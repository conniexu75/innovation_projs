Prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes are produced in vivo both from the ω6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) and the ω3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Certain beneficial effects of fish oil may result from altered PG metabolism resulting from increases in the EPA/AA ratios of precursor phospholipids. Here we report in vitro specificities of prostanoid enzymes and receptors toward EPA-derived, 3-series versus AA-derived, 2-series prostanoid substrates and products. The largest difference was seen with PG endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS)-1. Under optimal conditions purified PGHS-1 oxygenates EPA with only 10% of the efficiency of AA, and EPA significantly inhibits AA oxygenation by PGHS-1. Two- to 3-fold higher activities or potencies with 2-series versus 3-series compounds were observed with PGHS-2, PGD synthases, microsomal PGE synthase-1 and EP1, EP2, EP3, and FP receptors. Our most surprising observation was that AA oxygenation by PGHS-2 is only modestly inhibited by EPA (i.e. PGHS-2 exhibits a marked preference for AA when EPA and AA are tested together). Also unexpectedly, TxA3 is about equipotent to TxA2 at the TPα receptor. Our biochemical data predict that increasing phospholipid EPA/AA ratios in cells would dampen prostanoid signaling with the largest effects being on PGHS-1 pathways involving PGD, PGE, and PGF. Production of 2-series prostanoids from AA by PGHS-2 would be expected to decrease in proportion to the compensatory decrease in the AA content of phospholipids that would result from increased incorporation of ω3 fatty acids such as EPA.

North American and Western European diets have relatively high levels of ω6 fatty acids (e.g. linoleic acid (1Lands W. Libelt B. Morris A. Kramer N. Prewitt T. Bowen P. Schmeisser D. Davidson M.

As a result, the most common highly unsaturated fatty acid is the C20 ω6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid (AA). 3The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; PG, prostaglandin; PGDS, PGD synthase; mPGES-1, microsomal PGE synthase-1; PGHS, prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase; COX, cyclooxygenase; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; Tx, thromboxane; TxAS, thromboxane A synthase; HHTrE, 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid; HHTE, 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatetraenoic acid; hu, human; mu, murine; ov, ovine; IP, inositol phosphate; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; YEL, yeast extract-sodium lactate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; PG, prostaglandin; PGDS, PGD synthase; mPGES-1, microsomal PGE synthase-1; PGHS, prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase; COX, cyclooxygenase; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; Tx, thromboxane; TxAS, thromboxane A synthase; HHTrE, 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid; HHTE, 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatetraenoic acid; hu, human; mu, murine; ov, ovine; IP, inositol phosphate; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; YEL, yeast extract-sodium lactate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. AA is present mainly at the sn2-position of membrane phospholipids. Humans ingesting fish oil enriched in ω3 fatty acids show increased amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in their membrane phospholipids and an approximately corresponding decrease in the level of AA. The ratio of ω3 EPA/ω6 AA in tissue phospholipids from human populations averages less than 0.1 (1Lands W. Libelt B. Morris A. Kramer N. Prewitt T. Bowen P. Schmeisser D. Davidson M. Burns J.

The molecular basis for the health benefits of dietary fish oil is almost surely multifactorial. For example, ω3 fatty acids attenuate responses of T-cells (15Zeyda M. Staffler G. Horejsi V.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 6151-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One ω3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), has been shown to be essential in the development and maintenance of neuronal functions including visual acuity. This may also be related to the ability of DHA to change the physical properties of membranes in a way that facilitates rhodopsin signaling (17Gawrisch K. Eldho N. Holte L.

STKE. 2006; 2006: pe6PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-arrhythmic effects of ω3 fatty acids may relate to their stabilizing effect on cardiac cell membranes and inhibition of the fast, voltage-dependent sodium and L-type calcium currents (12Leaf A. Kang J.X. Xiao Y-F. Billman G.E. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2646-2652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonesterified polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly EPA, can also influence transcription acting through peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors and sterol response element binding protein-1c, major transcription factors controlling lipid metabolism (2Marszalek J. Lodish H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Jump D. Curr. Opin.

Other proteins that can be activated directly by polyunsaturated fatty acids, and thus, whose activities might be altered by changes in EPA/AA ratios include protein kinase C (25Schachter J. Lester D. Alkon D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1291: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), NADPH oxidase (26Pessach I. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as AA can promote apoptosis but the mechanism is not known (28Cao Y. Pearman A.T. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11280-11285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the eicosanoid pathways for lipid mediator formation; including the cyclooxygenase pathways, the 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase pathways, the P450 epoxygenase pathways, and non-enzymic oxidative pathways; are influenced by changes in EPA/AA ratios (29Smith W.L.

Anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic effects of ω3 fatty acids could result, at least in part, from their ability to attenuate the synthesis of specific eicosanoids and/or to alter the nature of the eicosanoid products formed or to serve as precursors of novel products such as isoprostanes and resolvins (32Kieran N.

Prostanoids are synthesized via the cyclooxygenase pathway, most commonly from AA, in response to various hormones and physical stimuli (29Smith W.L. Murphy R.C. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 2002Google Scholar). The pathway involves three stages: (a) mobilization of AA from membrane phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) sometimes in conjunction with secretory sPLA2s; (b) conversion of AA to the prostaglandin endoperoxide PGH2 by prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 or -2 (PGHS-1 or -2) also known as cyclooxygenase-1 or -2 (COX-1 or -2); and (c) isomerization of PGH2 to a “2-series” product, PGD2, PGE2-, PGF2α, PGI2, or thromboxane A2 (TxA2), by specific synthases. Newly formed PGs exit cells and function primarily through G-protein-coupled receptors on neighboring or parent cells to elicit responses. Because PGs act at or near their sites of synthesis and are rapidly metabolized, they are considered to be “local” hormones. Importantly, EPA can serve as a substrate for PG formation generating “3-series” PG products including PGD3, PGE3, PGF3α, PGI3, and TxA3. There is only limited biochemical information available on the specificities of the enzymes and receptors of the prostanoid pathways with EPA-derived versus AA-derived substrates and products. Here we report studies that address this topic. Materials—U46619, Δ17U46619, PGI2, PGI3, iloprost, SQ29548, AA, EPA, HHTrE, lipocalin PGD synthase (L-PGDS), and hematopoietic (H) PGDS were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). [3H]SQ29548 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [1-14C]AA and [1-14C]EPA were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. [3H]myoinositol and a cAMP assay kits were from Amersham Biosciences. SQ22536 was from Biomol. Cell culture materials were purchased from Invitrogen. Human fibrinogen, α-thrombin, and γIIa-thrombin were purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. Collagen was obtained from Chronolog Corp. Complete protease inhibitor was from Roche Applied Science. BCA protein reagent was from Pierce. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Inc. Ni-NTA was from Qiagen. All other materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Expression, Purification, and Assay of PGHSs—Hexahistidine-tagged (His6) ovine (ov) PGHS-1, murine (mu) murine PGHS-2, and human (hu) PGHS-2 were expressed in S21 insect cells and purified through Ni-NTA chromatography essentially as described previously (39Song I.

His6-muPGHS-1 was expressed also in insect cells but was unstable following Ni-NTA chromatography so in the experiment using this enzyme, the supernatant from centrifugation of solubilized cell pellets was used for COX assays. Oxygen electrode assays for COX activity were performed as detailed in previous reports (39Song I. Ball T.M. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Yuan C. Rieke C.J. Rimon G. Wingerd B.A. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

COX assays of purified enzymes utilizing radio thin layer chromatography assays of PGH2 or PGH3 formation were performed using [1-14C]AA and [1-14C]EPA as described previously (41Mbonye U.R. Wada M.

Preparation of Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP)—Platelets were obtained from normal human donors who had not taken medication during the 2 weeks prior to donation. Whole blood was drawn into 3.8% sodium citrate (1:9; citrate:blood). The blood was centrifuged at 180 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and PRP was transferred to a new tube. The remaining blood was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at room temperature to obtain PRP. For aggregation studies using PRP, the platelet count was determined on a Coulter counter (Model Z; Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) and adjusted with HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 14.7 mm HEPES, 0.35% dextrose, and 0.35% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) to 2.2 to 2.5 × 108 platelets/ml. For preparation of washed platelets, human platelets in PRP were separated from plasma by gel filtration over Sepharose 2B columns in HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer. The peak tubes were pooled, and the platelet count was adjusted to 2.5 × 108 platelets/ml before proceeding with platelet aggregation studies. Washed platelets (400 μl) were placed in a cuvette in the aggregometer and stirred at 37 °C. The integrity of the washed platelets was tested by their ability to be activated by collagen (1–5 mg/ml) and α-thrombin (3 nm). PGDS Assays—PGDS activity was determined essentially as described previously (42Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Ujihara M. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3820-3825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Tanaka Y. Ward S. Smith W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1374-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, PGH2 or PGH3 were prepared from 18 μm [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]EPA, respectively, by incubation for 20 s at room temperature with purified His6-muPGHS-2 (30 unit) in 100 μl of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm phenol, 20 μm hematin, and γ-globulin (1 mg/ml). PGH2/PGH3 isomerization to PGD2/PGD3 was initiated by the addition of either lipocalin or hematopoietic PGDS (0.04 unit) premixed with 0.1 mm GSH, followed by incubation for 40 s at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by adding 500 μl of diethylether/methanol/0.2 m citric acid (30:4:1). After vortexing for 10 s, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g × 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of organic extract (100 μl) was separated by thin layer chromatography on a silica gel plate in ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/water (110:50:20:100). Regions of the plates migrating with PGD, PGH, and other products were scraped into vials and radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation counting. One unit of PGDS enzyme represents 1 μmol of PGD2/min at 25 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm GSH, 1 mg/ml γ-globulin, and 40 μm PGH2. Expression, Purification, and Assay of Human Microsomal PGE Synthase-1 (hu mPGES-1)—The human PGES cDNA (Invitrogen) was amplified using High Fidelity PCR kit (Invitrogen) with the 5′-primer (with BspHI) GAA TTC ATC ATG ATC CCT GCC CAC AGC CTG GTG A and the 3′-primer (with HindIII and His6-tag) CAT CCA AGC TTG TCA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG CAG GTG GCG GGC CGC AAC. The PCR product was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The pRMGsp expression vector 4D. Sui and R. M. Garavito, unpublished results. was digested by AflIII and XhoI and the amplified PGES PCR product was digested with BspHI and HindIII. The digested DNA was isolated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and the DNA band was purified with a QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen). The digested and purified expression plasmid and His6-hu mPGES-1 insert were ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation sample was transformed into DH5-α competent cells, and plasmids from positive colonies were sequenced to confirm the expression construct pRMGsp-PGES-His6. The pRMGsp-PGES-His6 DNA with the aid DNA pAL9 (digested by PstI) were transformed into freshly made Schizosaccharomyces pombe competent cells. After selection of positive colonies on MAA plates, the potential transformants were screened twice on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium (YPD)/G418 plates (containing G418 at 20 μg/ml). Positive single colonies were then grown in yeast extract-sodium lactate (YEL) medium (with 10 μg/ml G418) to make glycerol stocks, which were stored at–80 °C. For expression of His6-hu mPGES-1 in S. pombe, 5 ml of YEL medium (with 10 μg/ml G418) was inoculated with 200 μl of a glycerol stock culture and shaken for 24 h at 32 °C. The culture was transferred into 50 ml of fresh YEL/G418 medium and incubated at 32 °C for 48 h with shaking until the A600 was 10–12. The culture was then transferred into 1 liter of YPD medium (with 100 μg of G419/ml) and incubated at 32 °C with shaking until the A600 exceeds 20 (∼48–60 h). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was stored at–80 °C. After completely thawing the cell paste in ice water, 5 ml of lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) was added for per gram of cell pellet. The resuspended cell pellet was lysed using an Emulsi-Flex-C3 (at 20,000–25,000 p.s.i. with two passes). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membrane-containing supernatant fraction was then centrifuged at ∼200,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in loading buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) and dodecyl maltoside (Anatrace) was added to a final concentration of 1%. The membrane fraction was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Imidazole was added to the supernatant fraction to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the mixture was loaded onto an Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column equilibrated with loading buffer supplemented with 10 mm imidazole; all column buffers contained 0.05% dodecyl maltoside. After loading, the column was washed with loading buffer containing 22 mm imidazole. The bound His6-hu mPGES-1 was eluted using loading buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Elution fractions containing His6-hu mPGES-1 were pooled and concentrated using a 30 molecular weight cutoff Centricon spin concentrator.

The cells were grown to 60% confluence and harvested from five 100-mm tissue culture dishes by scraping into the medium and centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and stored at–80 °C until membranes were prepared for competitive binding assays.

The product encoding the huEP1 was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3 to yield huEP1/pcDNA3. The sequence of huEP1 in huEP1/pcDNA3 was verified by DNA sequencing. huEP1/pcDNA3 encoding the huEP1 was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the recommendation of the manufacturer, and cells were harvested 30 h post-transfection. Cell pellets were stored at –80 °C and membranes prepared from these cells were used to determine the relative affinities of PGE2 versus PGE3.

Briefly, cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, with 1 mm EDTA and 1× Complete protease inhibitor), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized in Buffer A, and aliquots of the suspended protein (50–100 μg) were used immediately for binding assays. Binding assays were performed in 200 μl of 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm MgCl2. Binding isotherms were performed for [3H]PGE2,[3H]PGF2α, or the TPA antagonist [3H]SQ29548 to estimate Kd values for the different receptors with the cognate 2-series PG ligand. A concentration of 3H-labeled ligand corresponding to the Kd value for each receptor was then used in competition binding assays with PGE2 versus PGE3, PGF2α Δ17 versus PGF3α, or U46619 versus U46619. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and then filtered through Whatman GF/C glass filters. The filters were washed three times with cold MES buffer (without EDTA) and radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting. Receptor binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression in Origin. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test and/or ANOVA. cAMP Assays—HEK cell lines expressing EP2 and EP4 receptors that had been grown as described above in 6-well plates were treated for 15 min at 37 °C with fresh DMEM containing 50 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of PGE2 or PGE3 for an hour. The treatments were terminated by scrapping cells into 0.5 ml of TE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4 mm EDTA) and boiling for 8 min.

https://openalex.org/W2157963818,"Melanin pigments are ubiquitous in nature. Melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments, such as soils contaminated with radionuclides, suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms.Ionizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of melanin, consistent with changes in electronic structure. Irradiated melanin manifested a 4-fold increase in its capacity to reduce NADH relative to non-irradiated melanin. HPLC analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity, dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation. XTT/MTT assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized C. neoformans cells relative to non-melanized cells, and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron-transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells. Melanized Wangiella dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately 500 times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher CFUs, more dry weight biomass and 3-fold greater incorporation of (14)C-acetate than non-irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants. In addition, radiation enhanced the growth of melanized Cladosporium sphaerospermum cells under limited nutrients conditions.Exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation, and possibly other forms of electromagnetic radiation, changes its electronic properties. Melanized fungal cells manifested increased growth relative to non-melanized cells after exposure to ionizing radiation, raising intriguing questions about a potential role for melanin in energy capture and utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1977633672,"Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is a disease of historical and current importance that is found throughout the world. The basis of its historical transmission is anecdotal and its true global population structure has remained largely cryptic. Seven diverse B. anthracis strains were whole-genome sequenced to identify rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), followed by phylogenetic reconstruction of these characters onto an evolutionary model. This analysis identified SNPs that define the major clonal lineages within the species. These SNPs, in concert with 15 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers, were used to subtype a collection of 1,033 B. anthracis isolates from 42 countries to create an extensive genotype data set. These analyses subdivided the isolates into three previously recognized major lineages (A, B, and C), with further subdivision into 12 clonal sub-lineages or sub-groups and, finally, 221 unique MLVA15 genotypes. This rare genomic variation was used to document the evolutionary progression of B. anthracis and to establish global patterns of diversity. Isolates in the A lineage are widely dispersed globally, whereas the B and C lineages occur on more restricted spatial scales. Molecular clock models based upon genome-wide synonymous substitutions indicate there was a massive radiation of the A lineage that occurred in the mid-Holocene (3,064–6,127 ybp). On more recent temporal scales, the global population structure of B. anthracis reflects colonial-era importation of specific genotypes from the Old World into the New World, as well as the repeated industrial importation of diverse genotypes into developed countries via spore-contaminated animal products. These findings indicate humans have played an important role in the evolution of anthrax by increasing the proliferation and dispersal of this now global disease. Finally, the value of global genotypic analysis for investigating bioterrorist-mediated outbreaks of anthrax is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1977893138,"The proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kilodaltons (PRAS40) was identified as a raptor-binding protein that is phosphorylated directly by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) but not mTORC2 in vitro, predominantly at PRAS40 (Ser183). The binding of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to raptor requires a TOR signaling (TOS) motif, which contains an essential Phe followed by four alternating acidic and small hydrophobic amino acids. PRAS40 binding to raptor was severely inhibited by mutation of PRAS40 (Phe129 to Ala). Immediately carboxyl-terminal to Phe129 are two small hydrophobic amino acid followed by two acidic residues. PRAS40 binding to raptor was also abolished by mutation of the major mTORC1 phosphorylation site, Ser183, to Asp. PRAS40 (Ser183) was phosphorylated in intact cells; this phosphorylation was inhibited by rapamycin, by 2-deoxyglucose, and by overexpression of the tuberous sclerosis complex heterodimer. PRAS40 (Ser183) phosphorylation was also inhibited reversibly by withdrawal of all or of only the branched chain amino acids; this inhibition was reversed by overexpression of the Rheb GTPase. Overexpressed PRAS40 suppressed the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at their rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation sites, and reciprocally, overexpression of S6K1 or 4E-BP1 suppressed phosphorylation of PRAS40 (Ser183) and its binding to raptor. RNA interference-induced depletion of PRAS40 enhanced the amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4E-BP1. These results establish PRAS40 as a physiological mTORC1 substrate that contains a variant TOS motif. Moreover, they indicate that the ability of raptor to bind endogenous substrates is limiting for the activity of mTORC1 in vivo and is therefore a potential locus of regulation.

Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4771) Google Scholar). The mTOR polypeptide is now known to function in two distinct, independently regulated hetero-oligomeric complexes, called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Both complexes contain mTOR and the polypeptide mLST8/GβL; mTORC1 in addition contains raptor (an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KOG1), which binds directly to the known mTORC1 substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 and is indispensable for their phosphorylation by mTOR in vivo and in vitro. mTORC2 lacks raptor but contains the polypeptides rictor (an ortholog to ScAVO3) and mSin1 (an ortholog of ScAVO1). mTORC2 is one of the activating kinases for Akt, previously called PDK2, and also regulates the actin cytoskeleton through as yet unidentified effectors. Although rapamycin, in complex with FKBP12, binds directly to mTOR in a segment just amino-terminal to the catalytic domain, only mTORC1 binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex, and thus only mTORC1 is directly susceptible to inhibition by rapamycin. Rapamycin is among the most selective kinase inhibitors known (2Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3962) Google Scholar), and its longtime availability has enabled a detailed accounting of the cellular responses to inhibition of mTORC1. Perhaps the best appreciated and most general action of rapamycin in cell culture is its ability to inhibit cell growth (i.e. to suppress the accumulation of cellular mass) (3Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by a selective inhibition of mRNA translation and by suppression of ribosomal biogenesis at both a transcriptional and translational level (1Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N.

In addition, rapamycin activates autophagy and in some cells acts as a powerful inhibitor of proliferation (4Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L. Melino M.R. Sigal N.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar, 5Marx S.O. Jayaraman T. Go L.O. Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 412-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cell migration (6Poon M. Marx S.O.

Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) pointed out that the ability of these substrates to be regulated by mTORC1 in vivo depended on a short sequence (F(D/E)(F/I/L/M)(D/E)(L/I)) present in the noncatalytic amino-terminal flanking region of S6K1 and at the carboxyl terminus of 4E-BP1, which they named the TOR signaling (TOS) motif. Such a motif is also present in STAT3, another rapamycin-sensitive phosphoprotein (14Yokogami K. Wakisaka S. Avruch J. Reeves S.A. Curr.

Although many potential TOS motifs are evident by BLAST analysis, we are unaware of validated mTORC1 substrates that have been identified thereby. Consequently, we sought novel candidate mTORC1 substrates by analyzing the cellular polypeptides that bound to recombinant raptor overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Herein, we describe the identification of PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa), previously identified as an Akt substrate and 14-3-3 binding partner (20Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10189-10194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), as a raptor-binding protein and a physiological substrate of mTORC1. During the preparation of this report, two papers (21Vander Haar E.V. Lee S.I. Bandhakavi S. Griffin T.J. Kim D.H. Nat.

Moreover, based on the ability of PRAS40 to antagonize the mTORC1-catalyzed phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, it was proposed that a primary function of PRAS40 is to inhibit mTORC1 signaling to its physiological substrates, a function that is ameliorated by Akt-catalyzed PRAS40 phosphorylation; the latter was claimed to reduce, in a 14-3-3-dependent manner, PRAS40 binding to raptor. In contrast, we demonstrate that PRAS40 is itself a physiological substrate of mTORC1 and, like other mTORC1 substrates, competes for a pool of raptor substrate-binding sites whose abundance is apparently limiting for mTORC1-catalyzed substrate phosphorylation in vivo. PRAS40 binding to raptor is abolished by mTORC1-catalyzed PRAS40 phosphorylation but is unaffected by mutation of the PRAS40 Akt phosphorylation site, Thr246. We propose that PRAS40 functions primarily to regulate an as yet poorly defined cellular process, under the joint control of Akt and mTORC1. cDNAs and siRNAs—The expression vectors of FLAG-tagged raptor (pcDNA1-FLAG-raptor) (19Hara K.

For the small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies, HEK293 cells or HeLa cells were transfected with PRAS40 siRNA duplexes with 3′ dTdT overhangs corresponding to human PRAS40 mRNA (5′-GGGCAUUAGUGAUAAUGGA-3′) or (5′-GCGACUUCCAGAAGCUGAA-3′) (Qiagen) using Nucleofector 3 (AMAXA Biosystems). Scramble siRNA duplexes (iGENE Therapeutics) were employed as a control. For starvation of nutrients, cells were deprived of serum for 15 h, and the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM without serum for 1 h. For starvation of amino acids, the cells were washed twice with DMEM lacking amino acids, further incubated in the same medium for 2 h, and then stimulated with DMEM containing amino acids for 30 min in the presence or absence of 200 nm rapamycin. Where indicated, the amino acid mixture lacking branched-chain amino acids was employed instead of amino acids. For starvation of glucose, the cells were washed twice with DMEM lacking glucose (Sigma) and stimulated with DMEM lacking glucose in the presence or absence of 5.5 mm 2-deoxyglucose for 30 min. Where indicated, DMEM containing glucose was employed as a control. Immunoprecipitation—This procedure was carried out essentially as described (19Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). All cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and used for silver staining analysis or immunoblot. Where indicated, buffer A contained 1% Nonidet P-40 instead of 0.3% CHAPS. For the kinase assay, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A and twice in buffer B (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl). Immunoblot—The lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked at room temperature with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and were then incubated with each primary antibody, diluted in the 2% skim milk in TBST, for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The commercial antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:500–1:1000, except for the anti-β-actin antibody employed at a dilution of 1:5000. After incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. When the same sample was analyzed with different antibodies, the membrane was stripped and employed for the subsequent immunoblot analysis. When the endogenous 4E-BP1 proteins were analyzed, the cell lysates were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and the heat-stable proteins were subjected to immunoblot (27Shigemitsu K.

Kinase Assay—The mTOR kinase assay was performed as previously described (19Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K.

After the kinase reaction, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography using x-ray film or the Bioimaging Analyzer BAS2500 (Fujix). Then the membrane was immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody and visualized as described above. Mass Spectrometry—The analysis was carried out as described previously (28Yamaguchi Y. Shirai Y.

Briefly, FLAG-raptor immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The band corresponding to p40 polypeptide was cut out and destained, and the proteins in gels were reduced and alkylated, followed by in-gel digestion with trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were then subjected to the liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) by using a LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). Protein identification according to product ion mass lists was performed by the product ion mass fingerprinting using MASCOT “MS/MS ion search.” For identification of in vitro phosphorylation sites in PRAS40, GST-PRAS40 phosphorylated by mTOR was separated by SDS-PAGE. The GST-PRAS40 visualized by reverse staining was cut out from a gel. Destained proteins were digested with trypsin in a gel as described above and subjected to nano-ESI mass spectrometry by using a Q-Tof2 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass), as described previously. Sequence Analysis—The amino acid sequence identity and similarity were analyzed by using the GENETYX program, version 8 (GENETYX). Recombinant Raptor Binds Endogenous PRAS40 in an Amino Acid-dependent Manner—Using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and silver staining, we compared the polypeptides retrieved in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-raptor or with an empty vector. The most abundant cellular polypeptide recovered in the FLAG-raptor immmunoprecipitate was a protein of ∼290 kDa (Fig. 1A), shown to be mTOR by immunoblot as well as by the peptide mass fingerprinting analysis (data not shown). Many of the other prominent polypeptide bands in the FLAG-raptor immunoprecipitate were identified by mass spectrometric analysis as raptor, presumably reflecting FLAG-raptor proteolysis. A polypeptide of ∼40 kDa, however, contained several peptide fragments distinct from raptor, which were consistent with the amino acid sequence of PRAS40 (NCBI accession number NP_115751), a proline-rich protein first identified as an Akt substrate and 14-3-3 binding partner (20Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S. Guzzetta A.W. Schaefer E. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10189-10194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To verify the ability of recombinant raptor to bind endogenous PRAS40, the FLAG-raptor immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted with an anti-PRAS40 antibody (Fig. 1B, top). A small amount of PRAS40 was detected in the FLAG-raptor immunoprecipitate prepared from serum-deprived cells, but the additional removal of ambient amino acids resulted in a large increase in FLAG-raptor-associated PRAS40. A similar pattern was observed if an immunoprecipitate of endogenous PRAS40 was probed for endogenous raptor (Fig. 1B, bottom). Whereas no raptor was coprecipitated with normal rabbit IgG, endogenous raptor was present in the anti-PRAS40 immunoprecipitate; moreover, amino acid withdrawal substantially increased the amount of raptor recovered with PRAS40, whereas rapamycin resulted in a modest decrease in PRAS40-associated raptor. To determine whether the association of PRAS40 with raptor required mTOR or mLST8, we expressed recombinant His6-PRAS40 in HEK293 cells, retrieved the His6-PRAS40 on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, and washed the beads with buffer containing either 0.3% CHAPS or 1% Nonidet P-40; an immunoblot of the eluate from these beads was shown in Fig. 1C. Nonidet P-40, which causes the dissociation of an mTOR-mLST8 complex from raptor, did not diminish the recovery of raptor with His6-PRAS40. An amount of rapamycin sufficient to promote dissociation in vivo of raptor from mTORC1 modestly diminished the recovery of raptor with His6-PRAS40 (Fig. 1C). Thus, PRAS40 binds directly to raptor; this interaction occurs between the endogenous polypeptides, does not require mTOR, and is regulated by amino acid sufficiency. PRAS40 (Phe129) Is Important for the Association with Raptor—The binding of the mTORC1 substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to raptor has been shown to require a specific five-amino acid sequence (F(D/E)(F/I/L/M)(D/E)(L/I)) called the TOS motif (13Schalm S.S.

Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Human PRAS40 has six Phe residues, none of which are followed by a TOS motif consensus corresponding to those found in S6K1, 4E-BP1, or STAT3. The sequence in PRAS40 most similar to the TOS motif begins with Phe129, 129FVMDE133; this motif is conserved down through Xenopus tropicalis, slightly altered in Danio rerio (222FSMDE226) and lacking entirely in the putative Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, Lobe (supplemental Fig. 1). Nevertheless, we generated a PRAS40 mutant replacing Phe129 by Ala (F129A) and found that this mutant was greatly deficient in its ability to bind raptor as compared with wild-type PRAS40 (Fig. 2). Moreover, as seen in Figs. 1C and 2, the ability of PRAS40, when overexpressed, to bind endogenous raptor was not noticeably enhanced by amino acid withdrawal, whereas rapamycin, at concentrations sufficient to promote dissociation of the raptor-mTOR complex, did decrease the amount of raptor recovered with recombinant PRAS40. mTORC1 Phosphorylates PRAS40 in Vitro at Ser183—The ability of PRAS40 to associate with raptor through a TOS-like motif raised the possibility that PRAS40, like S6K1 and 4E-BP1, could serve as a substrate for the mTORC1 kinase. As seen in Fig. 3A, an immunoprecipitate of endogenous mTOR phosphorylated PRAS40 (as a prokaryotic recombinant GST or MBP fusion protein) in vitro to an extent comparable with GST-S6K1 or GST-4E-BP1 (the former purified from serum-deprived, rapamycin-treated HEK293 cells). This phosphorylation of PRAS40 was catalyzed by mTOR itself, inas- much as only the active recombinant mTOR but not the kinase-negative mTOR (N2343K) mutant (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) catalyzed GST-PRAS40 phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 3B). Tryptic digestion of PRAS40 followed by nano-ESI mass spectrometry was employed to identify the site(s) phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro. The experimental mass value (1395.75 Da) of the protonated peptide corresponding to the ion at m/z 698.38, which was observed only in the mass spectrum of GST-PRAS40 phosphorylated by mTOR (supplemental Fig. 2), was nearly identical to the calculated mass value (1395.71 Da) of a singly phosphorylated form of the PRAS40 tryptic peptide, 183SLPVSVPVWGFK194. Subjecting the m/z 698.38 ion to MS/MS established that Ser183, which is highly conserved (supplemental Fig. 1), is the phosphorylated residue (data not shown). In support of this identification, a PRAS40 (S183A) mutant was phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro to a greatly reduced extent as compared with wild-type PRAS40 (Fig. 4A), indicating that Ser183 is a major although not the sole site of mTOR-catalyzed PRAS40 phosphorylation in vitro.FIGURE 4Identification of an in vitro mTORC1-catalyzed phosphorylation site in PRAS40. A, mutation of PRAS40 Ser183 to Ala reduces PRAS40 phosphorylation by mTOR in vitro. mTOR immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells was used to phosphorylate GST, GST-PRAS40, and GST-PRAS40 (S183A).

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to sarcopenia. We evaluated whether healthy aging was associated with a transcriptional profile reflecting mitochondrial impairment and whether resistance exercise could reverse this signature to that approximating a younger physiological age. Skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy older (N = 25) and younger (N = 26) adult men and women were compared using gene expression profiling, and a subset of these were related to measurements of muscle strength. 14 of the older adults had muscle samples taken before and after a six-month resistance exercise-training program. Before exercise training, older adults were 59% weaker than younger, but after six months of training in older adults, strength improved significantly (P<0.001) such that they were only 38% lower than young adults. As a consequence of age, we found 596 genes differentially expressed using a false discovery rate cut-off of 5%. Prior to the exercise training, the transcriptome profile showed a dramatic enrichment of genes associated with mitochondrial function with age. However, following exercise training the transcriptional signature of aging was markedly reversed back to that of younger levels for most genes that were affected by both age and exercise. We conclude that healthy older adults show evidence of mitochondrial impairment and muscle weakness, but that this can be partially reversed at the phenotypic level, and substantially reversed at the transcriptome level, following six months of resistance exercise training."

https://openalex.org/W2120779367,"Background The future hydrogen economy offers a compelling energy vision, but there are four main obstacles: hydrogen production, storage, and distribution, as well as fuel cells. Hydrogen production from inexpensive abundant renewable biomass can produce cheaper hydrogen, decrease reliance on fossil fuels, and achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions, but current chemical and biological means suffer from low hydrogen yields and/or severe reaction conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we demonstrate a synthetic enzymatic pathway consisting of 13 enzymes for producing hydrogen from starch and water. The stoichiometric reaction is C6H10O5 (l)+7 H2O (l)→12 H2 (g)+6 CO2 (g). The overall process is spontaneous and unidirectional because of a negative Gibbs free energy and separation of the gaseous products with the aqueous reactants. Conclusions Enzymatic hydrogen production from starch and water mediated by 13 enzymes occurred at 30°C as expected, and the hydrogen yields were much higher than the theoretical limit (4 H2/glucose) of anaerobic fermentations. Significance The unique features, such as mild reaction conditions (30°C and atmospheric pressure), high hydrogen yields, likely low production costs ($∼2/kg H2), and a high energy-density carrier starch (14.8 H2-based mass%), provide great potential for mobile applications. With technology improvements and integration with fuel cells, this technology also solves the challenges associated with hydrogen storage, distribution, and infrastructure in the hydrogen economy."
https://openalex.org/W1968574388,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is predicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 30 structural and non-structural protein products. The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions. The interactions identified provide valuable material for future studies."

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also activates eNOS in endothelial cells; however, the molecular mechanisms linking agonist-mediated AMPK regulation with eNOS activation remain incompletely understood. We studied the role of AMPK in VEGF- and S1P-mediated eNOS activation and found that both agonists led to a striking increase in AMPK phosphorylation in pathways involving the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin demonstrated differential effects of VEGF versus S1P. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of AMPKα1or Akt1 impaired the stimulatory effects of both VEGF and S1P on eNOS activation. AMPKα1 knockdown impaired agonist-mediated Akt phosphorylation, whereas Akt1 knockdown did not affect AMPK activation, thus suggesting that AMPK lies upstream of Akt in the pathway leading from receptor activation to eNOS stimulation. Importantly, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPKα1 abrogates agonist-mediated activation of the small GTPase Rac1.

It remains unclear whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenic polypeptide growth factor and potent eNOS agonist, promotes AMPK phosphorylation under normoxic conditions (12Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and a recent study (18Reihill J.A. Ewart M. Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that implicated AMPK in VEGF-mediated eNOS activation did not define the mechanisms involved in this response. Akt and eNOS are also potently activated by the platelet-derived lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but the phosphorylation of AMPK by S1P and the possible involvement of AMPK in S1P-mediated eNOS activation and cell motility have not been previously described. Both VEGF and S1P act in part by stimulating an influx of calcium into the endothelium (19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Dudzinski D.M. Igarashi J. Greif D. Michel T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 235-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), thereby providing a route for AMPK activation that may depend upon CaMKK. The differential phosphorylation of AMPK by both VEGF and S1P therefore represents a plausible mechanism of eNOS regulation in endothelial cells. Caveolae are plasmalemmal microdomains originally identified on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells (21Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The scaffolding/regulatory protein of caveolae, caveolin-1 (22Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R.

Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that caveolin-1 negatively regulates the small GTPase Rac1 (25Kinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9786-9794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar), which in turn modulates the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway and regulates migration in endothelial cells (24Gonzalez E.

It is therefore possible that AMPK regulates agonist-mediated eNOS activation and endothelial migration by interacting with caveolin-1 or Rac1 in endothelial cells. In the present study, we provide evidence that the eNOS agonists VEGF and S1P differentially promote the phosphorylation of AMPK in vascular endothelial cells in distinct receptor-modulated pathways that involve tyrosine kinases and caveolin-1. Using pharmacological approaches as well as siRNA-mediated protein knockdown methodologies, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of eNOS activation downstream of AMPK and identify a novel AMPK-Rac1-Akt pathway that functions as a critical determinant of eNOS activity as well as endothelial cell migration and tube formation in the vascular endothelium.

Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 0.2% gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied prior to cell confluence between passages 5 and 9. siRNA Design and Transfection—Our siRNA duplexes were designed on the basis of established characteristics of siRNA targeting constructs (28Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). All experimental oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). We designed an AMPKα1 siRNA corresponding to bases 234–252 from the open reading frame of bovine AMPKα1: 5′-CCU CAA GCU UUU CAG GCA UdTdT-3′ (Ensembl Transcript ID: ENSBTAT00000000016).

Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have been described previously. A nonspecific control siRNA from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) was used as a negative control (5′-AUU GUA UGC GAU CGC AGA CdTdT-3′). BAEC were transfected with siRNA as described previously (24Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and analyzed 48 h after transfection. Drug Treatment and Immunoblotting—12–16 h prior to cell treatments, culture medium was changed to serum-free medium. VEGF and S1P were prepared as previously reported (24Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Genistein, PP2, cyclosporin A, SB203580, wortmannin, STO-609, and Compound C were solubilized in Me2SO and kept at –20 °C; where indicated, 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO was used as the vehicle control. After drug treatments, BAEC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 20 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Cells were harvested by scraping and then centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoblot analyses, 20 μg of cellular protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies using protocols provided by the suppliers. Densitometric analyses of the Western blots were performed using a ChemiImager 4000 (Alpha-Innotech). When indicated, for the experiments showing densitometry of Western blots, the ordinate is in arbitrary units. NOS Activity Assay—eNOS activity was quantified as the formation of l-[3H] citrulline from l-[3H] arginine in cultured BAEC, as described previously in detail (19Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Balligand J.L. Kobzik L. Han X. Kaye D.M. Belhassen L. O'Hara D.S. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14582-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were initiated by adding l-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml) plus VEGF or S1P, as described below. Each treatment was performed in duplicate cultures, which were then each analyzed in duplicate. The flow-through fraction was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting, and NOS activity was quantitated based on l-[3H]citrulline formation in the cells; the values were expressed as fmol of l-[3H]citrulline produced/well/min. Rac1 Activity Assay—Transfected BAEC in 100-mm dishes were stimulated with VEGF or S1P, and cells were then washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF). Pull-down of GTP-bound Rac was performed by incubating the cell lysates with glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to the p21-binding domain of p21-activated kinase-1 bound to glutathione-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C following the instructions provided by the suppliers. The beads were washed three times for 10 min each with lysis buffer, and the protein bound to the beads was eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed for the amount of GTP-bound Rac by immunoblotting using a Rac monoclonal antibody. Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed using a Transwell cell culture chamber containing polycarbonate membrane inserts with an 8-μm pore (Corning Costar Corp.) coated with 0.2% gelatin (24Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection in 6-well plates, the cells were trypsinized, and 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.4% fetal bovine serum were added to the upper Transwell chamber. The bottom chamber was filled with 600 μl of media, and the cells were allowed to adhere to the membrane at 37 °C for 1 h. VEGF (10 ng/ml), S1P (100 nm), or vehicle was added to the lower chamber, and the assembly was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow cell migration. After incubation, the membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells that did not migrate through the membrane were gently removed from the upper surface with a cotton swab. The membranes were then treated with trypsin to detach the migrated cells from the lower surface, and these cells were then counted with a hemocytometer. Tube Formation Assay—250 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was deposited into wells in a 24-well plate and allowed to solidify for 30 min at 37 °C. 48 h after siRNA transfection, BAEC were trypsinized, and 3 × 104 cells were added to each Matrigel-coated well. Cells were incubated on Matrigel for 9 h at 37 °C and imaged by phase-contrast microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TS100, ×5 objective). Four random fields of view (FOV)/well were examined and photographed by a blinded observer. For quantification purposes, a node was defined as an aggregation of cells from which three or more tubelike structures originated, and a tube referred to a continuous stretch of at least two cells containing no more than two nodes. For each FOV, ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used to measure the total tube length and the length per tube in units of pixels. Each experiment was repeated in nine wells. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times. Mean values for individual experiments were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were assessed by ANOVA or t test when appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. VEGF- and S1P-mediated AMPK and ACC Phosphorylation—We first studied the effects of VEGF and S1P on the phosphorylation of AMPK and the AMPK substrate ACC in BAEC (Fig. 1). After the addition either of VEGF (10 ng/ml) or S1P (100 nm) to BAEC, AMPK phosphorylation increased within 1 min of agonist addition, reaching a maximum ∼2.5-fold increase by 5 min, with a gradual return to basal levels at ∼30 min following VEGF or S1P addition (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunoblots probed with a phospho-specific ACC antibody revealed a similar time course for ACC phosphorylation, reaching a peak ∼3-fold increase in response to both agonists that gradually returned to base line after ∼30 min following the addition of VEGF or S1P. We next analyzed the dose response to VEGF and S1P for both AMPK and ACC phosphorylation. Fig. 1C shows immunoblots of BAEC lysates from cells treated for 5 min with increasing concentrations of VEGF or S1P and probed with antibodies directed against phospho-AMPK and phospho-ACC; total AMPK and ACC levels serve as the control in this immunoblot analysis. The dose response for VEGF-induced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation demonstrated an EC50 of ∼1 ng/ml, and S1P-induced phosphorylation of both targets showed an EC50 of ∼20 nm; these values fall within the physiological range seen for many other endothelial responses for VEGF and S1P (20Dudzinski D.M. Igarashi J. Greif D. Michel T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 235-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that both VEGF and S1P induce the reversible receptor-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrate ACC in endothelial cells. siRNA-mediated Down-regulation of VEGFR2 and Inhibition of Tyrosine Kinases and PI3K in VEGF- and S1P-mediated AMPK and ACC Phosphorylation—Previous work from our laboratory (30Igarashi J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42997-43001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) have observed cross-talk between VEGF and S1P receptors in mediating intracellular endothelial responses. Indeed, it has been previously reported that S1P responses are mediated by VEGF receptor transactivation (31Tanimoto T. Jin Z.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42997-43001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We explored the possibility of S1P-mediated transactivation of the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in promoting AMPK and ACC phosphorylation by using siRNA directed against VEGFR2. BAEC were transfected with duplex siRNAs specific for VEGFR2 (32Kou R. SenBanerjee S. Jain M.K. Michel T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15064-15073Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the effects on siRNA-mediated VEGFR2 knockdown on VEGF- and S1P-induced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation were analyzed (Fig. 2A). VEGFR2 siRNA effectively abrogated AMPK and ACC phosphorylation in response to VEGF, but this siRNA did not affect phosphorylation in response to S1P. These findings indicate that VEGF, but not S1P, acts through the VEGFR2 to activate AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and argue against S1P-mediated VEGFR2 transactivation as an essential component of S1P-mediated AMPK activation. We next used a series of pharmacological inhibitors to assess the role of tyrosine kinases and PI3K in VEGF- and S1P-mediated activation of AMPK and ACC. BAEC were stimulated with agonists following pretreatment with the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, with the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin, or with the vehicle as a control (Fig. 2, B–D). We found that genistein and PP2 blocked VEGF-induced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation but did not affect S1P-induced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation. In contrast, pretreatment of BAEC with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin did not affect AMPK or ACC phosphorylation in response to VEGF (data not shown), but wortmannin pretreatment significantly increased phosphorylation of both proteins in response to S1P (42.4 ± 18% increase compared with vehicle-pretreated, n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, C and D). We found that the p38 inhibitor SB203580 had no effect in either VEGF- or S1P-induced AMPK or ACC phosphorylation, with positive controls affirming that p38 phosphorylation was partially blocked under these conditions (Fig. 2C) (33Kang Y.J.

Effects of CaMKK Inhibition on VEGF- and S1P-mediated AMPK Phosphorylation Pathways—Both VEGF and S1P increase intracellular calcium in endothelial cells (20Dudzinski D.M. Igarashi J. Greif D. Michel T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 235-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and we sought to characterize a possible calcium-dependent upstream kinase responsible for both VEGF- and S1P-induced AMPK phosphorylation. BAEC incubated with the specific CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 (34Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 35Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. J. Biol.

We next designed and validated siRNA targeting the bovine β isoform of CaMKK; transfection with this siRNA severely impaired both VEGF- and S1P-induced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest that CaMKK may link VEGF- and S1P-activated pathways upstream of AMPK phosphorylation. siRNA-mediated Down-regulation of AMPK Impairs Agonist-mediated eNOS and Akt Activation—We next used siRNA approaches to explore the role of AMPK in VEGF- and S1P-mediated eNOS and Akt activation in BAEC.

To further analyze this process, recombinant laminin-111 heterotrimers with deletions and point mutations were generated by recombinant expression and evaluated for their ability to self-assemble, interact with nidogen-1 and type IV collagen, and form extracellular matrices on cultured Schwann cells by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Wild-type laminin and laminin without LG domains polymerized in contrast to laminins with deleted α1-, β1-, or γ1-LN domains or with duplicated β1- or α1-LN domains. Laminins with a full complement of LN and LG domains accumulated on cell surfaces substantially above those lacking either LN or LG domains and formed a lamina densa. Accumulation of type IV collagen onto the cell surface was found to require laminin with separate contributions arising from the presence of laminin LN domains, nidogen-1, and the nidogen-binding site in laminin. Collectively, the data support the hypothesis that basement membrane assembly depends on laminin self-assembly through formation of α-, β-, and γ-LN domain complexes and LG-mediated cell surface anchorage. Furthermore, type IV collagen recruitment into the laminin extracellular matrices appears to be mediated through a nidogen bridge with a lesser contribution arising from a direct interaction with laminin.

In contrast, α4-laminins possess only two short arms because of truncation of the α-subunit short arm. All laminins terminate in a group of LG domains distal to the coiled-coil. Previous studies have shown that laminin-111 (Lm-111, α1β1γ1-subunit composition) self-assembles into a polymer (2Cheng Y.S. Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol.

This polymerization is entropy-driven, thermally reversible, cooperative with a critical concentration of 0.1 μm, and calcium-dependent. The three-dimensional ultrastructure of the polymer was seen as a dense array of interconnecting struts in freeze-dried Pt/C replicas (4Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Analysis of interactions among laminin proteolytic fragments supported a model of self-assembly in which the essential repeating complex of polymerization consists of the three LN domains joined together with each domain derived from a different laminin molecule (3Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent study of different members of the laminin family led to a hypothesis that those truncated laminins lacking one or more short arms would not polymerize. More recently, evaluation of binding interactions between recombinant N-terminal laminin protein fragments by plasmon resonance spectroscopy and chemical cross-linking identified not only the proposed binding between α1-β1-, α1-γ1-, and β1-γ1-LN-LEa pairs, but also self-binding between fragments containing the α1-LN domain (7Odenthal U.

This type of homologous inter-domain binding was also reported for recombinant α2-, α5-, and β2-subunit fragments and was interpreted as evidence that there was less stringency of short arm LN domain interaction required for polymerization than previously thought. Type IV collagens are the only other basement membrane components known to self-assemble into a polymer. The network-like structure of α12α2[IV] collagen, consisting of 7 S domain complexes, NC1 dimers, and lateral associations, is considered to be an important element of the architecture of nearly all basement membranes (8Ruben G.C.

Nidogen-1, a glycoprotein similar in structure to nidogen-2, binds to the γ-subunit short arm of laminin through its G3 domain, to type IV collagen through G2 and G3, and to perlecan (10Fox J.W.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was proposed that nidogen acts as a bridge between laminin and type IV collagen and as an organizer of basement membrane structure (13Timpl R. Brown J.C. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Most basement membranes contain more than a single laminin heterotrimer along with type IV collagens, nidogens, perlecan, and agrin. An exception is found in the basement membranes of the developing nematode embryo which lack type IV collagen until later stages and in which the laminin polymer may form the only scaffolding (14Huang C.C. Hall D.H. Hedgecock E.M. Kao G. Karantza V. Vogel B.E. Hutter H. Chisholm A.D. Yurchenco P.D. Wadsworth W.G. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 3343-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Insights into the significance of basement membrane components and their interactions in tissues were gained through loss-of-function studies arising from mutations in mice, zebrafish, and invertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 15Yurchenco P.D. Amenta P.S. Patton B.L. Matrix Biol. 2004; 22: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the LAMC1 and LAMB1 genes coding for the common γ1- and β1-laminin subunits revealed that laminins are essential for the formation of several embryonic basement membranes (16Chen Z.L. Strickland S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In contrast, inactivation of the mouse genes for type IV collagen, nidogens, and the nidogen-binding site in the laminin γ1-subunit, although lethal by mid-embryonic development to birth, did not prevent basement membrane assembly in most tissues but instead caused structural defects and instability of basement membranes in different tissues (19Willem M.

Genetic evidence supporting a role of laminin polymerization was found in the phenotype of the dy2J mouse in which defective basement membranes were observed in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerve Schwann cell endoneurium (reviewed in Ref. 15Yurchenco P.D. Amenta P.S. Patton B.L. Matrix Biol. 2004; 22: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The underlying genetic defect of dy2J is a splice-donor mutation resulting in an in-frame deletion within the α2-LN domain that has been correlated with a failure of α2-laminin polymerization (22Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Utani A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1327-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on embryoid bodies, a model of early embryonic development, and cultured Schwann cells have further implicated laminin polymerization as acting in concert with anchorage as key contributors to basement membrane assembly (24Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Faössler R. Smyth N. Edgar D. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 25Li S. Liquari P. McKee K.K. Harrison D. Patel R. Lee S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An understanding of the assembly mechanisms is of value not only because of the role played by basement membranes in embryonic development and the pathogenesis of several diseases, but also because manipulations of assembly to produce more stable basement membranes hold promise as a therapeutic approach to correcting basement membrane defects (26Moll J. Barzaghi P. Lin S. Bezakova G. Lochmuller H. Engvall E. Muöller U. Ruegg M.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this study we have focused on the contributions of laminin domains to the assembly process. Lm-111 heterotrimers were generated by recombinant expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and evaluated for their ability to polymerize, interact with nidogen-1 and type IV collagen, and form a basement membrane on cultured Schwann cells. These cells, involved in laminin-dependent congenital muscular dystrophy, were chosen because it has been found that native laminin-111 assembles a basement membrane-type ECM on the cell surfaces in culture, that laminin attachment to the cells (anchorage) is substantially mediated by sulfatides, and that dystroglycan, although not required for assembly, associates with this ECM resulting in the functional readouts of Src activation and utrophin recruitment (25Li S. Liquari P. McKee K.K. Harrison D. Patel R. Lee S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). β1 integrins were not found to contribute to basement membrane assembly in this model. The data of this study support the hypothesis that all three LN domains are essential for laminin polymerization and formation of a basement membrane. They also reveal a requirement of the laminin LG domains for basement membrane assembly consistent with the concept that laminin becomes tethered to the cell surface through its LG domains, whereas type IV collagen and nidogen become tethered primarily to laminin. In addition, the data provide cellular evidence for the importance of nidogen serving as a bridge between the laminin and type IV collagen polymers. The wild-type cDNAs for mouse laminin α1, human β1, and human γ1 (mα1-pCIS, hβ1-pCIS, hβ1-pCEP4, hγ1-pRc/CMV2, γ1-wtCf, and α1-wtNf) have been described previously (27Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y.

Refer to supplemental Table 1 for details of laminin constructs. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were obtained from New England Biolabs and Fermentas. PCRs were carried out using PlatPfx (Invitrogen) and a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research). α1-wtNm—The 5′-end of the mα1 cDNA was amplified from mα1-pCIS utilizing primers ma1p4 and ma1F21. Three subsequent overlapping PCRs with primers ha1p8, ha1p9, and ha1p6 were carried out to synthesize a 5′-fragment that contained a NotI site followed by a 5′-untranslated region, BM40 signal sequence, c-Myc epitope tag, enterokinase cleavage site, and the 5′-terminal region of mα1. The 3′-end of the mα1 was amplified with primers ma1F20 and ma1F25. Both PCR fragments were digested with NotI and BspHI. A BspHI restriction fragment from mα1-pCIS was gel-purified (UltraClean 15 DNA purification kit, MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.) and ligated into a NotI-digested DHpuro vector (described below) along with the 5′ and 3′ PCR products. The ligated material was transformed into DH5α bacteria (Invitrogen) and plated onto LB-agar plates containing 10 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma), and resistant clones were isolated and grown in LB media, and DNA minipreps were performed with an UltraClean miniplasmid prep kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.). Ligation junctions and PCR products were checked by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. α1ΔLNNm—Nhel and BstEII-Nhel fragment were isolated from α1-wtNm. Primers ma1F90 and 050604-13 were used in a PCR of mα1-pCIS to generate a fragment which was subsequently amplified with overlapping primer ma1F35 and then 050604-11 along with 050604-13 to generate the required 5′ sequence. The final PCR product was digested with NheI and BstEII and ligated with the other two isolated RE fragments. α1ΔLN-L4bNm—A PCR fragment was produced from α1-wtNm with primers da1-1f and da1-2r and sewn together with a second fragment, generated with da1-2f and da1-1r, using da1-1f and da1-1r and digested with AflII. An AflII fragment was isolated from α1-wtNm. Both fragments were ligated into an AflII prepared α1-wtNm. α1ΔLG1-5Nf—An AflII-SacII fragment of mα1-pRCX3 (27Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y. Colognato H. Mathus T. Harrison D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was replaced with a PCR fragment generated from the same construct but utilizing a PCR primer to introduce a new SacII site and a STOP codon after the end of the coiled-coil domain. α1ΔLG1-5Nm—An AflII-AgeI fragment from α1-wtNm was replaced with a PCR insert produced by ligating two PCR fragments. One fragment was generated with dg1 and dg2 and a second with dg3 and dg4, and both fragments were combined with dg1 and dg4. β1-wtNh—An N-terminal PCR fragment containing a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA; Roche Applied Science) was generated from hβ1-pCIS using four successive rounds of PCR with four sense primers (hb1-1, hb1-2, hb1-3, and hb1-4) and a single antisense primer (hb1-re1) and digested with NheI and EcoRI. A 3′-end PCR fragment was generated with hb1-re4 and hb1-10 and digested with MluI and KpnI. An EcoRI-MluI fragment was purified from hβ1-pCIS and ligated along with the two PCR fragments into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/zeo+ (Invitrogen), which had earlier been digested with NheI and KpnI. β1ΔLNNh—The same approach used to generate β1-wtNh was employed, except hb1-23, hb1-25, hb1-3, hb1-4, and hb1-re5 were used to generate the N-terminal PCR fragment that was digested with NheI and AatII. Also, an AatII-MluI fragment isolated from hβ1-pCIS was used. Both the C-terminal PCR fragment and prepared vector, used in constructing β1-wtNh, were utilized. β1ΔLN-LEaNh—The same approach used to generate β1-wtNh was employed, except hb1-28, hb1-30, hb1-3, hb1-4, and hb1-re7 were utilized to generate the N-terminal segment that was digested with NheI and BstEII. Likewise, a BstEII-MluI fragment was isolated from hβ1-pCIS. γ1-ΔLNCf—A NotI restriction digest fragment was isolated from γ1-wtCf as well as an ApaLI-NotI fragment. An N-terminal fragment was generated by two overlapping PCRs with gg1, gg3, and gg6 followed by digestion with NotI and ApaLI and ligation with the two isolated restriction fragments. γ1-ΔLN-LEaCf—A NotI restriction digest fragment was isolated from γ1-wtCf as well as an AflII-NotI fragment. A 5′-terminal fragment was generated by two overlapping PCRs with gg9, gg4, and gg5 followed by digestion with NotI and AflII and ligation with the two isolated restriction fragments. γ1Σa1LNCf—A PCR fragment was produced from mα1-pCIS with primers a1s-1F and a1s-2R. A second fragment was generated from γ1-wtCf with a1s-2F and a1s-1R. The two fragments were sewn together with primers als-1F and a1s-1R. The PCR fragment and γ1-wtCf were both digested with SacII and AflII. The PCR fragment was then used to replace the corresponding fragment in γ1-wtCf. γ1Σβ1LNCf—A PCR fragment was produced from hβ1-pCIS with primers b1s-1F and b1s-2R. A second fragment was generated from γ1-wtCf with b1s-2F and b1s-1R. The two fragments were ligated with primers bls-1F and b1s-1R. The PCR fragment and γ1-wtCf were both digested with SacII and BsrGI. The PCR fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment in γ1-wtCf. γ1-N802SCf and γ1-P801QCf—To generate N802S (Asn to Ser; AAC to AGC) or P801Q (Pro to Gln; CCC to CAG), a BsiMI-AflII PCR fragment derived from ligating two overlapping PCR-generated fragments was utilized to replace the corresponding BsiMI-AflII fragment in γ1-wtCf. The 5′-fragment was generated with Nd-1f and PQ-2r or NS-2r. Likewise, the 3′-fragment was generated with PQ-2f or NS-2f and Nd-1r. Both 5′- and 3′-fragments were combined with Nd-1f and Nd-1r and digested with BsiMI and AflII. DHpuro—A vector that imparts puromycin resistance was constructed by replacing an AvrI-PciI fragment of pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) with a PCR fragment synthesized from pPUR (Clontech) containing the removed SV40 promoter sequence, puromycin resistance gene, an SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence, and a PciI site. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological), 200 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (1,000 units/ml penicillin and 1,000 μg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen). (a) Plasmids containing laminin subunits were stably transfected into HEK293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable cell lines expressing recombinant laminins were supplemented with puromycin (α1 chains), Zeocin (β1 chains), and G418 (γ1 chains) at a final concentration of 1, 100, and 500 μg/ml, respectively. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis of secreted protein was used to confirm expression of trimeric laminin in the stable cell lines. The α1-, β1-, and γ1-laminin chains were detected with antibodies specific for Myc (Roche Applied Science), HA (Roche Applied Science), and FLAG (Sigma) epitopes, respectively. Recombinant laminin was purified from media on a heparin-agarose (Sigma) column and eluted with 500 mm NaCl (in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). Heparin-eluted rLm1 was further bound to FLAG M2-agarose (Invitrogen) and eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). The diluted protein was concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (100,000, molecular weight cut-off) and dialyzed in TBS50 (90 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.125 mm EDTA). (b) A pCIS vector encoding full-length mouse nidogen-1 (gift of Rupert Timpl, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) was used to stably transfect cells. Secreted protein was purified from medium by metal chelating chromatography as described (10Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J.

(c) Type IV collagen was extracted from lathyritic mouse EHS tumor and purified by salt fractionation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described (30Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin, type IV collagen, and nidogen-1 concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, amino acid analysis, and comparison against known standards in Coomassie Bluestained gels as described (2Cheng Y.S.

Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and evaluated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 6% acrylamide gels. Electrophoresed gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, imaged with Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000 in bright field mode, and analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Aliquots (50 μl) of laminin in polymerization buffer (TBS, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) at various concentrations were incubated at 37 °C in 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g followed by dissolution of supernatant and pelleted fractions in SDS and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Similarly, increasing quantities of type IV collagen with constant laminin and nidogen (0.1 and 0.02 mg/ml, respectively) were incubated in PBS (with 0.1% Triton X-100) and analyzed as above. The Coomassie Blue-stained laminin β1 band and collagen α2 bands, which migrate separately, were used to determine the laminin and collagen amounts in the supernatant and pellet fractions. Nidogen binding to laminin was determined by immunoblotting. One μg of recombinant laminin was slot-blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Following a 1-h blocking step with 5% milk in TTBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 90 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), the laminin slots were incubated with various quantities of nidogen. Bound nidogen was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody at 5 μg/ml and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and quantitated by chemical luminescence in dark field mode with the Gel-Doc apparatus. Schwann cells isolated from sciatic nerves from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were the kind gift of Dr. James Salzer (New York University). These cells were expanded in culture for 10 passages and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bio Products), neuroregulin (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma), forskolin (0.2 μg/ml, Sigma), 1% glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells at passages 11-17 were treated with laminin, type IV collagen, and/or nidogen-1 after plating onto 24-well dishes (Costar) at half-confluent density. The following day, the media were changed, and the cells were incubated with laminins (20-40 μg/ml), type IV collagen (10-20 μg/ml), and/or nidogen-1 (2-8 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h followed by washing and fixation. For electron microscopy, SCs cells were plated in 60-mm Permanox dishes (Nalgene, Nunc) 2 days prior to addition of ECM proteins. Schwann cells grown in the presence of extracellular proteins were rinsed three times with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 127 mm NaCl) and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cultures were blocked with 5% goat serum and then stained with primary and appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent probes. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for laminin-111 (EHS), laminin fragment E4 (β1LN-LEa), recombinant laminin α1LG4-5 (RG50), and nidogen-1 were used as described (24Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Faössler R. Smyth N. Edgar D. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). EHS laminin antibody was titered in wells coated (1 μg/ml) with recombinant laminins (WTa, β1ΔLN, α1ΔLN, α1ΔLN-L4b, γ1ΔLN, and α1ΔLG1-5) and evaluated by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with serial 2-fold dilutions of antibody. The binding plots were essentially identical for all substrates except for α1ΔLN-L4b whose plot lagged by a single 2-fold dilution and whose color intensity at saturation (5 μg/ml) was decreased by <10%. This antibody (20 μg/ml) was used to compare the accumulation of different laminins on cell surfaces. Nidogen-specific rabbit antibody prepared against recombinant nidogen-1 (25Li S. Liquari P. McKee K.K. Harrison D. Patel R. Lee S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used at 3 μg/ml, and type IV collagen-specific rabbit antibody (Chemicon) was used at a 1:100 dilution. Detection was accomplished with Alexa Fluor 488 and 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) at 1:500 and 1:100 respectively, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgM at 1:100 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were counterstained with DAPI and imaged as described (24Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Faössler R. Smyth N. Edgar D. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Laminin, type IV collagen, and nidogen immunofluorescence levels were quantitated from digital images (average of 9, each 1300 × 1030 pixels, 437 × 346 μm) recorded using a ×20 microscope objective with IPLab 3.7 software (Scanalytics). A segmentation range was chosen to subtract background and acellular immunofluorescence. The sum of pixels and their intensities in highlighted cellular areas of fluorescence were measured and normalized by dividing by the number of cells determined by a count of DAPI-stained nuclei for each image. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of normalized summed intensities with the data analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Holm-Sidak comparisons in SigmaPlot version 9.01 and SigmaStat version 3.1 (Systat). For Rotary shadow Pt/C replicas, laminin (25-50 μg/ml in 0.15 m ammonium bicarbonate, 60% glycerol) was sprayed onto mica disks, evacuated in a BAF500K unit (Balzers), rotary-shadowed with 0.9 nm Pt/C at an 8° angle, and backed with 8 nm carbon at a 90° angle as otherwise described (3Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells adherent to plastic were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.2% tannic acid, transferred to modified Karnovsky’s fixative, washed with PBS, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and prepared for electron microscopy as described (31Tsiper M.V. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein sequences of the α1-, β1-, and γ1-subunits of laminin were modified as shown in Fig. 1.

https://openalex.org/W2088564722,"Human peroxiredoxins 1 and 2, also known as Prx1 and Prx2, are more than 90% homologous in their amino acid sequences. Prx1 and Prx2 are elevated in various cancers and are shown to influence diverse cellular processes. Although their growth regulatory role has traditionally been attributed to the peroxidase activity, the physiological significance of this function is unclear because the proteins are highly susceptible to inactivation by H2O2. A chaperone activity appears to emerge when their peroxidase activity is lost. Structural studies suggest that they may form a homodimer or doughnut-shaped homodecamer. However, little information is available whether human Prx1 and Prx2 are duplicative in structure and function. We noted that Prx1 contains a cysteine (Cys83) at the putative dimer-dimer interface, which is absent in Prx2. We studied the role of Cys83 in regulating the peroxidase and chaperone activities of Prx1, because the redox status of Cys83 might influence the oligomeric structure and consequently the functions of Prx1. We show that Prx1 is more efficient as a molecular chaperone, whereas Prx2 is better suited as a peroxidase enzyme. Substituting Cys83 with Ser83 (Prx1C83S) results in dramatic changes in the structural and functional characteristics of Prx1 in a direction similar to those of Prx2. Here we also report the first crystal structure of human Prx1 and the presence of the Cys83–Cys83 bond at the dimer-dimer interface of decameric Prx1. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human Prx1 and Prx2 possess unique functions and regulatory mechanisms and that Cys83 bestows a distinctive identity to Prx1.

In contrast, down-regulation of Prx1 has been shown to sensitize lung cancer cells to radiation and reduce metastasis of lung cancer xenografts (16Chen M.F. Keng P.C. Shau H. Wu C.T. Hu Y.C.

Kim S.K. Kim H.J. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that both Prx1 and Prx2 confer resistance to therapy and promote an aggressive survival phenotype of the cancer cells. The cell survival enhancing functions of Prx1 and Prx2 are generally attributed to their H2O2 scavenging activities. The H2O2 catalytic mechanism of Prxs is unique among the peroxide-detoxifying enzymes. For example, glutathione peroxidase reduces peroxides while oxidizing glutathione as a co-substrate. The H2O2 eliminating action of Prx1, on the other hand, is mediated by a transient inter-molecular disulfide bond formation between the catalytic Cys52 of one Prx1 molecule and the Cys173 residue of another Prx1 molecule (1Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Likewise, the H2O2 catalytic action of Prx2 is mediated through a disulfide bond formation between Cys51 and Cys172. The formation of an inter-molecular disulfide bond between Prx1 and Prx2 does not appear to occur. Transiently formed disulfide bond is reduced back to Cys-SH by the action of disulfide oxidoreductase, thioredoxin. The Cys173 residue of Prx1 (Cys172 in Prx2) has traditionally been referred to as a “resolving” Cys. This is based on the fact that the transient inter-molecular disulfide bond formation between the Cys173/172-SH of one Prx molecule and the Cys52/51-SOH of another Prx molecule engaged in peroxide catalysis is a necessary step for reduction of the Cys52/51-SOH back to Cys52/51-SH. Despite the initial biochemical characterization of Prxs as peroxide-removing enzymes, the physiological significance of their peroxidase activity is unclear, because the catalytic Cys of a Prx is highly susceptible to loss of activity as a result of its overoxidation to sulfenic (–SO2H) or sulfonic acid (–SO3H) during peroxide detoxification (20Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Lunardi J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). When the catalytic Cys is overoxidized, the peroxidase activity is lost. Structural studies from various species suggest that Prx proteins may exist as an α2 homodimer or a doughnut-shaped (α2)5 homodecamer (23Schroder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two molecules of reduced Prxs form an α2 homodimer, which in turn serves as a building block for decamer formation. According to x-ray crystallographic studies, the inter-molecular disulfide bond that occurs transiently during the catalytic cycle requires local unfolding because the distance between the catalytic Cys and the resolving Cys is too far apart at ∼13 Å (24Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 25Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The latter effect destabilizes the dimer-dimer (DD) interface and, by extension, the decameric structure. The stability of the DD interface is quickly restored when the disulfide bond is reduced back to Cys-SH by thioredoxin. This completes a cycle of H2O2 catalysis by the Prx protein. If the mechanics of unfolding or the conditions for disulfide formation are unfavorable for various reasons, the catalytic Cys becomes overoxidized to sulfenic (–SO2H) or sulfonic acid (–SO3H) and loses its H2O2 catalytic activity. The DD interface of an overoxidized Prx dimer, however, appears to be more stable than that of a fully reduced Prx dimer, and it may in fact lead to a more compact decamer (23Schroder E.

The information above suggests that the redox status of the catalytic Cys and the molecular chaperone activities of Prx may be closely linked. Human Prx1 and Prx2 are 91% homologous and 78% identical in their amino acid sequences. Are Prx1 and Prx2 duplicate proteins or do they have unique functions and regulatory mechanisms? Although Prx1 and Prx2 have been studied independently in a number of cell and animal systems, little information is available regarding this fundamental question. Studies of Prx1 knock-out (KO) and Prx2KO mice illustrate the complexity of addressing this deceivingly simple question. One of the major phenotypes of Prx1KO was uncontrolled cell proliferation and the development of tumors in certain cell types (29Neumann C.A. Krause D.S. Carman C.V. Das S. Dubey D.P. Abraham J.L. Bronson R.T. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Van Etten R.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). This striking observation led to the suggestion that Prx1 may act as a tumor suppressor. This is contradictory to the proposed role of Prx1 in promoting cell survival, treatment resistance, and malignant progression of various cancer cells (1Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K.

Absence of Prx2, on the other hand, resulted in splenomegaly caused by the congestion of red pulp with hemosiderin accumulation in Prx2KO mice (30Lee T.H. Kim S.U. Yu S.L. Kim S.H. Park D.S. Moon H.B. Dho S.H. Kwon K.S. Kwon H.J. Han Y.H. Jeong S. Kang S.W. Shin H.S. Lee K.K. Rhee S.G. Yu D.Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). No tumor development was observed in any cell types or tissues of Prx2KO mice. Based on this finding, it was suggested that Prx2 is essential for sustaining the life span of erythrocytes in mice. Although there are no data available comparing the levels of H2O2 in different tissues of the Prx1KO or Prx2KO mice, or between the same tissue or cells obtained from Prx1KO and Prx2KO mice, elevated levels of H2O2 were observed in certain tissues of both Prx1KO and Prx2KO mice. Obviously, reduced peroxide removal resulting from the absence of either Prx1 or Prx2 cannot offer an answer to the drastically different phenotypes observed in these studies. The above information and findings from various human cancer cells and tissues, however, clearly indicate the following: 1) Prx1 and Prx2 may not be identical in function and are distinguishable by their regulatory mechanisms; 2) maintaining an adequate level of these proteins may be important in keeping normal cell proliferation/apoptosis in check; 3) the functions of Prx1 and Prx2 may be regulated in a cell type- and tissue context-dependent manner; and 4) their functions would need to be tested (and interpreted) in light of the various genetic and environmental factors that could affect the molecular behavior of Prx1 and Prx2. When we examined the amino acid sequences of human Prx1 and Prx2, we noted that in addition to the well characterized catalytic Cys (Cys52 in Prx1 and Cys51 in Prx2) and resolving Cys (Cys173 in Prx1 and Cys172 in Prx2) residues, there is a Cys83 that is unique to Prx1 and not found in Prx2 (Fig. 1). According to available structural information from various Prx species (24Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 25Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the Cys83 of human Prx1 appears to be located at the putative DD interface. The goal of this study was to investigate whether there is a functional and/or structural difference between human Prx1 and Prx2 at the protein level, and if so, whether Cys83 in Prx1 contributes to the difference. Our approach was to employ defined experimental systems and to compare the molecular behaviors of these two proteins side by side. We purified recombinant human Prx1 and Prx2 proteins and evaluated their peroxidase and molecular chaperone activities. We also examined the biochemical and structural characteristics of the Cys83 → Ser substituted Prx1 (Prx1C83S) with those of wild type Prx1 and Prx2. Based on the results from a combination of mutagenesis, biochemical, computer modeling, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallographic studies, we conclude that Prx1 and Prx2 are not redundant proteins and that the Cys83 of Prx1 plays a critical role in bestowing a distinctive identity on Prx1, which is not shared by Prx2. Materials—Dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), NADPH, hydrogen peroxide, citrate synthase, and insulin were obtained from Sigma. Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was from Invitrogen. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was from Roche Applied Science. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The Prx1/pET-17b and Prx2/pET-17b vectors containing the entire coding regions of human Prx1 and Prx2 were constructed. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys83 to Ser83 was performed to generate the Prx1C83S with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the Prx1/pET-17b as a template. Recombinant human Prx1, Prx2, and Prx1C83S proteins were purified by sequential ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography as described previously (31Kim Y.J. Lee W.S. Ip C.

Briefly, the cell extract was loaded onto DEAE-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The proteins were dialyzed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The dialyzed proteins were loaded onto SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride.

Samples of Prx1, Prx1C83S, or Prx2 protein were used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mm NaCl. The excitation and emission band passes were set at 3 nm. Spectra were monitored from 300 to 500 nm at room temperature. Homology Modeling—A model of decameric human Prx1 was built based on the atomic structure of well characterized bacterial Prx protein, AhpC (Protein Data Bank code 1YEP). A molecular operating environment (version 2005.06, Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada) running on a G5 dual 2.7-GHz PowerPC workstation was used for homology modeling. The best intermediate model was energy-minimized to remove unfavorable van der Waals contacts. PyMOL (34DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2003Google Scholar) was used for analysis and illustration purposes. Intact Protein Analysis by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Samples of Prx1, Prx1C83S, or Prx2 in water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were mixed with a solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, sinapinic acid matrix. Five pmol each of the proteins was applied to a sample plate. The MALDI micro-MX™ mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) was operated in positive linear mode (post acceleration dynode, 5 kV; sample period, 1 ns). Data acquisition was performed over the m/z ranges of 25,000–250,000. Mass spectra were calibrated by the default method and verified by using bovine serum albumin for external calibration. In-solution Digestion of Recombinant Proteins with Trypsin—Samples of Prx1, Prx1C83S, or Prx2 proteins were diluted to 1 μm concentration with 10% acetonitrile, 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. After brief sonication to dissolve the samples, 200 μl each of protein solution was transferred to Eppendorf tubes. For some experiments, the protein solution was reduced with 20 μl of DTT (50 mm in 10% acetonitrile, 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer) at 60 °C for 30 min. After it was cooled to room temperature, iodoacetamide solution was added (20 μl, 200 mm in 10% acetonitrile, 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer), and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. A solution of sequencing grade trypsin (10 μg of trypsin dissolved in 500 μl of 10% acetonitrile, 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer) was added to the mixture to achieve an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:10 (w/w). The solution was digested at 37 °C for 16 h. MALDI-TOF Analysis of Trypsin-digested Peptides—After trypsin digestion, the peptide mixtures were dried in a Speedvac concentrator and dissolved in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 400:400:200 (v/v) acetonitrile/ethanol/water. A total of 1.3 μl of sample/matrix mixture was spotted onto a MALDI target plate, allowed to dry in air at room temperature, and analyzed on a MALDI micro MX™ mass spectrometer. The machine was operated in a positive reflectron mode with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV, and a time lag focusing delay of 500 ns. Data acquisition was performed over the m/z ranges of 900–4000. Calibration mixture containing polyethylene glycol in a range of molecular weights and sodium iodide was used to generate a multipoint external calibration. The MS data were externally corrected by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone as a lock mass. Q-TOF Analysis of Trypsin-digested Peptides—A hybrid quadruple/orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer Q-TOF API US (Waters, Milford, MA) was used to carry out a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. Two μl of digested peptide solution were injected into t"
https://openalex.org/W2002585058,"Background Guanylyl cyclases (GCs) catalyze the formation of the second messenger guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP). Cyclic GMP has been implicated in an increasing number of plant processes, including responses to abiotic stresses such as dehydration and salt, as well as hormones. Principle Findings Here we used a rational search strategy based on conserved and functionally assigned residues in the catalytic centre of annotated GCs to identify candidate GCs in Arabidopsis thaliana and show that one of the candidates is the brassinosteroid receptor AtBR1, a leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase. We have cloned and expressed a 114 amino acid recombinant protein (AtBR1-GC) that harbours the putative catalytic domain, and demonstrate that this molecule can convert GTP to cGMP in vitro. Conclusions Our results suggest that AtBR1 may belong to a novel class of GCs that contains both a cytosolic kinase and GC domain, and thus have a domain organisation that is not dissimilar to that of atrial natriuretic peptide receptors, NPR1 and NPR2. The findings also suggest that cGMP may have a role as a second messenger in brassinosteroid signalling. In addition, it is conceivable that other proteins containing the extended GC search motif may also have catalytic activity, thus implying that a significant number of GCs, both in plants and animals, remain to be discovered, and this is in keeping with the fact that the single cellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains over 90 annotated putative CGs."
https://openalex.org/W1993374118,"IQGAP1 is a scaffolding protein involved in multiple fundamental cellular activities, including transcription, cell-cell attachment, and regulation of the cytoskeleton. To function in these pathways, IQGAP1 associates with numerous proteins such as actin, calmodulin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, CLIP-170, and components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Moreover, IQGAP1 binds to active Cdc42 and Rac1 but not RhoA or Ras. Here we show that IQGAP1 also binds to the small GTPase Rap1. In vitro analysis demonstrates a direct interaction between Rap1 and IQGAP1, which is augmented by activation (GTP loading) of Rap1. Cdc42 does not modulate the interaction between Rap1 and IQGAP1. In contrast, the association is eliminated by calmodulin both in the absence and presence of Ca2+. The binding of Rap1 to a point mutant IQGAP1 construct that is unable to interact with calmodulin is 2.5-fold more than to wild type IQGAP1. Consistent with these findings, Rap1 binds to the IQ region of IQGAP1. Confocal microscopy demonstrates that Rap1 and IQGAP1 co-localize at the periphery of human epithelial cells but not in the cytoplasm. The interaction has functional sequelae. Overexpression of IQGAP1 substantially reduces adhesion-mediated activation of Rap1. In addition, Rap1 activation by cAMP is attenuated in cells that overexpress IQGAP1 and enhanced in cells lacking IQGAP1. These findings reveal that the interaction of IQGAP1 with Rap1 differs in several respects from its interaction with other small GTPases. Furthermore, our data suggest that IQGAP1 may link the calmodulin and Rap1 signaling pathways.

Biol. 2005; 15: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Members of the Ras family, which contains 36 proteins, include the Ras proteins (H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras) and several related proteins such as R-Ras proteins (R-Ras, R-Ras2, and M-Ras), Ral and Rap (2Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Like Ras, Rap1 cycles between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; Ni2+-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; Epac, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. such as Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), C3G, and CD-GEF, mediate Rap1 activation through exchange of GDP for GTP (3Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Rap1 is inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which catalyze the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. A wide variety of extracellular stimuli, for example thrombin, growth factors, and interferon, activate Rap1. These effects are mediated by second messengers, including Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and cAMP, which directly stimulate Rap1 GEFs. Ras and Rap1 are very similar at the amino acid level, with identical effector regions (4Caron E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the proteins have distinct functions. Rap1 has been implicated in the modulation of a number of cellular responses ranging from Ca2+ signaling and secretion to neurite outgrowth and cell proliferation (3Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A well characterized function of Rap1 is in cell adhesion, both integrin-mediated adhesion and cadherin-mediated cell junction formation (5Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Rap1 interacts with a large number of proteins that contribute to regulating these aspects of cell function (5Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar).

We generated maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion constructs of wild type Rap1A, Rap1A-63E, and Rap1A-17N. The BamHI-HindIII fragment containing Rap1A was cut from pRSET-Rap1A and inserted into pMAL-c2X at BamHI and HindIII sites. The proteins migrated to the expected position on SDS-PAGE. GST-Rap1A was generated by PCR on full-length Rap1A using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCCCGTGAGTTACAAGTCTAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGAGCAGCAGACATGATTTC-3′. The PCR product was cut with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into pGEX4T-1 at the same restriction sites. IQGAP1 was tagged with red fluorescent protein (RFP) using monomeric mRFP which was generously donated by Roger Tsien (University of California, San Diego, CA). A PCR product of mRFP was generated using primers 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGCCTCCTCCGAGGACG-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTGGCGCCGGTGGAGTGGCGTCT-3′ with pRSETB-mRFP1 as template. The PCR product was cut with XbaI and BglII, and the insert was replaced with a NheI-BglII fragment bearing the DsRed gene on pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech). To generate RFP-wild type IQGAP1, pcDNA-Myc-IQGAP1 was cut with XbaI and made blunt end with T4 polymerase then partially digested with BamHI. The BamHI-XbaI fragment bearing the whole IQGAP1 gene was inserted into mRFP-C1 at BglII-SmaI site. The RFP tag was attached to IQGAP1ΔIQ and IQGAP1 IQ3,4R using RFP-tagged wild type IQGAP1.

The lysate was loaded onto a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The sample was fractionated at 1 ml/min (0.5-ml fractions were collected) by fast protein liquid chromatography separation performed on an AKTATMFPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a UPC-900 monitor and a P-920 pump. The system was monitored and controlled by methods run by the UNICORN control system (Version 5.01). The column was calibrated using apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) as standards. Forty-microliter aliquots of selected fractions were resolved by Western blotting, then probed for IQGAP1 and Rap1. Adhesion Assays—To analyze cell adhesion, cells were trypsinized, suspended in complete medium, and plated onto collagen I- or fibronectin-coated culture dishes (BD Bioscience) at 37 °C for the times indicated in Figs. 7 and 8.

A, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of empty pcDNA3 vector (V) or IQGAP1ΔIQ (ΔIQ). Cells were plated on collagen I-coated culture dishes for the times indicated. Adherent cells were harvested with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Equal amounts of protein lysate were also used in a GST-RalGDS (for active Rap1) pulldown followed by Western blotting with anti-Rap1 antibody. Protein lysates were also blotted for Myc (all IQGAP1 constructs are Myc-tagged), IQGAP1, and β-tubulin (as loading control). B, the relative amount of GTP-Rap1 in each sample was quantified by densitometry and corrected for total Rap1 in the corresponding cell lysate. Data, expressed relative to MCF-7 cells transfected with vector at time 0, are the means ± S.D. of two independent experiments. C, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (V), wild type IQGAP1 (WT), or IQGAP1 IQ3,4R (IQ3,4R). Cells were plated on culture dishes coated with fibronectin. After 90 min, cells were processed for Rap1 as described for A. D, the relative amount of GTP-Rap1 in each sample was quantified by densitometry and corrected for total Rap1 in the corresponding lysate. Data, expressed relative to MCF-7 cells transfected with vector at time 0, are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Assay for Activation of Rap1 and Cdc42—Active Cdc42 (31Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and active Rap1 (32Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) were assessed essentially as described previously. Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with buffer A. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and active Rap1 and Cdc42 were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads precoupled to a GST fusion protein of the Rap1 binding domain of RalGDS for Rap1 and the GTPase binding domain of WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) for Cdc42. Samples were incubated for 40 min (for Rap1) or 30 min (for Cdc42). Beads were sedimented by centrifugation, washed three times with buffer A, and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. A portion of the cell lysate was reserved for analysis of total Rap1 or Cdc42 content. Cdc42 and Rap1 were detected by Western blotting. 8CPT-2Me-cAMP Treatment—Equal numbers of MCF-7 or MCF/I cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 24 h, cells were stimulated with 100 μm 8CPT-2Me-cAMP for the times indicated in the legend to Fig. 9. GTP-bound Rap1 was detected by pulldown with GST-RalGDS as described above. Similar analysis was done with MEFs derived from IQGAP1-null mice and normal littermate controls. In Vitro Binding Analyses—For binding assays using GST-tagged proteins, MBP-Rap1A was loaded with either GDP or GTPγS essentially as previously described (13Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, MBP-Rap1A was incubated in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) with 1 mm EDTA. After 10 min at 22 °C, 3 mm MgCl2 and 140 μm GTPγS or GDP were added, and samples were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. Samples were precleared with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h, and equal amounts of GST-IQGAP1 in 500 μl of buffer B containing 1 mm EGTA were added for 3 h at 4 °C. Complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose, washed three times in buffer B, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were probed with anti-Rap1 antibodies. For binding assays with MBP-tagged proteins, equal amounts of wild type MBP-Rap1A (loaded with GTPγS or GDP), dominant-negative Rap1A-17N, or constitutively active Rap1A-63E were incubated with purified IQGAP1 in 500 μl of buffer B for 3 h at 4 °C. Complexes were isolated with amylose beads, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 antibodies (26Roy M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9740-9752Google Scholar). To compare binding of Rap1A and Rap1B to IQGAP1, we used GST-tagged Rap1 proteins. IQGAP1 was cleaved from GST using tobacco etch virus protease as described (29Ren J.G. Li Z. Crimmins D.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34548-34557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GST, GST-Rap1A, and GST-Rap1B were loaded with GTPγS as described above. Equal amounts of purified IQGAP1 were incubated with equal amounts of GSTγS-loaded GST, GST-Rap1A, or GTP Rap1B in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EGTA for 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was cut into two pieces; the top portion was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 antibody. The lower half was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize GST-tagged proteins. [35S]Methionine-labeled transcription and translation (TNT) products were generated with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.5 μg of the IQGAP1 plasmids was incubated with 40 μl of TNT Quick Master mix and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 1 h. Products were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Equal amounts of radiolabeled peptide were incubated with His-Rap1A-63E. Complexes were isolated with Ni2+-NTA agarose, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and processed by autoradiography. Competitive Inhibition Analysis—[35S]Methionine-labeled IQGAP1 was preincubated with 5 μg of calmodulin, 5 μg of constitutively active Cdc42 (Cdc42-Q61L), or 5 μg of BSA in 500 μl of buffer B containing 1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm EGTA for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal amounts of His-Rap1A-63E protein were added, and samples were incubated another 1 h. The complexes were washed and isolated with Ni2+-NTA agarose. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and bands were analyzed by autoradiography of the dried gel. For calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography, [35S]methionine-labeled IQGAP1 was preincubated with 5 μg of His-Rap1A-63E or 5 μg of BSA in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal amounts of calmodulin-Sepharose or empty Sepharose were added. After 1 h beads were isolated and washed three times in buffer B containing Ca2+ or EGTA. Proteins bound to calmodulin were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed by autoradiography of the dried gel. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—MCF-7 or MCF-siIQ8 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-Rap1A alone or in combination with RFP-tagged IQGAP1 constructs. Cells were plated on glass coverslips that had been coated overnight with 10 μg/ml type I collagen or 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and blocked with 0.5% BSA. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (23Mataraza J.M. Briggs M.W. Li Z. Entwistle A. Ridley A.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41237-41245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 20 min at 22 °C. After washing twice in PBS, cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 22 °C. Polyclonal anti-IQGAP1 antibody was added in 0.2% Triton, 1% BSA for 16 h at 4 °C followed by Alexa-Fluor 543-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Where appropriate, actin was visualized with Alexa-Fluor 543-conjugated phalloidin. Rabbit IgG was used as a control for the corresponding primary antibody. The stained cells were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and analyzed with Zeiss LSM software. Miscellaneous—Densitometry of enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) signals was analyzed with UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific Corp.). Statistical analysis was assessed by Student's t test with Instat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Direct Interaction between IQGAP1 and Rap1—In vitro analysis was conducted to examine a possible association between IQGAP1 and Rap1. Purified MBP-Rap1A was loaded with either non-hydrolyzable GTPγS to form active Rap1A or with GDP to produce inactive Rap1A. Equal amounts of the Rap1A constructs were incubated with purified GST-IQGAP1. Pulldown with glutathione-Sepharose beads revealed that Rap1A binds to IQGAP1. IQGAP1 binds more efficiently to GTP-Rap1A than to the inactive form of Rap1A (Fig. 1A). Binding was specific, as no Rap1A associated with GST alone. Coomassie staining reveals that equal amounts of GST-IQGAP1 were present in the assay (Fig. 1A). To confirm these findings, the reverse experiment was done. MBP-Rap1A was incubated with purified IQGAP1. Pulldown with amylose beads reveals that more IQGAP1 binds to GTP-loaded Rap1A than to GDP-Rap1A (Fig. 1B). Similar analysis was conducted with MBP-tagged forms of the constitutively active Rap1A-63E and dominant negative Rap1A-17N. Consistent with the data obtained with guanine nucleotide loading, IQGAP1 associates with Rap1A-63E but not with Rap1A-17N (Fig. 1B). The amounts of MBP-Rap1A present in the assay were equivalent (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these data reveal that Rap1A interacts directly with IQGAP1 in a GTP-regulated"

https://openalex.org/W2047670480,"Bats are the only flying mammals and have well developed navigation abilities for 3D-space. Even bats with comparatively small home ranges cover much larger territories than rodents, and long-distance migration by some species is unique among small mammals. Adult proliferation of neurons, i.e., adult neurogenesis, in the dentate gyrus of rodents is thought to play an important role in spatial memory and learning, as indicated by lesion studies and recordings of neurons active during spatial behavior. Assuming a role of adult neurogenesis in hippocampal function, one might expect high levels of adult neurogenesis in bats, particularly among fruit- and nectar-eating bats in need of excellent spatial working memory. The dentate gyrus of 12 tropical bat species was examined immunohistochemically, using multiple antibodies against proteins specific for proliferating cells (Ki-67, MCM2), and migrating and differentiating neurons (Doublecortin, NeuroD). Our data show a complete lack of hippocampal neurogenesis in nine of the species (Glossophaga soricina, Carollia perspicillata, Phyllostomus discolor, Nycteris macrotis, Nycteris thebaica, Hipposideros cyclops, Neoromicia rendalli, Pipistrellus guineensis, and Scotophilus leucogaster), while it was present at low levels in three species (Chaerephon pumila, Mops condylurus and Hipposideros caffer). Although not all antigens were recognized in all species, proliferation activity in the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream was found in all species, confirming the appropriateness of our methods for detecting neurogenesis. The small variation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis within our sample of bats showed no indication of a correlation with phylogenetic relationship, foraging strategy, type of hunting habitat or diet. Our data indicate that the widely accepted notion of adult neurogenesis supporting spatial abilities needs to be considered carefully. Given their astonishing longevity, certain bat species may be useful subjects to compare adult neurogenesis with other long-living species, such as monkeys and humans, showing low rates of adult hippocampal neurogenesis."

When DNA damage is encountered, PCNA is monoubiquitinated on Lys-164 by the Rad6–Rad18 complex as the initiating step of translesion synthesis. DNA damage bypass by the translesion synthesis polymerase Rev1 is enhanced by the presence of ubiquitinated PCNA. Here we have carried out a mutational analysis of Rev1, and we have identified the functional domain in the C terminus of Rev1 that mediates interactions with PCNA. We show that a unique motif within this domain binds the ubiquitin moiety of ubiquitinated PCNA. Point mutations within this ubiquitin-binding motif of Rev1 (L821A,P822A,I825A) abolish its functional interaction with ubiquitinated PCNA in vitro and strongly attenuate damage-induced mutagenesis in vivo.

During normal progression of the cell cycle, replicative DNA polymerases are charged with the task of faithfully replicating host DNA. In eukaryotes, the B-family DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) 3The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; TLS, translesion synthesis; RPA, replication protein A; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PCNAUbi, PCNA mono-ubiquitinated at Lys-164; UBM, ubiquitin-binding motif; RFC, replication factor C. 3The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; TLS, translesion synthesis; RPA, replication protein A; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PCNAUbi, PCNA mono-ubiquitinated at Lys-164; UBM, ubiquitin-binding motif; RFC, replication factor C. and DNA polymerase ϵ synthesize the bulk of newly formed DNA (reviewed in Ref. 1Garg P. Burgers P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Both DNA polymerases possess a highly restrictive active site to promote proper Watson-Crick base pairing between the template strand and incoming bases (2Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). However, the restrictive nature of these enzymes also makes it inherently difficult for them to deal with DNA damage in the template DNA, and in general, the presence of DNA damage blocks the progression of the replication fork. This stalling activates one of several post-replication repair mechanisms that are designed to bypass damage in either an error-free or error-prone manner (reviewed in Refs. 3Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 4Lehmann A.R. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 300-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5Hochegger H. Sonoda E. Takeda S. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These pathways are initiated by monoubiquitination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on Lys-164 by Rad6–Rad18. During normal replication, PCNA serves as a processivity factor for the replicative DNA polymerases and coordinates the functions of enzymes on the lagging strand that are involved in the maturation of Okazaki fragments (reviewed in Refs. 6Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 433-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Garg P. Burgers P.M. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In order to carry out its DNA-associated functions, PCNA is loaded by the clamp loader replication factor C (RFC) in an ATP-dependent reaction (reviewed in Ref. 8Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Elegant genetic studies have shown that mono-ubiquitination of PCNA activates translesion synthesis (TLS) by translesion DNA polymerases (9Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 10Stelter P. Ulrich H.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 11Haracska L. Torres-Ramos C.A. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The more open active site of TLS polymerases, particularly of those in the Y-family of DNA polymerases, permits bypass of a variety of DNA lesions present on the template DNA (reviewed in Ref. 12Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). TLS in yeast consists of two branches, both of which require mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (PCNAUbi) for function. Bypass of UV damage, particularly cis-syn pyrimidine dimers, is mediated by pol η, the xeroderma pigmentosum variant DNA polymerase (13Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 14Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, pol η specifically interacts with PCNAUbi at sites of damage (15Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although unmodified PCNA has been shown to serve as a cofactor for damage bypass by pol η, ubiquitination of PCNA increases the rate of bypass in vitro (17Haracska L. Kondratick C.M. Unk I. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). TLS of most forms of DNA damage involves the participation of three DNA polymerases, pol δ, pol ζ, and Rev1, and may require additional activation by the Cdc7/Dbf4 protein kinase that normally functions in cell cycle progression (12Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 19Pessoa-Brandao L. Sclafani R.A. Genetics. 2004; 167: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This pathway is largely responsible for DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in eukaryotic cells. However, spontaneous mutagenesis and mutagenesis resulting from defects in the replication machinery is also largely dependent on this pathway (20Quah S.K. von Borstel R.C. Hastings P.J. Genetics. 1980; 96: 819-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Northam M.R. Garg P. Baitin D.M. Burgers P.M. Shcherbakova P.V. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4316-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several models for TLS of damage have been proposed in which one DNA polymerase carries out the insertion step across the lesion, and a second polymerase extends from the lesion (22Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1872-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 23Friedberg E.C. Lehmann A.R. Fuchs R.P. Mol.

Although pol δ is actually a high fidelity DNA polymerase, its requirement for mutagenesis follows from genetic studies of its third subunit pol 32 (24Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In vitro, the enzyme shows a high frequency of misincorporation and a high propensity to extend mismatched template-primer termini, making it the most error-prone B-family DNA polymerase (27Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 28Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4731-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The third required polymerase is the Rev1 deoxycytidyltransferase. Rev1 shows the highest catalytic activity opposite template guanines and abasic sites (30Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 31Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

This enzyme is primarily responsible for inserting dC residues opposite abasic sites during mutagenesis (25Gibbs P.E. McDonald J. Woodgate R. Lawrence C.W.

Kunitomi N. Iwai S. Loakes D. Negishi K. Mutat. Res. 2005; 578: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the requirement for PCNA mono-ubiquitination in damage-induced mutagenesis follows conclusively from genetic studies, the exact role of PCNAUbi remains to be established. All three DNA polymerases required for mutagenesis (pol δ, pol ζ, and Rev1) show interactions with unmodified PCNA, but only in the case of Rev1 have we been able to detect altered interactions upon ubiquitination of PCNA (18Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). PCNA and PCNAUbi show identical properties with regard to loading by RFC, in stimulating processive DNA synthesis by pol δ and by pol ϵ, and in coordinating Okazaki fragment maturation by pol δ, the flap endonuclease FEN1, and DNA ligase I (18Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Translesion synthesis by pol ζ is stimulated by PCNA via an unknown motif (34Garg P. Stith C.M. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23446-23450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This interaction is likely important for mutagenesis as PCNA mutants deficient for functional interactions with pol ζ are also defective for mutagenesis (21Northam M.R. Garg P. Baitin D.M. Burgers P.M. Shcherbakova P.V. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4316-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, ubiquitination of PCNA does not alter its functional interactions with pol ζ (18Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified Rev1 as a possible target for PCNAUbi in mutagenesis (18Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). PCNAUbi stimulates TLS by Rev1 more efficiently than PCNA does. Our model suggests that ubiquitination of PCNA may serve to localize Rev1 to stalled replication forks, which in turn recruits other components of the TLS machinery. This recruitment is likely mediated through the multiple interactions that Rev1 shows with TLS DNA polymerases, including pol ζ (35Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 36Guo C. Fischhaber P.L. Luk-Paszyc M.J. Masuda Y. Zhou J. Kamiya K. Kisker C. Friedberg E.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6621-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, following a similar biochemical approach to ours, others have failed to detect specialized interactions between PCNAUbi and Rev1 (37Haracska L. Unk I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6477-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to establish both a genetic and biochemical correlation between PCNA ubiquitination and Rev1 function. Recent studies have shown that several Y-family DNA polymerases contain a conserved ubiquitin-binding motif (UBM), and these UBM motifs contribute to increased binding of the polymerases to artificial linear ubiquitin-PCNA fusion proteins (38Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 39Guo C.

However, whether these UBMs are important for functional interaction with the physiologically relevant form of PCNA, i.e. with ubiquitin attached to Lys-164 of PCNA, remains to be determined. Yeast Rev1 contains at least two sequences that mirror these conserved UBMs. In order to determine whether these motifs play a role in the interaction of Rev1 with PCNAUbi, and whether this interaction is physiologically relevant for mutagenesis, we have generated a series of Rev1 deletion and point mutants that either delete or mutate these motifs. By measuring on one hand the ability of these Rev1 mutants to physically and functionally interact with PCNA versus PCNAUbi, and on the other hand to promote mutagenesis in vivo, we conclude that a single ubiquitin-binding motif is responsible for regulating the interactions between Rev1 and PCNAUbi. This motif is close to or embedded in a domain of Rev1 that mediates basic interactions with PCNA regardless of its ubiquitination state. DNA Substrates—All oligonucleotide substrates were prepared as described (34Garg P. Stith C.M. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23446-23450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The linear oligonucleotide templates contained a biotin at both ends. They are as follows: V9, 5′-Bio-CCTTTGCGAATTCT25GCGGCTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT30-Bio; V9AP1, 5′-Bio-CCTTTGCGAATTCT25GCG0CTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT30-Bio; and V9AP2 (where 0 indicates a tetrahydrofuran moiety), 5′-Bio-CCTTTGCGAATTCT25-GC0GCTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT30-Bio. Primer C12 (5′-AGGGAAGGGAGAGGGAGGAGAAGAAGGGAG) was 5′-32P-labeled and hybridized to the templates followed by addition of a 2-fold molar excess of streptavidin to block the biotin ends. Enzymes—Replication protein A (RP-A), RFC lacking the N-terminal domain of Rfc1 (RFC-1Δ273), and PCNA were purified as described previously (34Garg P. Stith C.M. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23446-23450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression and purification of Uba1, Rad6–Rad18, and Rev1 were as described (42Bailly V. Lauder S. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). PCNAUbi was prepared in an in vitro ubiquitination reaction, as described, and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography, followed by purification over a MiniQ column (18Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The MiniQ column separates PCNAUbi from unmodified PCNA and from partially co-migrating Rad6–Rad18, and two or three successive MiniQ purification steps were often required to remove all Rad6–Rad18. The resulting preparations contained in general 5–20% unmodified PCNA. Rev1 Mutants—Point mutations in REV1 were made in plasmid pJN60 (2 μm ori GAL1-10 URA3 GST-REV1) by PCR mutagenesis (30Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). C-terminal truncation mutants were made in the same fashion by inserting stop codons by PCR mutagenesis at the sites of truncation. The desired mutant was verified by sequencing and subcloning of the relevant (mutant) section of the gene. This series of mutant plasmids was named pBL822-x. Mutants were transferred from pBL822-x to series pBL820-x plasmids (pRS315-based: Bluescript SKII+ LEU2 CEN6 ARSH4 rev1-x) for genetic analysis of rev1-x mutants. Plasmids and sequences are available from authors upon request. Purification of Rev1 and Rev1 Mutants—Yeast strain BJ2168 (MATa ura3-52 trp1-289 leu2-3,112 prb1-1122 prc1-407 pep4-3) was transformed with pBL822-x, and transformants were grown on selective glycerol-lactate media and induced with galactose as described (43Bylund G.O. Majka J. Burgers P.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cells (∼40 g) were lysed by blending in dry ice with 20 ml of 3× lysis buffer (1× lysis buffer = 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaHSO3, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After thawing of the lysate, 5 m NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m and 10% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. All subsequent steps were at 0–4 °C. The lysate was spun for 30 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant was poured in a clean tube and spun again for 30 min at 18,000 rpm. The supernatant was batch-bound by gentle rocking motion for 2 h to 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose, equilibrated in buffer B1000 (B0 + 1000 mm NaCl; B0 = 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaHSO3, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100). The beads were loaded in a 10-ml column and washed at 1 ml/min with 100 ml of buffer B500, followed by 10 ml of B500 + 5 mm magnesium acetate + 1 mm ATP, followed by 10 ml of B300. The Mg-ATP wash removes contaminating Ssa1 heat shock protein. The column was eluted at 0.1 ml/min with 5 ml of B300 containing 20 mm glutathione at a pH of 8.0. Fractions containing GST-Rev1 were treated overnight at 4 °C with 80 units of thrombin (Sigma). The digest was diluted with 2 volumes of B0 buffer and fractionated over a 1-ml MonoS column (GE Healthcare) using a 15-ml gradient of B100 to B500 for elution. Pure Rev1 eluted at ∼200–250 mm NaCl. Purification of the Rev1 mutants proceeded similarly. Ubiquitination of 32P-PCNA—PCNA containing an N-terminal phosphorylatable tag (MRRASVGS-PCNA) was 32P-labeled by phosphorylation with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (catalytic subunit; New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP and purified as described (40Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitination was carried out in a 300-μl reaction containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgAc2, 600 fmol of deca-primed SKII single-stranded DNA (6 pmol of template-primer termini), 60 pmol of RPA, 4 pmol of RFC, 10 pmol of Rad6–Rad18, 20 pmol of Uba1, 20 pmol of His6-ubiquitin, and 3 pmol of 32P-PCNA, and the reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. An identical control reaction was set up, but lacking ubiquitin. After incubation, EDTA was added to 5 mm and dithiothreitol to 10 mm final concentration, and incubation was continued for 15 min to discharge ubiquitin-activating enzyme and ubiquitin carrier protein intermediates. The reaction was directly loaded onto a 0.8-ml MiniQ column and 32P-PCNA and 32P-PCNAUbi eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaCl. These partially purified preparations were used in the Rev1 binding assays. In Vitro Binding Assays—Binding studies of Rev1 (mutants) with PCNA and PCNAUbi were performed in 200-μl reactions containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. 12 fmol each of 32P-PCNA and of 32P-PCNAUbi were incubated with 1 pmol of wild type or mutant GST-Rev1 for 30 min at 4 °C. The addition of the PCNA and Rev1-containing fractions brings the salt concentration of the assay to ∼100 mm NaCl. 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was then added and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 30 min. The resin was then pelleted by low speed centrifugation and washed once with 1 ml of binding buffer. The beads were then boiled with 10 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the samples were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The bound PCNA was then visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager. DNA Synthesis and Damage Bypass Assays—Assays were carried out on the indicated template-primers and quantitated as described previously (18Garg P. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18361-18366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard 20-μl assays contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 100 μm each dNTPs, 100 fmol of template-primer, 1 pmol of RPA, 300 fmol of RFC, and 300 fmol of PCNA or PCNAUbi. The added NaCl was adjusted for each assay such that the final concentration was 100 mm, including contributions from enzyme storage buffers. Assays were preincubated at 30 °C for 45 s to pre-load the clamp. Reactions were then started by the addition of 100 fmol of Rev1 or mutant Rev1 as indicated and allowed to proceed for the indicated time. Products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel and quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager. UV-induced Mutagenesis—The pBL820-based REV1 plasmids were transformed into strain into strain SFY-1 (MATα arg4-17 his3Δ-1 leu2-3 trp1-Δ ura3-52 rev1Δ::hisG) obtained from Christopher Lawrence (Rochester University). Transformants were grown for 2 days to saturation in selective minimal media. The cells were washed with sterile water and either 106, 105, or 104 cells plates in patches on selective minimal media lacking arginine. The plates were either not irradiated or irradiated with 20 J/m2 of UV254 and immediately incubated at 30 °C in the dark. Plates were photographed after 3 days. The same series of plasmids was also transformed into strain pY201 (MATα his3Δ-1 leu2-3 trp1-Δ ura3-52 rev1Δ::hisG) and grown similarly. Serial dilutions were plated on selective plates (for the plasmid) with or without 80 μg/ml canavanine and irradiated with 0, 10, 20, or 30 J/m2 of UV light. Survival was measured on the plates without canavanine, spontaneous frequencies to canavanine resistance on unirradiated plates, and UV-induced frequencies to canavanine resistance on irradiated canavanine plates. Colonies appearing after 3 days of growth at 30 °C were counted. Salt Sensitivity of the Rev1 Assay—We have previously observed that Rev1 activity is stimulated by PCNA and hyper-stimulated by PCNAUbi. However, another group did not observe stimulation of Rev1 activity by PCNA nor by PCNAUbi (37Haracska L. Unk I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6477-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In order to understand the variabilities in the assay that might produce such disparate results, we measured Rev1 activity with or without clamp as a function of the salt concentration. The 101-nucleotide-long oligonucleotide template contained biotin residues at both ends. The template was primed in the middle with a 30-mer primer, and the template ends were blocked with streptavidin moieties. After coating of the single-stranded template regions with the single-stranded binding protein RPA, PCNA or PCNAUbi was loaded by RFC prior to initiating DNA synthesis at t = 0 by addition of Rev1. The terminal biotin-streptavidin anchors are important in preventing the loaded PCNA from sliding off the DNA (34Garg P. Stith C.M. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23446-23450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the assay in Fig. 1, the primer was positioned such on the template that Rev1 has to insert one dCMP opposite a template guanine prior to encountering the abasic site (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, at 75 mm NaCl Rev1 is proficient in abasic site bypass even in the absence of PCNA, and no further stimulation of Rev1 activity by the addition of PCNA was observed (Fig. 1, B and C). We attribute this lack of stimulation to the prolonged presence of the clamp loader RFC on the template, preventing association of Rev1 with PCNA or possibly even with the primer terminus. Such competition between the clamp loader and a DNA polymerase for interaction with the clamp has been well documented in Escherichia coli and also exists in eukaryotes (44Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 45Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In order to reduce interference by RFC for Rev1-PCNA-DNA complex formation, we have taken a combination of two approaches. First, in our studies we use a form of RFC, designated RFC-1Δ273, that lacks an N-terminal DNA binding domain of Rfc1 that is dispensable for loading in vitro and in vivo (41Gomes X.V. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14541-14549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RFC-1Δ273, although perfectly proficient for clamp loading, shows reduced interactions with the DNA thereby decreasing interference. Second, at higher salt concentrations, RFC is very rapidly dissociated from the DNA-PCNA complex after completion of loading (46Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consequently, at higher salt levels Rev1 could be properly recruited to the DNA-PCNA complex, and a strong stimulation by PCNA and hyper-stimulation by PCNAUbi were observed (Fig. 1, B and C). At 150 mm NaCl, PCNA stimulated Rev1 activity 6-fold, whereas PCNAUbi caused a 15-fold stimulation. At 100 mm NaCl, we could easily and reproducibly detect basal activity by Rev1 alone, as well as stimulation by PCNA and hyper-stimulation by PCNAUbi. Therefore, we have used 100 mm NaCl throughout the remainder of our lesion bypass experiments. Design of Mutants for Rev1 Interaction Analysis—In order to determine which domains of Rev1 may play a role in mediating its interaction with ubiquitinated PCNA, we systematically mutated several functional domains within Rev1, some of which have previously been shown to affect DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. One of these domains is a BRCT domain that is required for mutagenesis. The rev1-1 mutant contains a G193R mutation in a conserved hairpin turn in the BRCT domain; the mutant is defective for mutagenesis, and the mutant Rev1-1 protein has reduced polymerase activity (47Nelson J.R. Gibbs P.E. Nowicka A.M. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Y-family DNA polymerases harbor highly conserved UBM containing an invariant Leu-Pro within the sequence (38Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). We identified two potential motifs in Rev1 that may serve this same function (UBM-1 and UBM-2, shown in Fig. 2A). We used triple alanine substitutions to generate point mutations within these two domains that we refer to as rev1-11 (UBM-1 mutant; L809A,P810A,M813A) and rev1-12 (UBM-2 mutant; L821A,P822A,I825A) (Fig. 2A). In addition, we made two C-terminal truncation mutants based upon multiple sequence alignment analysis of 14 divergent sequences (48Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (28840) Google Scholar). The truncations were made between blocks of conserved sequences. Truncation mutant rev1-5 (Δ866–985) retains the two putative UBM motifs and a proposed PCNA interaction motif (see below) but removes the proposed pol ζ interaction motif, based upon studies with mouse Rev1 (36Guo C. Fischhaber P.L. Luk-Paszyc M.J. Masuda Y. Zhou J. Kamiya K. Kisker C. Friedberg E.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6621-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A more extensive truncation mutant, rev1-4 (Δ780–985), removes both UBMs and the proposed C-terminal PCNA interaction motif. Conflicting data exist with regard to the domain of Rev1 that binds PCNA"
https://openalex.org/W2065144272,"The RNA-binding factor HuR is a ubiquitously expressed member of the Hu protein family that binds and stabilizes mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs). Hu proteins share a common domain organization of two tandemly arrayed RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) near the N terminus, followed by a basic hinge domain and a third RRM near the C terminus. In this study, we engineered recombinant wild-type and mutant HuR proteins lacking affinity tags to characterize their ARE-binding properties. Using combinations of electrophoretic mobility shift and fluorescence anisotropy-based binding assays, we show that HuR can bind ARE substrates as small as 13 nucleotides with low nanomolar affinity, but forms cooperative oligomeric protein complexes on ARE substrates of at least 18 nucleotides in length. Analyses of deletion mutant proteins indicated that RRM3 does not contribute to high affinity recognition of ARE substrates, but is required for cooperative assembly of HuR oligomers on RNA. Finally, the hinge domain between RRM2 and RRM3 contributes significant binding energy to HuR·ARE complex formation in an ARE length-dependent manner. The hinge does not enhance RNA-binding activity by increased ion pair formation despite extensive positive charge within this region, and it does not thermodynamically stabilize protein folding. Together, the results define distinct roles for the HuR hinge and RRM3 domains in formation of cooperative HuR·ARE complexes in solution.

The cytoplasmic concentration of any given mRNA is a major determinant of the rate at which its encoded protein may be produced by the translation machinery and is governed by a balance between the rates of mRNA synthesis and degradation. Cellular decay kinetics can vary widely among the mRNA population, with different transcripts exhibiting half-lives ranging from minutes to days in mammalian cells (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Control of mRNA decay rates thus constitutes a major cellular mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.Several mRNAs that are rapidly degraded, often with half-lives of less than 1 h, include those encoding oncoproteins and signaling proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory mediators (3Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). A common feature of many rapidly degraded mRNAs is the presence of an AU-rich element (ARE) 2The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; RRMs, RNA recognition motifs; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; Fl, fluorescein; DTT, dithiothreitol; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; RRMs, RNA recognition motifs; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; Fl, fluorescein; DTT, dithiothreitol; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; GST, glutathione S-transferase. in their 3′-untranslated regions. The sequence of this cis-element is highly variable, although it frequently contains one or more AUUUA pentameric motifs within or near a U-rich region. The length of an ARE is also variable and can range from 30 to 120 nucleotides (4Chen C-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). AREs serve as binding sites for a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, >20 of which have been identified to date (3Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 5Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, interactions between ARE-binding proteins and their cognate RNA targets can yield a diverse range of consequences. For example, AUF1, tristetraprolin, and K homology splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) can direct rapid decay of mRNAs containing high affinity binding sites (6Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chen C-Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.-E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J.M. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M.

Cell. 2004; 14: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Conversely, members of the Hu family of proteins inhibit degradation of many ARE-containing mRNAs, possibly by antagonizing recruitment of competing mRNA-destabilizing factors (11Peng S.-Y.S Chen C.-Y. A. Xu N. Shyu A.-B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 12Dean J.L.E. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell.

Finally, proteins of the TIA-1/TIAR family do not appear to influence mRNA decay kinetics directly; rather, they control the subcellular localization and translational efficiency of targeted transcripts (15López de Silanes I. Galban S. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Indig F.E. Falco G. Zhan M. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9520-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 16Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.

Keene J.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). HuR, alternatively called HuA, is the only ubiquitously expressed protein of the four (18Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Expression of the remaining three family members (HuB (sometimes referred to as Hel-N1), HuC, and HuD) are limited to neuronal tissues (17Antic D. Keene J.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Antic D. Lu N. Keene J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The primary structures of the Hu proteins are well conserved (>68% pairwise identity among all proteins) and share an identical domain arrangement, with two tandemly arrayed RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) near the N terminus, followed by a hinge region and finally a third RRM near the C terminus (18Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). To date, characterization of the RNA-binding activity of the Hu proteins has been largely limited to the neuronal isoforms. Binding studies with HuD deletion mutants indicated that RRM1 is essential for RNA binding, but that high affinity association with ARE substrates also requires RRM2 or RRM3 (20Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of an HuD deletion mutant containing the two N-terminal RRMs bound to ARE fragments show that both of these RRMs specifically contact poly(U) sequences within RNA substrates, spanning a total of eight to nine nucleotides and inducing a pronounced kink in the RNA backbone between sequences contacted by RRM1 versus RRM2 (21Wang X. Tanaka Hall T.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). An NMR structure of the corresponding domain of HuC bound to an ARE fragment yielded similar data (22Inoue M. Muto Y. Sakamoto H. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the function of the C-terminal RRM domain is much less clear. A HuD binding study indicated ARE-binding activity for RRM3, although inclusion of this domain made relatively minor contributions (2-fold) to binding affinity (20Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By contrast, an earlier report indicated that HuR RRM3 facilitates association with poly(A) RNA sequences (23Ma W.-J. Chung S. Furneaux H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The cellular role of RRM3 also remains unresolved. Overexpression studies using HuR truncation mutant proteins have alternatively demonstrated that RRM3 is either required or dispensable for the mRNA-stabilizing activity of this protein, although these contradictory results may be cell type-specific (13Chen C-Y. A. Xu N.. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7268-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Finally, the basic hinge region located between RRM2 and RRM3 contains a nuclear localization sequence that allows HuR to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, although the protein is predominantly nuclear (25Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 26Gallouzi I-E. Steitz J.A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3092-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To date, the hinge domain has not been implicated in the association of Hu proteins with RNA substrates.In this study, we constructed recombinant wild-type and mutant HuR proteins lacking affinity tags and characterized their RNA-binding properties using combinations of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and fluorescence anisotropy-based binding experiments. The use of differentially sized RNA substrates spanning the ARE from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA permitted resolution of the minimal RNA-binding sites necessary for HuR recognition and cooperative binding. Together, these experiments identify RNA and protein determinants contributing to cooperative formation of multisubunit HuR complexes on ARE substrates and define specific roles for both the basic hinge and C-terminal RRM domains in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Substrates—Synthesis, 2′-hydroxyl deprotection, and purification of the RNA substrates used in this study were performed by Dharmacon Research or Integrated DNA Technologies. The RNA substrate ARE38 includes the core ARE sequence from TNFα mRNA (Table 1). Other substrates designated ARExx are subsections of this TNFα mRNA sequence. The RNA substrate Rβ encodes a fragment of the rabbit β-globin mRNA coding sequence. Fluorescein groups were linked to the 5′-ends of some RNA substrates during solid-phase synthesis and are designated by the prefix “Fl” where applicable. Lyophilized RNA samples were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). Quantification of RNA yields and fluorophore labeling efficiency was performed by absorbance spectroscopy as described previously (28Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For preparation of 5′-32P-radiolabeled RNA substrates, 5′-hydroxyl RNA oligonucleotides were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) as described (30Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), yielding specific activities of 3–5 × 103 cpm/fmol.TABLE 1RNA substrates used in this studyRNA substrateSequence (5′ → 3′)ARE38GUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAGARE20UUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAGARE18UUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAARE16AUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAARE15UUAUUUAUUUAUUUAARE14UAUUUAUUUAUUUAARE13AUUUAUUUAUUUAARE11UUAUUUAUUUARβUGGCCAAUGCCCUGGCUCACAAAUACCACUG Open table in a new tab Construction of Recombinant HuR and HuR Deletion Mutant Expression Vectors—A cDNA fragment encoding the complete open reading frame of human HuR was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA purified from the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and then subcloned into pGEM-7Z(+) (Promega) to generate plasmid pGW01. The fidelity of the HuR open reading frame was verified by automated DNA sequencing. HuR cDNA subfragments encoding the complete 306-amino acid open reading frame, residues 1–185 (HuRΔHinge3), and residues 1–242 (HuRΔRRM3) were amplified from the pGW01 template by PCR utilizing DNA primers incorporating unique terminal restriction sites. These cDNA fragments were then subcloned downstream (HuR and HuRΔHinge3) or upstream (HuRΔRRM3) of an intein/chitin-binding domain tag using plasmids pTYB11 and pTYB1, respectively, from the IMPACT-CN (intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag) system (New England Biolabs). The sequence and orientation of all cDNA inserts were verified by automated DNA sequencing.Preparation and Characterization of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant HuR or HuR deletion mutant proteins (see Fig. 1A) were prepared in Escherichia coli ER2566 cells using a variation of a procedure described by Meisner et al. (31Meisner N.C. Hackermuller J. Uhl V. Aszodi A. Jaritz M. Auer M. Chem Bio Chem. 2004; 5: 1432-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown with shaking at 37 °C in SOB medium supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 50 μg/ml ampicillin until reaching A600 ≈ 0.6–0.8. Protein production was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and cell growth was continued at 25 °C for 5 h. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 3300 × g for 20 min. In pilot experiments, optimal protein buffer conditions were selected through a solubility screening test monitored by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano series instrument (Malvern Instruments) essentially as described (32Jancarik J. Pufan R. Hong C. Kim S.H. Kim R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This procedure indicated optimal solubility for HuR and HuR deletion mutant proteins in a high salt buffer composed of sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (data not shown), which was subsequently termed HuR column buffer.Cells were resuspended in 15 ml of chilled HuR column buffer containing 20 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and disrupted on ice by sonication. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a chitin affinity column (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with HuR column buffer. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of HuR column buffer to remove unbound or nonspecifically bound proteins, followed by addition of 3 bed volumes of cleavage buffer (HuR column buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). The column was then capped, and DTT-induced self-cleavage of the intein tag was allowed to proceed for 40 h. Cleaved protein was eluted in HuR column buffer and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (10-kDa molecular mass cutoff). DTT remaining in the sample was removed by repeated concentration in HuR column buffer before a final centrifugation step (20,000 × g for 15 min) to remove any particulate matter. Recombinant proteins were quantified using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels against a titration of bovine serum albumin.The purity of all recombinant proteins was judged to be >95% by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1B, left panel). Western blot analyses using anti-HuR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) further verified that each recombinant protein was immunologically related to HuR (see Fig. 1B, right panel). UV absorbance spectra indicated no significant nucleic acid contamination of HuRΔRRM3 or HuRΔHinge3 (supplemental Fig. S1A). By contrast, absorbance of the full-length HuR protein was enhanced at wavelengths below 270 nm, characteristic of co-purifying nucleic acids. Comparisons with HuR spectra measured following addition of varying amounts of an RNA substrate containing a single HuR-binding site (ARE16) indicated that the total number of nucleic acid-binding sites co-purifying with recombinant HuR constituted <0.1 mol eq (supplemental Fig. S1B).Dynamic light scattering verified that recombinant protein preparations were free of high molecular mass complexes or aggregates. Typically, protein preparations returned peaks representing particle diameters of 5.1–7.5 nm, constituting >98% of the total sample volume (see Fig. 1C). Finally, the oligomerization status of purified recombinant proteins was monitored by gel filtration chromatography (see Fig. 1D). A HiPrep 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) packed with Sephacryl S-200 high resolution resin was equilibrated with HuR column buffer before loading protein samples (50–100 μg). Chromatography was performed at 30 ml/h with protein elution monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Column void volume was determined using blue dextran. The column was calibrated by monitoring elution of the following protein standards (Sigma) at A280: alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). The apparent molecular masses calculated for each of the HuR, HuRΔRRM3, and HuRΔHinge3 proteins resolved to within 10% of their predicted molecular masses calculated from amino acid sequence (supplemental Table SI), indicating that each recombinant HuR protein is a monomer in solution.Analyses of Protein Folding Stability by Chemical Denaturation—For all recombinant proteins, the thermodynamic stability of protein folding was estimated by equilibrium denaturation in guanidine HCl (GdnHCl). Protein samples (2 μm) were incubated at room temperature in RNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA) in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of GdnHCl (60-μl total volume). After 60 min, the extent of protein unfolding was assessed by measurement of protein fluorescence (λex = 270 nm and λem = 290–400 nm; 10 nm bandwidth) at 21 °C using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer equipped with a microcell. Because the HuRΔRRM3 and HuRΔHinge3 proteins do not contain tryptophan, the excitation wavelength was blue-shifted to 270 nm to preferentially excite tyrosine residues (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 1999; (, Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York)Crossref Google Scholar). Protein denaturation was considered as a two-state, GdnHCl-dependent transition between native and unfolded conformations, yielding distinct fluorescence emission intensities, Fnative and Funfolded, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters describing the denaturant-induced protein unfolding transition were estimated from the change in protein fluorescence measured at 305 nm (F305) as a function of GdnHCl concentration using Equations 1 and 2 adapted from the linear extrapolation method of Santoro and Bolen (34Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) as modified by Manyusa and Whitford (35Manyusa S. Whitford D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9533-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). F305=Fnative−((Fnative−Funfolded)ċe−ΔGu/RT1+e−ΔGu/RT)1 ΔGu=ΔGuw−meq[GdnHCl]2 Here, ΔGu represents the free energy of protein denaturation at each concentration of GdnHCl. ΔGuw is the extrapolated free energy of protein unfolding in the absence of denaturant, and meq relates the sensitivity of ΔGu to GdnHCl concentration. All parameters were resolved from F305 versus [GdnHCl] plots by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism Version 3.03.Protein·RNA Binding Assays—EMSAs were used to qualitatively assess the formation of complexes between recombinant HuR proteins and 32P-labeled RNA substrates. EMSAs were performed essentially as described (30Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but with EDTA (0.5 mm) instead of MgCl2 in the binding buffer. Quantitative measurement of protein·RNA binding equilibria was performed using fluorescence anisotropy essentially as described (28Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Reactions containing limiting concentrations of 5′-Fl-labeled RNA substrates (0.2 nm) and varying concentrations of protein were assembled in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin (100-μl final volume). Alternative monovalent salt or RNA substrate concentrations are indicated where applicable. Heparin (1 μg/μl) was also included in all binding reactions to suppress nonspecific interactions between proteins and RNA substrates (30Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the absence of this polyanionic competitor, HuR displayed modest binding to irrelevant RNA substrates (data not shown). Following incubation at 25 °C for 60 min, fluorescence anisotropy of the Fl-RNA substrates was measured using a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system (PanVera Corp.) equipped with fluorescein excitation (490 nm) and emission (535 nm) filters. Total fluorescence emission from each reaction was concomitantly measured to verify that the fluorescence quantum yields of RNA substrates were not significantly affected by protein binding events. Equilibrium binding constants describing formation of protein·RNA complexes were resolved from plots of total measured anisotropy versus protein concentration by nonlinear regression using Prism and employing analytical functions describing one or more of the binding models defined below (equations derived from Refs. 36Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and 37Wilson G.M. Geddes C.D. Lakowicz J.R. Reviews in Fluorescence. 2. 2005: 223-243Google Scholar). The appropriateness of each binding model was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (R2) from individual binding experiments and analysis of residual plot non-randomness to detect any bias for data subsets (Prism). When multiple models were considered for a common data set, pairwise comparisons of sum-of-squares deviations were performed using the F test (Prism), with differences exhibiting p < 0.05 considered significant.Reactions best described by cooperative binding were resolved by a variant of the Hill model. Under conditions of constant fluorescence quantum yield and limiting RNA substrate, measured anisotropy (At) varies with total protein concentration ([P]) as a function of the protein concentration yielding half-maximal binding ([P]½) and the Hill coefficient (h) by Equation 3. At=AR+(APxR-AR)×(([P]/[P]1/2)21+([P]/[P]1/2)2)3 Here, AR represents the intrinsic anisotropy of the free Fl-RNA substrate measured directly from sample reactions assembled without protein (n ≥ 4), and APxR represents the intrinsic anisotropy of the saturated HuR·Fl-RNA complex. In some cases, assembly of protein·RNA complexes involving two distinct protein binding events without cooperativity was indicated. Here, a sequential binding model given by Equation 4 resolves explicit equilibrium association binding constants for each stage of complex assembly provided that (i) the affinity of the first binding step (K1) is at least 5-fold greater than that of the second (K2), (ii) the concentration of the Fl-RNA substrate is significantly lower than 1/K1, and (iii) the fluorescence quantum yield of the Fl-RNA substrate is not significantly influenced by protein binding (36Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Wilson G.M. Geddes C.D. Lakowicz J.R. Reviews in Fluorescence. 2. 2005: 223-243Google Scholar). Additional resolved parameters are the intrinsic anisotropy values of the Fl-RNA substrate bound to one (APR) or two (AP2R) protein molecules. At=AR+APRK1[P]+AP2RK1K2[P]21+K1[P]+K1K2[P]24 If a single or multiple identical binding events are indicated, Equation 4 may be simplified by substitution of K2 = 0 to yield Equation 5. At=AR+APRK[P]1+K[P]5 In cases in which the apparent ARE-binding affinity was very high (1/K < 1 nm), data sets were also resolved by Equation 6. This function describes a quadratic binding algorithm incorporating protein depletion and includes terms for the total concentrations of RNA ([R]T) and protein ([P]T). At=AR+(APR-AR)×(1+K([R]T+K[P]T-{(1+K[R]T+K[P]T)2-4[R]T[P]TK2})1+K1[P]+K1K2[P]2)6 Where indicated, the free energy of protein binding was extracted from equilibrium association constants as ΔG =–RT ln(K), where R = 1.987 × 10–3 kcal mol–1 K–1.HuR Binding Density Analysis—The size of the HuR-binding site on the Fl-ARE38 substrate was calculated using the model-independent ligand binding density analysis approach of Lohman and Bujalowski (38Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and Bujalowski and Jezewska (39Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, quantitative estimates of the average binding density (Σν, defined as the average number of HuR proteins bound per Fl-labeled RNA) and free HuR protein concentration ([P]f) were extracted from the measured fluorescence anisotropy of the Fl-ARE38 substrate across a titration of HuR. The analysis holds that each possible HuR complex with the Fl-ARE38 RNA affects the experimentally observable net change in anisotropy (ΔA = Ax–AR, where AR is the intrinsic anisotropy of the Fl-ARE38 substrate in the absence of protein and Ax is the anisotropy in the presence of x nm HuR). As such, each HuR·Fl-ARE38 complex displays an intrinsic anisotropy (ΔAi) that contributes to the population weighted ensemble average (ΔAobs). A common value of ΔAobs in experiments containing two different RNA concentrations ([R]T1 and [R]T2) indicates that each system possesses similar distributions of complexes, yielding the same values of Σν and [P]f. The average binding density and free HuR protein concentration are related to the total protein concentrations under these conditions ([P]T1 and [P]T2) and can be extracted from the slope and intercept given by Equations 7 and 8, respectively, where i = 1 or 2 in the intercept determination. Σv=[P]T2-[P]T1[R]T2-[R]T17 [P]f=[P]Ti-(Σv)[R]Ti8 In this study, HuR titrations were performed across three concentrations of Fl-labeled RNA ([R]Ti) to permit estimation of errors in the resolved values of Σν and [P]f. For a series of ΔAobs values, slopes and intercepts were determined using linear least squares analysis of [R]Ti versus interpolated [P]Ti values across the set of titration curves for each given ΔAobs. An estimate of the average HuR binding density on the RNA substrate at saturation (Σνsat) was provided by linear extrapolation of ΔAobs versus Σν to the net anisotropy change at binding saturation"

To accomplish this, we used homologous recombination to ablate nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC) II-B by inserting cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NMHC II-A into the first coding exon of the Myh10 gene, thereby placing GFP-NMHC II-A under control of the endogenous II-B promoter. Similar to B-/B- mice, most Ba*/Ba* mice died late in embryonic development with structural cardiac defects and impaired cytokinesis of the cardiac myocytes. However, unlike B-/B- mice, 15 Ba*/Ba* mice of 172 F2 generation mice survived embryonic lethality but developed a dilated cardiomyopathy as adults. Surprisingly none of the Ba*/Ba* mice showed evidence for hydrocephalus that is always found in B-/B- mice. Rescue of this defect was due to proper localization and function of GFP-NMHC II-A in place of NMHC II-B in a cell-cell adhesion complex in the cells lining the spinal canal. Restoration of the integrity and adhesion of these cells prevents protrusion of the underlying cells into the spinal canal where they block circulation of the cerebral spinal fluid. However, abnormal migration of facial and pontine neurons found in NMHC II-B mutant and ablated mice persisted in Ba*/Ba* mice. Thus, although NMHC II-A can substitute for NMHC II-B to maintain integrity of the spinal canal, NMHC II-B plays an isoform-specific role during cytokinesis in cardiac myocytes and in migration of the facial and pontine neurons.

Myosins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, 2Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). To date, three isoforms of the NM-II heavy chain, termed NMHC II-A, NMHC II-B, and NMHC II-C, have been identified in vertebrates (3Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J.

The NMHCs are encoded by three different genes, Myh9,-10, and -14 (generating NMHC II-A, NMHC II-B, and NMHC II-C, respectively), which, in humans and mice, are located on different chromosomes (7Saez C.G.

They have similar molecular structures in that each heavy chain contains an amino-terminal globular region that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis and binds to actin to generate force and an α-helical carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil rod region that is responsible for myosin filament assembly (1Sellers J.R.

The primary structure of the three NMHC II isoforms is well conserved showing a 64-80% identity in amino acids. The three isoforms are widely expressed in most mammalian tissues and cells in a tissue-specific (6Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S. Shoham N.G. Goldin E. Conti M.A. Sellers J.R.

In cultured cells, NM-II has been found to participate in such fundamental cellular processes as cytokinesis, cell migration, and maintenance of cell morphology (11Matsumura F.

In vivo studies showed that mice that have been ablated for NMHC II-B had major defects in their hearts and brains and died between embryonic day (E) 14.5 and birth (23Tullio A.N. Accili D. Ferrans V.J. Yu Z.-X. Takeda K. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Preston Y.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12407-12412Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Takeda K. Kishi H. Ma X. Yu Z.X. Adelstein R.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cardiac defects included a membranous ventricular septal defect (VSD), double outlet from the right ventricle (DORV) of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and a defect in cytokinesis resulting in a decreased number of cardiac myocytes. The brain abnormalities included a severe hydrocephalus starting at E12.5 and resulting in destruction of large amounts of brain tissue (25Tullio A.N. Bridgman P.C. Tresser N.J. Chan C.-C. Conti M.A. Adelstein R.S. Hara Y. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 43: 62-74Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A point mutation in the motor domain of NMHC II-B (R709C), coupled with decreased expression of the mutant myosin, led to the impaired migration of specific groups of neurons, including the cerebellar granule cells during brain development, accompanied by the cardiac defects outlined previously (24Takeda K. Kishi H. Ma X. Yu Z.X. Adelstein R.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Ma X. Kawamoto S. Hara Y. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The hypomorphic mutant mice, which, unlike B-/B- mice, survived for up to 20 days after birth, had profound difficulties with their gait and balance and, similar to B-/B- mice, manifested a severe hydrocephalus (26Ma X. Kawamoto S. Hara Y. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These studies indicate the importance of NMHC II-B during murine cardiac and brain development. Because both the brain and heart (especially cardiac myocytes) are enriched in the expression of NMHC II-B relative to the other isoforms of NMHC II and because there is no obvious increase in the expression of NMHC II-A (and II-C) in cardiac myocytes and brain tissue in NMHC II-B ablated mice (see below), we are unable to distinguish whether the defects seen in B-/B- mice are due to the absence of the NMHC II-B isoform specifically or due to the absence of NM II in general. Similarly mice ablated for NMHC II-A die by E6.5 with a failure in the development of the visceral endoderm where only NMHC II-A, but not II-B, is expressed, again indicating that the defect may be due to the loss of NM II (27Conti M.A. Even-Ram S. Liu C. Yamada K.M. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41263-41266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Another related question raised in this study is whether the expression of an NMHC II isoform not usually found in a particular cell type such as cardiac myocytes could cause an adverse effect on the heart. Thus, cardiac myocytes, unlike most cells including skeletal and smooth muscle cells, cease to express NMHC II-A at the protein level by E9.5. Moreover mutations in many sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins, such as cardiac actin, β-cardiac myosin heavy chain, and muscle LIM protein, in humans result in a dilated cardiomyopathy (28Olson T.M.

Graham R.M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 945-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence for the first time that expression of NMHC II-A in adult cardiac myocytes results in a dilated cardiomyopathy. Finally vertebrates differ from Dictyostelium and Drosophila in that they express three different NMHCs rather than one. Therefore, it becomes of interest to learn whether each isoform of NM II in vertebrates plays a unique role or whether they are interchangeable. In this study, we focused on whether NMHC II-A can substitute for NMHC II-B in vivo during mouse development. To answer the question of functional replacement, we used homologous recombination to ablate the message encoding NMHC II-B by inserting cDNA encoding human green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NMHC II-A into the first coding exon of the NMHC II-B gene. This ablates NMHC II-B and places GFP-NMHC II-A under control of the endogenous II-B promoter. We examined the mice generated following germ line transmission of the GFP-NMHC II-A allele (designated Ba*) with respect to the ability of NMHC II-A to replace NMHC II-B and rescue the defects in mouse brains and hearts in NM II-B ablated mice. We showed that NMHC II-A can rescue hydrocephalus by restoring the integrity of the cells lining the spinal canal but, in most cases, cannot rescue either the impaired migration of the facial and pontine neurons or the cardiac defects. Construction of the Targeting Vector—A 5.8-kb genomic fragment containing exon 2 (351 bp), the first coding exon of the NMHC II-B gene, was cloned from a 129/Sv mouse genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for targeting vector construction as described previously (23Tullio A.N. Accili D. Ferrans V.J. Yu Z.-X. Takeda K. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Preston Y.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12407-12412Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged full-length coding region of human NMHC II-A with a poly(A) signal derived from SV40 was inserted into a BamHI site of exon 2 just after the initiating ATG to replace NMHC II-B. This was followed by insertion of a 1.8-kb neomycin resistance cassette in an intron upstream from exon 2 in a 3′-5′ direction for positive selection (see Fig. 1A). A diphtheria toxin cassette was used for negative selection (not shown). Homologous recombination between the SpeI sites results in disruption of the murine NMHC II-B gene by GFP-human NMHC II-A cDNA. During sequencing of the targeting vector, we found five nucleotide changes from the original report for human NMHC II-A that resulted in three conservative changes in amino acid sequence: K778R, an extra Glu residue at 1346, and I1626V. Studies from this laboratory and other investigators showed that these changes have no discernable effects on the properties of NM II-A (18Bao J. Jana S.S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

Generation of Chimeric Mice and Germ Line Transmission of the Mutant Allele—Linearized targeting vector was electroporated into embryonic stem (ES) cells, and clones were selected with G418. Genomic DNA from G418-resistant ES cell clones was extracted and digested with BamHI. The homologous recombinants were identified by an 8.9-kb band (versus a 6.7-kb band for the wild type) using Southern blot analysis with a 5′ external probe from a BamHI-SpeI fragment indicated in Fig. 1A (see Fig. 1B). Three heterozygous ES cell clones, which had undergone homologous recombination, were injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. The resulting chimeric mice were scored for germ line transmission by mating them with female C57BL/6 mice. The genotypes of the progeny were analyzed by Southern blot as described above. Only one of the ES cell clones was transmitted in the germ line. All procedures were conducted using an approved protocol in accordance with the NHLBI Animal Care and Use Committee. Immunoblot Analysis—Lung, brain, and heart samples were snap frozen on dry ice and homogenized with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1% by volume protease inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (Sigma) at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the protein in the supernates was quantitated by Bio-Rad protein assay and analyzed by immunoblotting. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the carboxyl-terminal sequences of human NMHC II-A and II-B and mouse II-C were described previously (6Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S.

Monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Immunoblots were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico (for brain and lung samples) and Super-Signal West Femto (for adult heart samples) Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce). Immunofluorescence Staining—Frozen sections or paraffin-embedded sections were blocked with 4% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used in this study are as follows. Polyclonal antibodies against mouse NMHC II-A (1:500) and human NMHC II-B (1:5000) were characterized previously in our laboratory (33Phillips C.L. Yamakawa K. Adelstein R.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric α-actinin (1:1000; clone EA-53) was from Sigma-Aldrich, and monoclonal antibody against desmin (1:100; clone D33) was from Dako Cytomation (Carpenteria, CA). β-Catenin and N-cadherin were from Invitrogen (1:200). Because the GFP signal could not be visualized in paraffin-embedded tissue or in the adult heart, GFP antibody was used (1:500; Clontech). Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (10 μg/ml) was from Invitrogen. Nuclei in some sections were counterstained with 4′6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The images were collected using a Leica TCS-SP confocal microscope. Histological Analysis—For histological analysis, fresh tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and 5-10-μm-thick paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In some cases, the heart sections were stained with Masson's trichrome to detect interstitial fibrosis. Flow Cytometric Detection of Cardiac Myocytes—Hearts from E16.5 embryos were harvested, and the cells, including both cardiac and noncardiac cells, were isolated by digestion with 0.05% trypsin, EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min. This digestion was repeated three times, removing the dissociated cells each time. The dissociated cells were filtered through a cell strainer with pore size of 70 μm (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware) and were fixed with 70% ethanol at -20 °C overnight before flow cytometric analysis. An aliquot was removed to determine cell number. The fixed cells were then incubated with monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric α-actinin (1:800; clone EA-53, Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min on ice. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with allophycocyanin-conjugated mouse IgG1 (1:100; BD Biosciences Pharmingen) for 30 min on ice followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. One wild-type heart sample incubated with secondary antibody alone functioned as a negative fluorescence control. Cells were analyzed using a BD FACS-Calibur system (BD Biosciences). Light scattered gates were set to exclude debris. The gates to distinguish positive and negative staining were established by staining with secondary antibody alone in a wild-type sample in each experiment. Echocardiographic Analysis—Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed on both B+/B+ and Ba*/Ba* mice. The investigators were blinded to genotypes. The echocardiograms were performed using an Acuson Sequoia 256c imaging system with a 15-MHz transducer. Left ventricular size, function, and wall motion were assessed using two-dimensional and m-mode echo modalities. All images were taken from the left ventricular short view at the papillary muscle level. All left ventricular measurements were performed from the m-mode. The measurements were performed off line using Prosolv Version 3.0 software. Three measurements were performed for each parameter and then averaged. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Heart samples were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA from each heart sample was prepared using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and reverse transcription was carried out using total RNA as described previously (18Bao J. Jana S.S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19594-19599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on a Chromo4 fluorescence detector (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR mixture contained 0.4 μm forward and reverse primers in a total volume of 50 μl. Amplification included one cycle of 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. A melting curve was used to identify a temperature where only the relevant amplified product, and not primer dimers, accounted for the SYBR Green-bound fluorescence. All the values were normalized to the mRNA expression levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The primer sequences used in this study are as follows: atrial natriuretic factor: forward 5′-3′ ACGCCAGCATGGGCTCCTTCTCC, reverse 5′-3′ GCTGTTATCTTCGGTACCGGAAG; brain natriuretic factor: forward 5′-3′ AAGCTGCTGGAGCTGATAAGA, reverse 5′-3′ GTTACAGCCCAAACGACTGAC; α-cardiac myosin heavy chain: forward 5′-3′ GAATGGCAAGACGGTGACTGTGA, reverse 5′-3′ CCTCTTAGTGTTGACAGTCT; β-cardiac myosin heavy chain: forward 5′-3′ CCAGAAGAGAAGAACTCCAT, reverse 5′-3′ ACTTTGAGTCTAGGATGGCA; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: forward 5′-3′ ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC, reverse 5′-3′ TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA. Expression and Distribution of GFP-NMHC II-A in Ba*/Ba* Mice—We disrupted the NMHC II-B gene with cDNA encoding NMHC II-A, thereby placing II-A under the control of the endogenous NMHC II-B promoter (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1, A and B). The absence of NMHC II-B was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of lung, heart, and brain tissues from 3-month-old homozygous mice, demonstrating that NMHC II-B expression was ablated from the Ba*/Ba* mice (Fig. 2A, top panel). Expression of GFP-NMHC II-A (GFP-II-A) was detected in all these tissues along with endogenous NMHC II-A using an antibody to NMHC II-A (Fig. 2A, second panel from top) and an antibody to GFP (Fig. 2A, middle panel). NMHC II-C expression was unchanged in these mice. We also carried out experiments to quantify the expression of GFP-NMHC II-A in Ba*/Ba* mice by generating mice that express GFP-NMHC II-B as a fusion protein, again using homologous recombination. 4J. Bao and R. S. Adelstein, unpublished data. This also allowed us to monitor any potential adverse effects of GFP on the organs expressing a fusion protein of GFP-NMHC II. We generated these BGFP/BGFP mice by inserting GFP into the II-B gene in the first coding exon just after the translational start site. Importantly these mice express the same amounts of NM II-B as B+/B+ mice. Using these mice and the Ba*/Ba* mice, we quantified the expression of GFP-NMHC II-B and GFP-NMHC II-A using an antibody to GFP. Quantitation of immunoblot analyses revealed that the expression of GFP-NMHC II-A in the hearts and lungs of the Ba*/Ba* mice was about 80% of the expression found for GFP-NMHC II-B in the BGFP/BGFP mice (see Fig. 2B) confirming that GFP-NM II-A was being expressed in Ba*/Ba* mice at or near physiological levels of NM II-B expression in wild-type mice. These quantitative data also suggest that the abnormalities found in the cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells of the Ba*/Ba* mice are not due to excessive over- or underexpression of NMHC II-A (see below). Moreover there was no phenotypic difference between the BGFP/BGFP mice and B+/B+ mice, showing that the fusion of GFP and myosin II was not toxic to mouse tissues. Studies using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of E16.5 paraffin-embedded heart sections of Ba*/Ba* mice confirmed the absence of NMHC II-B expression in the cardiac myocytes as well as the non-myocytes in the heart (Fig. 3G). The figure also shows the presence of GFP-NMHC II-A in both cell types of the Ba*/Ba* heart (Fig. 3I). Desmin, which is only present in the cardiac myocytes, was used to distinguish the myocytes from the non-myocytes (Fig. 3, B, E, and H; compare with C and F). Desmin staining and the staining of GFP-NMHC II-A using an antibody to GFP confirmed the presence of NMHC II-A in the cardiac myocytes of Ba*/Ba* hearts (Fig. 3, H and I). Note that wild-type hearts (B+/B+) do not contain NMHC II-A in the cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3, A and C; and Refs. 24Takeda K. Kishi H. Ma X. Yu Z.X. Adelstein R.S. Circ.

Replacement of NMHC II-B by II-A was also seen in the developing brain (Fig. 3, J-M) as well as the lungs and skin, 5X. Ma and R. S. Adelstein, unpublished observation. organs that normally express both NMHC II-A and II-B. As shown in Fig. 3J, the B+/B+ 4-day-old brain was enriched for NMHC II-B with NMHC II-A mostly confined to the vasculature (Fig. 3L). In Ba*/Ba* mice, NMHC II-B was absent from the brain (Fig. 3K) and was replaced by NMHC II-A (Fig. 3M). Taken together, these results confirm that NMHC II-A expression is under the control of the endogenous NMHC II-B promoter in the Ba*/Ba* mice. Some F2 Ba*/Ba* Mice Survive Embryonic Lethality—Our previous studies showed that 100% of the NMHC II-B knockout mice (B-/B-) died between E14.5 and birth (23Tullio A.N. Accili D. Ferrans V.J. Yu Z.-X. Takeda K. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Preston Y.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12407-12412Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Takeda K. Kishi H. Ma X.

Of note is that heterozygous (B+/Ba*) mice were no different from B+/B+ mice with respect to survival and phenotype. We also examined the hearts from B+/Ba* mice at ages 3, 6, and 12 months by echocardiography and histology (n ≥ 4 for each). We found no evidence for abnormalities in any of these hearts. Whereas most of the Ba*/Ba* mice generated from F1 generation matings of B+/Ba* mice died during embryonic development"
https://openalex.org/W2040741653,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are important mediators of innate immunity that act mainly through secretion of interferon (IFN)-alpha. Previous studies have found that these cells can suppress HIV in vitro; additionally, pDCs have been shown to be severely reduced in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals. In the present study, we sought to determine the ability of pDCs to directly suppress viral replication ex vivo and to delineate the potential mechanisms whereby pDCs are depleted in HIV-infected individuals. We demonstrate that activated pDCs strongly suppress HIV replication in autologous CD4(+) T cells via a mechanism involving IFN-alpha as well as other antiviral factors. Of note, unstimulated pDCs from infected individuals who maintain low levels of plasma viremia without antiretroviral therapy were able to suppress HIV ex vivo via a mechanism requiring cell-to-cell contact. Our data also demonstrate that death of pDCs by both apoptosis and necrosis is induced by fusion of HIV with pDCs. Taken together, our data suggest that pDCs play an important role in the control of HIV replication and that high levels of viral replication in vivo are associated with pDC cell death via apoptosis and necrosis. Elucidation of the mechanism by which pDCs suppress HIV replication in vivo may have clinically relevant implications for future therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2026207526,"Background Biogeographic models partition ecologically similar species assemblages into discrete ecoregions. However, the history, relationship and interactions between these regions and their assemblages have rarely been explored. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we develop a taxon-based approach that explicitly utilises molecular information to compare ecoregion history and status, which we exemplify using a continentally distributed mammalian species: the African bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus). We reveal unprecedented levels of genetic diversity and structure in this species and show that ecoregion biogeographic history better explains the distribution of molecular variation than phenotypic similarity or geography. We extend these data to explore ecoregion connectivity, identify core habitats and infer ecological affinities from them. Conclusions/Significance This analysis defines 28 key biogeographic regions for sub-Saharan Africa, and provides a valuable framework for the incorporation of genetic and biogeographic information into a more widely applicable model for the conservation of continental biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2013349788,"The functional capabilities of one of the smallest subfamilies of ATP-binding cassette transporters from Arabidopsis thaliana, the AtATMs, are described. Designated AtATM1, AtAATM2, and AtATM3, these half-molecule ABC proteins are homologous to the yeast mitochondrial membrane protein ATM1 (ScATM1), which is clearly implicated in the export of mitochondrially synthesized iron/sulfur clusters. Yeast ATM1-deficient (atm1) mutants grow very slowly (have a petite phenotype), are respiration-deficient, accumulate toxic levels of iron in their mitochondria, and show enhanced compensatory high affinity iron uptake. Of the three Arabidopsis ATMs, AtATM3 bears the closest functional resemblance to ScATM1. Heterologously expressed AtATM3 is not only able to complement the yeast atm1 petite phenotype but is also able to suppress the constitutively high capacity for high affinity iron uptake associated with loss of the chromosomal copy of ScATM1, abrogate intra-mitochondrial iron hyperaccumulation, and restore mitochondrial respiratory function and cytochrome c levels. By comparison, AtATM1 only weakly suppresses the atm1 phenotype, and AtATM2 exerts little or no suppressive action but instead is toxic when expressed in this system. The differences between AtATM3 and AtATM1 are maintained after exchanging their target peptides, and these proteins as well as AtATM2 colocalize with the mitochondrial fluor MitoTracker Red when expressed in yeast as GFP fusions. Although its toxicity when heterologously expressed in yeast, except when fused with GFP, precludes the functional analysis of native AtATM2, a common function, mitochondrial export of Fe/S clusters or their precursors for the assembly of cytosolic Fe/S proteins, is inferred for AtATM3 and AtATM1.

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 5The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NBF, nucleotide-binding fold; ORF, open reading frame; TMD, transmembrane domain; TP, targeting peptide; RT, reverse transcription. protein superfamily is one of the largest protein families known, and many but not all are membrane proteins (“ABC transporters”) competent in the transport of a broad range of materials across membranes. ABC proteins are designated as such, because each possesses one or two ATP-binding cassettes or nucleotide binding folds (NBFs) sharing 30-40% identity between family members and one or more transmembrane domains (TMDs) (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Each NBF encompasses ∼200 amino acid residues and contains three idiotypic sequence motifs. These are a Walker A box and Walker B box separated by ∼120 amino acid residues and an ABC signature (alias C) motif situated between the two Walker boxes (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). The NBFs catalyze ATP hydrolysis, whereas the TMDs, each of which contains multiple transmembrane spans, mediate solute transport across the phospholipid bilayer (or from one leaflet of the bilayer to the other). A feature of ABC transporters, evident from a survey of the superfamily, is their modular construction. The four core domains or modules, two NBFs and two TMDs, may be expressed as separate polypeptides or as multidomain proteins (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). In some transporters (e.g. many of those from bacterial sources), the four domains reside on different polypeptides (“quarter molecules”). In others the domains are fused in various combinations as half-molecules (NBF-TMD) or full molecules (NBF1-TMD1-NBF2-TMD2 or the reverse). Plants are a particularly rich source of ABC proteins. For instance, the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) each contain in excess of 120 ORFs for ABC proteins (2Sánchez-Fernández R. Davies T.G.E. Coleman J.O.D. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3Garcia O. Bouige P. Forestier C. Dassa E. J. Mol.

With only a few exceptions, these proteins, which fall into 12 or more subfamilies, pose a challenge, because many of the subfamilies contain upward of 13 members. One of the few exceptions is the AtATM (A. thaliana“ABC transporter of the mitochondrion” homolog) subfamily of forward orientation half-molecule ABC transporters. It contains only three ORFs: two that are immediately adjacent to each other on chromosome IV (AtATM1 and AtATM2) and one other on chromosome V (AtATM3) (2Sánchez-Fernández R. Davies T.G.E.

To date, only one ORF in rice (3024.m00134) and two in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) (Eugene 3.00131305 and Genewise1-v1.C_LG_XIX2542), all three of which most closely resemble AtATM3, have been assigned to this subfamily in the genomes from other plant sources (3Garcia O. Bouige P. Forestier C. Dassa E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 7R. Sánchez-Fernández and P. A. Rea, unpublished results. The prototypical ATM, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATM (ScATM1), localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (6Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and is inferred to participate in the elaboration of cytosolic iron/sulfur proteins by catalyzing the transport of iron/sulfur centers from the mitochondrial matrix, where they are synthesized, into the cytosol (7Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Deletion of the yeast ATM1 gene yields petite mutants that grow slowly, lack cytochromes, are deficient in respiration, exhibit constitutive activation of high affinity iron uptake across the plasma membrane, and establish anomalously high mitochondrial iron levels (6Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 8Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). 8A. Dancis, unpublished results. Likewise, cellular depletion of ScATM1 by promoter shut-off markedly attenuates cytosolic iron/sulfur enzyme activity while leaving mitochondrial iron/sulfur enzyme activity unaffected (7Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 9Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Google Scholar). In those that have been investigated in sufficient detail, albeit indirectly, a basic equivalence of function among the ATMs from different eukaryotes has been demonstrated. In humans, two genes are able to functionally complement yeast atm1 mutants. One is HsABC7, mutation of which is responsible for X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (XLSA/A), an iron storage disease associated with mitochondrial hyperaccumulation of this metal (10Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The other is HsMTABC3, which has been mapped to the same segment of chromosome 2 as the locus for lethal neonatal metabolic syndrome, a mitochondrial disorder that is also associated with mitochondrial iron hyperaccumulation (11Mitsuhashi N. Miki T. Senbongi H. Yokoi N. Yano H. Miyazaki M. Nakajima N. Iwanaga T. Yokoyama Y. Shibata T. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17536-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In plants, specifically Arabidopsis, AtATM3 (alias STA1, the starik1 gene product), whose deficiency causes pronounced dwarfism and chlorosis (12Babiychuk E. Fuangthong M. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Kushnir S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12722-12727Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), is also implicated in the transport of iron/sulfur clusters as well as tolerance toward heavy metals (14Kim D-Y. Bovet L. Kushnir S. Noh E.W. Martinoia E. Lee Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar). AtATM3 has a mitochondrial localization in planta, complements yeast atm1 mutants, and when ectopically overexpressed enhances cadmium and lead tolerance (13Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Storozhenko S. Davey M.W. Papenbrock J. Rycke R.D. Engler G. Stephan U.W. Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. Montagu M.V. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Kim D-Y. Bovet L. Kushnir S. Noh E.W. Martinoia E. Lee Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar). However, except for one experiment indicating that AtATM1 (alias STA2) only partially suppresses the sta1 phenotype of AtATM3-deficient plants (13Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Storozhenko S. Davey M.W. Papenbrock J. Rycke R.D. Engler G. Stephan U.W. Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. Montagu M.V. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), very little is known of the plant ATMs as a family or of the cellular biochemical basis of the effects they exert. In this paper, we describe the cloning and functional definition of all three members of the Arabidopsis ATM subfamily. In so doing, it is determined that they all target to the mitochondrion when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis or heterologously expressed in yeast but have different catalytic competencies and expression patterns. AtATM3, which is ubiquitously expressed in planta, satisfies all of the requirements of a canonical ATM inclusive of participation in iron transport and the restoration of respiratory function at the level of the electron transport chain in yeast atm1 mutants regardless of the ATM-type targeting peptide with which it is associated. The same applies to AtATM1 but at a lower level in all respects. AtATM2, by contrast, which shows only low levels of expression in planta under standard growth conditions, is toxic except when fused with GFP and exerts little or no suppression of the yeast atm1 phenotype regardless of how the phenotype is monitored. Yeast Strains and Yeast Transformation—S. cerevisiae atm1 mutants were selected from strain CM3262 (MATα, leu2-3,- 112, ura3-52, gcn4-101, his3-609, ino1-13) by screening for small colony size (a petite phenotype) and constitutive high affinity cellular iron uptake as described by Dancis et al. (15Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). After establishing a 2+:2-segregation ratio for the mutants in backcrosses, a tetrad from one of these crosses, designated x392b-4c (MATα, leu2-3,-112, ura3-52, gcn4-101, his3-609, atm1-21), which was shown to be allelic to an atm1 deletion strain provided by Dr. Jonathan Leighton (6Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was employed for the experiments described here. This strain and its isogenic wild-type, CM3262, were maintained in YPD liquid medium (2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, and 1% (w/v) yeast extract). All yeast transformations were performed as described previously (16Lu Y.P. Li Z.S. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8243-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected on complete synthetic drop-out medium lacking uracil (CSM - Ura) (2% (w/v) glucose or galactose, 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.08% (w/v) CSM - Ura (Bio101, Inc.), and 2% (w/v) agar). Cloning of AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3—The cDNAs corresponding to AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3 were cloned by PCR amplification. Total RNA was isolated from 15-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings that had been grown in standard liquid MS medium, in the case of AtATM1 and AtATM3, or in liquid MS medium containing 50 μm CdCl2, in the case of AtATM2, using TriZol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA was synthesized from the RNA extracts using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Invitrogen). All of the PCR amplifications were performed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase with proofreading activity (Stratagene). The gene-specific primers were designed to add a NotI restriction site at the 5′-end of the gene and a BamHI restriction site at the 3′-end. The primer combinations were AtATM1-F and AtATM1-R for AtATM1, AtATM2-F and AtATM2-R for AtATM2, and AtATM3-F and AtATM3-R for AtATM3 (Table 1). The thermal profile used for PCR was as follows: 1 min at 94 °C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C. For heterologous expression in yeast, the amplified AtATM1 and AtATM3 cDNAs were subcloned into the multiple cloning site between the constitutive PGK (3-phosphoglycerate kinase) gene promoter and CYC1 (cytochrome c1 gene) termination sequences of the Escherichia coli-yeast shuttle vector pYES3 (16Lu Y.P. Li Z.S. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8243-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because of its toxicity in both E. coli and yeast when subcloned into pYES3, the amplified cDNA for AtATM2 was first cloned into NotI and BamHI double-digested pBluescript and then into pYES2 (Stratagene), the equivalent of pYES3 but containing the galactose-inducible yeast GAL1 gene promoter instead of the PGK gene promoter. The fidelity of the pYES3-AtATM1, pYES2-AtATM2, and pYES3-AtATM3 constructs was established by sequencing.TABLE 1Sequences of PCR primers used in these investigationsPrimer nameSequenceAtATM1-FTTA AGC GGC CGC ATG ATG AGG GGA TCT CAtATM1-RTAT AGG ATC CTC ACA CCT CCA GTG TAC TGTAtATM2-FTTA AGC GGC CGC ATG ATG GAG TTT CTC AAAtATM2-RTAT AGG ATC CTC ACA CCT CCA ATT TAC TGTAtATM3-FATT AGC GGC CGC ATG TCG AGA GGA TCT CGA TTC GTTAtATM3-RGGG AGG ATC CCT ATT CCA ATT TGA TAG CTG CAT CAA GAtATM1-Sma(F)ATA CCC GGG CTA TGG ATG AAA GAC AAC CCA GAAAtATM1-Sma(R)ATA CCC GGG ATA GCT TGA AAT CGT GCG GAG GATAtATM3-Sma(F)ATA CCC GGG ACG CTT GCT GGC TAT TTG TGG ATGAtATM3-Sma(R)ATA CCC GGG ACG GAG AAT CTT CAT GTC AGC CATAtATM1-GFP(F)ATT ACC ATG GAT GAT GAG GGG ATC TCG GTT TCT CAtATM1-GFP(R)GCT AAG ATC TAC CTC CAG TGT ACT GTT TTG TTG TGTAtATM2-GFP(F)ATC ACC ATG GAT GAT GAG AGT TTC TCA ACT CCA AAtATM2-GFP(R)GCT ACC ATG GAC ACC TCC AAT TTA CTG TTT TGT TGAtATM3-GFP(F)ATT ACC ATG GAT GTC GAG AGG ATC TCG ATT CGT TAtATM3-GFP(R)GCT AAG ATC TTC CAA TTT GAT AGC TGC ATC AAG CATGFP-Bam(R)CGA AGG ATC CTC ACA CGT GGT GGT GGT GGT GGT GAtATM3-Pro(F)CGG TGG ATC CTG TTT TAT GGC AGG TTT ATG AAG TTAtATM3-Pro(R)CTT ACC ATG GCC CTT CTT CTC CGA AAG TTT CAC AGAtATM12-(F)TTT CAC AAC ATT CAC TAT GGAtATM1-(R)AAC AGA ACC CAA ACA CTA GCAtATM2-(R)CAA AGT GGC TTT TTG ATT CAAtATM3-(R)AGT GAG GCT CCA GTA CCG GTA GCActin1-FTGG AAC TGG AATGGT TAA GGC TGGActin1-RTCT CCA GAG TCG AGC ACA ATA CCG Open table in a new tab Ectopic Expression and Visualization of AtATM::GFP Fusions in Arabidopsis and Yeast—Using the pYES3-AtATM or pYES2-AtATM constructs described above as templates, the AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3 cDNAs, excluding their stop codons, were PCR-amplified with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The primer combinations were as follows: AtATM1-GFP(F) and AtATM1-GFP(R) for AtATM1, AtATM2-GFP(F) and AtATM2-GFP(R) for AtATM2, and AtATM3-GFP(F) and AtATM3-GFP(R) for AtATM3 (Table 1). After double digestion with NcoI and BglII, the AtATM1 and AtATM3 amplification products were cloned into double-digested binary vector pCAMBRIA1302 (accession number AF234298) to generate an in-frame C-terminal GFP translational fusion. The corresponding amplification product of AtATM2 was digested with NcoI and cloned into the NcoI site of pCAMBIA1302. The fidelity of the constructs, designated pCAMBIA-AtATM1-GFP, pCAM-BIA-AtATM2-GFP, and pCAMBIA-AtATM3-GFP, was confirmed by sequencing. For subcellular localization of the ATM::GFP fusions, the constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C/pGV3850, and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) by the floral dip method was performed as described by Clough and Bent (17Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To select transformants harboring the appropriate ATM::GFP construct, T1 seeds were germinated on MS medium containing 30 μg/ml hygromycin. Homozygous T3 and T4 plants were employed for all of the analyses reported here. The subcellular distributions of the AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3 GFP fusions, specifically their association with mitochondria, was assessed by fluorescence microscopy of the transformants after infiltration with MitoTracker Red. Mito-Tracker Red is a cell-permeant probe that is concentrated by active mitochondria and retained through interaction of its thiol-reactive chloromethyl moiety with intramitochondrial proteins and peptides (Molecular Probes). Ten-day-old seedlings were submerged in MS medium containing 500 nm MitoTracker Red for 20 min, rinsed three times in MS medium minus stain, and examined under a Leica DM IRB fluorescence microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a rhodamine filter and fluorescein filter for the visualization of the MitoTracker Red and GFP fluorescences, respectively. The images collected were exported as TIFF files and further processed using Adobe Photoshop (version 7.0; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). For expression of the ATM::GFP fusions in yeast, the AtATM-GFP insertions of the pCAMBIA-AtATM1-GFP, pCAMBIA-AtATM2-GFP, and pCAMBIA-AtATM3-GFP constructs were amplified by PCR using the forward primers AtATM1-F, AtATM2-F, and AtATM3-F, respectively, and the reverse primer GFP-Bam(R) (Table 1). After double digestion with NotI and BamHI, the amplification products were subcloned into pYES3 and, after confirmation of the fidelity of the constructs by sequencing, transformed into yeast strain CM3262 for selection on CSM - Ura solid medium. For fluorescence microscopy, the transformants were inoculated into CSM - Ura liquid medium, grown at 30 °C overnight at 245 rpm, pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and rinsed once with water. The cells were stained for 45 min with 100 nm Mitotracker Red dissolved in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5% (w/v) glucose and rinsed in the same medium minus dye for 15 min before fluorescence microscopy as described above. RT-PCR of AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3—For RT-PCR analyses of the tissue specificity of expression of AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3, poly(A) RNA was isolated from fully expanded rosette leaves, flowers, roots, stems, siliques, and cauline leaves of 21-day-old Arabidopsis plants using a MicroPoly(A)Pure Kit (Ambion). Twenty-ng aliquots of the poly(A) samples were reverse-transcribed and subjected to PCR as described by Hansen et al. (18Hansen C.H. Wittstock U. Olsen C.E. Hick A.J. Pickett J.A. Halkier B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using the gene-specific primers AtATM12-(F) and AtATM1-(R) for AtATM1, AtATM12-(F) and AtATM2-(R) for AtATM2, and AtATM3-F and AtATM3-(R) for AtATM3 (Table 1). To verify that equivalent amounts of RNA had been amplified, the same RNA samples were also subjected to RT-PCR using primers Actin1-F and Actin1-R (Table 1) for Arabidopsis Actin-8, a constitutively expressed gene. The thermal profile used for PCR was as follows: 2 min at 94 °C; 28 cycles for the AtATMs or 23 cycles for Actin-8 of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. All of the RT-PCRs were done in triplicate, and the PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gels were documented using a Kodak DC120 EDAK gel imager (Eastman Kodak Co.). Exchange of Putative Targeting Peptides of AtATM1 and AtATM3—The coding sequences corresponding to the putative N-terminal targeting peptides (TPs) of AtATM1 (270 bp) and AtATM3 (375 bp) were identified using SignalP (available on the World Wide Web) and PCR-amplified from pYES3-AtATM1 and pYES3-AtATM3, using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase and the primer combinations AtATM1-F and AtATM1-Sma(R) and AtATM3-F and AtATM3-Sma(R), respectively (Table 1). After double digestion with NotI and SmaI, the PCR fragments were cloned into pYES3 to yield the constructs pYES3-TP1 and pYES3-TP3. To generate pYES3 derivatives encoding TP1-AtATM1, TP3-AtATM1, TP1-AtATM3, or TP3-AtATM3, the AtATM1 and AtATM3 genes lacking their endogenous putative targeting peptides were amplified by PCR using the primer combination AtATM1-Sma(F) and AtATM1-R and the combination AtATM3-Sma(F) and AtATM3-R (Table 1), respectively. The constructs designated pYES3-TP1-AtATM1, pYES3-TP1-AtATM3, pYES3-TP3-AtATM1, and pYES3-TP3-AtATM3 were generated by double digesting the PCR products with SmaI and BamHI and cloning them into double-digested pYES3-TP1 or pYES3-TP3 as appropriate. The fidelity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Measurement of High Affinity Iron Uptake by Intact Yeast Cells—For the measurements of high affinity iron uptake by intact yeast cells, 96-well microtiter plates containing 100 μl of YPD medium/well were inoculated with triplicate samples of pYES-, pYES3-AtATM1-, or pYES3-AtATM3-transformed yeast atm1 strain x392b-4c or wild-type strain CM3262 and grown at 30 °C for 12 h. The cultures were then diluted 1:10 into 50 μl of YPD in a fresh microtiter plate and incubated for a further 3 h under the same conditions before initiating uptake by the addition of 50 μl of a solution containing 4 mg/ml sodium ascorbate, 5% (w/v) glucose, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, and 1.0 μm radioactive iron (55FeCl3; 37-50 mCi/mg total iron). After uptake for 2 h, cell density was estimated by measuring the OD720 nm of each well in an EL800 microplate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, Winooski, VT), and the suspensions were vacuum-filtered using a PHD harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). The vacuum filters were washed four times with water, and the radioactivity retained was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Iron uptake was enumerated as accumulation in pmol/OD720 nm/h after calibration against 55Fe standards of known radiospecific activity. Measurement of Yeast Mitochondrial Iron Accumulation—For the measurements of mitochondrial iron uptake by yeast atm1 mutant strain x392b-4c after transformation with pYES3, pYES3-AtATM1, pYES2-AtATM2, pYES3-AtATM3, pYES3-AtATM1-GFP, pYES3-AtATM2-GFP or pYES3-AtATM3-GFP, and wild-type strain CM3262 after transformation with pYES3, the transformants were grown in CSM - Ura liquid medium containing 1 μm copper sulfate and 2 μm ferric ammonium sulfate at 30 °C to an A600 nm of 0.2 before 4-fold dilution of the cultures into the same medium containing the appropriate carbon source (15Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Glucose (2% (w/v)) was the carbon source in all cases except for the pYES2-AtATM2/x392n-4c transformants, which were grown in media containing raffinose (1% (w/v)) and galactose (1% (w/v)) instead of glucose. To initiate iron uptake, 0.2 μm 55FeCl3 (37-50 mCi/mg) was added to the media, and the cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 h, after which time the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and their mitochondria were purified as described by Murakami et al. (19Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial 55Fe content was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. Measurements of Respiratory Competence and Mitochondrial Cytochrome Content—Mitochondrial respiratory competence was assessed by the tetrazolium overlay technique for the identification of respiration-deficient yeast (20Ogur M. John R.S. Nagai S. Science. 1957; 125: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Aliquots of liquid growth medium containing ∼30 or 1000 cells from cultures of pYES3-, pYES3-AtATM1-, pYES2-AtATM2-, or pYES3-AtATM3-transformed atm1 x392b-4c cells or from pYES3-transformed wild-type CM3262 cells were spotted onto the appropriate selective medium, grown for 3 days at 30 °C, and overlaid with 0.1% (w/v) 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. After incubation for 3 h, the overlays were photographed. Mitochondrial cytochrome content was assessed by both difference spectrophotometry and Western analysis. In the former case, reduced minus oxidized difference spectra from ∼800-μg aliquots of mitochondria purified from pYES3-, pYES3-AtATM1-, pYES2-AtATM2-, or pYES3-AtATM3-transformed atm1 x392b-4c cells or from pYES3-transformed wild-type CM3262 cells were recorded. The mitochondrial suspensions in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 were first oxidized with potassium ferricyanide and then reduced with potassium dithionite for difference spectrophotometry. In the case of the Western analyses, the mitochondrial suspensions from the same controls and transformants were subjected to denaturation, SDS-PAGE, electrotransfer, and reaction with polyclonal antibody raised against yeast cytochrome c (a gift from Dr. Debkumar Pain) or monoclonal antibody raised against yeast mitochondrial porin (Molecular Probes). The blots were probed with mitochondrial porin to verify that equivalent amounts of total mitochondrial protein had been loaded and electrotransferred in each case. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL using a SuperSignal System (Pierce). Chemicals—All of the general reagents were obtained from Fisher, Research Organics, Inc., and Sigma. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3—There are three ORFs, designated AtATM1, AtATM2, and AtATM3, in the genome of Arabidopsis capable of encoding proteins bearing a close similarity to S. cerevisiae ATM1 (ScATM1) (2Sánchez-Fernández R. Davies T.G.E. Coleman J.O.D. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Two of these, AtATM1 and AtATM2, map to within 582 bp of each other on chromosome IV (5Rea P.A. Sánchez-Fernández R. Chen S.X. Peng M. Klein M. Martinoia E. Holland B.I. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. 2003: 335-355Google Scholar). The other, AtATM3, maps to a portion of chromosome V that is otherwise devoid of ABC protein ORFs (5Rea P.A. Sánchez-Fernández R. Chen S.X. Peng M. Klein M. Martinoia E. Holland B.I. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. 2003: 335-355Google Scholar). For the investigations described here, the coding sequences for all three of these genes were cloned by RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from 15-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in standard liquid MS medium (AtATM1 and AtATM3) or MS medium containing 50 μm CdCl2 (AtATM2). In the first instance, all three PCR clones were subcloned into pYES3 vector under control of the PGK promoter (16Lu Y.P. Li Z.S. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8243-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) for constitutive heterologous expression in yeast. Subsequently, however, because constitutively expressed pYES3-borne AtATM2 was found to be toxic in E. coli and yeast, this PCR clone was subcloned into pBluescript for secondary cloning into pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) for expression from the galactose-inducible yeast GAL1 promoter instead of the constitutive PGK promoter. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the AtATMs against those of rep"
https://openalex.org/W1999800830,"A gene encoding an alditol oxidase was found in the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). This newly identified oxidase, AldO, was expressed at extremely high levels in Escherichia coli when fused to maltose-binding protein. AldO is a soluble monomeric flavoprotein with subunits of 45.1 kDa, each containing a covalently bound FAD cofactor. From sequence alignments with other flavoprotein oxidases, it was found that AldO contains a conserved histidine (His46) that is typically involved in covalent FAD attachment. Covalent FAD binding is not observed in the H46A AldO mutant, confirming its role in covalent attachment of the flavin cofactor. Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that wild-type AldO is active with several polyols. The alditols xylitol (Km = 0.32 mm, kcat = 13 s–1) and sorbitol (Km = 1.4 mm, kcat = 17 s–1) are the preferred substrates. From pre-steady-state kinetic analyses, using xylitol as substrate, it can be concluded that AldO mainly follows a ternary complex kinetic mechanism. Reduction of the flavin cofactor by xylitol occurs at a relatively high rate (99 s–1), after which a second kinetic event is observed, which is proposed to represent ring closure of the formed aldehyde product, yielding the hemiacetal of d-xylose. Reduced AldO readily reacts with molecular oxygen (1.7 × 105 m–1 s–1), which confirms that the enzyme represents a true flavoprotein oxidase.

The alditols xylitol (Km = 0.32 mm, kcat = 13 s–1) and sorbitol (Km = 1.4 mm, kcat = 17 s–1) are the preferred substrates. From pre-steady-state kinetic analyses, using xylitol as substrate, it can be concluded that AldO mainly follows a ternary complex kinetic mechanism. Reduction of the flavin cofactor by xylitol occurs at a relatively high rate (99 s–1), after which a second kinetic event is observed, which is proposed to represent ring closure of the formed aldehyde product, yielding the hemiacetal of d-xylose. Reduced AldO readily reacts with molecular oxygen (1.7 × 105 m–1 s–1), which confirms that the enzyme represents a true flavoprotein oxidase. Carbohydrate oxidases are highly valuable biocatalysts for analytical and synthetic purposes. Chemical methods cannot compete with the exquisite regio- and/or enantioselectivity by which these enzymes oxidize polyols. Applications in which carbohydrate oxidases are used are, for example, biosensors for blood sugar, synthetic routes toward chiral building blocks, sweeteners, and flavors. Oxidase-mediated catalysis also leads to formation of hydrogen peroxide, a property that is used in a number of applications, such as bleaching processes and waste-water treatment (1van Hellemond E.W. Leferink N.G. Heuts D.P. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 17-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Xu F. Golightly E.J. Fuglsang C.C. Schneider P. Duke K.R. Lam L. Christensen S. Brown K.M. Jorgensen C.T. Brown S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At present, only a limited number of carbohydrate oxidases have been identified, which restricts the biocatalytic exploitation of this class of redox enzymes. The best known representative is glucose oxidase, which in fact is the most widely applied redox enzyme. Besides galactose oxidase, which contains copper as cofactor, all presently known oxidases acting on carbohydrates contain a flavin cofactor. Examples of such flavoprotein oxidases are glucose oxidase, l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, xylitol oxidase, hexose oxidase, lactose oxidase, glucooligosaccharide oxidase, and pyranose oxidase. Except for glucose oxidase and pyranose oxidase, all of these oxidases belong to a specific group of flavoproteins, the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) 2The abbreviations used are: VAO, vanillyl-alcohol oxidase; MBP, maltosebinding protein; m-AldO, MBP fused to AldO; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: VAO, vanillyl-alcohol oxidase; MBP, maltosebinding protein; m-AldO, MBP fused to AldO; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. family. Members of this family share a similar overall structure consisting of two domains (3Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J. Benen J.A. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One domain binds the adenine part of the FAD cofactor and is called the FAD-binding domain, whereas the other, called the cap domain, covers the isoalloxazine moiety of the cofactor and forms the major part of the active site around the isoalloxazine ring system. A special feature of this flavoprotein family is the fact that a relatively large number of VAO members bind the FAD cofactor in a covalent manner. This is also the case for all of the above mentioned VAO-type carbohydrate oxidases. In fact, the recent elucidation of the structure of glucooligosaccharide oxidase has revealed the first example where a flavin cofactor is covalently linked to two amino acid residues (4Huang C.H. Lai W.L. Lee M.H. Chen C.J. Vasella A. Tsai Y.C. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38831-38838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a covalent FAD-protein linkage can have a significant effect on the redox behavior of the flavin cofactor (e.g. increasing the redox potential) (5Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H. van Berkel W.J. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This is in line with the observation that most VAO-type covalent flavoproteins act as an oxidase (6Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Weber R. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 881-886Google Scholar). In these cases, the FAD cofactor is typically tethered to a histidine residue, and this linking histidine can be readily identified by sequence motif recognition. Hence, the ability to identify covalent VAO homologs by sequence analysis can be used as a tool to find novel oxidase genes. Most of the characterized carbohydrate oxidases have been isolated from fungi, whereas only two from bacterial origin have been described (7Yamashita M. Omura H. Okamoto E. Furuya Y. Yabuuchi M. Fukahi K. Murooka Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2000; 89: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Hiraga K. Kitazawa M. Kaneko N. Oda K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1699-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we describe the discovery and characterization of an alditol oxidase (AldO) from the actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). We identified the putative aldo gene (SCO6147) in the genome sequence of this bacterium by searching for VAO homologs. The predicted protein sequence of AldO contains a histidine that is expected to form a covalent FAD-histidyl linkage. Therefore, it was anticipated that the protein would have a high probability to exhibit oxidase activity. In this report, we show that the enzyme is indeed a typical flavoprotein oxidase active on a number of alditols. By expressing the enzyme fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP), impressive amounts of alditol oxidase could be produced, enabling a detailed biochemical and kinetic characterization of this novel bacterial oxidase. Chemicals and Restriction Enzymes—Restriction enzymes were obtained from Roche Applied Science and New England Biolabs. Escherichia coli TOP10-competent cells, the TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing, and the pBAD/Myc-His A vector were obtained from Invitrogen. VAO (EC 1.1.3.38) was a kind gift from Dr. W. J. H. van Berkel (Wageningen University, The Netherlands). Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.2.3.2) was obtained from Stratagene. Horseradish peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) was obtained from Fluka. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cloning and Expression of the aldo Gene—The aldo genes were cloned into pBADNdeI and pBAD-MBP for expression. The latter is a pBADNdeI-derived vector in which the malE gene, including a Factor Xa protease cleavage site from pMAL-c2x, is inserted (NdeI-HindIII). The aldo gene from S. coelicolor A3(2) was amplified from genomic DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase. The following primers were used for cloning into pBADNdeI: Scoel_fw (5′-CTCCATATGAGCGACATCACGGTCACCC; NdeI site is underlined) and Scoel_rv (5′-TATAAGCTTGCCCGCGAGCACCCCGCGCAC; HindIII site is underlined). The following primers were used for cloning into pBAD-MBP: XOmbp_fw (5′-CTCGAATTCATGAGCGACATCACGGTC; EcoRI site is underlined) and XOmbp_rv (5′-TATCTGCAGTCAGCCCGCGAGCACCCC; PstI site is underlined, and the stop codon is in italic type). The aldo gene (KradDRAFT_2777) from Kineococcus radiotolerans was amplified from whole cells using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The following primers were used for cloning into pBADNdeI: kinrad_fw (5′-CTCCATATGAGCACCTCGACGACGTCGTCC; NdeI site is underlined) and kinrad_rv (5′-TATAAGCTTGGCGGTCAGCCCGACCCGGTC; HindIII site is underlined). The following primers were used for cloning into pBAD-MBP: kinrad_fwmbp (5′-CTCGAATTCGTGAGCACCTCGACGACGTCG; EcoRI site is underlined) and kinrad_rvmbp (5′-TATCTGCAGTCAGGCGGTCAGCCCGACCCG; PstI site is underlined, and the stop codon is in italic type). To facilitate TOPO cloning, 3′A-overhangs were generated by incubating the amplified aldo genes with 1 μl of Taq DNA polymerase at 72 °C for 15 min. For pBADNdeI cloning, the TOPO-aldo clones were digested with NdeI and HindIII, after which the aldo DNA was isolated from an agarose gel. The fragments were subsequently ligated into an NdeI- and HindIII-digested pBADNdeI vector, yielding pBAD-aldo(krad) and pBAD-aldo. For pBAD-MBP cloning, the TOPO-aldo clones were digested with EcoRI and PstI, after which the aldo genes were isolated from an agarose gel. The aldo genes were subsequently ligated into an EcoRI- and PstI-digested pBAD-MBP vector, yielding pBAD-MBP-aldo(krad) and pBAD-MBP-aldo. E. coli TOP10 cells were transformed with the constructed expression vectors and grown at 17 °C for 3 days in terrific broth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.02% (w/v) l-arabinose. Induction of pBAD-aldo(krad) and pBAD-aldo clones yielded AldO containing a 25-amino acid C-terminal extension consisting of a c-Myc epitope and a His6 tag. Induction of pBAD-MBP-aldo(krad) and pBAD-MBP-aldo clones yielded MBP-AldO fusion proteins containing a Factor Xa protease cleavage site. Purification of MBP-AldO—Cells from three 0.5-liter cultures were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm KPi buffer (pH 7.5). The cells were disrupted by sonication and subsequently centrifuged at 23,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was divided into two 20-ml aliquots to prevent overloading during the purification procedure. After loading the supernatant onto a Q-Sepharose column, the column was washed until the A280 was lower than 0.05. MBP-AldO was eluted by applying a 0–1 m KCl linear gradient. The yellow fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon stirred cell and YM-30 membrane (Millipore). To remove KCl from the concentrated enzyme solution, it was loaded onto a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical Methods—All experiments were performed at 25 °C and in a 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.5. The S.D. value in the experiments is 5%, unless stated otherwise. Oxidase activity and steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by coupling the production of H2O2 by (m-)AldO to a horseradish peroxidase-mediated oxidation of 4-aminoantipyrine and 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. This results in formation of a pink to purple colored product, which can be measured at 515 nm (∊515 = 26 mm–1 cm–1) (9Federico R. Angelini R. Ercolini L. Venturini G. Mattevi A. Ascenzi P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, 1 mm 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, 3 units of horseradish peroxidase, and 15 nm AldO or m-AldO. The extinction coefficient of m-AldO was determined by comparing the absorption spectra before and after incubation with 0.1% SDS. For this, it was assumed that the flavin spectrum of the unfolded m-AldO was equal to that of free FAD (∊ of 11.3 mm–1 cm–1 at 450 nm) (10de Jong E. van Berkel W.J. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For product identification, the conversion of xylitol by m-AldO was followed by HPLC analysis using a Shodex SUGAR SP0810 (8.0-mm inner diameter × 300 mm) column. Optical rotation of the product was determined by polarimetric analysis using a Schmidt and Haensch Polartronic MH8 apparatus. Redox potentials were measured by using the method described by Massey (11Massey V. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, New York1991: 59-68Google Scholar). A cuvette containing m-AldO (5–10 μm), xanthine (400 μm), KCl (107 μm), benzyl or methyl viologen (2.0 μm), and redox dye (5–16 μm) was made anaerobic by flushing with argon. Under a constant flow of argon, 68 nm xanthine oxidase was added, and spectra were collected every 2.5 min during reduction using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda Bio 10 spectrophotometer. Kinetic Measurements—Pre-steady-state studies were performed with an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus, model SX17MV. Spectral data were collected at time intervals of 2.5 ms using a diode array detector. A photomultiplier detector was applied to follow single wavelength traces in time. Spectral data obtained by diode array measurements were deconvoluted using the program Pro-K of Applied Photophysics. From the deconvoluted spectra, several wavelengths were selected to study the observed phases individually. The first two phases of the reductive half-reaction were monitored by following the absorption at 320 and 405 nm, respectively, after anaerobically mixing the enzyme solution with varying concentrations of xylitol. The first phase was monitored at 320 nm, because here the second and third phase showed no change in absorbance, whereas 405 nm is an isosbestic point in the first phase enabling analysis of the second phase. The third phase was monitored at 452 nm. The oxidative half-reaction was followed at 452 nm by mixing a solution containing reduced enzyme with a solution containing either 0.25 or 1.25 mm oxygen (in the presence or absence of 100 mm d-xylose). For anoxic conditions, all solutions contained 1.0 mm 4-ethylphenol and were made anaerobic by flushing with nitrogen. VAO was added to a final concentration of 100 nm to remove any residual oxygen. Traces obtained by photomultiplier measurements were fitted to an exponential function (Equation 1), A(t)=A+C×e(-kt)(Eq.1) where A represents absorption, C is a constant, and k is an observed rate constant. The observed rates for substrate concentration dependent reduction of m-AldO were fitted using the following equation (Equation 2). Kobs=Kred×SKd+S(Eq.2) Mechanistic Calculations—Mathematica 5.2 software was used to derive rate equations from the kinetic scheme by the determinant method (12Huang C.Y. Contemporary Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 54-84Google Scholar) (see supplemental materials). The kinetic parameters Km and kcat as well as the redox state during catalysis can be calculated according to the following equations. For a ping-pong mechanism, Km and kcat values can be calculated using Equations 3 and 4. KM=k3k4kdkox,1[O2](k4+k-3)kox,1[O2]+k3(kox1kred[O2]+k4(kred+kox,1[O2]))(Eq.3) Kcat=k3k4kox,1kred[O2](k4+k-3)kox,1kred[O2]+k3(kox1kred[O2]+k4(kred+kox,1[O2]))(Eq.4) For a ternary complex mechanism, Km and kcat values can be calculated using Equations 5 and 6. KM=k3k7kdkox,2[O2]k7kred(k-3+kox,2[O2])+k3(kredkox,2[O2]+k7(kred+kox,2[O2]))(Eq.5) Kcat=k3k7kredkox,2[O2]k7kred(k-3+kox,2[O2])+k3(kredkox,2[O2]+k7(kred+kox,2[O2]))(Eq.6) Expression, Purification, and Biochemical Characterization of AldO—By a PSI-BLAST search for putative oxidases using VAO-type flavoprotein sequences, a gene (SCO6147) from S. coelicolor A3(2) was identified that encodes such a flavoprotein. The protein consists of 418 amino acids with a calculated mass of 44,347 Da (excluding FAD) and therefore represents one of the smallest members in the VAO flavoprotein family. Among the known VAO-type oxidoreductases, it shows highest sequence similarity with xylitol oxidase from another Streptomyces isolate (78% sequence identity) and pig l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase (30% sequence identity). Except for sequence conservation typical for a VAO homolog, no other sequence motifs can be identified, suggesting that it is a cytosolic protein. Alignment of the protein sequence with known VAO-type protein sequences revealed the presence of a histidine residue (His46), which is typically involved in covalent attachment of the FAD cofactor (Fig. 1). Recent papers report on VAO-type oxidases containing a covalently bound FAD attached to two amino acids (4Huang C.H. Lai W.L. Lee M.H. Chen C.J. Vasella A. Tsai Y.C. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38831-38838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Winkler A. Hartner F. Kutchan T.M. Glieder A. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Rand T. Qvist K.B. Walter C.P. Poulsen C.H. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Next to an 8α-N-histidyl link, a second 6-S-cysteinyl linkage to the isoalloxazine moiety of FAD is present in these oxidases. Sequence alignments did not reveal such a conserved cysteine that would be involved in covalent FAD attachment. To verify that the enzyme from S. coelicolor is functional as an oxidase and explore its enzymatic properties, the corresponding gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, cloned, and expressed. For initial expression experiments, the (aldo) gene was subcloned in a pBAD vector. Using the pBAD-aldo expression plasmid, recombinant active AldO was only expressed at a very low level, as observed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The respective protein band is fluorescent at pH 4, indicative of the presence of a covalently bound flavin cofactor (Fig. 2, lanes A and B) (15Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To increase the level of expression, the protein was expressed fused to MBP, since it is known that N-terminal fusion to MBP often boosts expression of soluble protein (16Stevens R.C. Structure. 2000; 8: R177-R185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The resulting pBAD-MBP-aldo vector, linking MBP to the N terminus of AldO, drastically increased the expression level (Fig. 2, lane D). From 1 liter of culture broth, an impressive amount of 350 mg of MBP-AldO was purified by one anion exchange chromatography step. Purified MBP-AldO runs as a single band upon SDS-PAGE at about 87 kDa, which nicely agrees with a calculated mass of 88,068 Da (including FAD). The protein band was again found to be fluorescent at pH 4, indicative of a histidyl-bound FAD cofactor (Fig. 2, lanes C and D). The covalent binding of the flavin cofactor was also confirmed by the observation that upon denaturation of the enzyme, the redox cofactor coprecipitated with the protein, yielding a bright yellow pellet after centrifugation. To test the location of the histidyl-FAD linkage, the H46A mutant was prepared and expressed. The H46A mutant protein was no longer fluorescent after separation by SDS-PAGE. The expression level was comparable with that of the wild type MBP-AldO; however, part of the protein was insoluble. The H46A mutant was purified by anion exchange chromatography in the presence of 100 μm FAD. After purification, the H46A mutant was found not to contain FAD, and also no oxidase activity was observed. This confirms that His46 is crucially involved in covalent FAD binding. To determine whether the fused MBP-AldO protein behaves similar to the native AldO protein, we also prepared AldO without the MBP tag. For this, MBP-AldO was treated with modified trypsin lacking chymotrypsin activity. This yielded the two separate proteins: MBP and AldO. Using amylose resin, MBP could effectively be removed from this mixture. ESI-MS analysis showed that the cleavage had occurred at the expected target site for proteolysis resulting in a homogenous preparation of AldO. The determined mass of 45,665 ± 2 Da corresponds nicely with the expected mass of AldO of 45,663 Da, which includes an N-terminal extension of 4 residues (Ile-Ser-Glu-Phe) that were part of the MBP-AldO linker and one acetate molecule. By gel permeation chromatography, it was confirmed that AldO and MBP-AldO both behave as monomers. The flavin absorbance spectrum (300–650 nm) of AldO prepared by proteolytic cleavage was identical to that of the MBP-tagged AldO. This indicates that the microenvironment of the flavin cofactor is not influenced by the MBP fusion protein. Furthermore, it was found that isolated AldO was reactive with the same range of polyols as found for MBP-AldO (see below). Hence, we conducted all further analyses with the MBP-AldO fusion protein, referred to here as m-AldO. The absorption spectrum of m-AldO shows two absorption maxima at 348 and 452 nm, which are typical for an oxidized flavin cofactor. The relatively low wavelength for the 348 nm absorption maximum is a typical feature of histidyl-bound flavin cofactors (10de Jong E. van Berkel W.J. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of the covalently linked flavin was determined by comparing the absorption spectra of m-AldO before and after treatment with 0.1% SDS (10de Jong E. van Berkel W.J. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). From these spectra, an extinction coefficient for m-AldO was determined: 12.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 452 nm. A common characteristic of flavoproteins acting as an oxidase is the flavin reactivity with sulfite (17Massey V. Muller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L.G. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether m-AldO also exhibits this reactivity, it was titrated with Na2SO3 (Fig. 3, inset). This revealed that the enzyme readily forms a sulfite adduct with a Kd of 59 ± 5 μm. The addition of this nucleophile resulted in the disappearance of the absorbance maxima in the visible area, which is indicative of formation of a flavin N-5 sulfite adduct. It has been suggested that there is also a correlation between oxygen reactivity and the formation of a red anionic semiquinone upon partial reduction of the FAD cofactor (e.g. with a strong white light source) (18Massey V. Hemmerich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5612-5614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FAD cofactor of m-AldO also shows the ability to stabilize the red anionic semiquinone when reduced by light. The appearance of the red anionic semiquinone form of FAD, typified by an intense absorbance band at 380 nm, was also observed during redox potential measurements (Fig. 3, spectrum 3). The redox potential of the flavin in m-AldO was determined by using the xanthine oxidase method (11Massey V. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, New York1991: 59-68Google Scholar). For the oxidized/semiquinone couple, a redox potential (E1) of –4 mV was determined by using methylene blue (+11 mV) as a reference dye, whereas a redox potential (E2) of –213 mV for the semiquinone/reduced couple was determined by using anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (–225 mV). The midpoint redox potential (Em) of m-AldO is –109 mV (Em = (E1 + E2)/2). Substrate Identification and Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—In order to identify substrates for this m-AldO, a large number of potential substrates were tested. The test set of 86 substrates contained a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic amines and alcohols. For activity screening, a generic chromogenic assay was employed in which hydrogen peroxide, inherently formed upon oxidase activity, is used by a peroxidase to form a colored product. The activity screening revealed that only a few polyols are readily accepted as substrate by m-AldO. The alditols sorbitol and xylitol are the best substrates. By HPLC analysis, it was found that m-AldO performs selective oxidation on one of the primary hydroxyl groups of xylitol. Furthermore, polarimetric analysis showed that only d-xylose is formed upon oxidation of xylitol. m-AldO shows the highest catalytic efficiency with xylitol (Table 1). Although a similar kcat is observed with sorbitol, the Km value with this polyol is almost 5 times higher than with xylitol. Steady-state experiments were also performed with 1.25 mm O2, which resulted in a 1.5-fold increase of both kcat and Km. The observed kcat values for the alditols are in the same range as found for other oxidases and their substrates, which suggests that these polyols or related polyols are the physiological substrates for m-AldO. Besides alditols, only a low activity (conversion rate <1 s–1) was observed with other aliphatic primary alcohols, diols, and carbohydrates. It is clear that aliphatic polyols are preferred and that stereochemistry plays a role in substrate recognition. Next to this, the chain length of the substrate is also important for optimal reactivity. While xylitol is the best substrate with a 5-carbon skeleton, l-threitol (4 carbons), d-sorbitol (6 carbons), and d-mannitol (6 carbons) are all worse substrates because of relatively high Km values. Based on these results, we used xylitol as a model substrate to explore the kinetic behavior of m-AldO in more detail.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for m-AldO Open table in a new tab Using stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy, we determined the redox state of m-AldO during steady-state catalysis by monitoring flavin absorbance. Upon mixing 0.25 mm O2, 5.0 mm xylitol, and 11.6 μm AldO at 25 °C, we observed within the first 30 ms a fast decrease of absorbance at 452 nm to reach the steady-state phase. The steady-state phase lasted for about 300 ms, which complies with the determined kcat value, and was followed by a rapid and full reduction of the flavin due to the excess of xylitol. During steady-state, 32% of the flavin was found to be in the oxidized form, indicating that the reductive and oxidative half-reactions are almost balanced. Pre-steady-state Kinetic Analysis—To study the pre-steady-state kinetics of m-AldO, we followed the spectral changes of the covalently linked flavin by using a stopped-flow instrument equipped with diode array detection for spectral scans and a photomultiplier for single wavelength measurements. By investigating the reductive and oxidative half-reaction separately, information was obtained concerning the kinetic mechanism of m-AldO. The reductive half-reaction was monitored by anaerobically mixing the enzyme with varying concentrations of xylitol. After mixing, three phases were observed, leading from oxidized to fully reduced flavin (Fig. 4). The inset in Fig. 4 shows the corresponding concentration profiles that were obtained from the deconvolution with Pro-K. To study the rates of the observed phases separately, strategic wavelengths were selected for every phase in such a way that only the desired phase showed changes in absorption. To follow the first phase, the absorption at 320 nm was monitored, and the third phase was studied at 452 nm, because the largest spectral difference occurred at that wavelength. The second phase was followed at 405 nm, which is the isosbestic point of the two spectra for the transition in the first phase, allowing a rate determination without the influence of the first phase. The first phase showed the largest decrease in flavin absorption at 450 nm, indicating that this kinetic event reflects flavin reduction. A hyperbolic relation was observed between the rate of this first phase and an increasing concentration of xylitol, indicating that xylitol binding is the step preceding this redox reaction. The kinetic data for the first phase could be fitted by a simple hyperbolic function, indicating that reduction is virtually irreversible (Equation 2). Fitting yielded a reduction rate constant (kred) of 99 s–1 and a Kd of 1.3 mm. The spectrum formed upon flavin reduction (spectrum 2 in Fig. 4) does not resemble a typical fully reduced flavin spectrum. This suggests that the initially formed oxidation product, the open form of xylose, causes some spectral perturbations, possibly by forming a charge transfer complex, as is indicated by the increase in A520 (19Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Ghisla S. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6599-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Following this first phase, there is a second fast phase leading to a fully red"
https://openalex.org/W2147425559,"Heparan sulfates (HS) are linear carbohydrate chains, covalently attached to proteins, that occur on essentially all cell surfaces and in extracellular matrices. HS chains show extensive structural heterogeneity and are functionally important during embryogenesis and in homeostasis due to their interactions with various proteins. Phage display antibodies have been developed to probe HS structures, assess the availability of protein-binding sites, and monitor structural changes during development and disease. Here we have characterized two such antibodies, AO4B08 and HS4E4, previously noted for partly differential tissue staining. AO4B08 recognized both HS and heparin, and was found to interact with an ubiquitouys, N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfated saccharide motif, including an internal 2-O-sulfate group. HS4E4 turned out to preferentially recognize low-sulfated HS motifs containing iduronic acid, and N-sulfated as well as N-acetylated glucosamine residues. Contrary to AO4B08, HS4E4 did not bind highly O-sulfated structures such as found in heparin. Heparan sulfates (HS) are linear carbohydrate chains, covalently attached to proteins, that occur on essentially all cell surfaces and in extracellular matrices. HS chains show extensive structural heterogeneity and are functionally important during embryogenesis and in homeostasis due to their interactions with various proteins. Phage display antibodies have been developed to probe HS structures, assess the availability of protein-binding sites, and monitor structural changes during development and disease. Here we have characterized two such antibodies, AO4B08 and HS4E4, previously noted for partly differential tissue staining. AO4B08 recognized both HS and heparin, and was found to interact with an ubiquitouys, N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfated saccharide motif, including an internal 2-O-sulfate group. HS4E4 turned out to preferentially recognize low-sulfated HS motifs containing iduronic acid, and N-sulfated as well as N-acetylated glucosamine residues. Contrary to AO4B08, HS4E4 did not bind highly O-sulfated structures such as found in heparin. Heparan sulfates (HS) 3The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; GlcA, d-glucuronic acid; IdoA, l-iduronic acid; RPIP-HPLC, reversed phase-ion pair high performance liquid chromatography; PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; dpc, days post coitus. 3The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; GlcA, d-glucuronic acid; IdoA, l-iduronic acid; RPIP-HPLC, reversed phase-ion pair high performance liquid chromatography; PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; dpc, days post coitus. are linear, sulfated polysaccharides that occur covalently bound to core proteins in proteoglycan structures at cell surfaces and in extracellular matrices. Due to their negative charge, HS chains interact with a variety of proteins, and thus modulate important processes in embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 2Lin X. Development. 2004; 131: 6009-6021Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of HS involves formation of a precursor polysaccharide composed of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues, which is subsequently modified through a series of enzymatic reactions. The modifications include N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, C5-epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid (IdoA) units, and finally O-sulfation at C2 of hexuronic acid and C6, more rarely C3, of glucosamine units. The reactions are generally incomplete, yielding products of extensive structural heterogeneity (3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The modification process is not under template control, yet tightly regulated, such that differences in structure of HS generated in different tissues are strikingly conserved (4Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 5Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Goötte M. Selleck S. Kjellén L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although aspects of specificity of HS-protein interactions remain unclear, these differences are presumably of functional significance (6Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.-p. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Elucidation of these problems is hampered by the lack of high-throughput tools for detailed structural characterization of HS, which remains a tedious task. Phage display antibodies have been developed to overcome the limited immunogenicity of HS, thereby making it possible to highlight tissue-specific HS structures and to follow changes in development and disease. Using such antibodies, the differential expression of HS motifs in various tissues has been demonstrated (7van Kuppevelt T.H. Dennissen M.A.B.A. van Venrooij W.J. Hoet R.M.A. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biol.

Yet, few of these antibodies have so far been characterized for their epitope specificity, which hampers further use of these tools and interpretation of results. We have selected two of these phage display antibodies, AO4B08 and HS4E4, based on their tissue staining properties (8ten Dam G.B. Hafmans T. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Lensen J.F.M. Rops A.L.W.M.M. Wijnhoven T.J.M. Hafmans T. Feitz W.F.J. Oosterwijk E. Banas B.

The epitopes recognized by these two antibodies were further defined in the present study. AO4B08 thus preferentially binds a N-sulfated octasaccharide epitope with three consecutive 6-O-sulfates and an internally located 2-O-sulfate group, and interacts efficiently with fully sulfated heparin. HS4E4 binds preferentially to different structures present in HS with a moderate degree of sulfation and N-acetylated in addition to N-sulfated glucosamine residues and epimerized iduronic acid.

The DNA sequences encoding for the antibodies were subcloned into vector pUC119-His-VSV (J. M. H. Raats, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen). To produce antibodies, periplasmic fractions of infected bacteria were isolated as described (18ten Dam G.B. Kurup S. van de Westerlo E.M. Versteeg E.M. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. van Kuppevelt T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4654-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria expressing HS4E4 or AO4B08 single chain variable fragment antibodies were grown and induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to produce antibodies. The bacterial periplasmic fraction containing antibody was isolated, dialyzed against PBS, and stored at–20 °C. Antibodies AO4B08 and HS4E4 were purified using Protein A-agarose or HIS-cobalt affinity-agarose beads (18ten Dam G.B. Kurup S. van de Westerlo E.M. Versteeg E.M. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. van Kuppevelt T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4654-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The antibody concentration was determined at 280 nm and bovine serum albumin (1%) and sodium azide (0.02%) were added for stabilization and preservation. The efficiency of purification was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described earlier (18ten Dam G.B. Kurup S. van de Westerlo E.M. Versteeg E.M. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. van Kuppevelt T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4654-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Polysaccharides—Heparin from intestinal mucosa, HS (from porcine kidney and liver), and variously N-deacetylated/N-sulfated K5 preparations were N-[3H]acetylated as described previously (19Hoöoök M. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), targeting residual N-unsub-stituted glucosamine residues. Polysaccharide (200 μg) was dissolved in 100 μl of 0.5% Na2CO3 in 10% methanol, and 3.5 mCi of [3H]acetic anhydride was added in aliquots over a period of 1.5 h. The labeled material was separated from free radioactivity on PD-10 columns equilibrated with 1 m NaCl in 0.5 m sodium acetate. Labeled samples excluded from the gel were collected and desalted by extensive dialysis against deionized water using dialysis tubing with a 3500 Da molecular weight cut-off. The specific 3H activities for the various preparations were: 50% N-sulfated K5, 3,500 cpm/μg; 80% N-sulfated K5, 156,000 cpm/μg; epimerized 98% N-sulfated K5, 24,000 cpm/μg; two samples of HS from porcine liver, 7,000 and 31,000 cpm/μg, respectively; HS from porcine kidney cortex, 48,000 cpm/μg; and heparin from bovine intestinal mucosa, 26,000 cpm/μg. Partially N-acetylated/N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide samples were enzymatically modified along with 35S labeling, as follows. Samples of chemically N-deacetylated and N-sulfated K5 (50, 80, and 98% conversion) were incubated with microsomal enzymes from a heparin producing, murine mast-cell tumor, in the presence of 35S-labeled PAPS. Reaction mixtures of 0.5 ml contained 25 μg of polysaccharide substrate, 100 μCi of [35S]PAPS, 1 mm unlabeled PAPS, and 5 mg of microsomal protein, in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mMgCl2, 5mm CaCl2, 3.5 μm NaF. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was passed through a column (1 × 100 cm) of Sephadex G-15 equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Labeled polysaccharide, eluted in the void volume of the column, was recovered and desalted by lyophilization. The specific 35S activities for the various preparations were: 50% N-sulfated K5, 80,000 cpm/μg; 80% N-sulfated K5, 300,000 cpm/μg; 98% N-sulfated K5, 160,000 cpm/μg. Oligosaccharides—Oligosaccharides from bovine lung heparin were generated by partial deaminative cleavage at N-sulfated glucosamine residues, followed by reduction of products with NaB3H4, and separation by gel chromatography as described (20Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The end-labeled products had a specific activity of ∼7.5 × 106 cpm/nmol. An octasaccharide fraction was separated further by affinity chromatography on immobilized anti-thrombin, as described (18ten Dam G.B. Kurup S. van de Westerlo E.M. Versteeg E.M. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. van Kuppevelt T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4654-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Octasaccharide libraries were generated from bovine lung heparin as described (18ten Dam G.B. Kurup S. van de Westerlo E.M. Versteeg E.M. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. van Kuppevelt T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4654-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, heparin was chemically O-desulfated to eliminate all 6-O-sulfate and about half of the 2-O-sulfate groups, and was then subjected to partial deaminative cleavage followed by NaB3H4 reduction. Labeled 8-mer (∼1.4 × 106 cpm/nmol) was recovered and separated into subfractions with different numbers of 2-O-sulfate groups. Each subfraction was separately incubated with mastocytoma microsomal enzymes in the presence of (unlabeled) PAPS, generating primarily 6-O-sulfated products. Binding Assays—Affinity chromatography was performed essentially as described (18ten Dam G.B. Kurup S. van de Westerlo E.M. Versteeg E.M. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. van Kuppevelt T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4654-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with 1 mg of antibody coupled to 0.5 mg of Protein-A beads in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Radiolabeled polysaccharide samples were eluted with a stepwise gradient of 5 column volumes each of 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, and 2 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. All polysaccharide samples compared for antibody binding were applied in similar amounts, based on specific radioactivity determined by colorimetric analysis (21Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5879) Google Scholar). For ELISA, wells of microtiter plates were coated overnight with K5 polysaccharide derivatives and (modified) heparin preparations (Table 1) as described before (7van Kuppevelt T.H.

After blocking with PBS, 3% (w/v) BSA, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, for 1 h, periplasmic fractions containing AO4B08 or HS4E4 in PBS, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 were added and incubated for 1.5 h. Bound antibodies were detected using mouse anti-VSV tag IgG antibody P5D4 (1:10), followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2000), both for 1 h. Enzyme activity was detected using 100 μl of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, as a substrate. Absorbance was read at 405 nm. Immunostaining—Cryosections of 4 μm were obtained from Hsepi+/– and Hsepi–/– mouse embryos (17.5 dpc), Hs2st+/– and Hs2st–/– mouse embryos (18.5 dpc), and Hs6st1+/– and Hs6st1–/– mouse embryos (15.5 dpc). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 20 min with PBS, 2% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (2% BSA-PBST). Sections were then incubated with anti-HS antibodies AO4B08 or HS4E4 in 2% BSA-PBST for 1 h. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with rabbit anti-VSV tag IgG antibody (1:500), followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200), incubated for 45 min each. Cryosections were fixed in 100% ethanol for ∼10 s, air-dried, and embedded in 10% (w/v) mowiol. Cryosections of rat kidney were incubated with antibodies AO4B08 or HS4E4 in the presence of 0.15–1 m NaCl to determine the relative affinities of antibody binding to HS (18ten Dam G.B.

Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with mouse anti-VSV tag IgG antibody P5D4 (1:10), followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200). Immunohistochemistry on CHO K1 (wild type) and pgsF-17 (2-O-sulfotransferase-deficient) cell lines was performed by adding antibodies AO4B08 or HS4E4 in culture medium to the cells for 1 h. Bound antibodies were detected essentially as above. Characterization of Epitopes—For sequencing of epitope motifs, selected library octasaccharides were preparatively affinity purified on an AO4B08 column. The binding and non-binding fragments were separately pooled, desalted, dried in a centrifugal evaporator, and sequenced through a combination of chemical and enzymatic degradation procedures as described (22Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Samples were first subjected to partial HNO2 cleavage by treatment with 2 mm NaNO2 in 20 mm HCl at room temperature. Aliquots were incubated for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min, and then the reaction was stopped by addition of 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6. The aliquots were pooled, and a fraction of the pool analyzed directly by anion-exchange chromatography on a Propac column as described (22Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Separate aliquots of the deamination pool were subjected to enzymatic digestion using 1 milliunit of recombinant iduronate-2-O-sulfatase, in a final volume of 25 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h digests were analyzed on the Propac column. Sequence information was obtained by detecting shifts in the elution positions of the enzyme-treated fragments. Affinity-fractionated liver HS was subjected to either exhaustive deamination at pH 1.5 (23Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) or to N-deacetylation by hydrazinolysis at room temperature (24Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) followed by deamination at pH 3.9. The products were separately applied to repeated affinity chromatography on immobilized HS4E4 antibody. For disaccharide analysis K5 derivatives and HS were treated with 0.4 milliunits each of heparin lyase I, II, and III in 15 μlof heparin lyase buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Heat-inactivated digests were dried and resuspended in 45 μlofH2O for analysis by reversed phase-ion pair high performance liquid chromatography (RPIP-HPLC) as described (5Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P.

To determine the degree of epimerization, disaccharides were obtained by deamination of the chains at pH 1.5 (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), followed by end labeling using NaB3H4 and isolation by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column (20Feyzi E. Lustig F.

The labeled disaccharides were then analyzed by strong ion-exchange chromatography on a Partisil-10 SAX column as described (20Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J.

Hoöoök M. Pettersson I. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans were quantified by colorimetric analysis of hexuronic acid using the meta-hydroxydiphenyl method (21Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5879) Google Scholar) with GlcA as a standard. An arbitrary factor of 3 was employed to convert values to saccharide mass. Binding of Heparin and HS to Antibodies AO4B08 and HS4E4—The two antibodies, AO4B08 and HS4E4, had been selected by panning to mouse skeletal muscle glycosaminoglycan and kidney HS, respectively, and showed overlapping as well as differential staining of rat spleen tissue sections (8ten Dam G.B. Hafmans T. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Differences in staining patterns were also manifest when human kidney sections were incubated with AO4B08 and HS4E4 (9Lensen J.F.M. Rops A.L.W.M.M. Wijnhoven T.J.M. Hafmans T. Feitz W.F.J. Oosterwijk E. Banas B. Bindels R.J.M. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. van der Vlag J. Berden J.H.M. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we incubated rat kidney sections with antibodies at varied ionic strength to highlight differences in affinity for different epitopes in the tissues. Both antibodies stained Bowman’s capsules, renal tubules, and smooth muscle cells at physiologic ionic conditions, whereas no staining of the glomerular tuft and the mesangium was seen (Fig. 1). Increasing the salt concentration resulted in a decreased AO4B08 staining of Bowman’s capsule as well as renal tubules and smooth muscle cells. For HS4E4, increasing the salt concentration resulted first in decreased staining of the renal tubules. Only at a higher concentration of salt was staining of Bowman’s capsule and smooth muscle cells also decreased. These findings confirmed that the two antibodies preferentially bind to different epitopes. We therefore compared the antibodies regarding the ability to bind various defined 3H-labeled polysaccharides in affinity chromatography. Antibody AO4B08 retained heparin (Fig. 2A) and liver HS (Fig. 2E) to similar extents, both types of polysaccharides being eluted up to 0.45 m NaCl concentration. HS from kidney cortex bound poorly compared with liver HS or heparin and was largely unbound at 0.15 m NaCl (Fig. 2C). The ligand preference of antibody HS4E4 differed from that of AO4B08, in that both heparin and kidney HS were poor ligands (Fig. 2, B and D), whereas major portions of the liver HS sample required relatively high ionic strength for elution (Fig. 2F). Evaluation of Antibody Specificity by ELISA—The two antibodies showed more clear cut distinctions in their interactions against a panel of heparin/HS analogues (Table"

Recent studies suggest that some IGFBPs may have IGF-independent effects, including induction of apoptosis and modulation of cell migration. However, very little is known about possible IGF-independent actions of IGFBP-6. We have generated a non-IGF-binding IGFBP-6 mutant by substituting Ala for four amino acid residues (Pro93/Leu94/Leu97/Leu98) in its N-domain IGF-binding site. A >10,000-fold loss of binding affinity for IGF-I and IGF-II was observed using charcoal solution binding assay, BIAcore biosensor, and ligand blotting. Wild-type and mutant IGFBP-6, as well as IGF-II, induced cell migration in RD rhabdomyosarcoma and LIM 1215 colon cancer cells. Cell migration was mediated by the C-domain of IGFBP-6. Transient p38 phosphorylation was observed in RD cells after treatment with IGFBP-6, whereas no change was seen in phospho-ERK1/2 levels. Phospho-JNK was not detected. IGFBP-6-induced cell migration was inhibited by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 MAPK activation. In contrast, SP600125, a JNK MAPK inhibitor, had no effect on migration. Knockdown of p38 MAPK using short interfering RNA blocked IGFBP-6-induced migration of RD cells.

Dysregulation of the IGF system is implicated in many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. A family of six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs 1–6) modulates IGF activity through high affinity binding that sequesters IGFs from their receptors, thereby inhibiting their actions. In some cases, IGFBPs may also potentiate IGF action by regulating IGF delivery to its receptors. As well as directly binding to IGFs, IGFBPs also modulate their actions indirectly via interactions with a number of plasma, extracellular matrix, and cell surface molecules. Some IGFBPs have IGF-independent effects, including inhibition of growth, and modulation of cell migration and apoptosis (1Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). IGFBPs share conserved N- and C-domains, each of which contain multiple conserved disulfide bonds that are essential for maintaining protein conformation and biological activity. A nonconserved and unstructured L-domain lies between these domains. Previous studies using NMR spectroscopy and crystallization of an N-terminal subdomain of IGFBP-5 with IGF-I demonstrated an IGF-binding site containing a number of hydrophobic residues (2Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 3Zeslawski W.

A recent crystal structure of a complex comprising the N-domain of IGFBP-4 and IGF-I confirmed this binding site (4Sitar T. Popowicz G.M. Siwanowicz I. Huber R. Holak T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13028-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Substitution of these hydrophobic residues in IGFBP-3 and -5 decreased their IGF-I binding affinities >1000-fold and diminished their effects on IGF actions (5Hong J. Zhang G. Dong F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, another study showed residual IGF binding after similar mutations in IGFBP-3, suggesting other regions are involved in IGF binding (7Yan X. Forbes B.E. McNeil K.A. Baxter R.C. Firth S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53232-53240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indeed, C-domain residues of IGFBPs also play a role in high affinity IGF binding (8Headey S.J. Leeding K.S. Norton R.S. Bach L.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Bach L.A. Headey S.J. Norton R.S. Trends Endocrinol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most IGF-independent effects of IGFBPs have been localized to their C-domains. IGFBP-6 is unique among the IGFBPs as it has an ∼50-fold higher binding affinity for IGF-II than IGF-I, making it a relatively specific IGF-II inhibitor (11Bach L.A. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2005; 15: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because of its binding preference, IGFBP-6 inhibits IGF-II-induced cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (12Gallicchio M.A. Kneen M. Hall C. Scott A.M. Bach L.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Gallicchio M.A. Kaun C. Wojta J. Binder B. Bach L.A. J. Cell.

A few studies have suggested that IGFBP-6 may have IGF-independent effects, but they have not been definitively demonstrated (17Grellier P. De Galle B. Babajko S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1670-1676PubMed Google Scholar, 18Seurin D. Lassarre C. Bienvenu G. Babajko S. Eur. J.

In this study, we have generated a non-IGF-binding IGFBP-6 mutant (mIGFBP-6) and used it as a tool to study possible IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-6. We show that mIGFBP-6 and wild-type IGFBP-6 (wtIGFBP-6) both promote migration of cancer cells in an IGF-independent manner. Furthermore, the migratory effects of IGFBP-6 are mediated by its C-domain. We also present evidence suggesting that IGFBP-6 activates p38 MAPK, which in turn is involved in IGFBP-6-stimulated migration of human RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Antibodies to phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-ERK1/2 MAPK, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 MAPK, ATP-citrate lyase, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and Signal-Silence pool p38 MAPK siRNA kit were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. AcTEV protease and Lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. Ni-NTA resin was purchased from Qiagen. Proteinase inhibitor mixture tablets were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 were purchased from Sigma. RD cells, derived from a human pelvic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. LIM 1215 colon cancer cells, kindly provided by Dr. Robert Whitehead (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne, Australia), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Both media were supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The preparation of pProExHTb-IGFBP-6 that expresses a 28-amino acid peptide containing a His6 tag and a TEV protease cleavage site at the N terminus of full-length human IGFBP-6 (without signal peptide) has been described previously (8Headey S.J. Leeding K.S. Norton R.S. Bach L.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The vector was used as a PCR template to generate a non-IGF-binding IGFBP-6 mutant. A sense primer complementary to the N-terminal untranslated region (5′-AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC ACA GG-3′) and an antisense mutant primer complementary to amino acids 88–102 (5′-G GAC GAC GAG GCG GCT GCG CGC GCG GCG GCG CTC GGC CGA GGC-3′) were used to generate the N-terminal region of the mutant. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 1 min, then 25 cycles at 95 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 68 °C for 1.5 min. The C terminus of IGFBP-6 was obtained by digesting the pPro-ExHTb-IGFBP-6 plasmid with Eco52I/EcoRI. The pPro-ExHTb-mIGFBP-6 plasmid with P93A/L94A/L97A/L98A (Fig. 1) was then constructed by three-way ligation. BamHI/BssHII digestion was used to identify colonies containing the mutant sequence, which were further confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type, mutant, N-domain (residues 28–106), and C-domain (residues 160–240) of IGFBP-6 (Fig. 1) were expressed separately in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (8Headey S.J. Leeding K.S. Norton R.S. Bach L.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recombinant glycosylated IGFBP-6 (gIGFBP-6) was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified as described previously (21Neumann G.M. Bach L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14587-14594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The His6 tag on wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 was cleaved with AcTEV protease and removed using Ni-NTA-agarose. Binding studies were carried out as described previously (22Headey S.J. Keizer D.W. Yao S. Brasier G. Kantharidis P. Bach L.A. Norton R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2740-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 125I-IGF-II (2 × 104 cpm) was incubated with gIGFBP-6 (0.03–30 ng), wtIGFBP-6 (0.03–10 ng), or mIGFBP-6 (0.05–3000 ng) in 0.4 ml 0.1 m phosphate-buffer saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4. Free tracer was removed by incubation with ice-cold 5% activated charcoal, 2% BSA in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml) followed by centrifugation. Bound tracer in supernatants was counted in a γ-counter (Beckman). Each point was measured in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated four times. wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Osmonics). Ligand blotting using 125I-IGF-II was performed as described previously (12Gallicchio M.A. Kneen M. Hall C. Scott A.M. Bach L.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed using the BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). wtIGFBP-6 and mIGFBP-6 were immobilized by amine coupling onto separate channels of a CM5 chip (BIAcore AB) as described previously (8Headey S.J. Leeding K.S. Norton R.S. Bach L.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following immobilization, the chip was washed for 30 min with HBS buffer. The net increases in signal for wtIGFBP-6 and mIGFBP-6 were 682 and 1642 resonance units, respectively, where 1000 resonance units is equivalent to ∼1 ng of protein/mm2. IGF-I or IGF-II (10–400 nm)in HBS buffer was passed over the chip at 10 μl/min for 10 min at 20 °C. Following IGF injection, dissociation was evaluated by passing HBS buffer alone over the chip at 10 μl/min for 10 min. After each run, the chip was regenerated with 0.01 m HCl. RD cell number was measured after 72 h in serum-free medium ± wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) using an MTT assay as described previously (12Gallicchio M.A. Kneen M. Hall C. Scott A.M. Bach L.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A linear relationship between cell number and absorbance in this assay has been shown previously (12Gallicchio M.A. Kneen M. Hall C. Scott A.M. Bach L.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transwell Assay—Cell migration was assayed using 6.5-mm Transwell permeable supports (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 8-μm pore polycarbonate membrane inserts. Transwell membranes were coated with 100 μg/ml gelatin at room temperature for 30 min. 600 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 0.05% BSA and mitomycin C (0.5 μg/ml) to inhibit cell proliferation, plus wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) or IGF-II (100 ng/ml), was added to the lower chamber. RD cells (1 × 105 cells/100 μl) or LIM 1215 cells (3 × 105 cells/100 μl) in serum-free DMEM containing 0.05% BSA and mitomycin C were then seeded in the upper chamber. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Nonmigrating cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Migrating cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and photographed. Three photographs from each of duplicate membranes were used for each experimental group. Migrating cells were counted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). At least three independent experiments were performed. Chemotaxis Chamber Assay—Inhibitor studies were performed in a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) was added to serum-free DMEM with or without inhibitors (PD098059, SB203580, and SP600125, all 10 μm) and placed in the bottom wells of the chamber. Polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size) were pre-coated with gelatin (100 μg/ml) and placed over the bottom wells. RD cells (5.6 × 104 cells/well) were resuspended in serum-free DMEM and placed into top wells. The chamber was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h, after which the filters were removed, fixed, stained, mounted, and photographed. Nonmigrating cells were removed and at least three random fields/well of triplicate wells were photographed, and migrating cells were counted using ImageJ software. At least three independent experiments were performed. Expression of proteins related to cell signaling was examined by Western blot analysis. After treatment with wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) for 5–60 min, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 containing proteinase inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell mixtures were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined. About 50–60 μg of protein per lane was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (23Fu P. Thompson J.A. Leeding K.S. Bach L.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-ERK1/2 MAPK, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 MAPK (all 1:1000), and ATP-citrate lyase (1:3000). p38 and control siRNAs were used from the Signal Silence pool p38 MAPK siRNA kit. RD cells (2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates) were grown for 24 h at 37 °C. p38 MAPK or control siRNA (final concentration 25 nm) was incubated in 67 μl of serum-free DMEM, 0.05% BSA, 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 for 20 min and added to cells in fresh serum-containing DMEM (333 μl). Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, following which Western blotting and cell migration assays were carried out as described above. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. of 3–6 independent experiments. Migration experiments were initially analyzed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance as appropriate. For IGF-II + IGFBP-6 experiments, data were log-transformed prior to analysis to stabilize variance. Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Fisher’s PLSD correction for multiple comparisons. mIGFBP-6 Does Not Bind IGFs—To investigate potential IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-6, we designed and generated an IGFBP-6 mutant by substituting Ala for four hydrophobic amino acids, P93A/L94A/L97A/L98A (Fig. 1), based on previous structural and mutation studies of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 (5Hong J.

Binding of mIGFBP-6 to IGFs was tested using three different approaches as follows: (i) Western ligand blotting, (ii) charcoal solution binding assay, and (iii) SPR. Both gIGFBP-6 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and wtIGFBP-6 (with or without the His6 tag; Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4) bound 125I-IGF-II as measured by Western ligand blotting. In contrast, mIGFBP-6 (with or without the His6 tag) did not bind (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6), even when 10-fold more protein was loaded (Fig. 2A, lane 7). Dose-dependent binding of both gIGFBP-6 and wtIGFBP-6 to 125I-IGF-II was observed using the charcoal solution binding assay (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mIGFBP-6 did not bind, even with 10,000 times more protein than the minimum amount of wtIGFBP-6 that clearly bound IGF-II. Similar results were seen with 125I-IGF-I (results not shown). SPR analyses further confirmed that wtIGFBP-6 binds both IGF-I (Fig. 3A) and IGF-II (Fig. 3B) in a dose-dependent manner. mIGFBP-6 does not bind IGFs (Fig. 3, C and D), despite 2-fold more mIGFBP-6 being immobilized on the chip.FIGURE 3Sensorgrams of IGFBP-6 binding to IGF-I and IGF-II. IGF-I (A) or IGF-II (B) (10–400 nm) was passed over a biosensor chip coated with wtIGFBP-6. IGF-I (C) or IGF-II (D) (10–400 nm) was passed over a biosensor chip coated with mIGFBP-6. The association phase is from 60 to 360 s followed by dissociation from 360 to 600 s.

IGFBP-6 Decreases RD Cell Number, Most Likely Because of IGF Inhibition—The effects of wtIGFBP-6 and mIGFBP-6 on RD cell number were assessed using the MTT assay. As shown previously (12Gallicchio M.A. Kneen M. Hall C. Scott A.M. Bach L.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), wtIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) significantly decreased cell number to 74 ± 8% of control (p < 0.01 versus control); in contrast, mIGFBP-6 had no effect (Fig. 4). These findings, together with the high levels of autocrine IGF-II secreted by these cells, suggest that IGFBP-6 decreases RD cell number by inhibiting autocrine IGF-II actions. IGFBP-6 Induces Tumor Cell Migration in an IGF-independent Manner—To explore possible IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-6, we examined whether wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 regulates cancer cell migration using Transwell membranes. As shown in Fig. 5, IGF-II stimulated cancer cell migration, consistent with previous findings (13Gallicchio M.A. Kaun C. Wojta J. Binder B. Bach L.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Leventhal P.S. Feldman E.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, treatment with either wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) also significantly increased migration in RD cells (Fig. 5, A and B, 150 ± 10% and 166 ± 18% of control, respectively, p < 0.01 versus control) and LIM 1215 colon cancer cells (Fig. 5C, 284 ± 45% and 312 ± 37% of control, respectively, p < 0.01 versus control). Similar results were obtained with gIGFBP-6 (Fig. 5B, 155 ± 12%, p < 0.01 versus control). Because both wtIGFBP-6 and non-IGF-binding mIGFBP-6 induced RD and LIM 1215 cell migration, these results indicate an IGF-independent mechanism. Furthermore, the addition of IGF-II significantly increased wtIGFBP-6 and mIGFBP-6-induced RD migration to a similar extent (Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6A, IGF-II increases wtIGFBP-6- or mIGFBP-6-induced RD cell migration. RD cells were incubated with wtIGFBP-6 or mIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) ± IGF-II (100 ng/ml). Results are shown as the mean ± S.E. of eight independent experiments (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus control; ##, p < 0.01 versus wtIGFBP-6; ^, p < 0.05 versus mIGFBP-6). B, RD cell migration is mediated by the C-domain of IGFBP-6. RD cells were incubated with wtIGFBP-6 (1 μg/ml) or isolated N- or C-domains of IGFBP-6 (500 ng/ml). Results are shown as the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus control). Error bars are ±S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell Migration Is Mediated by the C-domain of IGFBP-6— We next examined which domain of IGFBP-6 is involved in the stimulation of cell migration. The N- and C-domains of IGFBP-6 (Fig. 1A) were expressed separately in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described previously (8Headey S.J. Leeding K.S. Norton R.S. Bach L.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 6B, the C-domain of IGFBP-6 increased RD cell migration to 184 ± 30% of control (p < 0.05). In contrast, the N-domain of IGFBP-6 had no effect on migration. IGFBP-6 Induces RD Cell Migration via the p38 MAPK Pathway—Activation of the MAPK has been implicated in many biological processes, including cell migration (26Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4619-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). To determine whether MAPK pathways are involved in IGFBP-6-induced RD cell migration, we first examined their activation status in response to wtIGFBP-6 and mIGFBP-6 by analyzing ERK1/2, p38, and JNK MAPK phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, IGFBP-6 transiently increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. We and others have shown previously that ERK1/2 is constitutively activated in RD cells, whereas IGF treatment has no further effect (23Fu P. Thompson J.A. Leeding K.S. Bach L.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Mauro A. Ciccarelli C. De Cesaris P. Scoglio A. Bouche M. Molinaro M. Aquino A. Zani B.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3587-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Scholl F.A. Dumesic P.A. Khavari P.A. Cancer Lett. 2005; 230: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present study confirmed a high level of constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7C). wtIGFBP-6 and mIGFBP-6 had no significant effect on ERK1/2 activation in RD cells (Fig. 7, C and D). Using the same conditions, we were unable to detect a signal for phospho- or total JNK in basal or IGFBP-6-stimulated cells (results not shown). To further evaluate whether MAPK activation contributes to IGFBP-6-induced migration in RD cells, we blocked these pathways using specific inhibitors of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 MAPKs. As shown in Fig. 8A, SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, completely abolished mIGFBP-6-induced RD migration but did not affect basal migration. Interestingly, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation, showed a similar effect (Fig. 8B). In contrast, SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, did not affect RD migration (Fig. 8C). These results further demonstrate that p38 MAPK is involved in mediating IGFBP-6-dependent migration of RD cells. In addition, we found that the p38 inhibitor SB203580 abrogated IGF-II-mediated migration from 173 ± 34% to 91 ± 18% of control (p < 0.05 versus IGF-II alone, n = 3). These results are consistent with a previous report showing that IGF-II-induced cell migration is p38-dependent (29Lee O.H. Bae S.K. Bae M.H. Lee Y.M. Moon E.J. Cha H.J. Kwon Y.G. Kim K.W. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Knockdown of p38 MAPK Abolishes IGFBP-6-induced Cell Migration—To further examine the involvement of p38 in IGFBP-6-stimulated RD migration, we transfected cells with either p38 siRNA or control siRNA. Western blot analysis showed that transfection with p38 siRNA efficiently suppressed the expression of endogenous p38 protein after 48 h, whereas transfection with control siRNA did not alter p38 expression (Fig. 9A). RD cell number after 48 h was not affected by either p38 or control siRNA transfection, excluding cytotoxic effects (Fig. 9B). To investigate the effect of p38 siRNA on IGFBP-6-induced RD migration, cells were transfected with p38 or control siRNA for 48 h, and migration was then studied in the presence or absence of mIGFBP-6. Knockdown of p38 MAPK completely abolished mIGFBP-6-induced cell migration, confirming the effect previously seen with the p38 MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 9C). In contrast, mIGFBP-6-induced cell migration was not affected by control siRNA (Fig. 9C). These results clearly demonstrate that p38 MAPK plays an important role in IGFBP-6-dependent cell migration. The present study describes four novel findings as follows: (a) substitution of alanine for Pro93/Leu94/Leu97/Leu98 within the putative IGF binding domain of IGFBP-6 results in a more than 10,000-fold reduction in binding affinity for IGFs; (b) IGFBP-6 promotes cancer cell migration in an IGF-independent manner; (c) the C-domain underlies the promigratory effect of IGFBP-6; (d) p38 MAPK is involved in IGFBP-6-dependent migration of RD cells. The non-IGF-binding IGFBP-6 mutant was designed based on previous structural and mutation studies of IGFBP-3 and -5 (5Hong J. Zhang G. Dong F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol.

This finding formally proves that, unlike presenilin, SPP does not require any additional proteins for proteolysis.

The discovery of minimal requirements for intramembrane proteolysis should facilitate mechanistic and structural analysis and help define general biochemical principles of hydrolysis in a hydrophobic environment. Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) 2The abbreviations used are: I-CLiP, intramembrane-cleaving protease; SPP, signal peptide peptidase; Prl, prolactin; DDM, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; TM, transmembrane; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MBP, MBP-binding protein. 2The abbreviations used are: I-CLiP, intramembrane-cleaving protease; SPP, signal peptide peptidase; Prl, prolactin; DDM, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; TM, transmembrane; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MBP, MBP-binding protein. are a family of polytopic enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of substrate transmembrane domains. Although these proteases bear essentially no sequence similarity to their water-soluble counterparts, they have apparently converged on similar catalytic mechanisms. Thus, the I-CLiPs include the Site-2 protease family of putative metalloproteases, the Rhomboid-type serine proteases, and presenilin and presenilin-like aspartyl proteases (1Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Such mechanistic categories have been assumed from mutagenesis studies and the types of compounds that inhibit these proteases. However, the first structures of an I-CLiP, the Escherichia coli Rhomboid GlpG, have recently been reported, confirming the presence of a serine-histidine catalytic dyad 10 Å within the membrane and the categorization of Rhomboid as a bona fide intramembrane serine protease (2Wu Z.

The new reports on the structure of Rhomboid emphasize the point that biochemical studies of I-CLiPs are prerequisites for structure determination and the mechanistic interpretation of such structures. Toward this end, tremendous efforts have focused on presenilin and the γ-secretase complex, a putative membrane-embedded aspartyl protease that produces the amyloid-β protein implicated in Alzheimer disease and that plays a key role in Notch receptor signaling during cell differentiation (5Selkoe D.J. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Although presenilin is apparently the catalytic component, it must assemble with three other membrane protein cofactors and be endoproteolyzed into two pieces to form active γ-secretase (6Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 7Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S.

Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The entire complex has been purified in active form, allowing the determination of low resolution structures by electron microscopy and single particle analysis (9Lazarov V.K. Fraering P.C. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Li H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6889-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Ogura T. Mio K. Hayashi I. Miyashita H. Fukuda R. Kopan R. Kodama T. Hamakubo T. Iwatsubo T. Tomita T. Sato C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the challenge of co-crystallizating presenilin with its cofactors makes structural determination of the γ-secretase complex at the atomic level quite difficult. In contrast to the complexity of γ-secretase, a family of presenilin homologues appears more suitable for detailed structural analysis. The most studied is signal peptide peptidase (SPP), which cleaves remnant signal peptides left behind in the membrane by the action of signal peptidase and also plays key roles in immune surveillance and the maturation of certain viral proteins (11Martoglio B. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ability to reconstitute SPP activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a eukaryotic organism that does not encode this protease, by expressing the presenilin homologue alone suggested that other protein cofactors are not required (12Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The chemistry behind proteolysis by SPP and presenilin is presumably the same (i.e. both are membrane-embedded aspartyl proteases), and a number of γ-secretase inhibitors and modulators can likewise affect SPP activity (13Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16528-16533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding SPP may provide insight into the workings of presenilin within the γ-secretase complex. Here we show that SPP from several species can be expressed in bacteria and purified in proteolytically active form, formal proof that this protein works alone. Surprisingly, a conserved C-terminal region of SPP is sufficient for enzymatic activity, suggesting that it represents a functional domain of this aspartyl I-CLiP. These studies provide important insights into the nature of intramembrane proteolysis and set the stage for detailed structural analysis through crystallography, NMR, and other biophysical approaches. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid encoding human SPP was constructed by amplifying the human SPP gene from the previously constructed SPP-CTV5his plasmid (14Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15153-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The resultant PCR product was ligated into the pMal-p2x vector (New England Biolabs). Schizosaccharomyces pombe haploid wild type strain (h-ura4-d18 leu1-32) was obtained as a gift from Dr. Dieter Wolf at the Harvard School of Public Health. The S. pombe genomic DNA was extracted from spheroplasts using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) and used as a template for SPP gene amplification, and the amplified gene was inserted into the vector. Drosophila SPP and SPPL3 genes were inserted into the pMal-p2x vector using the same strategy as described above. PCR products of these genes were amplified using expressed sequence tags (Open Biosystems) as templates. Drosophila SPP was also subcloned into the pET22b vector (Novagen) to introduce a His6 tag at the 3′ prime position for detection and isolation. Functional domains of human, S. pombe, and Drosophila SPPs were subcloned into both pET22b and pMal-p2x vectors using the same strategy as described above. In these cases, His6 tag was introduced in both pMal-p2x and pET22b constructs at the 3′ position. Mutation of the aspartate codons was performed using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Protein Expression and Membrane Isolation—The plasmids containing the genes of interest were transformed into the C43 (DE3) strain of E. coli. Cultures were grown in LB media with ampicillin, shaken at 37 °C until an optical density of 0.8 was reached. At this point, 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopy-ranoside was added, and the culture was grown at 23 °C for 12–14 h. Harvested cells from 400 ml of culture were resuspended in 20 ml of PSGS buffer (25 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 5% sucrose, pH 7.5) containing 1 μg/ml DNase-I and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were mechanically disrupted and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h to isolate the membranes. Membranes were washed in PSGS and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Purification of SPP—The isolated bacterial membranes were solubilized in 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) in PSGS containing a protease inhibitor mixture and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield solubilized membrane fractions containing the expressed SPP. These fractions were diluted, and SPP was affinity-purified using either amylose resin (New England Biolabs) (for MBP fusion proteins) or talon resin (BD Biosciences) (for His6-tagged proteins). Bound protein was either eluted or kept on the beads for the activity assay. The elution buffer (0.1% DDM in PSGS) contained 25 mm maltose to release MBP fusion protein or 300 mm imidazole to release His6-tagged protein. The purity and identity of eluted proteins were assessed by Western blotting and by silver and Coomassie staining. Anti-penta-His (Qiagen) and anti-MBP antibodies (New England Biolabs) were used for Western blot detection. Blue native gel (4–16%, Invitrogen) was also used for characterization of eluted proteins. Reconstitution of SPP—Chloroform-solubilized lipids were evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The resulting thin films were hydrated using 1% of DDM in phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated to make a 1% suspension of lipid. On-column reconstitution of activity was performed immediately after the isolation of MBP-SPP on amylose beads by adding 0.1% final concentration of the appropriate lipids. Off-column reconstitution was performed immediately after elution. The eluted protein was mixed with sonicated lipids (∼1:5000 of protein: lipid) and kept at 4 °C for 3 h. The resulting proteoliposomes were rapidly diluted, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and used for activity assays. Western blot and quantification were also performed on proteoliposomes. In Vitro SPP Activity Assay—A standardized in vitro cleavage assay was used throughout this study as described (15Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Authenticity of SPP activity was assessed in part by incubating the reaction mixture in the presence of an SPP-specific inhibitor, (ZLL)2 ketone (Calbiochem). (ZLL)2 ketone and helical peptide inhibitors were used at the concentration of 10 μm for standard reactions. Helical peptides were designed based on the SPP substrate calreticulin. 3T. Sato, A. Kuppanna, S. Narayanan, C. Cheng, and M. S. Wolfe, unpublished results. 5 μm pepstatin A (Sigma), 100 μm diisocoumarin (Sigma), 10 μm E-64 (Sigma), or 10 μm bestatin (Sigma) were used to characterize the sensitivity of SPP activity to inhibitors directed to major protease classes. (Hydroxyethyl)urea-type transition-state analog inhibitors were used as described previously (16Esler W.P. Das C. Wolfe M.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1935-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Glycerol Velocity Gradient—Globular proteins (albumin from chicken egg white, Mr ∼45 kDa; bovine serum albumin, ∼66 kDa; phosphorylase-b, ∼97.2 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase from S. cerevisiae, ∼141 kDa; catalase, ∼230 kDa) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as standards. ∼2 μg of purified, proteolytically active MBP-SPPs in 1 ml of assay buffer (0.1% foscholine in 25 mm phosphate, 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing a protease inhibitor cocktail) were loaded into 10 ml of 5–32% linear glycerol gradient-containing assay buffer. Gradients were centrifuged for 15.5 h at 36,000 rpm and 4 °C using an SW41Ti rotor and collected by 0.5-ml fractions. Collected fractions were resolved using 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and stained using Imperial Stain (Pierce). Expression and Characterization of Active Signal Peptide Peptidases in E. coli—Signal peptide peptidases were shown to functionally express in yeast and mammalian cells as N-glycosylated proteins (12Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 14Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol.

Mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that glycosylation is not essential for proteolytic function, suggesting that expression of active protease in bacteria might be possible (18Nyborg A.C.

Four different variants were expressed in E. coli strain C43: SPP from Homo sapiens, SPP from S. pombe, and SPP and SPP-like protein 3 (SPPL3) from Drosophila melanogaster, each as an N-terminal MBP fusion protein containing the PelB leader sequence for the proper insertion into E. coli membranes (Fig. 1a). Expression of these fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blot of total cell lysates, with some degree of protein degradation also being observed (not shown). E. coli membranes were isolated and solubilized in 1% DDM. This non-ionic detergent with a low critical micelle concentration was identified as best for protein extraction and provided less interference with protease activity among eight detergents tested (data not shown). Each of the expressed MBP-SPP fusion proteins were tested for proteolytic activity using an established in vitro assay that utilizes a synthetic Myc and FLAG-tagged peptide based on the prolactin signal sequence (Prl-FLAG) (15Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cleavage products were identified by Western blot analysis after incubating solubilized membranes with substrate at 30 °C for 90 min (Fig. 1b). Proteolytic fragments from the Prl-FLAG substrate were not observed before incubation and were prevented by a specific SPP inhibitor, (ZLL)2 ketone. Moreover, proteolysis was observed only in the presence of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (data not shown), and solubilized membranes from E. coli expressing MBP alone could not cleave the substrate (Fig. 1b), indicating that the proteolysis was not due to endogenous E. coli proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis of either of the two conserved transmembrane aspartates eliminated the SPP activity (Fig. 1c), consistent with the hypothesis that these residues represent the active site of a membrane-embedded aspartyl protease. Moreover, the sensitivity of this protease activity to a panel of inhibitors was consistent with that expected for SPP activity (13Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A.

Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); (ZLL)2 ketone reduced the proteolytic activity, but none of the other more broad-spectrum inhibitors (pepstatin A, dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), E-64, and bestatin) significantly affected activity (Fig. 1d). Human and Drosophila SPP displayed pH optima closer to neutral pH, whereas S. pombe SPP showed a pH optimum at acidic pH (data not shown). Together these results suggest that these expressed MBP-SPPs from diverse organisms are functional. Expression and proteolytic activity were similarly observed when Drosophila SPP was transformed with a C-terminal His6 tag instead of an N-terminal MBP (Fig. 1, e and f). The observed Prl-FLAG cleavage product co-migrated on the gel with product formed using membranes from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing human SPP. Time-dependent product formation and concentration-dependent inhibition with (ZLL)2 ketone were also observed (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that proteolytic activity was due to the expressed SPP protein, and this activity closely resembles that seen in mammalian cells. Reconstitution of SPP Activity with Purified Protein—Biochemical and structural understanding of SPP demands purification and functional reconstitution of this enzyme in lipids. DDM was chosen as the detergent to isolate SPP in functional form. Previous studies showed that over time DDM completely disrupted interaction of presenilin with its co-factors in the γ-secretase complex and abolished activity (19Fraering P.C. LaVoie M.J. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Any E. coli proteins that interact with SPP might be expected to dissociate during the purification process in the presence of DDM, allowing purification of the protein and testing of the hypothesis that SPP functions as a protease on its own. Drosophila MBP-SPP was used for this study because it showed better proteolytic activity and appeared to degrade less than the other SPPs after optimization of expression. After membrane isolation, affinity purification was carried out on amylose beads with maltose elution, providing pure protein as assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue or silver staining (Fig. 2, a–c). Previously, SPP was shown to exist as an SDS stable dimer that could be labeled with a transition-state analogue affinity probe (14Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15153-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on these and other findings, dimerization was thought to be important for activity (14Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15153-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Beer D. Nyborg A.C. Shearman M.S. Golde T.E. Goate A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, although SDS-stable dimers could be observed after DDM solubilization of membranes (Fig. 2a), none were seen after affinity purification (Fig. 2b). The activity of this pure protein was reconstituted with lipids, which play crucial roles in the function of enzymes located within the membrane (21Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta., Biomembr. 2004; 1666: 62-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Lipids were chosen to provide variation in the polar head groups. E. coli total lipids, primarily composed of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol, were selected first because SPP activity was seen in E. coli membrane extracts. Other lipids tested included 1) phosphatidylcholine (PC), 2) a 3:1 PC/PE mixture, and 3) heart total lipids, a combination of the zwitterionic PC and PE and the anionic phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid. Robust activity was observed in the presence of PC or PC/PE and was highest with E. coli total lipids; cardiac total lipids provided virtually no activity (Fig. 2d). Proteolytic activity required the added lipids and was completely inhibited by (ZLL)2 ketone. γ-Secretase and Rhomboid both likewise required added lipids after affinity purification for proteolytic activity (19Fraering P.C. LaVoie M.J. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Lemberg M.K. Menendez J. Misik A. Garcia M.

A. 2005; 102: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that this is a general property of I-CLiPs. Presumably, specific lipids and detergents allow these proteases to assume conformations that are conducive to proper interaction with and handling of substrate and/or that allow appropriate geometric alignment between catalytic residues. Identification of a Four-TM Functional Domain of SPP—The in vitro proteolytic SPP assay showed that human, S. pombe, and Drosophila SPP as well as Drosophila SPP-like protein 3 could all cleave the same synthetic substrate based on the bovine prolactin signal sequence. In each case the activity was blocked by the specific SPP transition-state analogue inhibitor, (ZLL)2 ketone, and the cleaved product formed from the bacterially expressed SPP co-migrated with product formed from solubilized membranes from mammalian cells (Fig. 1, b and f). Although the functional implications of these observations in vivo are not clear, the biochemical nature of the active site and substrate binding site are apparently highly conserved throughout these organisms. Interestingly, sequence alignment of the SPPs from these organisms showed higher homology in the C-terminal region compared with the N-terminal region (supplemental Fig. 1). The sequences containing the two essential aspartates are highly conserved as is a signature PAL domain further downstream. This observation led to the hypothesis that the C-terminal portion of SPP may represent a functional domain for enzymatic activity and that this domain may be capable of carrying out proteolysis on its own. This idea, however, had potential problems. Residues not involved in catalysis and located in disparate regions of the protein may nevertheless serve to stabilize the functional domain. For presenilin, evidence suggests that TM1 interacts with TM8 and TM3 with TM6 (24Brunkan A.L. Martinez M. Wang J. Walker E.S. Beher D. Shearman M.S. Goate A.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1315-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Kornilova A.Y. Bihel F. Das C. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 579-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), with the prediction that removing TM1 or TM3 would impair enzymatic activity. Evidence suggests that the membrane topology of SPP is opposite that of presenilin, with either seven or nine TM domains (17Friedmann E. Lemberg M.K. Weihofen A. Dev K.K. Dengler U. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50790-50798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Nyborg A.C. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Fauq A. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43148-43156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and our computational analysis suggested that SPP contains at least six TM domains. In any event, truncation of SPP just before the TM domain containing the first essential aspartate is predicted to provide a protein with four TM domains altogether. Loop regions were chosen to define the boundary of the functional domain. Combining our biochemical data, sequence homology, and topology analysis, the functional domain was defined as represented by the two arrows in the sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. 1) and by arrowheads in the schematic representation (Fig. 1a). The so-defined functional domains from human, S. pombe, and Drosophila SPP were subcloned into a vector that allowed installation of the PelB leader sequence on the N terminus and a His6 tag on the C terminus. After expression, the membranes were isolated, and all three functional domains were found to be inserted into the membrane, presumably due to the presence of the pelB signal sequence in the plasmid (Fig. 3a). Degradation bands were not observed; however, because the His6 epitope tag for antibody detection and purification was placed at the C terminus, premature translation and degradation cannot be ruled out. After solubilization of membranes in 1% DDM, the SPP activity assay was performed, and the three functional domains from each species were all proteolytically active (Fig. 3b). The degree of activity in each case was comparable with that seen using full-length Drosophila SPP, and the cleaved products co-migrated with this positive control. These results imply that activity was not compromised in the engineered functional domain of SPP. Because affinity purification using amylose beads provided highly pure samples of full-length SPP, an N-terminal MBP fusion was introduced into the functional domains as well. Expressed MBP-fused human SPP was detected in DDM-solubilized E. coli membranes as a single band by anti-MBP Western blot (Fig. 3c). These solubilized membranes contained SPP-like proteolytic activity, whereas membranes containing MBP alone did not (Fig. 3d). Mutagenesis showed that changing either one of the essential and conserved aspartates abolished the proteolytic activity of the functional domain (Fig. 3e). Moreover, the MBP-fused functional domain displayed the same profile of inhibitor sensitivity as full-length SPP; only the specific SPP inhibitor (ZLL)2 ketone substantially reduced activity (Fig. 3f), although the extent of this inhibition was not as great as that seen with full-length SPP. The inhibition by (ZLL)2 ketone was concentration-dependent, with an IC50 of ∼15 μm compared with 2 μm full-length SPP (not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that the chemistry of proteolysis is the same for both the full-length protein and the functional domain and that the four C-terminal transmembrane domains may be sufficient for SPP proteolytic activity. Reconstitution of SPP Activity with Purified Functional Domain—To corroborate the concept of the functional domain, human, S. pombe, and Drosophila SPP functional domains were purified by affinity column. DDM-solubilized membranes containing MBP-fused SPP were loaded onto amylose beads, washed, and eluted with maltose. MBP-SPP fractions contained a significant amount of MBP alone, cleaved from the SPP portion (not shown). Reconstitution of proteolytic activity was attempted with PC as well as E. coli total lipids. Whereas both types of lipids could reconstitute activity with purified full-length Drosophila (Fig. 2d), only E. coli total lipids worked for the functional domain (Fig. 4a). The reason for this difference is not clear; nevertheless, these findings suggest that the functional domain is proteolytically active without the need for any other protein factors (the free MBP in these samples does not have proteolytic activity; see Fig. 3d). SPP functional domains from all three species were also reconstituted successfully in this way (data not shown). Removal of the MBP fusion protein would provide a functional domain of ∼15 kDa, putting this membrane protein within range suitable for study by NMR. Two lipid-mimicking detergents that are suitable for NMR, foscholine 12 and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, were tested for compatibility with protease activity, swapping out the DDM during the affinity purification step. Including 2% glucose in the E. coli media and reducing the post-induction temperature to 20 °C together eliminated degradation of MBP-fused human SPP functional domain and facilitated high level isolation (Fig. 4b). Human SPP functional domain was purified to virtual homogeneity as assessed by Coomassie an"
https://openalex.org/W1981388557,"Corticosteroid hormones (aldosterone and glucocorticoids) and their receptors are now recognized as major modulators of cardiovascular pathophysiology, but their specific roles remain elusive. Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs), which are widely used to treat acute and chronic diseases, often have adverse cardiovascular effects such as heart failure, hypertension, atherosclerosis, or metabolic alterations. The direct effects of GC on the heart are difficult to evaluate, as changes in plasma GC concentrations have multiple consequences due to the ubiquitous expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), resulting in secondary effects on cardiac function. We evaluated the effects of GR on the heart in a conditional mouse model in which the GR was overexpressed solely in cardiomyocytes. The transgenic mice displayed electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities: a long PQ interval, increased QRS and QTc duration as well as chronic atrio-ventricular block, without cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. The ECG alterations were reversible on GR expression shutoff. Isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes showed major ion channel remodeling, with decreases in I(Na), I(to), and I(Kslow) activity and changes in cell calcium homeostasis (increase in C(al), in Ca2+ transients and in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load). This phenotype differs from that observed in mice overexpressing the mineralocorticoid receptor in the heart, which displayed ventricular arrhythmia. Our mouse model highlights novel effects of GR activation in the heart indicating that GR has direct and specific cardiac effects in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2010856383,"Anthrax infections are frequently associated with severe and often irreversible hypotensive shock. The isolated toxic proteins of Bacillus anthracis produce a non-cytokine-mediated hypotension in rats by unknown mechanisms. These observations suggest the anthrax toxins have direct cardiovascular effects. Here, we characterize these effects. As a first step, we administered systemically anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) and edema toxin (EdTx) to cohorts of three to twelve rats at different doses and determined the time of onset, degree of hypotension and mortality. We measured serum concentrations of the protective antigen (PA) toxin component at various time points after infusion. Peak serum levels of PA were in the µg/mL range with half-lives of 10–20 minutes. With doses that produced hypotension with delayed lethality, we then gave bolus intravenous infusions of toxins to groups of four to six instrumented rats and continuously monitored blood pressure by telemetry. Finally, the same doses used in the telemetry experiments were given to additional groups of four rats, and echocardiography was performed pretreatment and one, two, three and twenty-four hours post-treatment. LeTx and EdTx each produced hypotension. We observed a doubling of the velocity of propagation and 20% increases in left ventricular diastolic and systolic areas in LeTx-treated rats, but not in EdTx-treated rats. EdTx-but not LeTx-treated rats showed a significant increase in heart rate. These results indicate that LeTx reduced left ventricular systolic function and EdTx reduced preload. Uptake of toxins occurs readily into tissues with biological effects occurring within minutes to hours of serum toxin concentrations in the µg/mL range. LeTx and EdTx yield an irreversible shock with subsequent death. These findings should provide a basis for the rational design of drug interventions to reduce the dismal prognosis of systemic anthrax infections."
https://openalex.org/W2067530429,"Arabidopsis thaliana contains multiple carboxyesterases (AtCXEs) with activities toward xenobiotics, including herbicide esters that are activated to their phytotoxic acids upon hydrolysis. On the basis of their susceptibility to inhibition by organophosphates, these AtCXEs are all serine hydrolases. Using a trifunctional probe bearing a fluorophosphonate together with biotin and rhodamine to facilitate detection and recovery, four dominant serine hydrolases were identified in the proteome of Arabidopsis. Using a combination of protein purification, capture with the trifunctional probe and proteomics, one of these hydrolases, AtCXE12, was shown to be the major carboxyesterase responsible for hydrolyzing the pro-herbicide methyl-2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D-methyl) to the phytotoxic acid 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Recombinant expression of the other identified hydrolases showed that AtCXE12 was unique in hydrolyzing 2,4-D-methyl. To determine the importance of AtCXE12 in herbicide metabolism and efficacy, the respective tDNA knock-out (atcxe12) plants were characterized and shown to lack expression of AtCXE12 and have greatly reduced levels of 2,4-D-methyl-hydrolyzing activity.

A diverse range of synthetic compounds enter plants as pollutants or crop protection agents and undergo four phases of metabolism; namely, the introduction of reactive functional groups (phase 1), bioconjugation with polar natural products (phase 2), conjugate transport into the vacuole (phase 3), and finally phase 4 mineralization or incorporation into macromolecules (1Sandermann H. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 1360-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have termed this xenobiotic detoxifying system the xenome and are currently functionally characterizing its components in a range of plants (2Edwards R. Brazier M. Dixon D.P. Cummins I. Adv. Bot. Res. 2005; 42: 1-32Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An important group of phase 1 enzymes that have received very little attention in plants are the xenobiotic-hydrolyzing carboxylesterases (CXEs). 3The abbreviations used are: CXE, carboxylesterase; 2,4-D, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; pNA, p-nitrophenyl acetate; αNA, α-naphthyl acetate; 2,4-D-methyl, methyl-2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate; TriFP, trifunctional fluorophosphonate; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry. 3The abbreviations used are: CXE, carboxylesterase; 2,4-D, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; pNA, p-nitrophenyl acetate; αNA, α-naphthyl acetate; 2,4-D-methyl, methyl-2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate; TriFP, trifunctional fluorophosphonate; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry. These plant enzymes detoxify persistent pollutants (3Krell H.W. Sandermann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 143: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and insecticides (4Preiss U. Wallnofer P.R. Engelhardt G. Pestic. Sci. 1988; 23: 13-24Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as hydrolyzing pro-herbicide esters to their bioactive free acids (5Cummins I. Edwards R. Plant J. 2004; 39: 894-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Haslam R. Raveton M. Cole D.J. Pallet K.E. Coleman J.O.D. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 71: 178-189Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the latter case, many major classes of herbicides are applied as esters to facilitate penetration into the leaf. Ester hydrolysis within the leaf is then required to bioactivate the herbicide, and the rate of cleavage is an important determinant of selective action in crops and weeds (7Nandula V.K. Messersmith C.G. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 68: 148-155Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Ruiz-Santaella J.P. Heredia A. De Prado R. Planta. 2006; 223: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using a classification system based on the sensitivity of hydrolases to inhibition by organophosphate insecticides, herbicide-active CXEs in wheat and competing grass weeds are of the B-type (9Cummins I. Burnet M. Edwards R. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 113: 477-485Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Haslam R. Raveton M. Cole D.J. Pallet K.E. Coleman J.O.D. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 71: 178-189Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). B-class CXEs use a catalytic serine, with this residue undergoing irreversible covalent modification by organophosphates on binding. The modified catalytic serine residue is part of a conserved Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad that is found in a large number of hydrolytic enzymes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, most classically in the α/β-hydrolase-fold proteins (10Oakeshott J.G. Claudianos C. Russell R.J. Robin G.C. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Heikinheimo P. Golman A. Jeffries C. Ollis D.L. Structure. 1999; 7 (-R146): R141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis contains several superfamilies of α/β-hydrolase-fold proteins, the best characterized being the serine proteases (12Tripathi L.P. Sowdhamini R. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7 (, Art No 200)Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this well characterized active site chemistry has been recruited for multiple functions in plant metabolism, notably the hydrolysis of amide and carboxylic ester bonds, dehydrations, transacylations, and lyase functions (13Fraser C.M. Rider L.W. Chapple C. Plant Phys. 2005; 138: 1136-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).With respect to the hydrolases active toward xenobiotic carboxylic esters (see Fig. 1A), some progress has recently been made in identifying xenobiotic-hydrolyzing serine hydrolases in tobacco (14Baudouin E. Charpenteau M. Roby D. Marco Y. Ranjeva R. Ranty B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides L.) (5Cummins I. Edwards R. Plant J. 2004; 39: 894-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and rice (15Waöspi U. Misteli B. Hasslacher M. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Schwab H. Dudler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that the xenobiotic-hydrolyzing enzymes described are from distinct protein families. Thus, whereas the CXEs from rice and tobacco are both classic α/β-hydrolases (14Baudouin E. Charpenteau M. Roby D. Marco Y. Ranjeva R. Ranty B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Brick D.J. Brumlik M.J. Buckley J.T. Cao J.X. Davies P.C. Misra S. Tranbarger T.J. Upton C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the black-grass esterase was homologous to the unrelated microbial GDS hydrolase superfamily (16Brick D.J. Brumlik M.J. Buckley J.T. Cao J.X. Davies P.C. Misra S. Tranbarger T.J. Upton C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This example of convergent functional evolution is in contrast to all the other enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism in plants. Thus, the phase 1 cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases (17Schuler M.A. Crit. Revs. Plant Sci. 1996; 15: 235-284Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the phase 2 glutathione transferases (18Dixon D.P. Lapthorn A. Edwards R. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (.10): 3004.1-3004Crossref Google Scholar) and glucosyltransferases (19Bowles D. Isayenkova J. Lim E.K. Poppenberger B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and the phase 3 ATP-binding cassette transporters (20Rea P.A. Li Z.-S. Lu Y.-P. Drozdowicz Y.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 727-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), are each derived from divergent superfamilies.The presence of multiple esterase gene families in the plant xenome is further complicated by the lack of correlation between activities of individual enzymes toward “model” xenobiotic esters and “real” pollutants and pesticides. Thus, the major esterase in wheat with activity toward the general colorimetric substrates p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNA, Fig. 1A) and α-naphthyl acetate (αNA) had negligible activities toward herbicides used in this crop (9Cummins I. Burnet M. Edwards R. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 113: 477-485Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Conversely, a 40-kDa esterase from the weed black-grass, which hydrolyzed aryloxyphenoxypropionate esters such as clodinafop-propargyl (Fig. 1A) to the respective herbicidal acids had little activity toward substrates used in colorimetric assays (5Cummins I. Edwards R. Plant J. 2004; 39: 894-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Based on these fragmentary data derived from multiple species, there was a need to develop new tools to functionally characterize the large numbers of CXEs in plants. Based on approaches applied to functional proteomics in animal cells (21Adam G.C. Sorenson E.J. Cravatt B.F. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 828-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we now report on the use of chemical probes to identify CXEs involved in xenobiotic detoxification in Arabidopsis. The trifunctional probe used had a fluorophosphonate group that covalently modified reactive serine residues in the active sites of expressed AtCXEs, a biotin tag to facilitate recovery of labeled proteins and a fluorophore (rhodamine) for detection and quantification (see Fig. 2A). Using a combination of classic enzyme purification and this “chemotyping” probe, we have isolated the CXE in Arabidopsis plants responsible for the selective hydrolysis and hence bioactivation of the pro-herbicide methyl 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D-methyl) to the phytotoxic 2,4-D acid (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Use of TriFP to identify serine hydrolases in Arabidopsis.

Seed from the SAIL tDNA insertion mutant SAIL_445_G03 was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (Nottingham, UK). Arabidopsis knock-out and wild-type (Columbia) plants were maintained as described previously (23Brazier-Hicks M. Edwards R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the toxicity studies with young plants (28 days), treatments of 2,4-D-methyl or 2,4-D were spray-applied in 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 at 0, 2, 5, or 10 mg liter-1 each at a rate of 360 ml m-2, equivalent to field applications of 36, 18, and 7.2 g of active ingredient Ha-1, respectively. Plants were then assessed for injury at timed intervals, with all treatments carried out in triplicate.Analysis of tDNA Knockouts—Homozygous plants were selected using the primers: left product (LP), ACCAAGATCCACTAAAATTCATC; right product (RP), GATGTTTGCTCCTGCACTGTC; and SAIL left border (LB), TTCATAACCAATCTCGATACAC. The site of tDNA insertion was then confirmed by sequencing the PCR products obtained using the LB and RP, and LB and LP primer pairs, respectively.Synthesis and Use of a Trifunctional Chemotyping Probe—The generation of the trifunctional fluorophosphonate (TriFP) probe utilized the modular synthetic strategy described for the synthesis of the corresponding sulfonate ester probes (21Adam G.C.

Separately, α-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc))-lysine conjugated with biotin through its carboxyl function and with tetramethylrhodamine through its ɛ-amine function was prepared (21Adam G.C. Sorenson E.J. Cravatt B.F. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 828-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Fmoc protecting group was removed by treating (14 mg and 5 μmol) of the bifunctional linker with 5 ml of 4 n HCl in dioxane for 60 min at room temperature. After drying under a stream of N2, the deprotected intermediate was dissolved in methanol (3 ml) containing NaHCO3 (5 mg) and reacted with freshly prepared 10-((fluoroethoxyphosphinyl)-N-hydroxysuccinyl)decanamide (1.9 mg and 5 μmol). After reacting under argon for 4 h at room temperature, solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the TriFP purified by preparative reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography C18 column using an increasing linear gradient of water: MeCN (95:5, v/v) to MeCN. The final product (0.2 μmol) was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS m/z = 1134.38 (C58H82FN8O10PS requires 1134.38 Da).TriFP (5 μm) was incubated with protein (1 ml) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) for 60 min at 37 °C. Labeled proteins were then either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE, or subjected to affinity chromatography by mixing with streptavidin-Sepharose (40 μl of 50% slurry) in the presence of SDS (0.2% w/v) on an end-over-end mixer (60 min). The streptavidin-Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml of SDS (0.2% w/v), followed by 2 × 1 ml distilled water. The beads were then heated to 90 °C in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer to solubilize the biotinylated polypeptides.CXE Assay—Esterase assays with pNA were colorimetrically determined, whereas the hydrolysis of the pesticide esters was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (9Cummins I. Burnet M. Edwards R. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 113: 477-485Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All activities were determined in duplicate and corrected for non-enzymic hydrolysis by using boiled protein controls. CXE activity toward αNA was visualized following isoelectric focusing of protein preparations after an inhibitory pre-treatment ± 0.1 mm paraoxon (9Cummins I. Burnet M. Edwards R. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 113: 477-485Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar).CXE Purification and Proteomic Analysis—AtCXEs were purified from Arabidopsis suspension cultures using the protocol previously described, using sequential chromatography of active fractions on DEAE, butyl-Sepharose, and Mono Q fast-protein liquid chromatography (5Cummins I. Edwards R. Plant J. 2004; 39: 894-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CXE activity was monitored in fractions using pNA and 2,4-D-methyl as substrates. In the final stages, the TriFP was used to label active CXEs for concentration by streptavidin affinity chromatography prior to resolution of the polypeptides present by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% gels (5Cummins I. Edwards R. Plant J. 2004; 39: 894-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proteins labeled with the TriFP fluorescence tag were visualized using a Fuji FLA-3000 Imager, and the respective bands were excised and digested with trypsin prior to analysis on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) as described (22Loutre C. Dixon D.P. Brazier M. Slater M. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mass ions were used to screen a non-redundant Arabidopsis protein data base using Mascot (Matrix Science).Cloning of AtCXEs—The AtCXEs identified by proteomics were cloned using selective forward (F) and reverse (R) primer combinations. For AtCXE5 (At1g49660), F = 5′-TCATATGGAATCTGAAATCGCCTCC-3′ and R = 5′-TCTCGAGACCAATAATAAACTCGAC-3′; for AtCXE12 (At3g48690); F = 5′-TCAACTAACCATGGATTCCGAGATCGCCG-3′ and R = 5′-CGCCTCGAGGTTCCCTCCCTTAATAAACCC-3′; for AtCXE20 (At5g62180), F = 5′-TCATATGTCCGAACCAAGTCCAATC-3′ and R = 5′-TCTCGAGCAGAACAGAGAATATGAA-3′. cDNA was prepared from total RNA from the aerial tissues of flowering Arabidopsis plants and used as the template for PCR, with the amplification products cloned first into pGEMT and then pET24 for the transformation of Escherichia coli strain ROSETTA DE3 (pLysS, Novagen) as described (25Kordic S. Cummins I. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the recombinant AtCXEs was carried out essentially as previously described (25Kordic S. Cummins I. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except cultures were cooled and maintained at 10 °C when induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.Accession Numbers—Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank™/EMBL data libraries under the following accession numbers: AtCXE5, At1g49660; AtCXE12, At3g48690; and AtCXE20, At5g62180.RESULTSCXE Activities in Arabidopsis—To evaluate the usefulness of Arabidopsis as a model plant to study the hydrolytic bioactivation of herbicides, extracts from the foliage, roots, and suspension cultures were assayed against 2,4-D-methyl and the aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicide clodinafop-propargyl (Fig. 1A). The model CXE substrate pNA was also included (Fig. 1A) for reference. With the herbicide substrates, all of the tissues tested had a different range of hydrolytic activities (Fig. 1C). 2,4-D-Methyl was always the preferred substrate, particularly in suspension cultures, with lower activities being determined with clodinafop-propargyl, a herbicide used in the selective control of grass weeds in cereal crops (5Cummins I. Edwards R. Plant J. 2004; 39: 894-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that Arabidopsis plants and cultures were able to catalyze the hydrolytic bioactivation of herbicide esters, particularly 2,4-D-methyl, a compound designed to be used in the control of dicotyledonous weeds. To study the diversity of CXEs present, crude extracts from Arabidopsis foliage, roots and suspension cultures were resolved by isoelectric focusing and visualized by incubating with α-naphthyl acetate, with and without a prior treatment with the organophosphate inhibitor paraoxon (Fig. 1B). In total, 10 CXEs could be visualized by this method, all of which were sensitive to inhibition by paraoxon, demonstrating that these were all serine hydrolases (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the hydrolytic activities toward the pro-herbicides were also sensitive to inhibition by the organophosphate. The differences in esterase expression between the tissues were relatively subtle. For example, a CXE with a basic pI was present at higher levels in root cultures and foliage than in suspension culture, whereas the converse was true for an enzyme with a pI of pH 5.1. Based on these results it was concluded that Arabidopsis cell cultures were an excellent source of CXEs with activity toward 2,4-D-methyl and that the respective enzymes were serine hydrolases.Identifying Serine Hydrolases in Arabidopsis—The zymogen analysis showing the presence of multiple CXEs sensitive to inhibition by organophosphates suggested that this labeling chemistry could be used to identify the respective proteins using a directed proteomics approach. The method adopted involved the preparation of a customized trifunctional probe bearing a fluorophosphonate labeling group, a biotin recovery tag, and a rhodamine fluorescent reporter function (Fig. 2A). The TriFP probe was synthesized and purified, and its identity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS prior to use. Total protein extracts from Arabidopsis plants and cell cultures were incubated with the TriFP, and the resulting labeled proteins recovered using streptavidin affinity chromatography. The tagged proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the dominant fluorescently labeled polypeptides excised and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS-based proteomics (Fig. 2B). Four polypeptides were identified as the major expressed serine hydrolases, namely prolyl-oligopeptidase (At1g76140), and three serine hydrolases of unknown function: a 46-kDa putative GDS-type hydrolase, a 36-kDa putative CXE previously termed AtCXE12 (At3g48690, Marshall, et al. 26Marshall S.D.G. Putterill J.J. P Lummer K.M. Newcomb R.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and a 27-kDa lysophospholipase-like CXE (At5g20060). The screen was useful for defining the relative abundance of expressed serine hydrolases in Arabidopsis and confirmed the diversity of proteins bearing this catalytic mechanism. The utility of the TriFP in identifying serine hydrolases in crude plant extracts suggested that it would also be a useful tool in helping purify and identify low abundance AtCXEs associated with specific hydrolytic activities. Thus, a chemotyping probe with fluorophosphonate functionality could be employed in the final stages of enzyme enrichment to unambiguously identify serine hydrolases present and affinity-concentrate them for MS-based proteomics.Purification of AtCXEs—The CXEs responsible for the hydrolysis of 2,4-D-methyl in Arabidopsis suspension cultures were purified from a crude protein extract using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and separation based on anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies (Table 1). First, proteins precipitated between 40 and 80% ammonium sulfate saturation were resolved using a DEAE-Sepharose column. CXE activity toward 2,4-D-methyl eluted in two pools, with the majority recovered in peak DEAE 2 (supplemental Fig. S1A). The DEAE 2 peak was applied onto a butyl Sepharose column, where it was resolved into peaks butyl 1 and 2 (supplemental Fig. S1B). These fractions were stored separately, with the major pool (butyl 2) applied onto a Mono Q fast-protein liquid chromatography column, where the activity eluted in a single sharp peak (supplemental Fig. S1C). Overall, the 2,4-D-methyl-hydrolyzing activity was purified 305-fold with 3.3% recovery using this protocol (Table 1). In contrast, when the final purified preparation was assayed with clodinafop-propargyl, the enrichment was only 30-fold in 0.3% yield, demonstrating that the CXE activity isolated was selectively enriched for the hydrolysis of 2,4-D-methyl rather than other classes of herbicide.TABLE 1Summary of the purification of the major CXE activity toward 2,4-D-methyl from Arabidopsis suspension culturesFractionTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationTotal activityTotal recoverymgpicokatals/mg-foldnanokatals%Total20502901.059210040-80% (NH4)2SO46649403.3626106DEAE6660702140167.7Butyl 20.9148930169.544.37.5Mono Q10.2287900304.519.333.3 Open table in a new tab The polypeptides present at each stage of the purification were monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). When analyzed for total protein content it was difficult to identify a single polypeptide that was being enriched by sequential purification, with the final preparation containing multiple polypeptides. This was to be expected based on the low selectivity of the chromatography steps employed and is a common feature of purifying low abundance enzymes of secondary metabolism. However, by labeling proteins from each stage of the purification with the TriFP and then using the biotin recognition tag, the identification of the active serine hydrolases in each fraction was immediately clarified, with a single 36.6-kDa polypeptide identified in the final preparation. Use was then made of the biotin affinity tag to purify the TriFP-labeled protein from the final enriched fraction using streptavidin affinity chromatography, purifying and concentrating the polypeptide for proteomic analysis in a single step (Fig. 3B). Tryptic digests of the purified protein were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and analysis of the peptide fragments identified AtCXE12 as the active hydrolase (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 3Isolation of the 2,4-D-methyl-hydrolyzing AtCXE using the TriFP.

Thus the 2,4-D-methyl-hydrolyzing activity could be resolved into distinctly eluting pools both at the stage of DEAE-anion exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1A) and on butyl-Sepharose (supplemental Fig. S1B). Attempts to isolate CXEs from the minor DEAE 1 pool proved unsuccessful due to the instability of the respective enzymes. However, when the butyl 1 fraction was applied to a Mono Q column, a broad peak of CXE activity was recovered (supplemental Fig. S3). Using the TriFP, the peak was subsequently shown to contain three distinct serine hydrolases that were analyzed by MALDI-based proteomics. All the proteins were identified as members of the AtCXE family (26Marshall S.D.G. Putterill J.J. P Lummer K.M. Newcomb R.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), namely AtCXE5 (At1g49660) with lesser amounts of AtCXE20 (At5g62180) and AtCXE12 (At3g48690) also being determined (Table 2).

A key component of growth control is the protein kinase Akt, which acts downstream of mitogens and nutrients to affect protein translation and cell cycle progression. In this study, we found that transient transfection of activated Akt triggered a 3-4-fold increase in liver size within days but only minimal hepatocyte proliferation. Akt-induced liver growth was associated with marked up-regulation of cyclin E but not cyclin D1. Analysis of liver polyribosomes demonstrated that the post-transcriptional induction of cyclin E was associated with increased translational efficiency of this mRNA, suggesting that cell growth promotes expression of this protein through a translational mechanism that is distinct from the cyclin D-E2F pathway. Treatment of Akt-transfected mice with rapamycin only partially inhibited liver growth and did not prevent the induction of cyclin E protein, indicating that target of rapamycin activity is not necessary for this response. In the enlarged livers, cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes were present in high abundance but were inactive due to increased binding of p21 to these complexes. Akt transfection of p21-/- mice promoted liver growth, activation of Cdk2, and enhanced hepatocyte proliferation. In conclusion, growth promotes cyclin E expression through a novel translational mechanism in the liver, suggesting a new link between cell growth and the cell cycle machinery. Furthermore, p21 suppresses proliferation in the overgrown livers and may play a role in preventing cell cycle progression in response to organ size homeostatic mechanisms.

Although the terms are often used interchangeably, cell growth and proliferation reflect distinct processes. Cell growth refers to an increase in cell mass resulting from enhanced synthesis of proteins and other macromolecules, whereas proliferation refers to cell cycle progression resulting in increased cell number (1Saucedo L.J.

In many cases, extracellular stimuli, such as mitogens, promote both growth and proliferation, so that subsequent generations of cells maintain normal size. However, cell growth can be induced in the absence of proliferation, depending on the stimulus and target cell. The intracellular pathways that regulate growth are incompletely characterized, but several key mediators have been identified (1Saucedo L.J. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell Growth: Control of Cell Size. 2004: 23-48Google Scholar). In particular, signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway appears to play an important role in growth regulation. A major downstream target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase is the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B), which regulates diverse processes, including glucose homeostasis, transcription, apoptosis, cell motility, angiogenesis, proliferation, and growth (7Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 8Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Birnbaum M.J. Trends Endocrinol.

Akt has been identified as an oncogene, and this kinase is frequently activated in malignant cells (11Altomare D.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7455-7464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have implicated Akt signaling as an important mediator of cell and organ growth. For example, interruption of Akt signaling impairs growth in Drosophila, whereas constitutive activation of Akt leads to enlarged organ size (12Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 13Staveley B.E. Ruel L. Jin J. Stambolic V. Mastronardi F.G. Heitzler P. Woodgett J.R. Manoukian A.S. Curr.

In transgenic mice, overexpression of active forms of Akt in cardiomyocytes, islet cells, and skeletal muscle leads to cardiomegaly, increased pancreatic β cell mass, and muscle hypertrophy, respectively (14Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 15Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M.

Studies in cell culture systems indicate that Akt promotes growth by regulating several components of the translational apparatus, including the target of rapamycin (TOR) 2The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; RT, reverse transcription; Rb, retinablastoma protein; WT, wild-type. pathway (17Gingras A.C.

However, there is relatively little published information about the targets of Akt signaling in in vivo models. In addition to regulating growth, Akt promotes proliferation in some systems (reviewed in Refs. 9Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 10Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7391-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Altomare D.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7455-7464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Progression through the cell cycle is controlled by the activity of protein kinase complexes consisting of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and associated regulatory proteins (20Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Studies in a number of models have demonstrated that Akt regulates cyclin-CDK activity and cell cycle progression through several mechanisms. For example, Akt has been shown to induce expression of cyclin D1, a key G1 phase regulatory protein, through enhanced translation and impaired protein degradation (21Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Akt can also inactivate the CDK inhibitor proteins p21 and p27, thereby promoting CDK activity and cell cycle progression (9Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Although Akt is generally thought to play a proproliferative role, other reports have shown that this kinase can also lead to cell cycle inhibition. In endothelial cells, constitutive Akt activation leads to a senescence-like cell cycle arrest through a p53- and p21-dependent pathway (22Miyauchi H. Minamino T. Tateno K. Kunieda T. Toko H. Komuro I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with constitutively active Akt in thymocytes show cellular enlargement but no change in cell cycle distribution in vivo (23Malstrom S. Tili E. Kappes D. Ceci J.D. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, thymocytes with constitutively active Akt demonstrated enhanced cell cycle progression in culture, suggesting that organ size control mechanisms prevented cell cycle progression in vivo but not in culture (23Malstrom S. Tili E. Kappes D. Ceci J.D. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The available data suggest that the effects of Akt signaling on cell cycle progression are complex and are probably dependent upon both the cell type and extracellular cues. In the current work, we examined the regulation of hepatocyte growth and cell cycle progression by constitutively active Akt expression in vivo. As expected from other studies (14Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 15Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), Akt activation led to marked liver growth in the absence of substantial proliferation. Despite the lack of proliferation, liver growth was associated with increased expression of the cell cycle proteins, particularly cyclin E. The induction of cyclin E involved a translational mechanism, establishing a new link between cell growth and expression of this protein. Our data also suggest the existence of a p21-dependent cell cycle checkpoint that may be related to organ size homeostatic mechanisms. Animals—All animal studies were completed following IACUC-approved techniques and National Institutes of Health guidelines. Eight-week-old male BALB/c (Harlan Sprague-Dawley), or p21-/- or p21+/+ (The Jackson Laboratories) mice were injected with 6 × 109 plaque-forming units via tail vein injection of E1-deleted recombinant adenoviruses encoding Akt, cyclin D1, E2F2, or a β-galactosidase control vector followed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) injection, liver harvest, and processing as previously described (25Nelsen C.J.

Additional antibodies used were ph-Cdk2 (Thr-160) (catalog number 2561, ph-Cdk2 (Tyr-15) (catalog number 9111), ph-Akt (Ser-473) (catalog number 9271) (Cell Signaling Technology), and Cdk1 sc-54 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Quantification of mRNA by Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA from each liver was isolated and quantified as previously described (26Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3656-3663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RNA (5 μg) was treated with DNase I (DNA-free™; Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of each RNA sample with a Taqman reverse transcriptase reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) primed with oligo(dT). The cyclin E primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (upper, 5′-CACCACTGAGTGCTCCAGAA-3′; lower, 5′-CCACATTTGCTCACAACCAC-3′). Real time PCR was performed using the Light Cycler DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Primers were used at a concentration of 0.5 μm, and MgCl2 was used at 2.4 mm. Samples were denatured for 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. Samples were normalized to β-actin, and relative amounts were calculated as recommended by the manufacturer. Quantification of cyclin E mRNA by real time RT-PCR in polysome fractions was carried out as described above and expressed as a percentage of total RNA from each liver sample. RNA Isolation and Polyribosome Preparations—Mouse livers were removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. 300 mg of frozen liver tissue was placed in a Dounce homogenizer with 375 μl of low salt buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2), supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 units of RNase inhibitor, and 1 mg/ml cyclohexamide and crushed with three slow strokes of the tight pestle. The homogenizer was incubated on ice for 5 min, and 125 μl of lysis buffer (0.2 m sucrose, 1.2% Triton X-100 in low salt buffer) was added. The tissue was homogenized with 20 strokes of the tight pestle. The homogenate was removed and microcentrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 s to pellet insoluble material. The supernatant was removed to a new tube containing 50 μl of heparin (1000 USP units/ml) and 15 μl of 5 m NaCl. Equivalent A260 units of the supernatants were layered onto a 5-ml, 0.5-1.5 m linear sucrose gradient (in low salt buffer) and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55 rotor for 80 min at 4 °C. The polyribosome stratified RNA was fractionated using an ISCO density gradient fractionator as previously described (32Li S. Takasu T. Perlman D.M. Peterson M.S. Burrichter D. Avdulov S.

Ten fractions of 0.5 ml were collected into tubes containing 50 ml of 10% SDS. RNA in the fractions was purified using Tri-reagent (Sigma) and precipitated overnight with 0.5 volumes of isopropyl alcohol. Akt Induces Massive Liver Growth—Transfection of an activated form of Akt promoted liver growth beginning at 1 day after transfection (Fig. 1A) (24Ono H. Shimano H. Katagiri H. Yahagi N. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Anai M. Ogihara T. Fujishiro M. Viana A.Y. Fukushima Y. Abe M. Shojima N. Kikuchi M. Yamada N. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). At 6 days, the livers had nearly quadrupled in size. Microscopy revealed cytoplasmic changes compatible with increased hepatocyte fat and glycogen stores (data not shown) as recently reported following Akt transfection in the liver (24Ono H. Shimano H. Katagiri H. Yahagi N. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Anai M. Ogihara T. Fujishiro M. Viana A.Y. Fukushima Y. Abe M. Shojima N. Kikuchi M. Yamada N. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that cyclin D1 promotes liver growth (25Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3656-3663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although less dramatically than Akt. Cyclin D1 also induces robust hepatocyte proliferation (DNA synthesis and mitosis) in the absence of other mitogenic stimuli, particularly at time points from 1 to 3 days (25Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Akt induced little DNA synthesis as measured by BrdUrd incorporation into hepatocyte nuclei (Fig. 1B), and very few mitoses were seen in these livers (data not shown). Forward angle light scattering analysis of isolated hepatocytes demonstrated that Akt induced a substantial increase in hepatocyte size (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed an increased number of polyploid nuclei in the Akt-transfected mice (Fig. 1D), which are common in normal liver and frequently observed under conditions of hepatocyte cell cycle arrest (34Gupta S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, Akt induces marked liver and hepatocyte growth without triggering a proportional response in hepatocyte proliferation. Regulation of Cell Cycle Proteins by Akt—Because Akt is known to regulate the cell cycle in some systems (9Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 10Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7391-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Altomare D.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7455-7464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), we examined the expression of cell cycle proteins in our model. As expected, transfection of Akt was associated with phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, indicating activation of Akt (Fig. 2). At 1 day after transfection, no induction of cell cycle proteins was observed, in contrast to cyclin D1-transfected livers, which show robust proliferation at this time point (25Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that Akt signaling does not directly regulate cell cycle protein expression prior to the induction of growth. On the other hand, in livers that had undergone substantial growth at 6 days after Akt transfection, we were surprised to find significant up-regulation of proteins associated with the G1 and S phases (such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin A, cyclin E, and Cdk1) despite the minimal proliferative response (Figs. 1 and 2). In particular, cyclin E expression was higher at the 6 day time point following Akt transfection than in livers transfected with cyclin D1 for 1 day. Notably, Akt did not induce detectable cyclin D1 expression at any time point. Total levels of cyclin D3, Cdk2, and Cdk4 were modestly increased by Akt. Phosphorylation of Cdk2 at its activating site (Thr-160) was increased to levels greater than that observed in the cyclin D1-transfected mice, and phosphorylation at its inhibitory site was similar in the two models. We did not observe marked changes in the expression of the p27 CDK inhibitor, but p21 was substantially induced after 6 days. These results demonstrate that Akt-mediated liver growth promotes both proliferative and anti-proliferative changes in cell cycle protein expression and phosphorylation. Regulation of Cyclin E Expression by Akt and Growth—The marked induction of cyclin E protein at 6 days (but not 1 day) after Akt transfection was puzzling given the lack of cyclin D1 expression and cell cycle activity. Prevailing models of cell cycle control suggest that cyclin E is induced by E2F-mediated transcription following partial inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) and related pocket proteins by cyclin D1-Cdk4 (20Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). To examine this further, we measured the expression of cyclin E mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). At 1 day after cyclin D1 transfection, which is associated with activation of cyclin D1-Cdk4 kinase activity (25Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar), cyclin E mRNA was induced ∼140-fold, presumably due to E2F-mediated transcription. Similarly, transfection with E2F2 for 1 day, which promotes robust hepatocyte DNA synthesis, 3E. A. Hanse, C. J. Nelsen, and J. H. Albrecht, manuscript in preparation. also markedly induced cyclin E mRNA. At 1 day after Akt transfection, cyclin E mRNA was increased ∼4-fold, indicating that Akt signaling does promote modestly increased expression of this mRNA in the liver despite the lack of protein expression. At the 6 day time point, cyclin E mRNA was up-regulated to a similar extent as at 1 day (p not significant), but the expression of cyclin E protein was markedly induced to levels even higher than at 1 day after cyclin D1 transfection (Fig. 2). In a previous study (25Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar), we found that at 6 days after cyclin D1 transfection, when the liver had undergone marked growth, we saw more induction of cyclin E protein than at 1 day, although cyclin D1-Cdk4 activity and BrdUrd uptake were diminished at the later time point. At the 6 day time point after cyclin D1 transfection, there is enlargement of hepatocytes (26Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K. Albrecht J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3656-3663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This suggested that cyclin E overexpression in these enlarged livers may be regulated by a common mechanism following either Akt or cyclin D1 expression. Indeed, we now show that the expression of cyclin E mRNA was only modestly induced at 6 days after cyclin D1 transfection (Fig. 3A), in contrast to the situation at 1 day, whereas cyclin E protein is markedly induced (Fig. 3B) (25Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of cyclin E protein does not parallel the expression of its mRNA in these models, and this protein appears to be disproportionately up-regulated relative to its mRNA following hepatocyte growth induced by either Akt or cyclin D1. Previous review articles have suggested the possibility that cyclin E translation may be enhanced in states of cell growth, although direct evidence is lacking (5Garcia Z. Kumar A. Marques M. Cortes I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Edgar B.A. Hall M.N. Raff M.C. Thomas G. Cell Growth: Control of Cell Size. 2004: 23-48Google Scholar). To examine this further, we performed sucrose density centrifugation of liver extracts to isolate polysomes. As shown in Fig. 3B, cyclin E mRNA expression was shifted into heavier polysome fractions in the enlarged livers. These data suggest that the marked induction of cyclin E by Akt-mediated liver growth is due, at least in part, to increased translational efficiency of its mRNA. This supports the concept that cyclin E may act as a “sensor” of cell growth through a translational mechanism and thus may link growth to the cell cycle machinery (5Garcia Z. Kumar A. Marques M. Cortes I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Edgar B.A. Hall M.N. Raff M.C. Thomas G. Cell Growth: Control of Cell Size. 2004: 23-48Google Scholar). Involvement of TOR Signaling in Akt-mediated Cell Growth and Cyclin E Expression—The mechanisms by which Akt regulates cell growth and proliferation are incompletely characterized, but signaling through TOR and downstream effectors represents one important pathway (1Saucedo L.J. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

To examine the involvement of TOR in the hepatic effects of Akt activation, we treated animals with the specific inhibitor rapamycin, which inhibits hepatocyte growth and proliferation in response to 70% partial hepatectomy and mitogens (26Nelsen C.J.

Compared with vehicle-treated control animals, rapamycin diminished Akt-mediated liver growth by 24% at the 6 day time point, but the liver size was still markedly greater than normal (Fig. 4A). As expected, rapamycin completely inhibited phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, which is a downstream target of TOR signaling (Fig. 4B) (26Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Tucker M.M. Hansen L.K.

Because the Fenton reactant H2O2 is continuously released by inflammatory cells, a tight regulation of iron homeostasis is required. Here, we show that exposure of cultured cells to sustained low levels of H2O2 that mimic its release by inflammatory cells leads to up-regulation of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), the major iron uptake protein. The increase in TfR1 results in increased transferrin-mediated iron uptake and cellular accumulation of the metal. Although iron regulatory protein 1 is transiently activated by H2O2, this response is not sufficient to stabilize TfR1 mRNA and to repress the synthesis of the iron storage protein ferritin. The induction of TfR1 is also independent of transcriptional activation via hypoxia-inducible factor 1α or significant protein stabilization. In contrast, pulse experiments with 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine revealed an increased rate of TfR1 synthesis in cells exposed to sustained low H2O2 levels. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of iron accumulation by sustained H2O2, based on the translational activation of TfR1, which could provide an important (patho) physiological link between iron metabolism and inflammation.

Systemic iron homeostasis undergoes typical changes during inflammatory or infectious conditions.

Anning P.B. Nicholson A.G. Evans T.W. Quinlan G.J. Eur. Respir. J. 2003; 22: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Upon activation, inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages undergo an “oxidative burst” that results in the release of large amounts of reactive oxygen species to kill invading bacteria (19Klebanoff S.J. Snyderman R. Phagocytic Cells: Products of Oxygen Metabolism. Raven Press, New York1988: 391-444Google Scholar). The membrane-associated NADPH-oxidase (NOX2) first generates superoxide that is rapidly dismutated to the more stable H2O2 by superoxide dismutases (20Geiszt M. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51715-51718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, during inflammation, cells and tissues are exposed to sustained concentrations of H2O2 demanding a tight regulation of iron homeostasis to prevent tissue damage via Fenton and Fentonlike reactions. The activation of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) by H2O2 has been proposed as a regulatory link between cellular iron homeostasis and inflammation. IRP1 regulates the expression of several proteins by post-transcriptional mechanisms. In iron-deficient cells, the mRNA of TfR1 is stabilized upon binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to iron-responsive elements (IREs) within its 3′-untranslated region (21Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Earlier work showed that the IRE binding activity of IRP1 is induced by H2O2 (22Martins E.A. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, exposure of cultured cells or intact rat liver to H2O2 at quantities that are commonly released by inflammatory cells rapidly activate IRP1 within 30–60 min (24Mueller S. Pantopoulos K.

Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Importantly, IRP1 activation by H2O2 was sufficient to increase TfR1 expression in B6 fibroblasts (26Caltagirone A. Weiss G. Pantopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). TfR1 expression is also controlled transcriptionally; one mechanism involves the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which binds to a conserved binding site within the TfR1 promoter (27Lok C.N. Ponka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24147-24152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28Tacchini L. Bianchi L. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24142-24146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is activated in response to hypoxia, but up-regulation of HIF-1α has also been linked to mitochondria-derived oxidative stress (29Guzy R.D. Hoyos B. Robin E. Chen H. Liu L. Mansfield K.D. Simon M.C. Hammerling U. Schumacker P.T. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 401-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Transient pulses of H2O2 are commonly employed to study the effects of this reactive oxygen intermediate in biochemical pathways. Such conditions, however, hardly mimic the continuous release of H2O2 from inflammatory cells because H2O2 is degraded rapidly by cultured cells (30Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have previously employed an enzymatic system for H2O2 generation at steadystate levels based on glucose oxidase (GOX) and catalase (CAT) (25Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol.

Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40542-40549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For methodological reasons, however, these studies were restricted to relatively short time intervals (24Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Hübner C.A. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23192-23196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In an optimized setting, we expose here cultured cells to a sustained flux of H2O2 at low, nontoxic concentrations that mimic the H2O2 release by inflammatory cells in terms of time and dose response. We show that such conditions induce the expression of TfR1, which is associated with increased transferrin-mediated iron uptake and intracellular iron accumulation. Neither IRP1 nor HIF-1α are involved in the up-regulation of TfR1 in response to such sustained low levels of H2O2. Moreover, H2O2 does not block TfR1 turnover but significantly stimulates TfR1 expression at the translational level. We suggest that H2O2-mediated iron uptake via translational induction of TfR1 could be a general mechanism that contributes to iron accumulation and tissue damage under conditions of inflammation. Reagents—Luminol, NaOCl, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Hanks' buffer, H2O2, catalase, tetrazolium salt (MTT), glucose oxidase, and sodium azide were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), McCoy's 5A medium, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Greiner Labortechnik. Stock solutions of luminol, NaOCl, and H2O2 were prepared as described recently (32Mütze S. Hebling U. Stremmel W. Wang J. Arnhold J. Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40542-40549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human HepG2, HeLa, and HT29 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 ng/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Human colonic carcinoma HCT116 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium, and murine B6 fibroblasts were grown in supplemented DMEM containing 1000 mg/liter of glucose. The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Determination of Enzymatic Activities for Catalase and GOX—Enzymatic activities of GOX and catalase were determined at submicromolar H2O2 concentrations prior to the experiment using a sensitive chemiluminescence technique (31Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Stremmel W. Stanley P.E. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Molecular Reporting with Photons. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1997: 338-341Google Scholar, 33Mueller S. Riedel H.D. Stremmel W. Blood. 1997; 90: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Continuous measurements on supernatants of cultured cells confirmed the maintenance of steady-state concentrations of H2O2 during each experiments (30Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed as described previously using a radiolabeled human ferritin H-chain IRE probe (34Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). RNA-protein complex formation was quantified by densitometric scanning of the depicted autoradiographs. Western Blotting—The cells were solubilized directly in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer, and lysates were immediately boiled for 10 min. Equal aliquots were resolved by SDS/PAGE on 8% gels, and proteins were transferred on to nitrocellulose filters. The blots were saturated with 5% nonfat milk in PBS and probed with 1:4000 TfR1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), 1:250 HIF-1α mouse (Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), or 1:500 β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the blots were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the following dilutions: TfR monoclonal antibodies with rabbit anti-mouse IgG 1:6000, β-actin antibodies with goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:10000, and HIF-1α mouse antibodies with goat anti-mouse IgG 1:10000 dilution. Glucose oxidase was detected with a previously developed anti-GOX polyclonal antibody (35Rost D. Welker A. Welker J. Millonig G. Berger I. Autschbach F. Schuppan D. Mueller S. J. Hepatol. 2007; 46: 482-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in conjunction with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) at a dilution of 1:3000. Detection of the horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies was performed with the ECL® method (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were quantified by densitometric scanning using the TotalLab software version 1.11 (Nonlinear Dynamics Inc., Durham, NC). Determination of the Labile Iron Pool (LIP)—The LIP was measured using the metal-sensitive fluorescence probe calcein (36Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik I.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We modified the technique to allow LIP detection of attached cells. Briefly, the cells were first treated for over 24 h in the presence of H2O2 or the membrane-impermeable iron chelator desferal (desferrioxamine). The cells were then washed twice with PBS and loaded with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester at a final concentration of 5 μm for 30 min (from a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide). First fluorescence readings (F1) were taken using a Fluostar (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) in bottom read technique with a fluorescein optical filter (excitation, 465–495 nm; emission, 505 nm). Subsequently, the cells were depleted of iron in the presence of the membrane-permeable iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone for 30 min (38Laskey J. Webb I. Schulman H.M. Ponka P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and a second measurement of fluorescence was performed (F2). After background subtraction, this protocol allowed us to determine the F2/F1 ratio as relative indicator of LIP independent of the cell number and distribution within the wells. Northern Blotting—RNA prepared with the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) was analyzed by Northern blotting with 32P-radio-labeled mouse TfR1, hepcidin, or rat β-actin cDNA probes (23Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Oxygen Measurements and Induction of Hypoxia—Oxygen was measured using a computer-driven oxygen electrode Oxi 325-B (WTW, Weilheim, Germany). The electrode was calibrated with air-saturated water (21%). Permanent magnetic stirring was necessary to facilitate oxygen exchange at the membrane side of the oxygen electrode. To induce hypoxia, an custom-made oxygen chamber was used and equilibrated with a prepared gas mixture of 3% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 92% nitrogen (Lifegas). Iron Uptake Experiments—Transferrin-mediated iron uptake experiments were carried out as described in Ref. 39Riedel H.D. Muckenthaler M.U. Gehrke S.G. Mohr I. Brennan K. Herrmann T. Fitscher B.A. Hentze M.W. Stremmel W. Blood. 1999; 94: 3915-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, uptake experiments of 59Fe-labeled diferric transferrin (holotransferrin) were performed in 6-cm dishes at 37 °C for 30 min in 1 ml of buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 1 ml 1 m NaOH. Radioactivity of lysates was determined using a Cobra II Auto Gamma counter (Canberra Packard, Meriden, CT). For all of the uptake experiments, the controls were incubated on ice to determine nonspecific binding of holotransferrin to the cell membrane. The 0 °C values were subtracted from the 37 °C values to determine net uptake rates. Analysis of TfR1 mRNA Levels by Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cell culture using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). TfR1 and control β-actin mRNA transcripts were quantified by a two-step RT-PCR with the Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system. cDNA synthesis was performed with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transcripts were amplified in duplicates with specific sense and antisense QuantiTect® primers (Qiagen). The thermal cycler profile consisted of a total reaction volume of 50 μl that underwent a 95 °C activation for 10 min, followed by 40 repetitions of the following three steps: 95 °C denaturation for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and a 33-s extension period at 72 °C. Transcripts were detected with the QuantiTect SYBR® Green kit. TfR1/β-actin ratios were calculated using LightCycler sequence detection software v1.2. TfR1 Protein Stability and Synthesis—For protein stability, the cells were metabolically labeled for 1 h with (50 μCi/ml) trans-35S label, a mixture of 70:30 [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN, Irvine, CA) in RPMI methionine/cysteine-free medium prior to GOX treatment. Following the 1-h pulse, the cells were chased with cold medium in the absence or presence of GOX treatment. In contrast, the rate of protein synthesis was determined by first incubating the cells in cold medium with or without GOX and subsequently metabolically labeling the cells for 1 h. Following both the protein stability and synthesis studies, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 1 mg of lysates was subjected to quantitative immunoprecipitation with 2 μl of mouse monoclonal TfR (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Radioactive bands were quantified by phosphorimaging. Cytotoxicity Studies—Cell viability was determined with the MTT assay (40Mueller S. Cadenas E. Schonthal A.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 156-163PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, conversion of the tetrazolium salt (MTT) into a blue formazan product was detected using a 96-well plate reader (Fluostar, BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) at 570 nm. The cells were treated with different activities of glucose oxidase and catalase in culture medium for 24 h in 96-well plates at 37 °C. After two washing steps with PBS, MTT was added to each well (0.5 mg/ml), the cells were incubated for further 4 h at 37 °C and, finally, 10% SDS in 0.01 m HCl was added to lyse the cells. The samples were incubated overnight, and the absorbance was measured. Generation of Sustained H2O2 in Cultured Cells under Nontoxic Conditions—Optimization of the previously developed GOX/CAT system (30Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Stremmel W. Stanley P.E.

Levels and flux of H2O2 by GOX are lower or resemble those of activated leukocytes in vivo (0.2 μm s–1 or < 10 μm) (41Mueller S. Arnhold J. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1995; 10: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using an ultrasensitive H2O2 assay (30Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41Mueller S. Arnhold J. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1995; 10: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we show (Fig. 1A) that H2O2 is maintained at a constant concentration of ∼5 μm over the entire time interval of 24 h, indicating that GOX remains stable under these experimental conditions and the substrates glucose and oxygen are not depleted. Cell cultures could be exposed to GOX/CAT over several days, and such experiments were only limited by cellular confluence and eventual growth arrest. The media were always replaced every 12 or 24 h to prevent glucose depletion. We then examined whether under the above experimental conditions toxicity/growth inhibition was associated with H2O2 concentrations or flux by varying GOX amounts or ratios of GOX/CAT (32Mütze S. Hebling U. Stremmel W. Wang J. Arnhold J. Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40542-40549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Sureda A. Hebling U. Pons A. Mueller S. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, toxicity depended solely on the levels of H2O2 and was independent of the flux. Both GOX 1× and GOX 5× inhibited cell growth when H2O2 levels exceeded a concentration of 10 μm H2O2. Interestingly, B6 cells that were incubated with increasing GOX without the additional external catalase also showed growth inhibition at a steady-state concentration of 10 μm H2O2 because of the low cellular catalase activity of 0.001 s–1 (31Mueller S. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Stremmel W. Stanley P.E. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Molecular Reporting with Photons. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1997: 338-341Google Scholar). Thus, toxicity of a GOX/CAT system only depends on the concentration of H2O2 (defined by the ratio of GOX/CAT) and not the H2O2 generation rate (defined by the GOX activity), which could be linked to consumption or other metabolites. No changes in cell growth were observed with H2O2 concentrations below 5 μm, and these nontoxic conditions are tolerated well over 24 h. Sustained Exposure of Cultured Cells to Nontoxic H2O2 Concentrations Up-regulates TfR1—Long term exposure of B6 fibroblasts over 48 h to low H2O2 concentrations was accompanied by a strong induction of TfR1 expression (Fig. 2A). A slight increase (40%) of TfR1 steady-state levels was observed after 8 h, whereas maximal activation (∼3.5-fold) was manifested after 24 h and sustained up to 48 h. Excess of catalase completely blocked TfR1 up-regulation (not shown). Thus, H2O2 not only antagonized the previously reported inhibiting effect of cell growth on TfR1 expression (43Wang J. Chen G. Pantopoulos K. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) but further increased TfR1 expression. The ratios of TfR1 densities from H2O2-treated and control cells are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2A. In contrast to iron-depleting conditions, the iron storage protein ferritin was slightly up-regulated in H2O2-treated cells and more so with iron loading with hemin (Fig. 2B). Thus, prolonged exposure of B6 cells to nontoxic H2O2 concentrations strongly activates TfR1 expression and slightly up-regulates ferritin. Importantly, these data were corroborated in additional cell lines of various tissue origin (HeLa, HepG2, HCT116, and HT29). TfR1 Up-regulation in Cells Exposed to GOX/CAT Is Mediated Solely by H2O2 and Not Hypoxia—In the GOX/CAT system, the ratio of GOX/CAT activities determines the concentration of H2O2, whereas GOX defines the consumption rate of oxygen (30Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At higher concentrations, GOX significantly decreases oxygen levels in the culture medium (Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2041604111,"Interferon (IFN)-alpha subtypes exhibit differences in biological potencies based on their affinity interactions with the IFN receptor subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Using available three-dimensional structural information and computational biology, homology models of human IFN-alpha1, human IFN-alpha8, IFN alfacon-1, and murine IFN-alpha4 were derived and docked with the extracellular region of human IFNAR2 to evaluate the behavior of potential interacting residue pairs and characterize the nature of the IFN-IFNAR2 binding interfaces. The data suggest that IFN afacon-1 has 9 optimal interactions with IFNAR2, comprising hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding. Human IFN-alpha2 exhibits 8 optimal interactions, human IFN-alpha1, 7, and murine IFN-alpha4 exhibits the least number of optimal interactions, at 5. A model of IFNAR1 was generated, taking into consideration the IFNAR1 extracellular domain interaction with cell surface glycosphingolipids, putative ligand interaction residues, and residues stabilizing the structural integrity of IFNAR. IFNAR1 was then docked with the various IFN-IFNAR2 complexes to describe the complete extracellular receptor pocket with bound IFN. These data provide insights into the species specificity of IFN-alphas: residues in murine IFN-alpha4 that preclude strong affinity interactions with human IFNAR because of steric crowding and residues in human IFN-alpha8 that resemble a receptor interactive domain in murine IFN-alpha4, are described."
https://openalex.org/W2083188895,"Sulfate assimilation provides reduced sulfur for synthesis of the amino acids cysteine and methionine and for a range of other metabolites. Sulfate has to be activated prior to reduction by adenylation to adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS). In plants, algae, and many bacteria, this compound is reduced to sulfite by APS reductase (APR); in fungi and some cyanobacteria and γ-proteobacteria, a second activation step, phosphorylation to 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), is necessary before reduction to sulfite by PAPS reductase (PAPR). We found previously that the moss Physcomitrella patens is unique among these organisms in possessing orthologs of both APR and PAPR genes (Koprivova, A., Meyer, A. J., Schween, G., Herschbach, C., Reski, R., and Kopriva, S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 32195-32201). To assess the function of the two enzymes, we compared their biochemical properties by analysis of purified recombinant proteins. APR from Physcomitrella is very similar to the well characterized APRs from seed plants. On the other hand, we found that the putative PAPR preferentially reduces APS. Sequence analysis, analysis of UV-visible spectra, and determination of iron revealed that this new APR, named PpAPR-B, does not contain the FeS cluster, which was previously believed to determine the substrate specificity of the otherwise relatively similar enzymes. The lack of the FeS cluster in PpAPR-B catalysis is connected with a lower turnover rate but higher stability of the protein. These findings show that APS reduction without the FeS cluster is possible and that plant sulfate assimilation is predominantly dependent on reduction of APS.

In these compounds, sulfur is present in the reduced form of organic thiols; however, the major form of sulfur available in nature is sulfate. This has to be reduced and incorporated into organic compounds in the sulfate assimilation pathway, which is present in photosynthetic organisms, fungi, and many bacteria, but not in metazoans and bacteria adapted to a parasitic lifestyle. In the sulfate assimilation pathway, sulfate is taken up into cells by sulfate transporters. Before reduction, it is activated by adenylation to adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS), 2The abbreviations used are: APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; APR, adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PAPR, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase; PpPAPR and PpAPR-B, P. patens 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase and homolog, respectively; PpAPR, P. patens adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AtAPR, A. thaliana adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase; EcPAPR, E. coli 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase; PaAPR, P. aeruginosa adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase. which is catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase (Fig. 1). APS can be reduced directly to sulfite by APS reductase (APR) or undergo a second activation step, phosphorylation by APS kinase to 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Subsequently, PAPS is reduced by thioredoxin-dependent PAPS reductase (PAPR) to sulfite. Sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by sulfite reductase and incorporated into the amino acid acceptor of O-acetylserine (reviewed in Refs. 1Leustek T. Martin M.N. Bick J.A. Davies J.P. Annu. Rev.

APS and PAPS differ only by a single phospho group, similar to NADH and NADPH. Accordingly, APR and PAPR are homologous proteins sharing ∼20% identical amino acid residues, including two highly conserved domains, a sulfonucleotide-binding domain, and a catalytic domain containing the active-site cysteine (3Kopriva S.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14647-14657Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). APRs from plants and green algae also possess a C-terminal domain that functions as a glutaredoxin in the transfer of electrons from glutathione (9Bick J.A. Aslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8404-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by APR can be divided into three steps. In the first step, APS binds to the protein, and a reductive transfer results in sulfite bound to the active-site cysteine in a stable reaction intermediate (10Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Carroll K.S. Gao H. Chen H. Stout C.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the second step, free sulfite is released by the action of the C-terminal domain in plants or free thioredoxin in bacteria. In the third step, the glutaredoxin active site or thioredoxin is regenerated by reduction with GSH or thioredoxin reductase (10Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Carroll K.S. Gao H. Chen H. Stout C.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All available evidence points to the conclusion that the ability to reduce APS is linked to the presence of the iron-sulfur cluster (4Kopriva S. Koprivova A. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Not only do all confirmed APRs, including dissimilatory APR from sulfate-reducing bacteria, possess the FeS cluster, but when the bifunctional APR/PAPR from Bacillus subtilis is deprived of its cofactor, reduction of APS (but not PAPS) is abolished (4Kopriva S.

The iron-sulfur cluster is bound to the APR apoenzyme by three or four cysteine residues that are present in the primary sequences as two invariable pairs (3Kopriva S. Buöchert T. Fritz G. Suter M.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14647-14657Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These cysteine pairs thus seem to serve as markers to distinguish between APR and PAPR (3Kopriva S. Buöchert T. Fritz G. Suter M. Benda R. Schuönemann V. Koprivova A. Schuörmann P. Trautwein A.X. Kroneck P.M.H. Brunold C. J. Biol.

With one exception, all organisms analyzed to date possess either one or the other enzyme. The exception is the moss Physcomitrella patens (12Koprivova A. Meyer A.J. Schween G. Herschbach C. Reski R. Kopriva S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32195-32201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In attempts to confirm that APR is the only sulfate-reducing enzyme in plants by analysis of APR knock-outs in P. patens, the cDNA for the first putative PAPR from plants was cloned (12Koprivova A. Meyer A.J. Schween G. Herschbach C. Reski R. Kopriva S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32195-32201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative P. patens PAPR (PpPAPR) is more similar to the sequences of PAPRs from Escherichia coli and fungi than to the sequence of APR from P. patens (PpAPR) (Fig. 2). PpPAPR lacks the two cysteine pairs necessary for binding the FeS cluster and does not contain the thioredoxin-like C-terminal extension. However, neither the enzyme activity of the gene product nor its function in P. patens sulfate assimilation has been confirmed yet (12Koprivova A. Meyer A.J. Schween G. Herschbach C. Reski R. Kopriva S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32195-32201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the biological function of the two proteins, we performed biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins. Here, we provide evidence that, although the protein encoded by the novel cDNA is capable of PAPS reduction, it is much more active with APS as a substrate. Thus, the APS reduction catalyzed by PpPAPR is not dependent on the FeS cluster, and as a consequence, this enzyme should be renamed PpAPR-B. Plant Material—P. patens (Hedw.) B.S.G. was cultured in liquid or solid Knop medium as described (13Reski R. Abel W.O. Planta. 1985; 165: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Bioreactor cultures were grown semicontinuously in standard stirred-tank glass bioreactors in Knop medium as described (14Hohe A. Decker E.L. Gorr G. Schween G. Reski R. Plant Cell Rep. 2002; 20: 1135-1140Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Localization of PpAPR and PpPAPR—The intracellular localization of PpAPR and PpPAPR was addressed by transient expression of vectors encoding C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins. The complete open reading frames of PpAPR and PpPAPR were amplified from P. patens RNA by reverse transcription-PCR with primers APRlokfw (TCAGATCTATGGCGTTGAAGGTTGCATCAC) and APRlokrev (CTCCCGGGTTGCAATGCTTGCACAAACCCAAG), introducing BglII and SmaI restriction sites, and primers PAPRlokfw (TCGGATCCATGGCGATGGCTATGGCGGAT) and PAPRlokrev (CTCCCGGGTGTTCTACCACCAACGTGAATTCC), adding BamHI and SmaI sites, respectively. The PCR products were cleaved with the corresponding restriction enzymes and ligated into the BglII-SmaI-digested GFP reporter plasmid mAV4 (15Kircher S. Kozma-Bognar L. Kim L. Adam E. Harter K. Schaöfer E. Nagy F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1445-1456PubMed Google Scholar). As a control for plastid targeting, pCTP-GFP, corresponding to the mAV4 vector containing the chloroplast transit peptide from P. patens FtsZ2-1 (formerly called pFtsZ1-(1-93)-GFP in Ref. 16Kiessling J. Kruse S. Rensing S.A. Harter K. Decker E.L. Reski R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was used. The identity of plastids is evident from the red chlorophyll autofluorescence. The plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared with the QIAfilter plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen Inc.). Protoplasts were transiently transfected with 50 μg of circular plasmid DNA. Isolation and regeneration of protoplasts in the absence of any antibiotic drug were carried out as described previously (17Rother S. Hadeler B. Orsini J.M. Abel W.O. Reski R. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 143: 72-77Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Six days after transfection, the localization of GFP fluorescence was analyzed in live moss protoplasts by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS 4D) using 488 nm excitation and two-channel measurement of emission from 510 to 580 nm (green/GFP) as well as 590 nm (red/chlorophyll). Overexpression of PpAPR and PpPAPR in E. coli—PpAPR and PpPAPR (12Koprivova A. Meyer A.J. Schween G. Herschbach C. Reski R. Kopriva S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32195-32201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were produced in E. coli using the pET14b expression system and purified to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE with the His·Tag® system (Novagen). Enzyme Assays—APR and PAPR activities were measured as the production of [35S]sulfite, assayed as acid-volatile radioactivity. The reaction mixture contained 5 μg of recombinant PpPAPR (0.1 μg for measurements with APS) or 4 ng of recombinant PpAPR, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9), 500 mm MgSO4, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 1-200 μm [35S]PAPS (specific activity of 1.67 kBq/nmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 1-330 μm [35S]APS (synthesized according to Ref. 18Li J. Schiff J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and 5 μg of E. coli thioredoxin (Sigma) in a volume of 500 μl and was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (19Schwenn J.D. Krone F.A. Husmann K. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To analyze the pH dependence of the reaction, a series of Tris-HCl buffers with varying pH values was used. For calculation of kinetic parameters, the data were linearized according to the Lineweaver-Burk method. Protein concentrations were routinely estimated according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Determination of Iron—Iron was quantified spectrophotometrically using tripyridyltriazine (21Fischer D.S. Price D.C. Clin. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Electronic Spectra—UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Lambda 16 instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a temperature-controlled cell compartment. Bioinformatics—Sequence analysis was performed with the web-based platform Biology WorkBench (workbench.sdsc.edu/). Analysis of the P. patens genomic sequence was performed on the COSMOSS homepage (www.cosmoss.org). The subcellular localization of APR and PAPR was analyzed by programs available on-line, viz.

Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) using the neighbor-joining method and with the web-based tool PhyML (27Guindon S. Lethiec F. Duroux P. Gascuel O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), resulting in the same tree topology. The protein sequences used for analysis were obtained from the GenBank™ Data Bank as follows: Arabidopsis thaliana APR (AtAPR)-1 (NP_192370), AtAPR2 (NP_176409), and AtAPR3 (NP_193930); PpAPR (CAD22096) and PpPAPR (CAD32963); Adiantum capillus-veneris (BP918674); Ceratopteris richardii (AAT09441); Enteromorpha intestinalis (AAC26855); Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (AAM18118); Selaginella moellendorffii APR and PAPR (obtained from analysis of genomic sequence at moss.nibb.ac.jp/); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NP_250447); Burkholderia cepacia (AAD50979); Sinorhizobium meliloti (AAD55759); B. subtilis (P94498); Mycobacterium tuberculosis (P65668); E. coli (P17854); Salmonella typhimurium (P17853); Synechococcus (Q55309); Synechocystis (P72794); Saccharomyces cerevisiae (P18408); Penicillium chrysogenum (AAG24520); Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Q10270); Selaginella lepidophylla (AAT09442); and Marchantia polymorpha (combined from expressed sequence tags BJ859590 and BJ853552). Homology modeling was performed with MODELLER Version 9 and was based on the structures of E. coli PAPR (EcPAPR; Protein Data Bank code 1SUR) and P. aeruginosa APR (PaAPR; code 2GOY, chain B) (28Savage H. Montoya G. Svensson C. Schwenn J.D. Sinning I. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 895-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Chartron J. Carroll K.S. Shiau C. Gao H. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of PpAPR and PpPAPR—Physcomitrella is unique in possessing genes homologous to plant APR as well as to bacterial and fungal PAPRs. To obtain a first insight into the biological function of the two proteins, we analyzed their intracellular localization. Plant sulfate assimilation occurs in plastids. When compared with their bacterial counterparts, both PpAPR and PpPAPR contain N-terminal extensions carrying all signs of targeting peptides. Several computer prediction programs uniformly indicated localization of both proteins in plastids with high probability (Table 1). To corroborate the prediction, we created constructs coding for C-terminal fusions of PpAPR and PpPAPR with GFP and transfected Physcomitrella protoplasts. Plastid localization of both fusion proteins was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy displaying co-localization of the GFP fluorescence signals with red autofluorescence of chlorophyll (Fig. 3). The same signal distribution was obtained with a control construct encoding GFP fused to the chloroplast-targeting peptide of FtsZ2-1 (16Kiessling J. Kruse S. Rensing S.A. Harter K. Decker E.L. Reski R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distribution of the two enzymes within the moss chloroplasts differed significantly. Whereas the PpPAPR-GFP signal was uniformly distributed within the plastids, PpAPR-GFP fluorescence displayed a spotty pattern (Fig. 3) similar to that described previously for Physcomitrella hydroperoxide lyase (30Stumpe M. Bode J. Goöbel C. Wichard T. Schaaf A. Frank W. Frank M. Reski R. Pohnert G. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys.

As expected, purified PpAPR was dark yellow in color, similar to recombinant APR from A. thaliana or Lemna minor (5Kopriva S. Buöchert T. Fritz G. Suter M. Weber M. Benda R. Schaller J. Feller U.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42881-42886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas PpPAPR was colorless. The UV-visible spectrum of PpAPR was very similar to that of AtAPR2, indicating the presence of an FeS cluster as a cofactor, whereas no indication for the same cofactor was detected in the spectrum of PpPAPR (Fig. 4). These findings were confirmed by iron measurements. Although recombinant PpAPR and AtAPR2 contained 3.2 nmol of iron/nmol of protein, no iron was associated with recombinant PpPAPR (data not shown). On an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, recombinant PpAPR was detectable as a single band of 50 kDa, whereas the molecular mass of PpPAPR was 32 kDa (data not shown). Substrate Specificity of PpAPR and PpPAPR—PpAPR catalyzes the reduction of APS dependent on dithioerythritol or GSH. The properties of the enzyme are similar to those of the well characterized enzyme from A. thaliana (4Kopriva S. Koprivova A. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Kopriva S. Buöchert T. Fritz G. Suter M. Weber M. Benda R. Schaller J. Feller U. Schuörmann P. Schuönemann V. Trautwein A.X.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to AtAPR2, PpAPR was inhibited by APS concentrations >20 μm (Fig. 5A). The affinity of both enzymes for APS was very high, with an estimated Km of 6 μm (Table 2). From this, we calculated a Kcat of 37.5 s-1 and a Kcat/Km of 6.25 × 106 liter m-1s-1. PpPAPR was able to reduce PAPS in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the activity was ∼50,000-fold lower than that of PpAPR with APS as a substrate (Fig. 5B). The Km for PAPS was estimated to be 20 μm, which is comparable with that of EcPAPR known from literature (22.5 μm) (31Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Aslund F. Ritz D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7695-7698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or determined using bacterial extracts (18 μm) (Fig. 5B). Accordingly, the Kcat and Kcat/Km values were very low: 7.5 × 10-4 s-1 and 37.3 liter m-1s-1, respectively. PpAPR did not show any significant activity with PAPS as a substrate (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, however, PpPAPR was much more active with APS as a substrate than with PAPS (Fig. 5C). The APS reduction rate increased almost linearly at an APS concentration of up to 100 μm and decreased afterward to ∼50% of the maximal value. Compared with PpAPR, the APR activity of PpPAPR was several thousandfold lower at low APS concentrations, but at APS concentrations >50 μm, the difference was only ∼200-fold. The Kcat of PpPAPR for APS reduction was 0.176 s-1, leading to a Kcat/Km of 3520 liter m-1s-1. EcPAPR was not able to reduce APS at all (Fig. 5C). To confirm the substrate specificity of the PpPAPR protein, competition assays with unlabeled APS or PAPS added to the APR or PAPR assays were performed. Whereas the addition of PAPS did not affect APR activity (Fig. 5D), the addition of APS inhibited sulfite production from PAPS (Fig. 5E). Thus, the putative PAPR from P. patens, despite a high similarity to PAPRs from fungi and E. coli, catalyzes the reduction of APS. Therefore, this enzyme has been renamed PpAPR-B.TABLE 2Kinetic constants of PpAPR, PpAPR-B, and AtAPR2KmVmaxKcatKcat/Kmμmunits/mgs−1liter m−1 s−1AtAPR264537.56,250,000PpAPR64537.56,250,000PpAPR-B/APS500.330.1763520PpAPR-B/PAPS200.00140.0007537EcPAPR22.56.63.5155,000 Open table in a new tab Similar to other plant APRs, PpAPR can use both dithioerythritol and GSH as electron donors. The reaction catalyzed by PpAPR and AtAPR2 was saturated at 4 mm dithioerythritol (Fig. 6A). It needed, however, a substantially higher GSH concentration. AtAPR2 activity reached its maximum at 30 mm GSH and was inhibited by higher GSH concentrations (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, PpAPR was capable of maximal activity at GSH concentrations of 50 and 100 mm. The maximal reaction velocity of AtAPR2 was ∼50% higher with dithioerythritol than with GSH, whereas the activity of PpAPR was identical with both reductants. Because the GSH concentrations necessary for full activity were much higher than the physiological concentrations of 1-5 mm, in vivo, APR seems not to function at its full potential. PpAPR-B (but not PpAPR) was dependent on thioredoxin (Fig. 6C). The addition of thioredoxin increased PpAPR-B activity with both substrates, APS and PAPS. The APR activity of PpAPR-B was saturated at 2.5 μm thioredoxin, but PAPS-dependent sulfite production was still increasing. On the other hand, PpAPR activity was not affected by thioredoxin. This was in line with our expectations, as the protein already contains the thioredoxin-like domain necessary for electron transfer (10Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J.

Additional Characteristics of PpAPR and PpAPR-B—The pH dependence of APS reduction by PpAPR was very similar to that of AtAPR2, with low activity at pH ≤ 7 and higher activity at pH ≥ 8.5 (Fig. 7A). PpAPR-B activity in terms of APS reduction increased gradually and less markedly with increasing pH. On the other hand, the PAPS-dependent activity of PpAPR-B showed a clear optimum at pH 8 (Fig. 7B). To test whether PpAPR or AtAPR might be capable of PAPS reduction at a different pH than in the standard assay, we also measured this reaction at varying pH values. However, the two enzymes did not show any indication of PAPR activity. As a control for PAPR, an extract of E. coli was analyzed in the same way and showed a pH optimum between pH 8 and 8.5 with a slower decrease of activity at more alkaline pH (Fig. 7B). Plant APRs are very unstable enzymes because of the rapid loss of their iron-sulfur clusters (5Kopriva S. Buöchert T. Fritz G. Suter M. Weber M. Benda R. Schaller J. Feller U. Schuörmann P.

Indeed, PpAPR and AtAPR2 were completely inactivated after 1 day at -20 °C. In contrast, PpAPR-B retained 30% of its activity after the same storage time (data not shown). When kept at 4 °C, AtAPR2 started to lose activity after 24 h and was completely inactivated after 4 days. PpAPR did not lose any activity for 48 h, but the enzyme was inactivated afterward and retained only ∼15% of the initial activity at days 4 and 5. On the other hand, PpAPR-B was stable over 5 days (data not shown). The two APR isoforms of P. patens differed also in their temperature dependence. Whereas 37 °C was the optimal temperature for both of them, PpAPR was slightly more active at lower temperature, but wa"

https://openalex.org/W2113298070,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptor plays a major role in inhibitory neurotransmissions. Intronic SNPs and haplotypes in GABRB2, the gene for GABAA receptor β2 subunit, are associated with schizophrenia and correlated with the expression of two alternatively spliced β2 isoforms. In the present study, using chimpanzee as an ancestral reference, high frequencies were observed for the derived (D) alleles of the four SNPs rs6556547, rs187269, rs1816071 and rs1816072 in GABRB2, suggesting the occurrence of positive selection for these derived alleles. Coalescence-based simulation showed that the population frequency spectra and the frequencies of H56, the haplotype having all four D alleles, significantly deviated from neutral-evolution expectation in various demographic models. Haplotypes containing the derived allele of rs1816072 displayed significantly less diversity compared to haplotypes containing its ancestral allele, further supporting positive selection. The variations in DD-genotype frequencies in five human populations provided a snapshot of the evolutionary history, which suggested that the positive selections of the D alleles are recent and likely ongoing. The divergence between the DD-genotype profiles of schizophrenic and control samples pointed to the schizophrenia-relevance of positive selections, with the schizophrenic samples showing weakened selections compared to the controls. These DD-genotypes were previously found to increase the expression of β2, especially its long isoform. Electrophysiological analysis showed that this long β2 isoform favored by the positive selections is more sensitive than the short isoform to the inhibition of GABAA receptor function by energy depletion. These findings represent the first demonstration of positive selection in a schizophrenia-associated gene."
https://openalex.org/W2086326597,"G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) are serine/threonine kinases that desensitize agonist-occupied classical GPCRs. Although the insulin receptor (IR) is a tyrosine kinase receptor, the IR also couples to G-proteins and utilizes G-protein signaling components. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that GRK2 negatively regulates IR signaling. FL83B cells, derived from mouse liver, were treated with insulin and membrane translocation of GRK2 was determined using immunofluoresecence and Western blotting. Insulin caused an increase in the translocation of GRK-2 from cytosol to the plasma membrane. To determine the role of GRK2 in IR signaling, GRK2 was selectively down-regulated (∼by 90%) in FL83B cells using a small interfering RNA technique. Basal as well as insulin-induced glycogen synthesis (measured by d-[U-14C]glucose incorporation) was increased in GRK2-deficient cells compared with control cells. Similarly, GRK2 deficiency increased the basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser21 in glycogen synthase kinase-3α. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR was similar in control and GRK2-deficient cells. Basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Tyr612 in insulin receptor subunit 1 was significantly increased while phosphorylation of Ser307 was decreased in GRK2-deficient FL83B cells compared with control cells. Chronic insulin treatment (24 h) in control cells caused an increase in GRK2 (56%) and a decrease in IR (50%) expression associated with the absence of an increase in glycogen synthesis, suggesting impairment of IR function. However, chronic insulin treatment (24 h) did not decrease IR expression or impair IR effects on glycogen synthesis in GRK2-deficient cells. We conclude that (i) GRK2 negatively regulates basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis via a post-IR signaling mechanism, and (ii) GRK2 may contribute to reduced IR expression and function during chronic insulin exposure.

We conclude that (i) GRK2 negatively regulates basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis via a post-IR signaling mechanism, and (ii) GRK2 may contribute to reduced IR expression and function during chronic insulin exposure. The primary biological effect of insulin is maintenance of glucose homeostasis. The effects of insulin are mediated by binding to the insulin receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family (1Kasuga M. Zick Y. Blith D.L. Karlsson F.A. Haring H.U. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric receptor, consisting of two extracellular α and two transmembrane β subunits (2Pilch P.F. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1722-1731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin binding to the α-subunit of insulin receptor causes autophosphorylation of the β-subunit at specific tyrosine residues (3Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the β-subunit increases the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor toward other protein substrates, resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a family of insulin receptor substrate proteins including IRS1, 2The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GRK, G-protein-coupled receptor kinases; IR, insulin receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 2The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GRK, G-protein-coupled receptor kinases; IR, insulin receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance. IRS2, and Shc. The IRS proteins serve as docking proteins for other intracellular proteins containing Src homology 2 domains such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Grb2. The binding of these proteins to IRS proteins transmits the signal downstream, leading to the metabolic and mitogenic effects of insulin (4Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). For example, the interaction of phosphorylated IRS1/2 with PI 3-kinase leads to activation of protein kinase B/Akt, producing many effects such as GLUT4 translocation, protein synthesis, and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). The GSK3, a serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylates glycogen synthase and inactivates it. As glycogen synthase is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, inactivation of GSK3 by insulin removes the inhibitory effect of GSK3 on glycogen synthase and leads to increased glycogen synthesis (5Avruch J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin.

A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In addition to signaling via its tyrosine kinase activity, the insulin receptor also couples to the G-proteins Gi and Gq (8Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol.

For example, insulin resistance develops in adipocytes when Gαi is down-regulated (10Green A. Walters D.J. Belt S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E254-E261PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in 3T3L1 adipocytes IR signaling via Gαq/11 is required for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (11Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Artemyev N.O. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7167-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The signaling of receptors via G-proteins is regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), a family of serine/threonine kinases that participate in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization. GRK2 can produce GPCR desensitization either by phosphorylation-dependent or phosphorylation-independent mechanisms. Phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRKs results in the uncoupling of GPCRs from heterotrimeric G-proteins and receptor internalization (12Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Recently, GRK2 also has been shown to decrease GPCR signaling by sequestering Gq/11 proteins via their RGS domain (13Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 14Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

This phosphorylation-independent mechanism was recently shown to account for the negative regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by GRK2 in 3T3L1 adipocytes (15Usui I. Imamura T. Satoh H.

The present study was designed to determine whether GRK2 modulates insulin receptor signaling and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in mouse liver FL83B cells. Our data show that insulin induces the translocation of GRK2 from cytosol to the plasma membrane. Depleting cells of GRK2 caused an increase in basal as well as insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3α, leading to increased glycogen synthesis. GRK2 depletion also increased the basal and insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 at residue 612, whereas the phosphorylation at serine residue 307 was decreased in GRK2-deficient cells. Finally, we found that chronic insulin treatment (24 h) decreased IR expression and IR-stimulated glycogen synthesis. These changes in IR expression and IR-stimulated glycogen synthesis by chronic insulin treatment were not observed in GRK2-depleted cells. Materials—The FL83B cell line was obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Anti-GRK2 antibody, anti-insulin receptor β-subunit antibody, and anti-GRK3 antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Cy3 antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). Anti-GSK3, anti-pS21 GSK3α, anti-IRS1, anti-pS307 IRS1, and anti-pY612 IRS1 antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Phosphorylated tyrosine 612 is the pYMXM consensus motif that binds to PI 3-kinase. GRK2 siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Chicago, IL). Oligofectamine, Opti-MEM I, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from Invitrogen. d-[U-14C]Glucose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Mounting media with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was purchased from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The protein measuring kit was purchased from Pierce. Cell Culture—The experiments were performed in FL83B cells, a hepatocyte cell line derived from mouse. The cells were grown in F12 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 1% bacitracin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Experiments were performed on cells, passage 3-15, that were 80-90% confluent. GRK-2 Down-regulation by siRNA—The transfection was performed using 40-50% confluent hepatocytes. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum-free medium was added. GRK2 siRNA (antisense: 5′-UCGAUGCACACUGAAGUCAdAdT-3′) and Oligofectamine (0.6%) were diluted separately in Opti-MEM I for 10 min. Then, they were mixed and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The oligoribonucleotide containing mixture was then added to the cells and the cells were incubated for 4 h. After 4 h, growth medium containing normal serum and antibiotic were added and the cells were collected after 48 h. Western blotting of cell lysates was performed using anti-GRK2 antibody to determine the down-regulation of GRK2. For controls, a sequence of non-targeting siRNA that has at least four mismatches to any human, mouse, or rat gene was used instead of the GRK2 siRNA sequence. Immunofluorescence—The hepatocytes were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and grown to ∼40-50% confluency. Then, the cells were treated without/with insulin (100 nm) for 5 or 10 min, washed with ice-cold PBSS (in g/liter: sucrose 12, NaCl 8, Na2HPO4 1.2, KH2PO4 0.2, KCl 0.2), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were then treated with 0.34% l-lysine, 0.05% sodium metaperiodate for 20 min, washed with PBSS, and incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Then the cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 15 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-GRK2 antibody, 1:500) prepared in 0.2% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 buffer, overnight at 4 °C in a humidifying chamber. The cells then were washed with PBSS (3 times/5 min each). From this point onward, all steps were carried out in the dark. The cells were incubated with secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBSS (3 times/5 min each). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with mowiol oil containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain the nuclei and allowed to dry overnight in the dark. The cells were visualized using an Olympus deconvoluting microscope. A ×60 oil immersion lens was used to capture all images. Z-stacks were taken (0.2 μm) and the images were deconvoluted using software from Autoquant Imaging Inc. (Watervliet, NY). Plasma Membrane Preparation—The cells were treated without/with insulin (100 nm for 5 or 10 min), collected in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm potassium acetate and 18 mm HEPES, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.2, and processed for plasma membrane preparation (16Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then passed 10 times through a 22-gauge needle. The buffer concentration of the resulting cell lysate was adjusted to 25 mm potassium acetate and 125 mm HEPES. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 66,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in 25 mm potassium acetate, 125 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and used as plasma membrane fraction. The purity of the plasma membrane fraction was checked using Rab-5 antibody. Immunoblotting—The cells were treated without/with insulin (100 nm) acutely (5 or 10 min) or chronically (24 h) at 37 °C. After treatment, a cell lysate was collected in lysis buffer (mmol/liter: HEPES 50, NaCl 150, Na3VO4) 4, Na2H2P2O7 20, NaF 10, EDTA 10, Triton X-100 1%, glycerol 10%). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (blot). The blots were blocked with 4% fat-free milk and then incubated with primary antibody (anti-insulin receptor β-subunit, anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-GRK2, anti-GRK3, anti-GSK3α, anti-pS307 IRS1, anti-Y612 IRS1, or anti-IRS1 antibody). The blots were then washed, treated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. The bands were visualized on x-ray films and the intensity of each band was measured by densitometry using a Kodak Image analyzer. The specificity of the antibodies for GRK2 and insulin receptor β-subunit was confirmed by using the appropriate blocking peptides that resulted in the disappearance of the appropriate protein band (data not shown). Glycogen Synthesis Assay—The accumulation of glycogen in intact cells was determined using a previously described method (17Hess S.L. Suchin C.R. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, plated cells (80-90% confluent) were incubated overnight in glucose-free media with serum. Then, the cells were treated without (basal) or with insulin (100 nm) for 10 min followed by incubation with d-[U-14C]glucose (2 μCi/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, solubilized in 30% KOH, and heated at 100 °C for 30 min. Aliquots were then taken for protein estimation. Acetone and Na2SO4 were added to the remainder of each sample, and the samples were kept on ice for 30 min to allow precipitation of glycogen. The samples were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and d-[U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined by scintillation counting. Glycogen synthesis is expressed as nanomoles of glucose incorporated/mg of protein/3 h. Protein in plasma membranes and cell lysates was measured using BCA protein assay kit, which is based on the biuret reaction detected with bicinchoninic acid (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test/one way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test was used to compare variation between groups. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism, version 4.01 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effect of Insulin Treatment on GRK2 Localization—To determine whether insulin induces GRK2 translocation from cytosol to the plasma membrane, we utilized immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The FL83B cells were treated with insulin for 5 or 10 min. GRK2 was labeled with anti-GRK2 antibody and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody and the cells were observed under the microscope. Insulin treatment increased the translocation of GRK2 from cytosol to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). GRK2 localization also was determined in the isolated plasma membrane fraction by Western blotting. Insulin treatment (100 nm) caused an increase in GRK2 (∼80 kDa) localization in the plasma membrane by 29 and 38% at 5 and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 1B). The purity of the plasma membrane fraction was tested by assessing the content of Rab-5, a cytosolic protein. Rab-5 antibody labeled a band in the cytosolic fraction, whereas no band was detected in the plasma membrane fraction (data not shown) suggesting that the plasma membrane fractions are devoid of cytosolic proteins. Effect of GRK2 siRNA on GRK2 Expression—To down-regulate GRK2, we utilized the GRK2 siRNA technique. Treatment of FL83B cells with GRK2 siRNA (2 μm) for 48 h decreased the levels of GRK2 in the cell by more than 90% (Fig. 2A). This concentration of siRNA was used in all subsequent experiments. GRK2 siRNA did not affect the expression of GRK3 (Fig. 2A), a member of GRK2 subfamily, suggesting that our GRK2 siRNA is specific for GRK2. Similar treatment with scrambled sequence used as a control, had no effect on the GRK2 expression (Fig. 2B). Effect of Insulin on Glycogen Synthesis in Control and GRK2-deficient Cells—Insulin treatment increased the incorporation of glucose into glycogen by 30 nmol/mg of protein over basal in control cells, whereas the increase was 52 nmol/mg of protein over basal in GRK2-deficient cells (Fig. 3). The insulin-stimulated increase in glycogen synthesis in scrambled sequence-treated cells (28 nmol/mg of protein over basal) was similar to that in control cells. However, the basal value for glycogen synthesis in GRK2-deficient cells (36.5 ± 4.5 nmol/mg of protein) was higher than the basal value in the control (21.6 ± 3.5) and scrambled sequence-treated cells (23.3 ± 6.5). It should be noted that insulin receptor expression was not higher in GRK2-deficient cells (82.5%) as compared with the control cells (Fig. 7C).FIGURE 7Effect of chronic insulin treatment on the expression of GRK2 and insulin receptor. Mouse liver FL83B cells were treated with insulin (100 nm) for 24 h. The cell lysate (3 μg of protein for GRK-2, 15 μg for GRK-3) was subjected to Western blot analysis followed by incubation with (A) anti-GRK-2 antibody and (B) anti-GRK3 antibody. C, FL83B cells (control and siRNA treated) were incubated with insulin (100 nm) for 24 h. The cells were collected in lysis buffer and 4 μg of protein was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-insulin receptor antibody. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody. Bands were quantified by densitometric analysis. Data are presented as mean ± S.E., n = 4. *, significantly different from control, unpaired Student's t test, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Insulin on Ser Phosphorylation of GSK3α and GSK3β in Control and GRK2-deficient Cells—As shown in Fig. 4, Ser(P)21-GSK3α antibody labeled a single band (∼51 kDa). After the bands were recorded, the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-GSK-3 antibody. Density of Ser(P)21-GSK-3α was normalized with total GSK-3α. The data revealed that the basal phosphorylation of Ser21 at GSK-3α was increased in GRK2 deficient compared with control cells. Insulin (100 nm) treatment (5 and 10 min) caused an increase in the Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3α over respective basals. However, the insulin-stimulated Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK-3α was greater in GRK2-deficient cells (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation inactivates GSK3 activity leading to an increase in glycogen synthesis. Thus, the greater phosphorylation (basal and insulin-induced) of GSK3α is consistent with the enhanced glycogen synthesis in GRK2-deficient cells. The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3β in GRK2-deficient hepatocytes was similar to that in control cells (data not shown). Effect of Insulin on Tyr Phosphorylation of IR in Control and GRK2-deficient Cells—To determine whether the increase in insulin-induced glycogen synthesis in GRK2-deficient cells is due to changes in the Tyr phosphorylation of the IR, we performed immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 5). In the immunoprecipitation samples, phospho-Tyr antibody labeled a single protein band (96 kDa). After the bands were recorded, the same blot was stripped and re-probed with IR antibody, which labeled a protein with the same size (96 kDa). Density of the phospho-Tyr protein bands was normalized with total IR band density. Insulin treatment increased Tyr phosphorylation of IR to a similar extent in both control and GRK2-deficient cells. The basal Tyr phosphorylation was not detectable in either cell groups. This suggests that GRK2 does not affect the Tyr phosphorylation of IR in hepatocytes. Effect of Insulin on Tyr and Ser Phosphorylation of IRS1 in Control and GRK2-deficient Cells—To determine the Tyr phosphorylation of IRS1, we used phospho-Tyr612-IRS1 specific antibody. The phosphorylation of IRS-1 on this residue increases its association with PI 3-kinase and hence increases insulin signaling (19Esposito D.L. Li Y. Cama A. Quon M.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The phospho-Tyr612-IRS1 band density was normalized with the total IRS1 protein band density. Insulin treatment increased Tyr612 phosphorylation of IRS1 in control and GRK2-deficient cells. The increase in IRS1 Tyr phosphorylation over basal in GRK2-deficient cells (3.5-fold increase) was greater than in control cells (2.2-fold increase) (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the basal Tyr612 phosphorylation in control cells was not as distinct as in GRK2-deficient cells, suggesting that GRK2 deficiency also enhanced the basal phosphorylation of Tyr612 of IRS1. We determined the Ser phosphorylation of IRS1 by using a site-specific antibody that labels phospho-Ser307 of IRS1. The phosphorylation of IRS1 at this site decreases its association with IR and hence decreases the insulin signaling (20Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.J. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. While M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In control cells, the IRS1 is Ser307 phosphorylated at the basal level, which was modestly reduced (8%) by insulin treatment. Basal Ser307 phosphorylation in GRK2-deficient cells was significantly reduced (81%) compared with that in control basal. Insulin treatment did not affect Ser307 phosphorylation further in GRK2-deficient cells (Fig. 6B). Effect of Chronic Insulin Treatment on GRK2 and Insulin Receptor Expression—As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, insulin (100 nm) treatment for 24 h increased GRK2 protein expression by 56%; insulin treatment had no effect on the expression of GRK-3 (83 kDa), which is a member of the same subfamily. This suggests a selective effect of chronic insulin treatment on GRK-2 expression. On the other hand, chronic insulin treatment caused a 50% reduction in insulin receptor expression in control cells. However, in GRK2-deficient cells, the effect of chronic insulin treatment on IR expression was prevented (Fig. 7C). This suggests a role of GRK2 in insulin-induced regulation of the IR. Effect of Chronic Insulin Treatment on Glycogen Synthesis in Control and GRK2-deficient Cells—To determine whether chronic insulin treatment decreases glycogen synthesis and whether this decrease is restored in GRK2-deficient cells, we performed glycogen synthesis in control and GRK2-deficient cells. In the control group, the insulin treatment for 10 min, as expected, significantly increased the glycogen synthesis, whereas the chronic insulin treatment (24 h) failed to increase glycogen synthesis (Fig. 8). This suggests desensitization of the insulin action after a prolonged exposure of cells, as reported earlier (21Korsheninnikova E. Seppala-Lindroos A. Vehkavaara S. Goto T. Virkamaki A. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, in GRK-2-deficient cells, chronic treatment with insulin increased glycogen synthesis. This suggests a role of GRK2 in the desensitization of insulin action on glycogen synthesis. GPCR kinase-2 (GRK2) is predominantly a cytosolic protein. Upon activation, GRK2 translocates to the plasma membrane and phosphorylates GPCRs at serine/threonine residues, leading to receptor desensitization. GRK2 also directly binds to the activated Gαq/11 proteins and decreases signaling through the G-protein (14Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although, GRK2 has been known to regulate members of the GPCR superfamily (12Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), the results of the present study suggest that GRK2 may have an inhibitory role in regulating glycogen synthesis by affecting insulin receptor signaling in liver cells. Recently, a similar study showed that GRK2 negatively regulates insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes (15Usui I. Imamura T. Satoh H. Huang J. Babendure J.L. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily. However, the insulin receptor also activates G protein-linked signaling pathways (8Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Imamura T. Huang J. Dalle S. Ugi S. Usui I. Luttrell L.M. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Olefsky J.M. J.

In the present study increased GRK2 translocation to the plasma membrane, in response to insulin, suggests a link between the insulin receptor and GRK2. At least two mechanisms could contribute to this translocation. First, GRK2 translocation may be promoted by a Gβγ subunit released as a result of the interaction of the activated insulin receptor with G-proteins. Alternatively, activation of protein kinase C by the insulin receptor could promote GRK2 translocation (22Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 23Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Perez L. Price D. Galloway L. Poklepovic A. Sajan M.P. Cenni V. Sirri A. Moscat J. Toker A. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25308-25316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To determine the functional significance of GRK2 translocation in insulin receptor signaling/function, FL83BB cells were made GRK2-deficient and then insulin receptor signaling and function were studied. Examining the metabolic effects of insulin, we found that GRK2 deficiency caused an increase in basal glycogen synthesis compared with basal in control cells. Insulin produced a 2-fold increase in glycogen synthesis above this elevated basal level in GRK2-deficient cells; a similar increment is observed in control cells. Because basal glycogen synthesis is increased in GRK2-deficient cells, the fact that the increment of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis is unchanged can be interpreted in two ways. One interpretation is that GRK2 deficiency may not affect insulin receptor function. Alternatively, insulin caused an absolute increase in glycogen synthesis in GRK2-depleted cells that is nearly twice that observed in control cells (52 versus 30 nmol/mg of protein). Therefore, it could be concluded that GRK2 deficiency augments the metabolic response to insulin. Therefore, GRK2 may modulate liver glycogen synthesis through both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent mechanisms. The increase in glycogen synthesis following GRK2 depletion correlates well with the inactivation of GSK3α. Glycogen synthase kinase 3α phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of glycosyl residues into glycogen. Under basal conditions, GSK3α is constitutively active, exerting an inhibitory influence on glycogen production. Phosphorylation of GSK3α on Ser21 leads to decreased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. This causes a net activation of glycogen synthase and increases glycogen production (7Fang X. Yu S.X. Lu Y. Bast C.R. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In the present study, GRK2 depletion caused a modest but significant increase in basal Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3α; i.e. GSK3α was modestly inhibited. Insulin caused additional Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3α in both the GRK2-deficient and control cells; the effect was greater in the GRK2-deficient group. Therefore, it appears that depletion of GRK2 reduces basal GSK3α inhibition of glycogen synthase. In addition GRK2 depletion enhances insulin-stimulated glycogen production by enhancing the ability of insulin to phosphorylate GSK3α Ser21, reducing the inhibitory influence of GSK3α on glycogen synthase and thereby increasing glycogen production. In light of the potentiation of insulin-stimulated glycogen production produced by GRK2 depletion, we were surprised to find that GRK2 depletion had no effect on insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Classically, GRK2 activation leads to phosphorylation of GPCRs on serine/threonine residues and subsequent receptor desensitization (24Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Increased Ser phosphorylation of the insulin receptor causes a simultaneous decrease in Tyr phosphorylation of insulin receptor and thus a decrease in receptor activity (25Tennagels N. Telting D. Parvaresch S. Maassen J.A. Klein H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26Takayama S. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3440-3447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we anticipated that the GRK2 depletion would reduce serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, enhance Tyr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, and enhance insulin receptor signaling. However, insulin-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation was similar in control and GRK2-deficient cells. This suggests that GRK2 may not regulate insulin receptor signaling by affecting Tyr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Rather, the changes in basal and insulin-induced glycogen synthesis produced by GRK2 depletion may result from effects on post-insulin receptor signaling components such as IRS1. Evidence suggesting that the function of IRS1 might be modulated by GRK2 was obtained in GRK2-deficient cells. We observed that the phosphorylation of IRS1 at Tyr612 was increased, whereas phosphorylation at Ser307 was decreased by GRK2 depletion. The increase in Tyr612 phosphorylation of IRS1 was observed under basal conditions and insulin-stimulated Tyr612 phosphorylation of IRS1 also was increased. IRS1 phosphorylation at this site promotes the binding of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, leading to insulin-mediated activation of downstream effectors (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). In contrast to Tyr612, phosphorylation of Ser307 of IRS-1 was reduced by GRK2 depletion. This phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser307 reduces the influence of insulin on effectors downstream of IRS1 (27Greene M.W. Garofalo R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7082-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Mothe I. Obberghen E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For example, Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS1 decreases IRS1 association with the insulin receptor, decreases Tyr phosphorylation on IRS1 and thus negatively regulates insulin signaling (19Esposito D.L. Li Y. Cama A. Quon M.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of the present study support the hypothesis that GRK2 affects phosphorylation of Ser307 on IRS1, reducing insulin receptor-IRS1 interaction and reducing insulin receptor phosphorylation of Tyr612 on IRS1. In this manner GRK2 could negatively regulate insulin receptor signaling, both in the basal condition and in the presence of added insulin. The influence of GRK2 on insulin receptor signaling through IRS Ser phosphorylation is potentially relevant to the pathophysiology of diabetes. Increased Ser phosphorylation of IRSs is observed in muscles of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (29Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S. Guebre-Egziabher F. Riou J. Laville M. Marchand-Brustel Y.L. Tanti J.F. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether GRK2 directly affects IRS1 phosphorylaton or whether GRK2 phosphorylates another intermediary signaling molecule that then is responsible for Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1. GSK3α via negative feedback regulation also phosphorylates IRS1 at serine residues and attenuates insulin receptor signaling (30Liberman Z. Eldar-Finkelman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4422-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, the decrease in GSK3α activity observed in GRK2-deficient cells could result in reduced Ser phosphorylation of IRS1 and contribute to the increase in IRS1 Tyr phosphorylation that we observed. In addition to the kinase activity, GRK2 also suppresses GPCR signaling by binding to Gαq/11 protein and preventing it from propagating the signal downstream. Insulin receptor is known to couple to Gαq/11 and Gαi proteins. The Gαq/11 subunit is required for insulin signaling in 3T3L1 adipocytes and down-regulation of Gαi leads to insulin resistance in mice (29Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S. Guebre-Egziabher F. Riou J. Laville M. Marchand-Brustel Y.L. Tanti J.F. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recently a study demonstrated that GRK-2 in 3T3L1 adipocytes inhibits insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation by binding to Gαq/11 (15Usui I. Imamura T. Satoh H. Huang J. Babendure J.L. Hupfeld C.J. Olefsky J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This inhibition was independent of GRK2 kinase activity and did not affect Tyr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which supports our findings in that GRK2 deficiency did not affect basal or insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation. A final area of investigation in the present study was the influence of GRK2 on the response to chronic insulin receptor activation. Chronic insulin exposure down-regulates the insulin receptors and decreases insulin receptor signaling. Moreover, several studies have shown that chronic hyperinsulinemia is associated with reduced insulin receptor sensitivity in animal models and humans (21Korsheninnikova E. Seppala-Lindroos A. Vehkavaara S. Goto T. Virkamaki A. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports we observed that chronic insulin treatment decreased insulin receptor expression and was not associated with increased glycogen synthesis, suggesting insulin receptor desensitization. These responses were accompanied by increased expression of GRK2. In GRK2-deficient cells chronic insulin treatment had no effect on insulin receptor expression and was associated with increased glycogen synthesis. Because GRK2-deficient cells exhibited an increase basal glycogen synthesis, this could partially contribute to the increase in glycogen synthesis after insulin treatment in these cells. However, the absence of insulin receptor down-regulation in GRK2-deficient cells suggests that GRK2 may have a role in regulating insulin receptor expression and desensitization during prolonged insulin exposure. One potential explanation is that two different mechanisms regulate the response of the insulin receptor upon chronic insulin exposure. First, desensitization of the insulin receptor signal could be mediated in part by the post-insulin receptor mechanism involving IRS1 Ser phosphorylation as previously discussed. The second could be a regulation of receptor synthesis or degradation, leading to reduced receptor number with chronic insulin treatment. Our observation of enhanced GRK2 expression with chronic insulin treatment is important in that enhanced expression of GRK2 also is reported in disease conditions such as cardiac failure and myocardial ischemia. Moreover, tissue-specific inhibition of GRK2 in transgenic animals has led to enhanced contractility of heart muscles (31Penela P. Murga C. Ribas C. Tutor A.S. Peregrin S. Mayor Jr., F. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 69: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Iaccarino G. Koch W.J. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2003; 2: 347-355Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Enhanced GRK2 expression also is observed in tissues from obese Zucker rats, a model of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (33Trivedi M. Lokhandwala M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F298-F299Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GRK2 due to chronic insulin receptor stimulation may contribute to disease states such as insulin resistance and diabetes. It would be interesting to examine the levels of GRK2 in experimental models of diabetes and to see if controlled inhibition of GRK2 could improve the disease state. In summary, we demonstrate a relationship between the cellular levels of GRK2 and insulin-dependent and -independent glycogen synthesis in liver cells. Depletion of cellular GRK2 reduces IRS1 Ser phosphorylation and increases IRS1 Tyr phosphorylation, which in turn, appears to activate downstream insulin receptor effectors. Upon activation by insulin, this pathway is further enhanced with a net gain in insulin receptor function in terms of glycogen synthesis. Chronic insulin treatment causes elevation in GRK2 expression, which may have a role in the insulin receptor desensitization and down-regulation observed in cells after prolonged insulin exposure. Inasmuch as the present studies provide the first report indicating an inhibitory role of GRK2 in the regulation of glycogen synthesis in liver cells, more studies are needed to define the precise mechanism(s) of this phenomenon.

Specifically, total esterified HETE varied from 100 to 2000 ng/4 × 106 cells (due to donor variation), but only 17.5 ng/4 × 106 cells was detected after purification and hydrolysis of PE from one donor. This suggests that 15-HETE is esterified into additional nonphospholipid pools that have not been detected here, although perhaps not being ionized in negative mode.” Since this work was published, we succeeded in generating an 18:0a/15-HETE-PE standard and have now been able to directly quantitate the four PE-HETEs using this lipid. Although there may be small differences in ionization efficiency between the four lipids, we believe that quantitation using these standards with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is a more accurate approach than that used in this work. Specifically, we previously purified total PE, followed by hydrolysis to liberate 15-HETE, re-extraction, and then quantitation using LC/MS/MS. We believe that these additional steps resulted in losses of lipid and significant underestimation of total levels of PE-esterified HETE. Using the new approach, our estimates of PE-HETE are now much closer to our measurements of total esterified HETE in activated monocytes (Table 1). This suggests instead that PE-HETEs are the major source of esterified HETE and that only a small amount remains that is esterified elsewhere.TABLE 1Esterified HETEs measured using LC/MS/MS in lipid extracts from ionophore-actived monocytesMoleculeControlActivatedng/4 × 106 cellsng/4 × 106 cellsFree 15-HETE (measured using LC/MS/MS)1.43257Total esterified 15-HETE (lipid extracts hydrolyzed and total esterified 15-HETE measured using LC/MS/MS)11.116416:0p/15-HETE-PE (measured using synthetic standard)3.863.818:0p/15-HETE-PE (measured using synthetic standard)1.320.318:1p/15-HETE-PE (measured using synthetic standard)2.737.718:0a/15-HETE-PE (measured using synthetic standards)1.629Total PE-HETEs (totaled from individual species measured above)9.6150.8 Open table in a new tab"

Although the average speeds were dependent on the diameter of beads, 40- and 60-nm diameter beads rotated with essentially the same rate (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J.

The mechanism underlying the chemistry and energy coupling of FoF1 has been studied by introducing mutations (1Futai M. Sun-Wada G.H. Wada Y. Futai M. Wada Y. Kaplan J.

One of the most interesting mutations is the substitution of the βSer-174 residue (24Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Tanabe M. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Saito K. Ueda I. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The size of the residue at this position is pertinent as to the activity (25Omote H. Park M-Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10265-10269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the larger the side-chain volume of the residue introduced, the lower the ATPase activity became. The βS174F (βSer-174 to Phe substitution) or βS174L (βSer-174 to Leu) F1 sector exhibited ∼10% of the wild-type activity (25Omote H. Park M-Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10265-10269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The defect of βS174F was suppressed by the replacement of βGly-149 (βGly-149 to Ala, Ser, or Cys) in the phosphate binding P-loop near α-helix B (26Iwamoto A. Omote H. Hanada H. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16350-16355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwamoto A. Park M-Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3156-3160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, rotation of an actin filament connected to γ was not proportional to the ATPase activity; generated torque for βS174F and βS174L were 40∼100% that of the wild-type level (24Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Tanabe M. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Saito K. Ueda I. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47508-47511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, it became of interest to analyze mechanical revolution of the γ subunit in these mutants using a probe smaller than an actin filament. In this study we confirmed stochastic fluctuation of the γ subunit rotation by analyzing the single revolution time (time required for 360° revolution). The βS174F mutant paused at 120° steps longer than the wild type, giving an ∼6 times lower revolution time. The rotation of second-site revertant βG149A/βS174F was similar to that of the wild type. Essentially the same results were obtained for βS174L mutant and its second-site revertant βG149A/βS174L. We discuss a possible role(s) of the domain including β-sheet 4 and the phosphate binding P-loop, where βSer-174 and βGly-149 are located, respectively (Fig. 1). Preparation and Materials—E. coli strain DK8 (ΔuncB-C) was used as a host for recombinant plasmids and grown at 37 °C in a synthetic medium containing 0.5% glycerol as a carbon source. A plasmid carrying the unc operon introduced six His residues at the α subunit amino terminus, and γS193C and γK108C substitutions in the γ subunit were described previously (18Nakanishi-Matsui M.

Mutations βS174F and βS174L and related substitutions of the β subunit were introduced into F1 engineered for rotation (24Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Tanabe M. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Saito K. Ueda I. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47508-47511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant F1 sectors were purified on a glycerol gradient (24Iko Y.

Gel electrophoresis showed the presence of about 1 mol ∊/mol F1 but no δ subunit in any of the preparations analyzed. Gold beads (60-nm diameter) were obtained from British Bio Cell International and were coated with biotinylated bovine serum albumin (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J.

The cover glass used for constructing a cell for observing rotation was soaked in 0.1 n KOH for 3 days followed by extensive washing with high purity water (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S.

Assay Procedures—Mutant and wild-type ATPase activities were assayed as described previously (10Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) under the conditions used for the rotation assay (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J.

The third (highest) Km values for ATP were obtained with the Mg2+ concentrations that gave the maximal activities. When varying the ATP concentration, the Mg2+:ATP ratio was maintained at 1:1, except that the Mg2+ concentration was 0.5 mm when ATP concentration was lower than 0.5 mm. For the βG149A mutant, the ratio was maintained at 2:1, except that the Mg2+ concentration was 4 mm for ATP lower than 0.5 mm. Protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Fraction V) as a standard (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Observing γ Subunit Rotation—Rotation was assayed essentially as described previously (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, gold beads were connected to the immobilized F1 sector in a flow cell (∼30-μm deep) filled with buffer A (10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MOPS 2The abbreviation used is: MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid. /KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2). Immediately after the introduction of buffer A containing 2 mm ATP and its regenerating system, images of the beads illuminated with laser light (JUNO EX, Showa Optronics Co.) were obtained on dark field microscopy (BX51WI-CDEVA-F, Olympus, Tokyo) and recorded with a charge-coupled device camera for data analysis using a Metamorph (Molecular Devices Corp.). The proper camera speeds (1000∼4000 frames/s) were selected depending on the mutations of the F1 sectors; wild-type and the revertants, 4000 frames/s; βS174F, βS174L, and βG149A, 1000 frames/s. They were also assayed at a different camera speed when necessary. Other methods, including construction of glass cells for rotation and laser-light illumination, were described previously (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We occasionally observed apparent clockwise movements of less than two revolutions, although they were not actual rotations. The beads analyzed were those showing such movements amounting to less than 5% of the total counterclockwise revolutions. Stochastic Rotation of Gold Beads Attached to Wild-type F1—Gold beads connected to F1 rotated with various speeds and often paused for a short period (∼ms) as shown previously (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the previous paper, we recorded their rotations for 0.25 s, estimated rates every 10 ms, and combined those from different beads (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Histograms of the rotation rates showed stochastic fluctuation. However, previous analysis may emphasize the frequencies of rates close to 0 rps if beads paused a long time (>10 ms). Furthermore, these histograms may include variation between beads together with fluctuation of the rotation speeds. The previous observation time (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was not enough to detect long pauses (>0.25 s). Thus, we were prompted to study longer time courses and single rotation events (360° rotations). The present analysis was more appropriate than estimating rates every 10 ms (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), because all revolutions could be included. In this study the time course of each bead was followed for 2 s. We occasionally observed long pauses (>0.1 s) (Fig. 2a), which were not found in previous time courses (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); a bead rotated about 500 revolutions and paused (yellow curve in Fig. 2a), and others paused after 300 revolutions (green and pink curves). Sometimes we observed beads that started rotating after a long pause (gray curve). On average, about 3 long pauses appeared when we recorded 1000 revolutions. These pauses were possibly because of Mg-ADP inhibition (29Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), as discussed below. We assumed that the long dwells are Mg-inhibited states of the enzyme and analyzed single rotation events. When time courses were expanded, apparent smooth rotations (Fig. 2a) exhibited dwells (short pauses, ∼ms) and ∼120° stepping (Fig. 2b). Therefore, we analyzed the single revolution time, i.e. the time required for 360° of revolution, to evaluate stochastic fluctuation of rotation. This parameter could follow all rotations of a bead in a time course regardless of the length of the pauses. As expected from the various speeds observed in a time course, each bead clearly showed stochastic fluctuation of the single revolution time (for examples, see Fig. 2c). The histograms for the individual beads and those for multiple beads (Fig. 2d) are closely similar, indicating that fluctuation tendency is an intrinsic property of the F1 molecule. The geometric mean of single revolution time was ∼2.3 ms (2.0, 2.3, 2.3, and 2.6 ms, for four different beads) (Fig. 2c), and the average rotation rate (reciprocal of single revolution time) was 440 rps, i.e. slightly higher than the reported value, 380 rps (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A 360° rotation including the long pause was observed with lower frequency and shown in the histograms of single rotation times (see >15, horizontal axis in Fig. 2, c and d). ATPase Activity of Mutant F1—It became of interest to analyze the mutant F1 sector to understand the mechanisms underlying rotation and its stochastic fluctuation. βS174F (Fig. 1b) and related mutations were introduced into the engineered F1 to observe rotation as previously described (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Tanabe M. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Saito K. Ueda I. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47508-47511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Steady state ATPase activities were assayed under the same conditions as those for rotation observation. The relative activities (% of wild-type level) were essentially similar to previous results: βS174F, 8%; βS174L, 9%; βG149A/βS174F, 314%; βG149A/βS174L, 200%; βG149A, 75%. We also estimated the third (highest) Km for ATP to assay rotation in the presence of excess ATP. βS174F, βS174L, and the second-site revertant βG149A/βS174F exhibited Km values for ATP of 69, 60, and 64 μm, respectively, i.e. essentially the same as that of the wild type (71 μm). βG149A exhibited a Km value (0.3 mm) of ∼4-fold higher than that of the wild type, possibly because of the location of βGly-149 near bound-Mg-ATP at the catalytic site (Fig. 1c). Based on these biochemical properties of the mutant enzymes, we assayed rotations of βS174F, βS174L, and the corresponding second-site revertants in the presence of 2 mm ATP, ∼30-fold higher than the Km values to compare steady state ATP hydrolysis and rotation. Rotation of Mutant F1 with βSer-174 Replacement—The time course of a gold bead attached to βS174F was followed for 2 s. The mutant rotated with variable rates and exhibited long pauses similar to the wild type (Fig. 3, a and b). The total revolutions (in 2 s) were much less than those of the wild type (Fig. 3b). Thus, we compared the wild type and mutants by analyzing single rotation events. The mutant apparently exhibited longer single revolution times than the wild type, as shown for the histograms of multiple beads (Fig. 3c). They are similar to those for single beads (data not shown). The peaks of the wild-type and mutant histograms from multiple beads were at 1.75 and 5 ms, respectively, and their geometric means were 2.3 and 14 ms, respectively. Most (∼80%) of the mutant single revolution times were longer than 5 ms, and ∼50% of them were longer than 10 ms (Fig. 3c), whereas ≥90% of those of the wild type were ≤5 ms. The geometric mean of the βS174L single revolution times was ∼26 ms, i.e. ∼11 times longer time than that of the wild type, and >20% of the mutant times were longer than 100 ms, as shown by the histograms (Fig. 3d). These results were consistent with the low ATPase activities of the mutants. Pausing of the γ Subunit in the Presence of a High Concentration of ATP—The single revolution times of βS174F and βS174L were significantly longer than those of the wild type in the presence of 2 mm ATP (Fig. 3, c and d), possibly because the mutants exhibited a high tendency for longer dwell. Thus, we compared dwells of the wild type and mutants. As shown by expanded time courses, the mutant paused longer at 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 of a 360° revolution compared with the wild type (Fig. 4a, note the time scale). The angular distributions of the centroids showed three peaks at about 120°, 240°, and 360°/0° (Fig. 4b), indicating that beads paused after 120° revolutions, as shown previously with low ATP concentrations (20Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). However, the pausing observed in the present study may not be at the ATP waiting dwell (time for a catalytic site waiting for ATP binding), since it was not affected by a further increase in the ATP concentration (data not shown), and rotations were assayed in the presence of a ∼30-fold higher ATP concentration than the Km. The pausing dwell contributed significantly to a single revolution time since the stepping (0 → 120°, 120 → 240°, or 240° → 360°/0°) speeds were high (mostly ≤0.25 and ≤1 ms per 120° step for wild-type and mutant, respectively). About 80% of the pausing dwells of the wild type and mutant were ≤0.5 and ≤5ms, respectively (Fig. 4c), indicating that mutant paused at least ∼10 times longer than the wild type. Essentially the same results were obtained for the βS174L mutant. Thus, the longer pausing dwells caused the slow rotation speeds and low ATPase activities of mutants. Rotation of the Second-site Revertant—As shown previously, a defect of the βS174F enzyme was suppressed by the second-site mutations, βGly-149 to Ser, Cys, or Ala (26Iwamoto A. Omote H. Hanada H. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16350-16355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwamoto A. Park M-Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3156-3160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), giving apparently wild-type ATPase activity. The time course of the revertant βG149A/βS174F and βG149A single mutant was analyzed (Fig. 5, a and b) and shown together with those of the wild type and βS174F mutant for comparison (Fig. 5c). Beads attached to the revertant F1 rotated similar to those of the wild type, except that they rarely exhibited pauses longer than 0.1 s. The histogram of the single revolution times for the revertant showed a peak at 2.5 ms and a geometric mean of 2.9 ms (Fig. 5d), i.e. similar to the wild-type values (Fig. 2d). The average rotation rates were estimated as reciprocals of the geometric means for single revolution times, assuming that F1 sectors exhibiting various speeds were present in the assay mixture; those for the wild type, βS174F, revertant, and βG149A were 440, 70, 340, and 70 rps, respectively. The results for the two single mutants and the revertant indicate that the two mutations (βS174F and βG149A) suppressed each other and gave similar rates as the wild type. Essentially the same results were obtained for βG149A/βS174L (Fig. 5e), the second-site revertant of βS174L. We have previously observed that a gold bead attached to the γ subunit rotated at various rates, indicating stochastic fluctuation of F1 rotation (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the reported results may have included variations between F1 molecules because data for multiple beads were combined to obtain histograms. In this study we analyzed single revolution times that include the pausing dwell and stepping velocity. As expected from the time courses, individual beads exhibited stochastic fluctuations, and their histograms were similar, indicating that the variation among F1 molecule was not significant. The observed stochastic fluctuation was probably because of the intrinsic properties of the γ subunit driven by catalysis in α3β3 hexamer, since they were essentially independent of the bead sizes (40-200-nm diameter) (18Nakanishi-Matsui M.

Ubukata, A. Iwamoto-Kihara, Y. Wada, and M. Futai, unpublished observation. and enzyme preparations (F1 or FoF1) (data not shown). The fluctuations were mainly because of the varying pausing dwells (∼ms) because stepping was fast. Stochastic fluctuation was also observed in Bacillus F1 with the fluorophore Cy3, attached to the γ subunit (30Adachi K. Yasuda R. Noji H. Itoh H. Harada Y. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7243-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Careful definition of wild-type rotation was the basis of further studies on mutant F1. Replacement of βSer-174 in β-sheet 4 lowered the ATPase activity to ∼10% of the wild-type level (25Omote H. Park M-Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10265-10269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The means of single revolution times of the beads attached to βS174F and βS174L were about 6 and 11 times longer than that of the wild type, respectively, consistent with about a 10 times longer pausing dwell of the mutant than that of the wild type. βS174L took longer single revolution times than βS174F for an unknown reason, although their steady state ATPase activities were similar (9 and 8% of the wild-type level, respectively). The difference between the results of ATPase activity and single revolution time may be because of the observation times: rotation assay, 2 s; ATPase activity, 3 min. It is possible that βS174F did not rotate for long time (>2s) more often than βS174L. βS174F and βS174L exhibited the ∊ subunit sensitivity similar to the wild type (data not shown), suggesting that the slow rotations by the mutants were not because of the effect of this subunit. As shown previously, the ∊ subunit was dissociated from F1 during its immobilization and washing before rotation assay (18Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The defect of βS174F mutant activity was suppressed by a series of replacements of the βGly-149 residue (26Iwamoto A. Omote H. Hanada H. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16350-16355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwamoto A. Park M-Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3156-3160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single revolution times of the revertant βG149A/βS174F and βG149A/βS174L were similar to that of the wild type. βGly-149 is the first residue of the P-loop containing catalytic residues such as βLys-155 and βThr-156, whereas βSer-174 is located in β-sheet 4 (Fig. 1). The conformation of the β-sheet 4/loop/a-helix B/P-loop domain is strikingly different between the empty (βE) and nucleotide-bound (βDP and βTP) β subunit (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, b, and c). Thus, the conformational changes of the P-loop during catalysis affect β-sheet 4 through α-helix B for the rotation. Substitution of βSer-174 possibly affected the conformational transition (βD → βE or βE → βT) of the entire domain and increased the pausing dwell. The transition became similar to the wild type with the second mutation, βG149A. It should be important to discuss which rotation step is related to the conformation transition. 120° revolution was observed initially for an actin filament connected to Bacillus F1, when the ATP concentration was lowered (20Yasuda R.

Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Ito H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) further observed 90° and 30° substeps in each 120° step, which were later revised to 80° and 40°, respectively, by the same group (21Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The dwell before the 80° revolution was dependent on the ATP concentration, whereas that before the 40° substep was not. These results indicated that the 80° and 40° substeps were driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis/product release, respectively. We assayed rotations with a high ATP concentration and often observed pauses upon 120° revolution possibly at one of the two substeps. As discussed above, they paused not at the ATP waiting dwell but possibly at the ATP hydrolysis/product release dwell. Assuming that the E. coli enzyme has the same two substeps as Bacillus, the mutant F1 paused longer before the 40° stepping. Present results of mutants and revertants indicate that the 40° stepping is driven by the conformation transition of the β-sheet4/loop/a-helix B/P loop domain. Hydrolysis in or product release from the catalytic site including P-loop apparently originates this transition. We occasionally observed long pauses (>0.1 s), which apparently lowered bulk-phase ATPase activity. The revertant βG149A/βS174F and βG149A mutant showed long pauses less often than the wild type. These pauses may be because of the Mg-ADP-inhibited form observed previously using duplex beads (440- and 517-nm diameter) (29Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The wild-type ATPase activity is sensitive to Mg2+ (31Kanazawa H. Horiuchi Y. Takagi M. Ishino Y. Futai M. J. Biochem. 1980; 88: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which stabilizes the Mg-ADP-inhibited form (32Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M.

On the other hand, the ATPase activities of βG149A/βS174F and βG149A were less sensitive to Mg2+ than that of the wild type (data not shown), similar to the revertant, βG149S/βS174F (26Iwamoto A. Omote H. Hanada H. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16350-16355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the long pauses of the revertant and βG149A occurred rarely because their Mg-ADP-inhibited forms were unstable. These results were consistent with higher steady state ATPase activities of the revertant and βG149A. In this regard mutations in the corresponding domain of Bacillus F1 changed the tendency to generate Mg-ADP-inhibited form (34Masaike T. Mitome N. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, using gold beads but not actin filaments, present studies clearly exhibited stochastic fluctuation of F1 rotation and its defect in β subunit mutants. Mutation/suppression studies revealed that the β-sheet 4/loop/a-helix B/P-loop is an important domain to drive rotation and is at least partially responsible for Mg-ADP inhibition. Further single molecule analysis will provide a new insight in enzyme mechanism (35Lu H.P. Xun L. Xie X.S. Science. 1998; 282: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Macrophage phagocytosis triggers the translocation of cytosolic SK1 to the nascent phagosome, which promotes a localized elevation of Ca2+ that is required for its maturation to an acidic, microbicidal phagolysosome.

However, the mechanisms that regulate the localization of SK1 to specific membrane compartments, including the phagosome, remain undefined. Utilizing live cell confocal microscopy, we recently described the kinetics of SK1 translocation to nascent phagosomes (28Thompson C.R. Iyer S.S. Melrose N. VanOosten R. Johnson K. Pitson S.M. Obeid L.M. Kusner D.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3551-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this transient recruitment of SK1 during phagocytosis is similar to that which has been previously documented for phagosomal actin polymerization and depolymerization (47Allen L.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin polymerizes at the base of the phagocytic cup and within the encircling pseudopods, and actin filaments remain attached to the nascent phagosome for the first few min following ingestion (47Allen L.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity in the kinetics of recruitment and subsequent release of SK1 from the phagosome (28Thompson C.R. Iyer S.S.

https://openalex.org/W1982193545,"Escherichia coli K1 is a leading pathogen in neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The K1 capsule, composed of α2,8-linked polysialic acid, represents the major virulence factor. In some K1 strains, phase-variable O-acetylation of the capsular polysaccharide is observed, a modification that is catalyzed by the prophage-encoded O-acetyltransferase NeuO. Phase variation is mediated by changes in the number of heptanucleotide repeats within the 5′-coding region of neuO, and full-length translation is restricted to repeat numbers that are a multiple of three. To understand the biochemical basis of K1 capsule O-acetylation, NeuO encoded by alleles containing 0, 12, 24, and 36 repeats was expressed and purified to homogeneity via a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. All NeuO variants assembled into hexamers and were enzymatically active with a high substrate specificity toward polysialic acid with >14 residues. Remarkably, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Kmdonor) increased linearly with increasing numbers of repeats, revealing a new mechanism for modulating NeuO activity. Using homology modeling, we predicted a three-dimensional structure primarily composed of a left-handed parallel β-helix with one protruding loop. Two amino acids critical for catalytic activity were identified and corresponding alanine substitutions, H119A and W143A, resulted in a complete loss of activity without affecting the oligomerization state. Our results indicate that in NeuO typical features of an acetyltransferase of the left-handed β-helix family are combined with a unique regulatory mechanism based on variable N-terminal protein extensions formed by tandem copies of an RLKTQDS heptad.

The pathogenesis of E. coli meningitis is a complex process involving colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal translocation, bacteremia, passage of the blood-brain barrier, and invasion of the arachnoidal space (4Bonacorsi S. Bingen E. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2005; 295: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cell culture experiments indicated that transfer across the blood-brain barrier is mediated by transcytosis through brain endothelial cells (5Kim K.S. Nat. Rev.

Despite advances in diagnostics and therapeutics of neonatal infections, E. coli neonatal meningitis is still characterized by high rates of mortality and a high incidence of permanent neurological sequelae in those that survive (8Harvey D.

E. coli K1 is protected by a thick layer of capsular polysaccharide, which is the major virulence factor important for serum resistance and vital passage of the blood-brain barrier (5Kim K.S. Nat.

Up to 200 residues are joined in α2,8-glycosidic linkages, resulting in a linear homopolymer that is structurally identical to polySia of the host organism (12Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol.

In several K1 strains, modification of the capsule by O-acetylation of the Neu5Ac residues in positions O-7 and O-9 was observed (14Ørskov F. Ørskov I. Sutton A. Schneerson R. Lin W. Egan W.

A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This modification is phase-variable, and individual strains can switch between O-acetylated (OAc+) and non-O-acetylated (OAc-) capsule variants (14Ørskov F. Ørskov I. Sutton A. Schneerson R. Lin W. Egan W. Hoff G.E. Robbins J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although associated with increased immunogenicity, modification of the K1 capsule by O-acetylation correlates with increased virulence in patients with bacteremia (17Frasa H. Procee J. Torensma R. Verbruggen A. Algra A. Rozenberg-Arska M. Kraaijeveld K. Verhoef J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because O-acetylated polySia resists hydrolysis by neuraminidases, capsule O-acetylation may favor colonization of the intestinal tract (14Ørskov F. Ørskov I. Sutton A. Schneerson R. Lin W. Egan W. Hoff G.E. Robbins J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). O-Acetylation of the K1 capsule is catalyzed by an acetyl-CoA-dependent O-acetyltransferase with preferential acceptor specificity toward polySia with >14 residues (15Higa H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8872-8878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding gene (neuO) is part of a 40-kb prophage of the P22 family, and phase variation is mediated by changes in the overall length of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) within the 5′-coding region (16Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Stummeyer K. Schwarzer D. Claus H. Vogel U. Gerardy-Schahn R. Mühlenhoff M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). VNTR loci are among the most variable regions of many bacterial genomes and arise through slippage and mispairing during DNA replication due to occasional DNA polymerase dissociation (19van Belkum A. Scherer S. van Alphen L. Verbrugh H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 275-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Viguera E. Canceill D. Ehrlich S.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the neuO-positive K1 strains reported so far, 14-39 copies of the heptanucleotide unit 5′-AAGACTC-3′ were inserted two nucleotides downstream of the start codon (16Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Only repeat numbers that are a multiple of three allow full-length translation of neuO (phase on), whereas other numbers move the start codon out of frame resulting in truncated and thereby inactive translation products (phase off). In the case of full-length translation, the presence of VNTRs will lead to significant N-terminal protein extensions with every three tandem heptanucleotides encoding an RLKTQDS heptad. Comparison of 10 different OAc+ K1 strains indicated that VNTR-encoded protein extensions may affect NeuO activity (16Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, direct analysis of the enzymatic activity in bacterial lysates is hampered by the high frequency of phase variation, and thus far, isolation of endogenous NeuO failed (15Higa H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8872-8878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we succeeded in purification of active recombinant enzyme, forming the basis for a detailed biochemical characterization of NeuO. Functional and structural analyses of variants encoded by neuO alleles with 0, 12, 24, and 36 heptanucleotide repeats revealed that NeuO shares the typical features of an acyltransferase of the left-handed-β-helix (LβH) superfamily and assembles into hexamers that might be formed by dimerization of two trimers. In contrast to other members of the LβH family, NeuO activity is regulated by changes in the number of N-terminal RLKTQDS heptads and the catalytic efficiency gradually increases with the length of this VNTR-encoded protein extension. Materials—E. coli K1 strains A160 and C375 were kindly provided by M. Achtman and F. Ørskov, respectively. pET expression vectors and E. coli BL21(DE3) were obtained from Novagen. CMP-Neu5Ac, Neu5Ac, colominic acid, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), acetyl-, propionyl-, and butyryl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. Isolated sialic acid dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers were obtained from Nacalai-Tesque (Tokyo, Japan). Cloning of the Capsule-specific O-Acetyltransferase of E. coli K1—In parallel to Deszo et al. (16Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we identified the capsule-specific O-acetyltransferase of E. coli K1 in the unfinished genome of strain RS218 (serotype O18ac:H7:K1, University of Wisconsin) by screening for homologies to the amino acid sequence of the sialic acid O-acetyltransferase of serogroup W-135 and Y meningococci (oatWY, accession number Y13969). A corresponding DNA sequence of the identified gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of the O-acetylation-positive K1 strain C375. The gene was termed oatK1, and the sequence was submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data-bases under the accession number AJ783705. DNA sequencing revealed the presence of 18 heptanucleotide repeats and that the coding region is identical to neuO published by Deszo et al. (16Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R.

Highest scores were obtained for the structural model based on homology to the E. coli maltose O-acetyltransferase (PDB accession number 1ocx), and all structural data were visualized by the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Generation of NeuO Expression Plasmids—Constructs for the expression of wild-type NeuO were constructed in pET22b-Strep. In this modified pET22b vector, the original pelB leader sequence was exchanged by the sequence encoding an N-terminal Strep tag II (WSHPQFEK). NeuO without heptanucleotide repeats was amplified by PCR using genomic E. coli K1 DNA as a template and the primer pair MM275/MM282 (5′-CGGGATCCATGTCGTTTTCCGTTGATG-3′,5′-GTCCGCTCGAGTTGCGTGAGCTTCGCATG-3′). BamHI and XhoI sites (underlined) in forward and reverse primers, respectively, were used for subcloning of the PCR products into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pET22b-Strep, resulting in constructs with an N-terminal Strep tag II and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. NeuO variants with heptanucleotide repeats were amplified by PCR using the primer pair MM301 (5′-CGGGATCCATGTTAAGACTCAAGACTC-3′ and MM282 and genomic DNA of an E. coli K1 strain harboring an neuO gene with 36 heptanucleotide repeats as a template. The forward primer MM301 covers two heptanucleotide repeats and, therefore, can bind randomly within the repeat stretch resulting in a wide variety of PCR products containing 2-36 heptanucleotide repeats. PCR products of different length were subcloned by BamHI/XhoI sites into pET22b-Strep as described above. Constructs containing 12, 24, and 36 repeats were selected, and the number of heptanucleotide repeats was confirmed by sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's guidelines and the following primer pairs: MM295/MM296 to introduce the amino acid exchange H119A (5′-GCGTGCATCAGATGGCGCGCCTATATTTGATATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATATCAAATATAGGCGCGCCATCTGATGCACGC-3′) and MM278/MM279 for the mutation W143A (5′-CATTATATCTAGTTACGTAGCGGTAGGGAGAAATGTCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGACATTTCTCCCTACCGCTACGTAACTAGATATAATG-3′). BamHI/XhoI fragments of the corresponding PCR products were subcloned in pET22b-Strep for recombinant expression in E. coli BL21(DE3). The identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant NeuO—Freshly transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) were cultivated at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB)-medium containing 200 μg/ml carbenicillin. At an optical density (A600) of 0.6 expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and bacteria were harvested 2 h after induction. Purification was performed by immobilized Ni2+-affinity chromatography using HisTrap-chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare). Bacteria were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/500 mm NaCl/40 mm imidazole) and lysed by sonication, and the soluble fraction was applied to a 1-ml column according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing with 25 ml of binding buffer, proteins were eluted with a linear imidazole gradient of 40-500 mm imidazole in binding buffer. Imidazole was removed by gel filtration using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/150 mm NaCl. In Vitro Assay for the Determination of NeuO Activity—NeuO activity was determined in a spectrophotometric assay according to Alpers et al. (22Alpers D.H. Appel S.H. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a total volume of 100 μl, the standard reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm EDTA, 4 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 2 mg/ml colominic acid, and 1 mm acetyl-CoA, and the reaction was initiated by adding 24 pmol of purified enzyme. The reaction was performed at 25 °C and monitored continuously at 405 nm in half-area 96-well plates (Greiner) using a PowerWave 340 microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek). For comparison of NeuO activity toward colominic acid, CMP-Neu5Ac, Neu5Ac, and Neu5Ac oligomers of different length, the concentrations of all acceptor substrates were normalized to equal sialic acid content (6.85 mm) and thereby to an equal number of acceptor sites. For quantification of the sialic acid content, oligomers were hydrolyzed to free sialic acid by treatment with 100 mm trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 80 °C followed by the thiobarbituric acid assay according to Skoza and Mohos (23Skoza L. Mohos S. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) using Neu5Ac as standard. Kinetic Analysis—The acceptor and donor kinetics were measured on purified NeuO variants using the spectrophotometric assay described above. The steady-state parameters, Km and kcat, were determined by holding one substrate at saturating concentration while the concentration of the second substrate was varied. Twelve different concentrations of donor (0.025-2 mm acetyl-CoA) and acceptor substrate (2-215 μm colominic acid) were used. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression analysis with Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Analysis of NeuO Activity in Vivo—NeuO lacking the VNTR region was amplified by PCR using the primers HC412 (5′-GCGCGCGGATCCCGTTTTCCGTTGATGATAATGGG-3′) and HC406 (5′-GCGCGCCTGCAGTATTTATTGCGTGAGCTTCGC-3′) containing BamHI and PstI sites (underlined), respectively. The above described pET-based plasmids containing neuO encoding either wild-type or mutated variants with the amino acid exchanges H119A and W143A were used as a template. PCR products were ligated into BamHI/PstI sites of pQE32 (Qiagen), and the identity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli K1 strain A160, which lacks endogenous neuO. Bacteria were grown on LB-agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μl of a bacterial suspension (optical density at 600 nm = 0.1) were added to each well of a microtiter plate (Greiner) coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). After drying, bacteria were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffer saline. Capsule expression and modification by O-acetylation was monitored in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (24Vogel U. Morelli G. Zurth K. Claus H. Kriener E. Achtman M. Frosch M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): mAb 735 (25Frosch M. Görgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), which is specific for α2,8-linked polySia (OAc+ and OAc- forms), and mAb 58-5 (Monosan), which binds exclusively to the O-acetylated form of the K1 antigen. Determination of the Minimal Acceptor Substrate Length—In a final volume of 50 μl, 200 μg of colominic acid was incubated with 1.3 μg of purified NeuO in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was separated by high percentage PAGE, and the degree of polymerization of the smallest radioactively labeled acceptor molecule was determined by autoradiography. For generation of a radioactively labeled oligosialic acid marker ladder, the solid-phase fixed polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV/PST-1 was autopolysialylated in vitro in the presence of CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac (GE Healthcare) as described (26Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After removal of unbound substrate, radioactively labeled sialic acid oligomers were released by partial endosialidase cleavage. Analysis of Polysialic Acid by High Percentage PAGE—Sialic acid oligomers and polymers were separated on 25% polyacrylamide gels as described (27Pelkonen S. Häyrinen J. Finne J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2646-2653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed for 4 h at 4 °C and 400 V, using 14-cm gels (0.8-mm thick). Immediately after electrophoresis, acrylamide gels were vacuumdried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (GE Healthcare). SDS-PAGE, Silver Staining, and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Silver staining and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (28Gerardy-Schahn R. Bethe A. Brennecke T. Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Ziesing S. Lottspeich F. Frosch M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For detection of the hexahistidine tag, penta-His antibody (Qiagen) was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Strep-tagged proteins were detected with StrepTactin-AP conjugate (IBA) at a 1:4000 dilution. Size-exclusion Chromatography—The quaternary structure of wild-type and mutant NeuO was determined on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/150 mm NaCl and calibrated with molecular mass standards (Sigma) thyroglobulin (669 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome C (12.4 kDa). 1 mg of affinity-purified wild-type or mutant NeuO was applied to the column, and the eluted protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Purification of NeuO Variants with Variable N-terminal Protein Extensions—In all OAc+ E. coli K1 strains investigated so far, neuO contains VNTRs located two nucleotides downstream of the start codon (16Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, full-length translation and thereby expression of active NeuO depend on repeat numbers that are divisible by three. In the case of full-length translation, every three tandem heptanucleotides encode an RLKTQDS heptad. To investigate the role of N-terminal heptads on protein expression and activity, a set of neuO alleles with 0, 12, 24, and 36 heptanucleotide repeats was generated, and the corresponding translation products were termed NeuO+0, NeuO+12, NeuO+24, and NeuO+36, respectively. Each variant was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with an N-terminal Strep- and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (see Fig. 1B for schematic representation). Recombinant proteins were isolated by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Notably, high imidazole concentrations (≥450 mm) were required for the elution of all variants, indicating tight adsorption to the IMAC matrix. Because NeuO was unstable under these conditions, fractions eluted from the IMAC column were loaded immediately onto a Sephadex G-25 column to remove imidazole. Using this purification protocol, all NeuO variants were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1, C and D). Silver staining revealed single bands with an apparent molecular mass consistent with the calculated mass of the respective variant (Fig. 1, B and D). Western blot analysis using StrepTactin and anti-penta-His antibody (Fig. 1D, middle and right panel) revealed that neuO alleles with 12, 24, and 36 heptanucleotide units were translated in full-length proteins with the expected N-terminal extensions of 28, 56, and 84 amino acids, respectively, and no proteolytic cleavage or degradation of the heptad region was observed. From 1-liter cultures, 2.5 mg of purified NeuO+0 was obtained (Fig. 1B). Expression levels and protein yields increased with increasing numbers of VNTRs, suggesting that heptads contribute to protein stability. Because the insertion of 12, 24, and 36 nucleotide repeats increases the molecular mass of the translation products by 13, 25, and 37%, respectively, protein yields were compared on the molar level revealing a 2-fold higher protein yield for NeuO+36 than for NeuO+0 (Fig. 1B). It is worth noting that none of the NeuO variants bound significantly to a StrepTactin column, although the N-terminal Strep tag was detectable by Western blotting (Fig. 1D, middle panel). This observation indicates that in native NeuO the N terminus is not accessible. Remarkably, this finding was irrespective of the presence or absence of heptad repeats (data not shown). For the unequivocal detection of full-length proteins, we kept the Strep tag in all used constructs. Direct comparison of NeuO with and without the Strep tag revealed that this tag did not affect NeuO activity (data not shown). N-terminal Heptads Are Dispensable for Enzymatic Activity of Isolated NeuO—After demonstrating that heptanucleotide repeats are translated in stable protein extensions, we asked whether RLKTQDS heptads are essential for enzymatic activity of NeuO. To investigate this point, the O-acetyltransferase activity of NeuO variants with and without heptad repeats was determined in a modified Alpers assay (22Alpers D.H. Appel S.H. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this spectrophotometric assay, the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to polySia is followed by measuring the appearance of the free sulfhydryl group of CoA-SH with Ellman's reagent. Reactions were initiated by adding equimolar amounts of purified NeuO+0, NeuO+12, NeuO+24, or NeuO+36, and the optical density was monitored at 405 nm. Under the applied conditions of high donor and acceptor substrate concentrations, NeuO+0 and NeuO+12 showed comparable enzymatic activities (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that N-terminal RLKTQDS heptads are dispensable for enzymatic activity. Interestingly, increased activities were observed for NeuO+24 and NeuO+36, indicating that VNTR-encoded protein extensions influence the enzymatic properties of NeuO. RLKTQDS Heptad Repeats Increase the Catalytic Efficiency of NeuO—To further investigate the effect of heptad repeats on the activity of NeuO, substrate kinetics of purified NeuO variants with and without RLKTQDS repeats were compared. In a first step, steady-state kinetic constants of NeuO+0, NeuO+12, NeuO+24, and NeuO+36 were determined for the donor substrate using 12 different concentrations of acetyl-CoA. All kinetic analyses were performed at 25 °C and yielded linear Lineweaver-Burk plots (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The donor Km value of NeuO+0 was determined to be 0.4 mm (Table 1), whereas all Km values of heptad-containing variants were decreased by almost 50%. Vmax and thereby kcat values slightly increased with the number of heptads leading to a 2.3-fold higher kcat for NeuO+36 compared with NeuO+0.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of NeuO variants with different numbers of heptad repeatsNeuO variantDonor substrateDonorAcceptoraFor acceptor kinetics, acceptor substrate concentrations were given as mm sialic acid residues.Kmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1s−1 mm−1mms−1s−1 mm−1+0Acetyl-CoA0.40 ± 0.010.51 ± 0.051.281.17 ± 0.141.99 ± 0.081.70+12Acetyl-CoA0.22 ± 0.040.56 ± 0.072.541.10 ± 0.141.85 ± 0.141.68+24Acetyl-CoA0.27 ± 0.011.07 ± 0.113.951.00 ± 0.042.57 ± 0.112.57+36Acetyl-CoA0.22 ± 0.051.16 ± 0.165.261.06 ± 0.123.84 ± 0.103.62+36Propionyl-CoA0.22 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.010.40a For acceptor kinetics, acceptor substrate concentrations were given as mm sialic acid residues. Open table in a new tab A lower Km value in combination with an increased kcat resulted in a 4-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Kmdonor) of NeuO+36 compared with NeuO+0 (Table 1). Remarkably, kcat/Kmdonor values increased linearly with the number of heptad repeats (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the presence of heptad repeats result in gradual changes in enzyme conformation allowing an increase in enzyme-donor substrate affinity and facilitation of the reaction rate. In a second step, kinetic parameters for the acceptor were determined using 12 different polySia concentrations. As an acceptor substrate, we used colominic acid, a commercially available mixture of oligomeric α2,8-linked sialic acid. Analysis of the batch used in the present study revealed oligomer lengths ranging from 2 to over 60 residues and an average degree of polymerization (DP) of 32.

Epidemics were classified in three levels of mortality burden (""high"", ""moderate"" and ""low""). The model was fitted on 14 influenza seasons and was validated on six subsequent influenza seasons. Five out of the six seasons in the validation set were correctly classified. The average absolute difference between observed and predicted mortality was 2.8 per 100,000 (18% of the average excess mortality) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.89 (P = 0.05).The method described here can be used to estimate the influenza mortality burden in countries where specific pneumonia and influenza mortality surveillance data are not available."

Both proteins fluctuate rapidly between two well folded (native) conformations N1 and N2 and less frequently between N and the excited states I1 and I2 with local disorder that may present structural intermediates on the way to PrPSc. These four structural states can be observed in the hamster and human PrP. At ambient pressure, less than 5 molecules of 10,000 are in the intermediate state I2. From the structural point of view, the different states are mutually different, particularly in positions strategically important for generating species barriers for infection. The results point to the notion that excited state conformers are important for infection and that their structural differences may crucially determine species barriers for infection.

The results point to the notion that excited state conformers are important for infection and that their structural differences may crucially determine species barriers for infection. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are associated with the formation of an oligomeric conformational scrapie isomer, PrPSc, of the host-encoded monomeric prion protein PrPC (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). They are infectious fatal disorders of the central nervous system, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk (2Weissmann C.

According to the “protein only” hypothesis, PrPSc is the sole component of transmissible prions (3Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). The formation of PrPSc involves a conformational switch by which PrPC is transformed into the PrPSc conformation with PrPSc as template (4Horiuchi M. Caughey B. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7 (-R240): R231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A puzzle of this hypothesis is the existence of a wide variety of distinct so-called prion strains with differing infectivity and related to them a species barrier (i.e. the degree of the low interspecies infectivity of a prion strain) (5Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Primarily, the differences in PrPSc amino acid sequence related to heterology of the PrP genotype may account for the formation of distinct prion strains and for the species barrier (6Prusiner S.B. Scott M. Foster D. Pan K.M. Groth D. Mirenda C. Torchia M. Yang S.L. Serban D. Carlson G.A. Hoppe P.C. Westaway D. DeArmond S.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 673-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). For this reason, hamster prions are usually not infectious to wild-type mice, and there is a moderate species barrier for transmission of mouse prions to hamster. However, formation of distinct prion strains is known even when the strains have identical primary structure and the hosts are genetically identical (7Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Neuron. 2002; 34: 854-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The species barrier can be defined as the inability of the host to replicate the conformation of the infectious isomer and is broken only by altering the original conformation and generating a conformationally distinct isoform (8Peretz D.

Basic three-dimensional structures of the cellular prion proteins from different species are known, which include hamster (10James T.L. Liu H. Ulyanov N.B. Farr-Jones S. Zhang H. Donne D.G. Kaneko K.

This indicates that the basic folded structures themselves cannot tell the molecular mechanism for the species barrier for infection. On the other hand, only a couple of sequence variations may change the infectivity (9Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This suggests that the structural basis for the species barrier could be very subtle and local. Our idea is then that we must seek for the structural basis in a site-specific manner with NMR spectroscopy, not in the stable folded state but rather in an unstable and more reactive excited state. To this end, NMR with pressure perturbation is one of the best available methods of study. Application of high hydrostatic pressure will increase the population of an excited state conformer through the difference in their partial molar volumes to the level of spectroscopic detection and may allow the determination of their structures at least qualitatively (17Foguel D. Suarez M.C. Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Porto T.C.R. Palmieri L. Einsiedler C.M. Andrade L.R. Lashuel H.A. Lansbury P.T. Kelly J.W. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present work, we have analyzed the two high pressure NMR data sets from the two proteins in an identical manner to find the similarity and differences in their excited state conformers. Protein Expression and Sample Preparation—Recombinant human prion protein huPrP-(121-230) (residues 121-230) was prepared as described previously (12Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C.

For the NMR experiments, a 1.2 mm solution of 15N-enriched huPrP-(121-230) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, was used. The measurements were performed in 1H2O with 8% 2H2O added. The samples contained 0.1 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as an internal reference. 15N-enriched ShaPrP-(90-231) in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, in 1H2O with 5% 2H2O was measured with trace amounts of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3,-2H]tetradeuteropropionate added as a chemical shift reference. High Pressure NMR Measurements—Online high pressure NMR systems were used in a commercial 5 mm NMR probe from Bruker. To apply high pressure on huPrP-(121-230), we used an one-line variable pressure cell system (20Yamada H. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1974; 45: 640-642Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Price W.E. Ludemann H.D. Holzapfel W.B. Isaacs N.S. High Pressure Techniques in Chemistry and Physics: A Practical Approach. 1997: 225-266Google Scholar) with a sapphire capillary of 1.72-mm inner and 3.14-mm outer diameter (22Arnold M.R. Kalbitzer H.R. Kremer W. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 161: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Kremer W. Arnold M.R. Kachel N. Kalbitzer H.R. Spectroscopy. 2004; 18: 271-278Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY spectra were acquired at hydrostatic pressures of 0.1, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 MPa 2The abbreviations used are: MPa, megapascals; GPa, gigapascals. and at a temperature of 293 K. One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of ShaPrP-(90-231) were measured in a quartz tube with 1-mm inner and 3-mm outer diameter (24Akasaka K. Li H. Yamada H. Li R. Thoresen T. Woodward C.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1946-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) at pressures of 3, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, and 250 MPa and at 303 K. Analysis of the Chemical Shifts—The pressure dependence of the chemical shift values of the amide protons and nitrogen atoms in the HSQC-TROSY spectra of the two proteins was fitted in two different ways, using a second order Taylor expansion (Equation 1) or a two-site fast exchange model (Equation 2). δ(p,T0)=δ0(p0,T0)+B1(p0,T0)(p−p0) + B2(p0,T0)(p−p0)21 δ=11+Kδ1+K1+Kδ2=δ1+δ2exp(−ΔGRT)1−exp(−ΔGRT)2 δ0 is the chemical shift at ambient pressure p0 at temperature T0. The first order pressure coefficient B1 and the second order pressure coefficient B2 of each amide proton were corrected by subtracting the pressure coefficients of the standard peptide (Gly-Gly-X-Ala) of the corresponding amino acid as published by Arnold et al. (23Kremer W. Arnold M.R. Kachel N. Kalbitzer H.R. Spectroscopy. 2004; 18: 271-278Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Arnold M.R. Kremer W. Ludemann H.D. Kalbitzer H.R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The corrected coefficients are referred to as B1* and B2*. If there is an equilibrium between two conformations of the protein that is in fast exchange on the time scale of the NMR experiment, the observed chemical shifts are the weighted average of the chemical shifts δ1 and δ2 of the two states. With an equilibrium constant for the conformational exchange K, K=N2N1 the chemical shift δ is given by Equation 2. The free energy at ambient pressure ΔG0 can be determined by fitting the data to Equation 4. ΔG=ΔG0+ΔV(p−p0)+12Δκ(p−p0)24 Here, ΔV is the partial molar volume, and Δκ is the compressibility. For our calculations of the ΔG0 values, we neglected the quadratic term in Equation 4. Analysis of the Signal Volumes—If there is a conformational exchange that is slow relative to the time scale of the NMR experiment, the signal volume of one state is proportional to its population Ni. Assuming a two-state transition for the change of the conformational equilibrium with increased pressure, the equilibrium constant K can be calculated from the relative cross-peak intensities of the TROSY spectra by Equation 5 (19Kuwata K. Li H. Yamada H. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Akasaka K. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12277-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). K=1−I(p)I0I(p)I05 I(p) is the relative cross-peak intensity at pressure p, and I0 is the intensity when 100% of the protein is in the native state. With this, one obtains the free energy ΔG associated with the pressure-induced conformational change by Equation 6. I(p)=I01+exp(−ΔGRT)6 The free energy at ambient pressure ΔG0 is defined by Equation 4 and can be obtained from a three-parameter fit with I0, ΔV0, and ΔG0, neglecting the second order term in p. Analysis of Pressure-dependent Shift Correlations—When the chemical shift changes in two samples A and B (e.g. the same spin in two constructs of a protein or the hydrogen and nitrogen atoms of an amide group) are governed by the same physical process that can be approximated by a two-site exchange, then the chemical shift changes can be described by the same free energy ΔG. In this case, the pressure-dependent chemical shift changes ΔδA and ΔδB, K=N2N1 ΔδB=δB(p)−δB(p0)=(δ2B−δ1B)f(p) follow the linear relation, ΔδA=(δ2A−δ1A)(δ2B−δ1B)ΔδB9 General Pressure Effects on the Folded Core of Human and Syrian Hamster Prion Protein—Human and Syrian hamster PrP show a species-specific sequence polymorphism that extends also into the folded core of the protein (Fig. 1). One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY NMR spectra of 15N-enriched human prion protein, huPrP-(121-230), were recorded at pH 4.8 (acetate buffer) at various pressures under solution conditions identical to those used for the structure determination (12Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez G.F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). At 293 K, hydrostatic pressures in steps of 0.1, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 MPa were applied. The data of ShaPrP-(90-131) recorded at 303 K and published earlier (19Kuwata K. Li H. Yamada H. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Akasaka K. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12277-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were reevaluated in an identical manner to those from human protein. Slightly different experimental temperatures were selected for the two proteins, since optimal (most complete) NMR spectra were obtained at 303 K for hamster and 293 K for human protein and since the two NMR structures were solved at these temperatures. ΔG is per se temperature-dependent by its TΔS contribution. However, in the used temperature range, the contribution is very small and (as we showed earlier) within the limits of error. More importantly, we showed that the residue-specific pattern of the pressure response is not influenced significantly by a temperature change from 293 to 303 K (18Kachel N. Kremer W. Zahn R. Kalbitzer H.R. BMC Struct. Biol. 2006; 6 (:16,): 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Increasing pressure results in chemical shift changes of almost all resonances. In addition, in TROSY-HSQC spectra, the increased pressure leads to a decrease of the signal volumes of a number of resonances. Some signals disappear completely from the spectra, whereas others show no significant volume changes (18Kachel N. Kremer W. Zahn R. Kalbitzer H.R. BMC Struct. Biol. 2006; 6 (:16,): 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Kuwata K. Li H. Yamada H. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Akasaka K. James T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12277-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Pressure-induced chemical shifts are sensitive measures of conformational fluctuation of a protein, which takes place within the folded manifold of the protein. In general, the pressure response of proteins is not isotropic, and the chemical shift changes induced by the local and global conformational changes lead to a nonlinear dependence of the chemical shifts on pressure. The pressure dependence was described by the zero-order coefficient δ0(p0, T0), the first order coefficient B1 and the second order coefficient B2 of a Taylor expansion around the pressure p0 and the temperature T0 (see Equation 1) (24Akasaka K. Li H. Yamada H. Li R. Thoresen T. Woodward C.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1946-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When the pressure effects are assumed to be composed of two contributions, an unspecific effect as observed in random coil peptides and a specific, structure-dependent effect, then the influence of these effects on the Taylor coefficients can be assumed as additive as long as the two events are not coupled or are only weakly coupled (see “Materials and Methods”). In this case, the corrected, conformation-dependent pressure (Taylor) coefficients B1* and B2* can be obtained by subtracting the correspondent pressure coefficients from random coil peptides. Random coil pressure coefficients are available for the 1H shifts from a study of the model Gly-Gly-X-Ala peptides (25Arnold M.R. Kremer W. Ludemann H.D. Kalbitzer H.R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but not for the 15N shifts. The first order conformation-dependent pressure coefficients B1*(H) for the 1HN shifts and of the uncorrected pressure coefficient B1(N) of the 15NH chemical shift as a function of the primary and the secondary structure are displayed in Fig. 2 for the structured core of huPrP and ShaPrP. Analogously, the second order coefficients B2*(H) and B2(N) are plotted as a function of the sequence position in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3Second order pressure coefficients of the 1HN and of the 15NH chemical shifts taken from the TROSY/HSQC spectra of human and hamster PrP. Only values for the folded core (residues 120-230) are given. The conformation-dependent pressure coefficients B2*(H) (a) for the 1HN shifts and the uncorrected pressure coefficient B2(N) (b) for the 15NH chemical shifts are plotted as a function of the sequence position. Black bars, human protein; white bars, hamster protein. In addition, the secondary structure of the human prion protein is symbolized by arrows (β-strands) and lanyards (α-helices). Note that huPrP-(121-230) contains two additional N-terminal amino acids, Gly119 and Ser120, as cloning artifacts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mean values of the absolute first order pressure coefficients |B1*(H)| and |B1(N)| of the human protein are 0.54 and 3.35 ppm/GPa. The corresponding values for the Syrian hamster protein (only residues 121-230) are quite similar, at 0.58 and 3.03 ppm/GPa. In the case of the second order coefficients |B2*(H)| and |B2(N)|, there are significantly larger differences in the mean values: 1.69 and 7.29 ppm/GPa2 (human) and 1.19 and 6.15 ppm/GPa2 (hamster). The same is observed for the correlation coefficients of B1*(H), B1(N), B2*(H), and B2(N) of the two proteins. The correlation coefficients are 0.67 (B1*(H)), 0.52 (B1(N)), 0.18 (B2*(H)), and 0.16 (B2(N)), and the corresponding slopes are 0.70, 0.52, 0.13, and 0.14. The rather low correlations, especially for the second order coefficients, are not only caused by the difference of the two proteins. For residues with small pressure-induced shifts, the second order Taylor coefficients cannot be determined from the data with high precision; their relatively large errors remove possibly existing global correlations almost completely. Calculating the correlation coefficients for huPrP and ShaPrP directly from the chemical shifts (see Equation 9), leads to much higher values. The mean value of the correlation coefficients of each residue of huPrP to its corresponding residue of ShaPrP is 0.82 in the case of HN and 0.86 for the NH. However, distinct local differences and interesting trends of shifts are found in both proteins. Pressure-induced Shifts and First Order Pressure Coefficient—The first order coefficients B1*(H) for the 1HN shifts (Fig. 2a) are plotted as deviations from corresponding shifts in model peptides. The positive coefficient generally means that the hydrogen bond is compressed more than that in the model peptide, whereas the negative coefficient generally means that the hydrogen bond is less compressed than in the model peptide or even elongated. A somewhat reduced first order coefficient (0 < B1*(H) < - B1rc(H, with B1rc(H the first order shift coefficient of the corresponding amino acid of the random coil model) is the typical pressure response for protons involved in internal hydrogen bonds to carbonyl groups in proteins (27Li H. Yamada H. Akasaka K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Akasaka K. Li H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8665-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the model peptide, the maximum first order 1H shift coefficient is found for threonine with 0.72 ppm GPa-1. 1H chemical shift changes outside of this range can be considered to be a consequence of special structural features. For 15N, random coil pressure coefficients are not available; however, the values vary clearly as a function of the sequence (Fig. 2b). The second order coefficients (Fig. 3) show larger errors than the first order coefficients, especially when the overall pressure-induced shifts are relatively small. In random coil peptides, they vary between 0.53 and -0.66 ppm GPa-2. Again, at different sites of the PrPs, second order pressure coefficients are observed that are clearly outside of this range. The largest deviation of the 1H second order pressure coefficient is found for Glu211 of the human PrP with -12.3 ppm GPa-2 (Fig. 3a). Larger second order coefficients are usually related to global conformational transitions (see below). Differences in Pressure Response—In Fig. 4, residues that show significant differences in the pressure response in the two proteins are depicted in the human and hamster structure. Differences were considered as significant and highly significant when at least one of the four different pressure coefficients of the two proteins differed by more than σ0 and 2σ0, respectively. Such differences can be seen in the β-pleated sheet β1 (Gly131), loop L2 (I138M, I139M, His140, and Phe141) connecting β1 with helix α1 and in the helix α1 (Asp147, Arg151, and H155N). Loop L3 and β-strand β2 show significant differences in the pressure response of the two proteins at positions Arg156 and Tyr163, respectively. In loop L4, only one residue (S170N) shows differences in the pressure response. Helix α2 shows differences in its second half (Thr183, Lys185, His187, Val189, and Thr192). The long interconnecting loop L5 reacts similarly to pressure in the proteins ShaPrP and huPrP. A different pressure response of a significant part of the helix α3 (M205I, Glu207, Val210, Glu211, Met213, I215T, and E219Q) is observed. Conformational Transitions in the Native State—The pressure dependence of the chemical shifts after correction by the pressure dependence of random coil peptides (25Arnold M.R. Kremer W. Ludemann H.D. Kalbitzer H.R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Akasaka K. Chem. Rev. 2006; 108: 1814-1835Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar) of selected residues of ShaPrP is plotted in Fig. 5. These residues show a behavior that is typical for a two-state transition between conformational states in fast exchange on the NMR time scale. The same behavior was described earlier for certain residues of huPrP (18Kachel N. Kremer W. Zahn R. Kalbitzer H.R. BMC Struct. Biol. 2006; 6 (:16,): 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). With Equations 2 and 4, it is possible to fit the data and to calculate the molar free energy for this structural transition. ΔG0 is 3.0 ± 1.4 kJ/mol in the case of huPrP (18Kachel N. Kremer W. Zahn R. Kalbitzer H.R. BMC Struct. Biol. 2006; 6 (:16,): 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 3.3 ± 1.1 kJ/mol for ShaPrP (Fig. 5). Within the limits of error, the values are the same for both species (Table 1). The low ΔG0 values and small chemical shift changes indicate that the observed conformational exchange takes place between two structurally relatively similar native conformations N1 and N2. The pressure-stabilized conformer N2 is already significantly populated at ambient pressure. About 76 and 23% of the human PrP and 78 and 21% of the hamster PrP occur in states N1 and N2 at ambient pressures.TABLE 1Gibbs free energies and specific volumes Mean and S.D. values are given for ΔG0 and ΔV0.Protein and transitionK0Population at 0.1 MpaΔG0ΔV0ΔV0%kJ mol–1ml mol–1nm3ShaPrP-(90–230)aData were measured at 303 K and represent the average of the residues in the corresponding domain for amino acids 121–230.

Biol. 2006; 6 (:16,): 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)c ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Fluctuations Involving Locally Disordered Conformers (Cross-peak Intensity Changes)—With increasing pressure, a large proportion of the signals in the TROSY-HSQC spectra of huPrP and ShaPrP lose intensity. Assuming a two-site model, the pressure-induced changes of signal volumes and thus of the corresponding populations can be used to calculate a molar free energy difference (ΔG0) for every single amino acid residue in the polypeptide chain. The distribution of the ΔG0 values of the individual residues indicates for both species the existence of (at least) two different independent conformational exchange processes and therefore the existence of two pressure-stabilized intermediate states, I1 (intermediate ΔG0) and I2 (high ΔG0) (Fig. 6, a and b, and Table 1). The corresponding energy distributions for the transitions to the intermediate states are shifted to somewhat higher values for the hamster PrP (Fig. 6) (i.e. higher energies are necessary to shift the equilibrium to the transition state for ShaPrP). Correspondingly, about 0.8 and 0.01% of hamster PrP occur in states I1 and I2 at ambient pressure, respectively. For the human PrP, slightly higher values of 1.1 and 0.05% are obtained at ambient pressure. Common Features of the Two Prion Proteins—In the part of the protein studied in this paper (amino acids 121-230) and corresponding essentially to the folded core of the hamster and human prion protein, only 14 amino acids differ. In addition, the human protein contains two C-terminal deletions and one insertion compared with the Syrian hamster protein (Fig. 1). These sequence variations influence the conformation of the folded core and the pressure response of the protein. However, the observed effects may vary in their extent considerably. They are also connected to the species barrier, but again all sequence variations are not equally important (29Zahn R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 309-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In general, two different pressure responses are to be expected: 1) a small structural change that depends on the local compressibility of the protein and 2) a shift of the conformational equilibrium between different structural states. Both processes usually cause chemical shift changes that can be described by the first and second order pressu"

Histidines 120 and 213 have previously been shown to be essential in binding zinc across an intersubunit binding site. We tested the flexibility of the zinc-binding site by making mutations that had the effect of shifting the two essential histidines up to 13 residues upstream or downstream from their original positions and then testing the ability of the mutated receptors to respond to zinc. Using this method, we were able to explore potential orientations of the two regions relative to one another. Our data are consistent with a moderately flexible zinc-binding site and inconsistent with parallel and anti-parallel orientations of the regions surrounding histidines 120 and 213.

ATP acts as a signaling molecule in the nervous system, where it elicits a number of effects, including fast excitatory synaptic transmission, through P2X receptors (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that open when exposed to extracellular ATP. Seven P2X receptor subtypes have been cloned in mammals, and they are expressed throughout the body (for review, see Ref. 1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). A functional channel is likely made up of three subunits (2Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and may be either homo- or heteromeric (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Each subunit has two transmembrane domains, with intracellular N and C termini and a large extracellular loop (see Fig. 1A). The P2X2 protein is expressed throughout the nervous system of rats (3Kanjhan R. Housley G.D. Burton L.D. Christie D.L. Kippenberger A. Thorne P.R. Luo L. Ryan A.F. J. Comp.

Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The colocalization of zinc and P2X2 in parts of the nervous system suggests a possible physiological role for this effect (3Kanjhan R. Housley G.D. Burton L.D. Christie D.L. Kippenberger A.

Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 393-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Previous studies of recombinant rat P2X2 receptors have identified two key residues involved in zinc potentiation. By individually mutating each extracellular histidine and cysteine to alanine, histidines 120 and 213 were both found to be required for the potentiation of current by zinc (8Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Clyne J.D. Wang L.F. Hume R.I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more recent study (12Nagaya N. Tittle R.K. Saar N. Dellal S.S. Hume R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25982-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) provided evidence that histidines 120 and 213 are directly involved in zinc binding and that zinc is bound at the interface between adjacent subunits. We hypothesized that there might be sufficient flexibility across the subunit interface to tolerate some degree of misalignment and still effectively bind zinc. To test this idea, we conducted a histidine scan of the regions surrounding the zinc-binding site (see Fig. 1B). By replacing one of the two essential endogenous histidines with alanine and then substituting histidine for a nearby residue, we could effectively shift each key histidine upstream or downstream of its normal location. Because basic principles of protein structure (13Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure.2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1998: 13-87Google Scholar) indicate that the side chains of residues involved in an α helix are expected to point the same direction every 3.6 residues, the side chains in β sheets are expected to face the same direction every other residue, and the side chains of adjacent amino acids in a loop can point in the same direction, the location of any histidines that restored zinc potentiation (relative to positions 120 and 213) should allow us to draw inferences regarding the structure of the two distinct regions that comprise this zinc-binding site. Mutagenesis—Rat P2X2 cDNA (encoding a 472-amino acid protein) in pcDNA1 was obtained from Dr. D. Julius (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences of mutant subunits were confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core). Except where otherwise noted, each mutant is referred to by the original amino acid (one-letter code) followed by the residue number and the substituted amino acid (one-letter code). Expression of P2X2 Receptors—P2X2 receptors were expressed in defolliculated stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes. Oocytes were harvested using procedures approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Vertebrate Animals and have been described in detail previously (14Zhou Z. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RNAs encoding wild type and mutant P2X2 receptors were synthesized using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Each oocyte was injected with 50 nl of RNA at 5–10 ng/μl. Electrophysiological Recordings—Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed 2–5 days after RNA injection. All of the recordings were made at a holding potential of -50 mV. Recording electrodes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass on a model P-87 Flaming Brown puller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) and had resistances of 0.5–1 MΩ. The currents were recorded with a Turbo TEC-03 voltage clamp amplifier (npi electronic GmBH, Tamm, Germany). Data acquisition was performed using a Digidata 1322A interface controlled by pCLAMP 9 (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Solutions—The external recording solution contained 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Electrodes were filled with an internal solution of 3 m KCl. Disodium ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as a 100 mm stock in double-distilled H2O and stored at -20 °C. For recording, ATP solutions were made by diluting the stock in external recording solution. To compensate for the chelation of Mg2+ by ATP, we added MgCl2 to our solutions such that all solutions contained 1 mm free Mg2+, as determined by the program Bound and Determined (15Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Zinc chloride was prepared as a 10 mm stock in external recording solution that was acidified with 0.01 m HCl to prevent precipitation. The pH of ATP solutions with and without zinc was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH prior to recording. In some experiments, apyrase was added to solutions to remove any endogenous ATP released from the oocytes. We used grade 1 apyrase (Sigma-Aldrich) that was prepared as 100 units/ml aliquots in double-distilled H2O and stored at -20 °C. The apyrase recording solutions were diluted to a final concentration of 1 unit/ml apyrase in external recording solution and were used within 20 min of preparation. Quantification of Zinc Potentiation and Selection of Zinc and ATP Concentrations—The response of P2X2 receptors to zinc is biphasic; at low levels, zinc causes potentiation, but at high levels it results in inhibition of current (8Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Wildman S.S. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we used the nonpotentiating mutants H120A and H213A to demonstrate that these two effects of zinc are separate processes. At a zinc concentration of 20 μm or below the inhibition is negligible, whereas at all higher zinc concentrations both processes are occurring (8Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore used 20 μm zinc in all experiments testing only zinc potentiation, even though 50 and 100 μm zinc produce greater potentiation (see Fig. 5). We defined potentiation to zinc as [(current in low ATP + 20 μm zinc)/current in low ATP] - 1. Thus, a cell that showed no increase in current in response to zinc had a zinc potentiation ratio equal to 0. To compare the magnitude of zinc potentiation between groups of oocytes, it is essential that all of the oocytes be studied at similar points on the ATP concentration-response relation, because as the concentration of ATP increases, potentiation decreases so that there is no zinc potentiation when a saturating concentration of ATP is present (8Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Wildman S.S. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the EC50 for ATP of different oocytes expressing the same construct can vary significantly (16Clyne J.D. Brown T.C. Hume R.I. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In all experiments except those shown in Fig. 5, we dealt with these complications by testing each oocyte first with a low concentration of ATP that we expected would be close to the EC10 based on the average concentration-response relation for each construct and then with a high concentration of ATP, which was a maximal concentration (again based on the average concentration-response relation). Only oocytes for which it was verified that the low ATP concentration used was between the EC5 and the EC20 (so that at least a 5-fold increase in current was possible) were included in the data presented. For the experiments presented in Fig. 5, we used a simpler approach to determine which oocytes should be excluded. For each construct we already knew from experiments presented in Figs. 2 and 3 the amount of potentiation that would be obtained in response to 20 μm zinc when the ATP level was correctly set. Therefore, in the zinc concentration-response experiments, any oocyte that gave zinc potentiation to 20 μm zinc more than one standard deviation above or below the known average value was considered to have had an EC10 for ATP outside of the acceptable range and was excluded from the average data.FIGURE 3Zinc potentiation for double mutants tested in the histidine scans.

The significance of differences between groups was tested using the two-tailed, unpaired t test function of Excel, with significance taken to be p < 0.01. Concentration-response relations for ATP were fit to the three parameter Hill equation using the nonlinear curve fitting program of Sigmaplot 8.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). For displaying average data, the points from each oocyte were normalized to between 0 and 100% based on the maximum value of the fitted curve. The scaled data were then averaged and plotted with error bars indicating the standard error of the mean. The lines fit to the data indicate the average parameters of the individual fits. We made a total of 22 double mutants in which one essential histidine remained in its original position and the other was near its original position (Fig. 1B). For the H120A scan, these included all residues between serine 116 and threonine 123. For the H213A scan, all residues between aspartate 209 and isoleucine 226 were mutated, except for cysteines 214 and 224, which form an essential disulfide bond (11Clyne J.D. Wang L.F. Hume R.I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for extending this scan so far from position 213 in the C-terminal direction was that the disulfide bond might bring residues near 224 close to position 213. By comparing the level of zinc potentiation in these mutants with that of wild type P2X2, we were able to assay the extent to which the altered receptors could respond to zinc. Responses to ATP—Two mutations in this study resulted in nonfunctional P2X2 receptors: H213A/P225H and H213A/I226H. This result is consistent with the finding that P225A and I226A were nonresponsive to ATP (17Nakazawa K. Ojima H. Ishii-Nozawa R. Takeuchi K. Ohno Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 483: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All other mutations made in the present study resulted in functional receptors, and the ATP concentration-response relationship was determined (Table 1).TABLE 1The EC50 values of all mutant receptors characterized in this study All of the data are ± S.E.ConstructEC50nan refers to the number of oocytes testedμmP2X222 ± 17Single mutantsH120A18 ± 26K212A27 ± 26K212H53 ± 1bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H213A29 ± 1bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016Double mutantsS116H/H120A29 ± 210M117H/H120A15 ± 1bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.018R118H/H120A90 ± 13bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.015V119H/H120A35 ± 3bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.0110H120A/S121H33 ± 38H120A/S122H70 ± 7bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H120A/T123H21 ± 16D209H/H213A15 ± 0bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.0110Y210H/H213A34 ± 66L211H/H213A380 ± 56bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.019K212H/H213A187 ± 13bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.017H213A/T215H13 ± 1bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.0115H213A/F216H46 ± 4bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H213A/D217H14 ± 1bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.015H213A/Q218H27 ± 1bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H213A/D219H26 ± 16H213A/S220H34 ± 2bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H213A/D221H6 ± 0bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H213A/P222H26 ± 26H213A/Y223H89 ± 12bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016Quadruple mutantsV119H/H120A/L211H/H213A (H119/H211)2,549 ± 118bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H120A/S121H/L211H/H213A (H121/H211)503 ± 126bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016V119H/H120A/K212H/H213A (H119/H212)578 ± 58bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016H120A/S121H/K212H/H213A (H121/H212)452 ± 15bReceptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.016a n refers to the number of oocytes testedb Receptors with an EC50 that significantly differed from wild type receptors at p < 0.01 Open table in a new tab Many of the histidine scan mutants had EC50 values that were significantly different from wild type P2X2. Seven mutant receptors had an EC50 that was shifted more than 2-fold from that of wild type P2X2. Of these, six shifted to the right, and in the most extreme case (L211H/H213A), the EC50 was right-shifted more than 10-fold. One mutant (H213A/D221H) was shifted to the left, with an EC50 of 6 μm compared with 22 μm for wild type. Responses to Zinc—Fig. 2 shows representative traces obtained when the zinc potentiation protocol was tested on oocytes expressing wild type P2X2, H120A, H213A, and the four histidine scan mutants that involved the smallest shifts to either side of the normal position of the histidine. Average data for all of the double mutants studied are presented in Fig. 3. The average zinc potentiation ratio for wild type P2X2 was 6.4 ± 0.37. As reported previously, mutation of His120 or His213 to alanine produces receptors that are almost completely unaffected by the application of zinc (8Clyne J.D. LaPointe L.D. Hume R.I. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with an average zinc potentiation ratio of -0.1 ± 0.01 for H120A and 0.2 ± 0.06 for H213A. In the scan around His213, histidine substitution at 11 of the 13 positions tested resulted in zinc potentiation ratios that were not greater than the H213A single mutant. One double mutant, L211H/H213A, showed modest but statistically significant potentiation (zinc potentiation ratio of 0.50 ± 0.05), whereas a second (K212H/H213A) had an average zinc potentiation ratio of 13.9 ± 0.6, which was significantly greater than wild type P2X2. Similarly, in the scan around His120, substitution at only a single position (H120A/S121H) resulted in a zinc potentiation ratio greater than 0.5 (3.5 ± 0.09). However, in this region, four of the five other positions tested gave zinc potentiation that was small but significantly greater than that exhibited by the H120A single mutant. Thus, robust zinc potentiation was present only when a histidine was shifted no more than one residue downstream or upstream of its endogenous location. Further Analysis of the K212H/H213A Mutant—The level of zinc potentiation in the mutant K212H/H213A was greater than wild type P2X2. Furthermore, the combination of zinc and low ATP exceeded the maximum current attained by saturating levels of ATP, which is not the case for wild type P2X2 (Fig. 2). There were a number of possible explanations for this phenomenon. We first tested whether this effect was due to the loss of the lysine at position 212 rather than to the new position of the histidine by studying the properties of two single mutants: K212A and K212H (Fig. 4). Because lysine 212 is conserved across all seven P2X receptors, it might be expected to play a critical role. The ATP concentration-response relation and zinc potentiation ratio for K212A were not significantly different from wild type P2X2 (EC50 of 27 μm and zinc potentiation ratio of 7.7 ± 0.3). This was a similar result to that reported by Ennion et al. (18Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 27535656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), who found that mutating the equivalent lysine in P2X1 to alanine or arginine had almost no effect on ATP potency. K212H was slightly right-shifted in its response to ATP when compared with wild type P2X2 (EC50 of 53 μm), but its zinc potentiation ratio, at 7.8, was not significantly different from wild type. Thus, removing the lysine at 212 or adding an additional histidine at 212 is insufficient to produce the phenotype exhibited by the K212H/H213A double mutant. We conclude that it is the movement of the histidine from position 213 to position 212 and not the loss of the lysine at position 212 that accounts for the properties of this double mutant. It was possible that K212H/H213A might have a shifted potency for its potentiating or inhibiting response to zinc compared with wild type. To test this possibility, we compared the zinc concentration-response relations for wild type P2X2 and the K212H/H213A mutant (Fig. 5, A, B, and E). This was accomplished by adding higher and higher concentrations of zinc to the [EC10] ATP. Although the fold potentiation for K212H/H213A was higher than that for wild type P2X2 at every concentration of zinc tested, the concentration-response relation for both potentiation and inhibition was similar. Recent reports suggest that airway epithelial cells respond to extracellular zinc in the absence of ATP by a process that involves P2X4, P2X6, or coassembly of the two subunits (19Zsembery A. Fortenberry J.A. Liang L. Bebok Z. Tucker T.A. Boyce A.T. Braunstein G.M. Welty E. Bell P.D. Sorscher E.J. Clancy J.P. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2005; 289: C388-C396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the responses of wild type P2X2 and the K212H/H213A mutant to ascending concentrations of zinc (2, 5, 20, 50, 100, and 500 μm) to see whether zinc alone could elicit an inward current. For oocytes with holding currents of -35 nA or less at -50 mV, the responses to zinc were small outward currents that did not differ significantly from uninjected oocytes. For oocytes with larger holding currents at -50 mV, we sometimes observed small inward currents in response to zinc. However, the amplitudes of the zinc responses were positively correlated with the amplitudes of the holding currents so it seemed plausible that these oocytes were leaking ATP and that the inward currents were due to zinc acting on the small proportion of receptors that had ATP bound rather than due to an effect of zinc alone. We therefore tested the effect of zinc alone in the presence of 1 unit/ml of apyrase to destroy endogenous ATP. With apyrase, the average response to 20 μm zinc was a very small outward current in oocytes expressing wild type P2X2 (+3 ± 3 nA), K212H/H213A (+3 ± 2 nA) and in uninjected oocytes (+6 ± 1 nA, n = 6 each), regardless of the holding current (Fig. 5, C and D). There was no significant difference between the three groups of oocytes. We therefore conclude that zinc alone cannot open the channels of P2X2 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The Effect of Simultaneously Moving Both Histidines—If the region near His120 and the region near His213 ran in a parallel orientation (as suggested in Fig. 1B), then simultaneously moving both histidines in the C-terminal direction or in the N-terminal direction might be expected to create a receptor that more closely mimics the normal distance between these histidines than either double mutant alone and thus might restore normal zinc potentiation. Conversely, if these two regions ran in an anti-parallel orientation, the normal distance would be restored when one histidine was moved in the N-terminal direction and the other in the C-terminal direction. To test these ideas, we made quadruple mutants in which both critical histidines were moved from their endogenous positions (Fig. 6). Because Cys214 is an essential cysteine, we only explored combinations in which the second histidine was moved in the N-terminal direction, either to position 211 or 212, whereas the first histidine was moved from 120 in both directions. For clarity of presentation, we will refer to these quadruple mutants by the positions of their histidines. Thus, V119H/H120A/K212H/H213A, a quadruple mutant, will be referred to as H119/H212. Using this nomenclature, wild type P2X2 is H120/H213, and the most highly zinc potentiating double mutant is H120/H212. As noted previously, the ATP concentration-response relations of H120/H211 and H120/H212 double mutant receptors were right-shifted compared with wild type P2X2 (EC50 values of 380 and 187 μm, respectively). The four quadruple mutants that included His211 and His212 were much more severely right-shifted, with three of the four EC50 values near 500 μm and the fourth exceeding 2 mm (Table 1). To test the predictions of the parallel and anti-parallel models, we compared zinc potentiation data from wild type, double mutant, and quadruple mutant receptors (Table 2). The double mutant H120/H211 showed very modest potentiation to zinc, suggesting that a better positioned first histidine should have been able to substantially augment zinc potentiation when paired with His211. The parallel model predicts that His119 will be closer to His211 than His121, whereas the anti-parallel model predicts that His121 will be closer to His211, so if one of these models is a good description of this region, then one quadruple mutant receptor should have zinc potentiation enhanced and the other suppressed. However, neither H119/H211 nor H121/H211 receptors showed significant zinc potentiation (Fig. 6B), so both positions were significantly worse than H120/H211. Conversely, if orientation were either parallel or anti-parallel, then either His119 or His121 would be expected to be too distant to form a zinc site with His212. However, both H119/H212 and H121/H212 supported substantial zinc potentiation. In summary, regardless of the position of the other histidine, the ability to potentiate to zinc followed the order His212 > His213 > His211 and His120 > His121 > His119. We conclude from these experiments that it is likely that the regions containing His120 and His213 are neither parallel nor anti-parallel to each other.TABLE 2Extent of zinc potentiation in receptors in which both histidines were moved compared with receptors when one or both histidines were at their normal locations All of the data are ± S.E.ConstructEC10 for [ATP]Zinc potentiation at EC10 ATPnan refers to the number of oocytes testedμmH119/H211bReceptors in which both histidines were moved500–0.3 ± 0.035H119/H212bReceptors in which both histidines were moved780.8 ± 0.166H119/H213120.3 ± 0.106H120/H2111000.5 ± 0.125H120/H2123713.9 ± 1.526H120/H213 (wild type P2X2)36.4 ± 0.906H121/H211bReceptors in which both histidines were moved620.0 ± 0.055H121/H212bReceptors in which both histidines were moved714.8 ± 0.769H121/H213153.5 ± 0.236a n refers to the number of oocytes testedb Receptors in which both histidines were moved Open table in a new tab From our previous work (12Nagaya N. Tittle R.K. Saar N. Dellal S.S. Hume R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25982-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we knew that the interaction of His120 and His213 with zinc is across the interface between adjacent subunits. Because the interface of two subunits was involved, one possibility was that there might be sufficient flexibility in one subunit or the other to allow the positions of the critical histidines to be moved and still retain zinc binding. However, we also knew that all 10 extracellular cysteines in P2X receptors are probably involved in disulfide bonds (11Clyne J.D. Wang L.F. Hume R.I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3873-3880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because His120 is only four residues from Cys124 and His213 is next to Cys214, the presence of disulfide bonds so close to these histidines suggested that the structure around them might be highly ordered. In this case, movement of the histidines to other locations might be expected to render the receptor incapable of responding to zinc. To test these ideas, we conducted a histidine scan of the rat P2X2 zinc-binding site by replacing one of the endogenous required histidines with alanine and replacing a nearby residue with histidine. By assaying the resulting double and quadruple mutants for their responsiveness to zinc, we were able to assess the tolerance of the zinc-binding site to shifted positions of the essential histidines. It should be noted that our zinc potentiation assay does not measure zinc binding directly, so there are multiple potential explanations for mutations that do not potentiate to zinc. However, when potentiation was present, the magnitude of the effect provided interesting new information about the structure of these receptors. Our results suggest a zinc-binding site that is intermediate between the highly flexible and the highly ordered models and suggest that the regions around His120 and His213 take on neither an α helical nor a β sheet secondary structure. The latter interpretation of the data is based on the observation that the side chains of residues involved in an α helix are expected to point the same direction every 3.6 residues, and the side chains in β sheets are expected to face the same direction every other residue (13Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure.2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1998: 13-87Google Scholar). However, the pattern of residues that could support zinc potentiation fit neither of these patterns. As far as the region around position 120, moving the histidine to any of five nearby positions gave detectable zinc potentiation. Thus, any of six positions somewhat symmetrically spread in either direction around position 120 can come close enough to His213 to form a zinc-binding site, although all but 120 and 121 do this very poorly. The spread around position 213 was unidirectional. When we inserted a histidine at positions beyond 213, none of the locations tested was able to produce receptors that could respond to zinc. This suggests that the entire loop formed by the disulfide bridge between Cys214 and Cys224 is pointed away from the zinc binding interface. In contrast, placing a histidine at either of the two positions just before the location of the endogenous histidine produced receptors that showed slight (position 211) or substantial (position 212) zinc potentiation. A possible structure for each of these regions therefore is a loop in which the residues directly before and after the endogenous histidines point in a similar direction. By moving both histidine residues at once, we were able to make predictions about relative orientation of the two regions of the zinc-binding site. If the region near 120 and the region near 213 were in loops in the same plane (as shown in Figs. 1A and 6A), then the peptide backbones of the two regions would be either relatively parallel or anti-parallel to each other. Because our results with quadruple mutants do not support either model, it seems likely that these two regions are in different planes. One potential model is that they approach each other only at a point normally defined by 120 and 121 on one side and by 212 and 213 on the other but that some side to side movement is possible in either subunit. There is a functional dissociation between the ability of receptors to respond to zinc and their ability to respond to ATP. Wild type receptors (EC50 for ATP of 22 μm), K212H/H213A receptors (EC50 for ATP of 187 μm), and H121/H212 receptors (EC50 for ATP of 452 μm) all responded robustly to zinc. Indeed, the K212H/H213A receptors potentiated to zinc better than the wild type P2X2. Conversely, the H120A and H213A mutants responded to ATP like wild type receptors but were zinc-insensitive. The response to ATP and the response to zinc seem to be functionally separate processes. Are the binding sites also structurally distinct? One approach to understanding ATP binding has been through site-directed mutagenesis of residues conserved in all P2X receptors, followed by additional tests to distinguish binding from gating (18Ennion S.

A recent study showed that two of these residues, Lys68 and Phe291, are in very close proximity across the subunit interface (25Marquez-Klaka B. Rettinger J. Bhargava Y. Eisele T. Nicke A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1456-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in a P2X1/2 chimera. If these residues are directly involved in binding ATP, this indicates that ATP as well as zinc binds between subunits in P2X receptors. Another recent study also suggests an intersubunit ATP-binding site (27Wilkinson W.J. Jiang L.H. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A second approach to understanding ATP binding has been to make models of the ATP-binding site based on homology to other proteins with known structures. One model for the ATP-binding site is based on the crystal structure of synapsin II (28Roberts J.A. Vial C. Digby H.R. Agboh K.C. Wen H. Atterbury-Thomas A. Evans R.J. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 486-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The synapsin II model includes roles for many of the residues identified as critical in mutagenesis scans. Another interesting model for ATP binding to P2X receptors (29Freist W. Verhey J.F. Stuhmer W. Gauss D.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is based on similarities between residues in the extracellular domain of P2X receptors and the catalytic domains of the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which also bind ATP. This model has been extended to P2X4 receptors (30Yan Z. Liang Z. Tomic M. Obsil T. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1078-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Yan Z. Liang Z.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32649-32659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and tested by making site-directed mutants of several residues predicted to be critical in ATP binding. Potential limitations of this model are that several of the key residues are not conserved across the P2X receptor family and that the region modeled includes only residues from Lys180 to Lys326 (which represent about the second half of the extracellular domain), even though a role for Lys69 in binding ATP has been supported by a number of studies (18Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 27535656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although this model may be incomplete, it makes interesting predictions about the structure of P2X2 in the vicinity of His213. The position of this histidine is predicted to be in a loop between strands β1 and β2 of a six-strand β-pleated sheet. Although none of the residues mutated in our histidine scan are directly implicated in binding the ATP molecule, the next residue in the C-terminal direction after our scan, Phe227 (P2X2 numbering), was implicated in binding to the adenine ring. If this is correct, His213 would also be close to the adenine ring of a bound ATP because of the disulfide bond between Cys214 and Cys224. Although this model does not include a prediction for the His120 region of the scan, we know that when histidines 120 and 213 are both mutated to cysteine, they are close enough to form an intersubunit disulfide bond (12Nagaya N. Tittle R.K. Saar N. Dellal S.S. Hume R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25982-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the model by Yan et al. (30Yan Z. Liang Z. Tomic M. Obsil T. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1078-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is a good approximation of the residues that bind ATP, it would mean that the region surrounding His120 is also very close to the bound ATP. This model suggests a possible reason that no residues other than His120 and His213 have thus far been identified as binding to zinc, although most zinc-binding sites are tetrahedral (32Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). This result could be explained if the coordination of zinc within P2X2 receptors involves an interaction with ATP, which has a significant affinity for divalent cations, including zinc (33Sigel H. Griesser R. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2005; 34: 875-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We thank members of the Hume laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2010841499,"The mammalian serine-arginine (SR) protein, ASF/SF2, contains multiple contiguous RS dipeptides at the C terminus, and ∼12 of these serines are processively phosphorylated by the SR protein kinase 1 (SRPK1). We have recently shown that a docking motif in ASF/SF2 specifically interacts with a groove in SRPK1, and this interaction is necessary for processive phosphorylation. We previously showed that SRPK1 and its yeast ortholog Sky1p maintain their active conformations using diverse structural strategies. Here we tested if the mechanism of ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by SRPK is evolutionarily conserved. We show that Sky1p forms a stable complex with its heterologous mammalian substrate ASF/SF2 and processively phosphorylates the same sites as SRPK1. We further show that Sky1p utilizes the same docking groove to bind yeast SR-like protein Gbp2p and phosphorylates all three serines present in a contiguous RS dipeptide stretch. However, the mechanism of Gbp2p phosphorylation appears to be non-processive. Thus, there are physical attributes of SR and SR-like substrates that dictate the mechanism of phosphorylation, whereas the ability to processively phosphorylate substrates is inherent to SR protein kinases.

Pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export are complex processes, which involve a large number of protein and RNA factors (1Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin.

SR proteins, a class of non-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein splicing factors, participate in every step in the spliceosome assembly and catalysis (5Sanford J.R. Longman D. Caceres J.F. Prog. Mol. Subcell Biol. 2003; 31: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SR proteins have unique domain architecture. The N-terminal domain contains one or two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) 3The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; SRPK, SR protein kinase 1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; wt, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; SRPK, SR protein kinase 1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; wt, wild type. and is responsible for RNA binding, and the C-terminal domain, known as the RS domain, is rich in long stretches of serine-arginine/arginineserine (SR/RS) dipeptides (6Fu X.D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). The RS domains of SR proteins are extensively phosphorylated. Although many kinases have been demonstrated to target SR proteins, members of the SR protein kinase (SRPK) family have been established as the predominant kinase (6Fu X.D. RNA (N.

Members of the SRPK family display strict substrate specificity, preferring to phosphorylate only serine residues flanked by arginines. One of the well studied mammalian SR proteins, ASF/SF2, contains 20 serines within its 50-residuelong RS domain (see Fig. 1a). SRPK1 phosphorylates ∼10–12 of these serines in the N-terminal RS1 region of the RS domain (11Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ma C.T. Zhong X.Y. Zhou H. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This multisite phosphorylation occurs in a processive manner where the kinase remains bound to the substrate until all sites are phosphorylated (12Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RS1 is essential for the nuclear import of ASF/SF2. In yeast, Sky1p regulates the phosphorylation and nuclear import of SR-like proteins Npl3p and Gbp2p (13Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, unlike the mammalian SR proteins, the yeast proteins do not have a classic RS domain with long stretches of arginine/serine repeats (6Fu X.D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). In the case of Npl3p, eight isolated RS dipeptides are present within the RGG domain, and the C-terminal most RS dipeptide is phosphorylated by Sky1p (15Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This modification is essential for the nuclear import of Npl3p, facilitated by an importin, Mtr10p (17Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Defects in phosphorylation cause accumulation of Npl3p in the cytoplasm with enhanced mRNA binding activity (14Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent experiments reveal that the Gbp2p RS-repeat motif, which contains three successive RS-dipeptides, is critical for the nuclear import of Gbp2p (Fig. 1a) (13Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The domain arrangement in SRPKs is unique in that these kinases contain a large insert, bifurcating the kinase core domain (Fig. 1a). Although the insert region, known as the spacer domain, bears little sequence homology among SRPKs across species, its precise location with respect to the core kinase domain suggests that it may play a similar function in most SRPKs. Indeed, in both yeast and human kinases, the spacer domain plays a role in the subcellular localization of these kinases (18Ding J.H. Zhong X.Y. Hagopian J.C. Cruz M.M. Ghosh G. Feramisco J. Adams J.A. Fu X.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both SRPK1 and Sky1p also have non-homologous extensions at their N termini. Sky1p has a 40-residue-long extension at its C terminus, whereas the C terminus of SRPK1 has no such extension (19Nolen B. Yun C.Y. Wong C.F. McCammon J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure and subsequent deletion analysis of Sky1p reveal that its non-conserved C-terminal tail makes contact with the activation loop of the kinase. Deletion of only 10 residues from the C terminus of Sky1p drastically reduces the catalytic activity of Sky1p (19Nolen B. Yun C.Y. Wong C.F. McCammon J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the entire spacer domain and N-terminal 137 amino acids of Sky1p can be removed without compromising its in vitro activity (19Nolen B. Yun C.Y. Wong C.F. McCammon J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In SRPK1, both ends of the previously designated spacer domain fold into helical structures and interact with the kinase core. Deletion analyses of SRPK1 have revealed that, unlike Sky1p, removal of the designated spacer domain in its entirety results in reduced stability of SRPK1 (20Ngo J.C. Gullingsrud J. Giang K. Yeh M.J. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. McCammon J.A. Ghosh G. Structure. 2007; 15: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite the critical differences in the primary and tertiary structures between SRPK1 and Sky1p, they can phosphorylate each other's substrate in vivo and in vitro (21Schenk P.W. Boersma A.W. Brandsma J.A. den Dulk H. Burger H. Stoter G. Brouwer J. Nooter K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6982-6986PubMed Google Scholar, 22Siebel C.W. Feng L. Guthrie C. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5440-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SRPK1 also can functionally substitute for Sky1p in yeast suggesting that the basic mechanism of phosphorylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. Perhaps it is not too surprising as the yeast substrate is phosphorylated only at a single site and that recognition of the phosphorylation site peptide of Npl3p is not different between these kinases. However, it is unclear if the yeast enzyme can phosphorylate the mammalian substrates at multiple sites in a processive manner. If so, this would imply the development of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of phosphorylation among SRPKs. Our results show that, despite significant differences in the mechanism of how Sky1p and SRPK1 maintain their active states, these two kinases display an evolutionarily conserved mode of substrate binding and catalysis. We demonstrate here that catalysis and substrate recognition are conserved among SR protein kinases. However, only the SR protein substrates such as ASF/SF2 undergo processive phosphorylation but not the SR-like protein Gbp2p. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Expression and purification of His-SRPK1ΔNS1, His-Sky1pΔN(137)ΔS, mutants of Sky1p, SRPK1 K109M (trap), and Npl3p have been described previously. The cloning of ASF/SF2 in Escherichia coli expression vector has been described earlier (11Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ma C.T. Zhong X.Y. Zhou H. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) and grown in LB containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced overnight at room temperature at A600 1.0 with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted, and the pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100 detergent), and lysed. The lysed cells were centrifuged, and the pellet contained ASF/SF2. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of denaturing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m MOPS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 8 m urea). The cleared suspension was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 100 ml of denaturing buffer. Protein was eluted with 50 ml of denaturing buffer supplemented with 1 m NaCl. The protein was then bound to Probond Nickel resin (Invitrogen) via batch binding for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was washed extensively followed by refolding of His-ASF/SF2 in the column with stepwise removal of urea. His-ASF/SF2 was then washed with low pH buffer (pH 4.5, 20 mm Tris, 0.1 m MOPS, 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl) and then eluted with a buffer of pH 2.1. The RGG domain Gbp2p encompassing residues 1–123 was prepared by introducing a stop codon at amino acid 124 in a vector expressing full-length Gbp2p as a GST fusion protein. Gbp2p mutants were generated by stepwise single step PCR. Gbp2p was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells after growing to an A0.3 and inducing for 5 h at 37 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were pelleted, suspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged for 40 min at 13,000 rpm, and the supernatant was loaded onto a GST column. The GST column was then washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer and then eluted with lysis buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. The protein was then dialyzed against 3 liters of dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). Mutants of Gbp2p were purified similarly. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Kinase assays were performed in the following conditions: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm cold ATP, and 5–10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C. Reactions were quenched using 2× SDS-PAGE loading dye, and samples were boiled for 1 min at 95 °C before loading onto a 10% SDS gel. Bands of radio-labeled product were cut out and quantified via a Beckman scintillation counter and normalized to background as performed previously (11Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ma C.T.

Extrapolated curves for Km of Npl3p and kobs were calculated using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Trap Kinase Assay—Trap assays consisted of three separate in vitro kinase time-course reactions using equimolar amounts of kinase and substrate as performed previously (11Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ma C.T. Zhong X.Y. Zhou H. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The positive control reaction labeled “no trap” containing no SRPK1 K109M inhibitor (trap) in which the kinase and substrate were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min before initiation with ATP. The negative control reaction labeled “trap-start” contained 50 μm trap incubated with the substrate at 25 °C for 5 min before the addition of active kinase and subsequent initiation with ATP. The last reaction labeled “start + trap” contained incubated kinase and substrate initiated with a mixture of ATP and trap to final concentrations of 200 μm and 50 μm, respectively. The mechanism of phosphorylation was determined by comparison of the phospho-content of the “start + trap” reaction to that of the positive and negative controls, indicating processive and distributive modes, respectively. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—MALDI-TOF analyses were carried as previously described (11Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ma C.T. Zhong X.Y. Zhou H. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Preparation of phosphorylated protein samples were carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 8 μm His-Sky1pΔNS, 8 μm His-ASF at 25 °C. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 3 mm ATP in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were quenched with three volumes of stop buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1mm DTT, 8 m urea). GST Pulldown Assays—Pulldown experiments were carried out in two steps. In the first step crude extract containing GST fusion proteins (Npl3p, Gbp2, or ASF/SF2) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were bound to buffer-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl), centrifuged, and washed (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT). We estimated roughly 10 μg of GST fusion protein to remain bound to beads. In the second step, His-tagged kinase (2–20 μg) was added to the bead bound to GST (control) or GST-Npl3p (or Gbp2 or ASF/SF2) in 150 μl of binding buffer. Samples were then washed four times with 750 μl of wash buffer. 10 μlof4× SDS-PAGE loading dye was added to each sample; then each sample was boiled at 95 °C for 2 min and then loaded onto a 10% SDS gel. Proteins were visualized via Western blot or Coomassie stain. Western Blotting—Protein samples were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were then probed with either anti-His antibodies or anti-GST antibodies (obtained from Qiagen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively). Sky1p Can Phosphorylate Heterologous ASF/SF2 Substrate at Multiple Sites—It has been previously shown that SRPK1 can functionally complement SKY1 in vivo (23Yeakley J.M. Tronchere H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The replacement of SKY1 with SRPK1 implies that the mammalian kinase can phosphorylate Npl3p and other Sky1p substrates at a sufficient level for viability. The peptide-bound structures of Sky1p and SRPK1 shown above (Fig. 1, b and c) suggest a similar mechanism of substrate recognition by these two kinases (24Ngo J.C. Chakrabarti S. Ding J.H. Velazquez-Dones A. Nolen B. Aubol B.E. Adams J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the physiological substrates for these two kinases are different in terms of the number of potential phosphorylation sites. This prompted us to understand how each of these kinases phosphorylates the heterologous substrates. An in vitro kinase assay was implemented to determine the ability of Sky1pΔN(137)ΔS and SRPK1ΔNS1 (hereafter referred to as Sky1p and SRPK1, respectively) to phosphorylate ASF/SF2 and Npl3p, respectively. These experiments show that both Sky1p and SRPK1 efficiently phosphorylate ASF/SF2 (Fig. 2a, middle lanes) and Npl3p (Fig. 2a, right lanes), respectively. These results suggest that the SRPKs may recognize and phosphorylate these two substrates using similar mechanisms. To further test if, like SRPK1, Sky1p also phosphorylates ASF/SF2 at multiple sites, we have measured the phosphate content of Sky1p-phosphorylated His-ASF/SF2. We used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to quantify the number of phosphates added to ASF/SF2 by wt SRPK1 and Sky1p. In these studies, His-tagged ASF/SF2 (8 μm) was incubated with a stoichiometric amount of Sky1p or wt SRPK1 for 5 h in the presence or absence of ATP at room temperature and then analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 2, b–d). In the spectra, we observe that the ASF/SF2 M + 1 and M + 2 peaks shift before and after ATP treatment. Both peak maxima shift to a higher mass/charge (443 for M + 2 and 857 for M + 1) after adding ATP in the case of SRPK1 wt, consistent with the incorporation of ∼10 phosphates per substrate molecule (Fig. 2c). Also a shift in peak maxima was observed (558 for M + 2 and 1064 for M + 1) upon the addition of Sky1p, corresponding to the incorporation of ∼13 phosphates per substrate molecule by Sky1p (Fig. 2d). Longer incubation of the enzymes with ASF/SF2 and ATP resulted in no further changes in phosphoryl content (data not shown), indicating that an end point in the reaction was achieved. These data provide a definitive measure of phosphoryl content that is independent of total active ASF/SF2 concentration. Sky1p Binds ASF/SF2 with High Affinity—We tested the relative binding efficiencies of ASF/SF2 for Sky1p and SRPK1 using a GST co-precipitation assay. Pulldown experiments showed that GST-ASF/SF2 efficiently retained both SRPK1 and Sky1p (Fig. 3, a and b, left panels), whereas GST-Npl3p bound Sky1p only (Fig. 3, a and b, right panels). Although SRPK1 can phosphorylate Npl3p, GST-Npl3p failed to pull down SRPK1 in conditions where it interacted with Sky1p. This suggests that binding affinity of the SRPK1·Npl3p complex is lower than the Sky1p·Npl3p complex. The GST co-precipitation experiment is a qualitative assay and does not provide a quantitative assessment of affinity. It has been shown previously that SRPK1 stably binds ASF/SF2 with a kd of ∼50 nm (12Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We wanted to test if Sky1p could bind to ASF/SF2 with a similar affinity. To estimate a kd, single turnover profiles were measured at different kinase concentrations with a fixed ASF/SF2 concentration (20 nm). Under single turnover conditions at low SRPK1 concentrations, it was shown previously that ASF/SF2 phosphorylation is biphasic, but at high SRPK1 concentrations, phosphorylation profiles are monophasic (12Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the first phase is directly related to the amount of enzyme-bound ASF/SF2 so that a kd can be determined from a plot of fraction bound versus total enzyme concentration. To estimate the affinity of the Sky1p·ASF/SF2 complex, we varied Sky1p concentrations from 500 nm to 50 nm to determine at which concentration the progress curves became noticeably biphasic (Fig. 3c). We observed that above 100 nm Sky1p, the progress curves followed a single exponential, rapidly reaching an end point. However, at 50 nm Sky1p, a biphasic trend in the phosphoryl transfer mechanism was observed. These findings suggest that, at 100 nm Sky1p or higher, most of the ASF/SF2 is bound by the enzyme, implying that the kd for Sky1p and ASF/SF2 is lower than 100 nm. These observations indicate that Sky1p has a similar affinity for ASF/SF2 as SRPK1. Sky1p Processively Phosphorylates ASF/SF2—To further investigate potential differences in the mechanism of ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by Sky1p, we used a trap assay as previously reported (11Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ma C.T. Zhong X.Y. Zhou H. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this assay, the kinase and substrate are preincubated, and the reaction is started with the simultaneous addition of ATP and excess trapping agent designed to bind any free ASF/SF2 (Fig. 4). Here, we used a catalytically inactive form of full-length SRPK1 K109M (trap) that binds well but cannot phosphorylate ASF/SF2 (11Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ma C.T. Zhong X.Y. Zhou H. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). If the reaction is processive, no free ASF/SF2 is generated as the reaction progresses, so the trap cannot inhibit the reaction (Fig. 4a). However, if the reaction is distributive one or more phospho-intermediates of ASF/SF2, released from the active site of Sky1p, will be readily trapped by K109M resulting in reaction inhibition. We used 100 nm ASF/SF2, 100 or 500 nm Sky1p, and 50 μm trap for the reaction (Fig. 4, b and c). We observed that, even at 100 nm Sky1p concentration, the reaction is processive. There is a noticeable difference in phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 in the control trap-start reaction between two different concentrations of Sky1p. In the trap-start reaction, ASF/SF2 is preincubated with the trap before adding active Sky1p. Perhaps the trap is unable to fully inhibit the kinase at 500 nm concentration. However, these observations clearly show that, similar to SRPK1, Sky1p is a processive enzyme. Sky1p and SRPK1 Use a Similar Docking Groove to Bind ASF/SF2—We have previously shown that the SRPK1 docking groove is important for binding and processive phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 (24Ngo J.C. Chakrabarti S. Ding J.H. Velazquez-Dones A. Nolen B. Aubol B.E. Adams J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We have also shown that Sky1p contains a homologous docking groove (25Lukasiewicz R. Nolen B. Adams J.A. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using mutations within the docking groove, we showed that the docking groove in Sky1p plays an important role for Npl3p phosphorylation. Next, we wanted to test if this same docking groove of Sky1p is also important for ASF/SF2 recognition. We tested the binding between Sky1p docking groove mutants (QM and 4M) and GST-ASF/SF2 using GST co-precipitation assays. Each of these mutants contains four amino acid changes to alanine (QM: Ile-653, Lys-657, Trp-659, and Lys-668; and 4M: Asp-601, Asp-617, Glu-624, and Lys-668). Both sets of mutations in the docking groove (QM and 4M) drastically reduced the binding of ASF/SF2 compared with wt Sky1p (Fig. 5a, lower panel). In all, our results suggest that both yeast and human SRPKs use common regions to recognize ASF/SF2, and the kinase docking groove is key to their interaction. Our results also imply that the docking groove-docking motif interaction plays a major role in substrate phosphorylation. Docking Interaction Plays a Role in Processive Phosphorylation of ASF/SF2—We next tested the effect of the Sky1p docking groove mutations (QM and 4M) on processive phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 using the start-trap assay as described earlier (Fig. 5, b and c). We used 100 nm ASF/SF2, 100 nm of the mutant kinases, and 50 μm trap for the reactions. We observed that ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by Sky1p QM is not affected by the addition of trap (Fig. 5b). Our results demonstrate that Sky1p QM processively phosphorylates ASF/SF2, whereas 4M does so only partially (Fig. 5c). These observations are consistent with our previous report that the Sky1p QM mutant did not affect phosphorylation of Npl3p, whereas the Sky1p 4M mutant did (25Lukasiewicz R. Nolen B. Adams J.A. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, these results appear to be inconsistent with GST co-precipitation experiments that showed that both mutants were defective in ASF/SF2 binding. It is difficult to differentiate the affinities of the mutant kinases for ASF/SF2 relative to each other using a co-precipitation assay. Although we see that both Sky1p mutants are unable to bind ASF/SF2 in a pulldown assay, it is possible that the 4M mutant has a significantly lower affinity toward ASF/SF2 than the QM mutant. It is possible that we simply used a protein concentration during the co-precipitation that is below the threshold of the stabilities of both complexes. It appears that the affinity of the ASF/SF2·Sky1p QM complex is sufficient enough for the phosphorylation to occur processively. Sky1p 4M exhibits partial processivity, which suggests that, although affinity is significantly reduced, this mutant still interacts with the substrate to an extent that partial processive activity remains. Processivity could also be affected by the ATP concentration, and the effect of ATP may be more important for relatively weak kinase·substrate complexes. Sky1p Interacts with Gbp2p and Phosphorylates It at Multiple Sites—The ability of Sky1p to carry out processive phosphorylation of heterologous substrates motivated us to look for natural yeast substrates that might be processively phosphorylated at multiple sites. Yeast protein Gbp2p, contains an RGG/RS domain like Npl3p where three serines are present within a continuous stretch of RS dipeptides (RS motif) (Fig. 1a). Gbp2p also contains an RGG domain C-terminal to the RS motif. In our previous studies, we have shown that the docking groove of Sky1p interacts with the RGG domain of Npl3p, and this docking interaction is important for efficient phosphorylation of Npl3p (25Lukasiewicz R. Nolen B. Adams J.A. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also showed that the RGG domain of Npl3p makes electrostatic interactions with an acidic docking groove in Sky1p (25Lukasiewicz R. Nolen B. Adams J.A. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presence of an RS motif located in the N terminus (Arg-12 to Ser-17) with an RGG motif nearby in Gbp2p suggests that Sky1p may also mediate similar docking interactions with the RGG domain to phosphorylate the serines in the RS motif. To test if Sky1p interacts with Gbp2p, we have expressed the RGG/SR domain of Gbp2p (residues 1–123) as a GST fusion protein (GST-Gbp2p1–123) (Fig. 6a). Gbp2p is an extremely unstable protein, and several attempts to purify this fusion protein to homogeneity failed. We tested its binding to wt Sky1p and the docking groove mutants (QM and 4M) using GST co-precipitation experiments (Fig. 6a). Pulldown assays were carried out in duplicates where two different amounts of these kinases (2 μg and 10 μg) were used. We observed Sky1p wt and QM bind similarly to Gbp2p, but the 4M mutant bound poorly. We also observed that SRPK1 could also bind Gbp2p. Together, these results suggest that Sky1p utilizes a similar binding mechanism to interact with Gbp2p and Npl3p. To test if Sky1p phosphorylates these serines or other serines within the RGG/RS domain, we mutated all three serines in the RS repeat region at positions 13, 15, and 17 of GST-Gbp2p-(1–123) to alanine. In vitro phosphorylation of the GST-Gbp2p-(1–123) triple mutant by Sky1p was dramatically reduced compared with Gbp2p-(1–123) wt (Fig. 6b). To test if multisite phosphorylation occurs in Gbp2p, we carried out kinase reactions with three single mutants where each of these serines is mutated to alanine (Fig. 6b). The kinase assay results demonstrated that Sky1p phosphorylates Gbp2p at multiple sites between Ser-13, Ser-15, and Ser-17. We further created a double mutant (S13A,S15A), which also undergoes phosphorylation by Sky1p (data not shown). Our experiment clearly suggests that Sky1p acts on this RS motif. An acidic residue at the P-2 position (Glu-409) in Npl3p was previously shown to be important for Npl3p phosphorylation (19Nolen B. Yun C.Y. Wong C.F. McCammon J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An aspartate at position 11 could serve as a P-2 residue with respect to Ser-13. We mutated this aspartate to alanine, and the mutant revealed no effect on Gbp2p phosphorylation. Finally, we investigated if Sky1p processively phosphorylates these serines using the trap assay (Fig. 6c). We did not observe phosphorylation of Gbp2p (over that of the negative control) at a concentration of 0.3 μm of the Sky1p·Gbp2p complex. In the absence of clear knowledge of apparent dissociation constant of the complex, it is difficult to know the exact mechanism of phosphorylation. The absence of even partial phosphorylation of Gbp2p suggests that multisite phosphorylation of this substrate may not occur in a processive manner. In this study, we have demonstrated that, like SRPK1, Sky1p phosphorylates ASF/SF2 at multiple sites. SRPK1 phosphorylates ASF/SF2 at an average of 10–12 sites, whereas Sky1p phosphorylates 13 sites. These similar amounts of phosphorylation by both kinases suggest that identical serines of ASF/SF2 might also be phosphorylated by these kinases. Previously, we showed that both SRPK1 and Sky1p contain a peptide docking groove near the bottom of the large lobe of the kinase formed by an insert unique to the mitogen-activated protein kinase, helix αG, and the loop connecting helices αF and αG (24Ngo J.C. Chakrabarti S. Ding J.H. Velazquez-Dones A. Nolen B. Aubol B.E. Adams J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of Sky1p and SRPK1 bound to an Npl3p-derived peptide revealed that the kinase docking groove recognizes the peptide in a manner observed for many other peptide·protein complexes where the peptide occupies a groove in the kinase complementing it in both shape and size. Both Sky1p and SRPK1 utilize their docking grooves to interact with their respective substrates, Npl3p and ASF/SF2. We show here that Sky1p binds ASF/SF2 with high affinity and mutations in the Sky1p docking groove affect ASF/SF2 binding. Therefore, results shown here clearly suggest a conserved general mechanism of ASF/SF2 recognition and phosphorylation by both SRPK1 and Sky1p. Like the conserved docking grooves in SRPK1 and Sky1p, the docking motifs of their substrates also share conserved features. The docking motif of ASF/SF2 lies between the second RRM and the RS domain is rich in basic residues. Similarly, the docking motif of Npl3p, imperfectly repeated throughout the entire RGG domain, is also rich in basic residues (25Lukasiewicz R. Nolen B. Adams J.A. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These basic residues are the driving force for an electrostatic interaction with conserved acidic residues in the kinase docking groove, leading to substrate recognition. In the case of Gbp2p, the phosphorylation sites are located in the N-terminal portion RGG/RS domain, whereas an RGG repeat region resembling the docking motif of Npl3p is found C-terminal to the phosphorylation site. Although the physical orientation of the phosphorylation site and the docking motif are reversed in Npl3p and Gbp2p, their recognition by Sky1p is similarly affected by disruption of the acidic docking groove in Sky1p. Similar behavior in GST-coprecipitation experiments suggests that Sky1p recognizes Npl3p and Gbp2p similarly. We have demonstrated that Sky1p possesses the ability to processively phosphorylate a heterologous SR protein substrate. This begs the question if there are native yeast substrates that also undergo processive phosphorylation. The most likely recipient of processive phosphorylation is Gbp2p, which we have demonstrated to be phosphorylated multiple times by Sky1p. However, trap assay experiments suggest a mechanism that is more likely to be distributive rather than processive. We did not determine the affinity of the Sky1p·Gbp2p complex. However, it is important to note that Gbp2p, like ASF/SF2, was able to pulldown both Sky1p and SRPK1 at ∼100 nm concentration. We used 300 nm kinase and substrate, which is 3-fold above the concentration used in the pulldown experiments and well above that of the kd of the Sky1p·ASF/SF2 complex. In this concentration phosphorylation was completely inhibited. This lack of even some phosphorylation compared with the control suggests that phosphorylation of Gbp2p by Sky1p is most likely distributive. We can at least suggest that the mechanism of phosphorylation of SR and SR-like substrates by SRPKs is different. The trap assay results raise an interesting issue of what dictates processive phosphorylation. Results from previous studies and experiments herein suggest a complex mechanism. In addition to the ability of a substrate having multiple phosphorylation sites and being able to bind the kinase with high affinity other criteria might be required. Perhaps the coordinated interaction between the kinase and substrate at the docking and active sites is essential for processive phosphorylation. It is important to note that the second RRM of ASF/SF2 is also involved in the binding interactions with SRPK1 and presumably with Sky1p as well. In contrast, the RRMs of Npl3p are not involved in any binding interaction. Using this analogy, it is possible that additional contacts and modes of these contacts through the RRM domain might be required for processive phosphorylation. Thus, all RGG proteins such as the viral protein ICP27 (26Mears W.E. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sandri-Goldin R.M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1608-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with multiple phosphorylation sites may undergo distributive phosphorylation. Further investigation is required to resolve this issue. Lastly, a clear role for processive phosphorylation in biological regulation has yet to be established. We suggest that processive phosphorylation is advantageous over distributive phosphorylation, because extremely fast phosphorylation achieved through processivity allows the substrates to be involved in their biological functions in a rapid manner in the nucleus. These functions are far more important in higher eukaryotes for their survival. In yeast, the rare occurrence of splicing may not require these SR/RGG-like proteins to function in such a manner. We thank Sutapa Chakrabarti for careful reading of the manuscript. We also thank Chen-Ting Ma for providing valuable insight regarding the trap assays."
https://openalex.org/W2022846228,"Phylogenetic profiling of amino acid substitution patterns in proteins has led many to conclude that most structural information is carried by interior core residues that are solvent inaccessible. This conclusion is based on the observation that buried residues generally tolerate only conserved sequence changes, while surface residues allow more diverse chemical substitutions. This notion is now changing as it has become apparent that both core and surface residues play important roles in protein folding and stability. Unfortunately, the ability to identify specific mutations that will lead to enhanced stability remains a challenging problem. Here we discuss two mutations that emerged from an in vitro selection experiment designed to improve the folding stability of a non-biological ATP binding protein. These mutations alter two solvent accessible residues, and dramatically enhance the expression, solubility, thermal stability, and ligand binding affinity of the protein. The significance of both mutations was investigated individually and together, and the X-ray crystal structures of the parent sequence and double mutant protein were solved to a resolution limit of 2.8 and 1.65 Å, respectively. Comparative structural analysis of the evolved protein to proteins found in nature reveals that our non-biological protein evolved certain structural features shared by many thermophilic proteins. This experimental result suggests that protein fold optimization by in vitro selection offers a viable approach to generating stable variants of many naturally occurring proteins whose structures and functions are otherwise difficult to study."
https://openalex.org/W2091083862,"When yeast cells enter into quiescence in response to nutrient limitation, the adenine deaminase Aah1p is specifically degraded via a process requiring the F-box protein Saf1p and components of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box complex. In this paper, we show that Saf1p interacts with both Aah1p and Skp1p. Interaction with Skp1p, but not with Aah1p, requires the F-box domain of Saf1p. Based on deletion and point mutations, we further demonstrate that the F-box domain of Saf1p is critical for degradation of Aah1p. We also establish that overexpression of Saf1p in proliferating cells is sufficient to trigger the degradation of Aah1p. Using this property and a two-dimensional protein gel approach, we found that Saf1p has a small number of direct targets. Finally, we isolated and characterized several point mutations in Aah1p, which increase its stability during quiescence. The majority of the mutated residues are located in two distinct exposed regions in the Aah1p three-dimensional model structure. Two hybrid experiments strongly suggest that these domains are directly involved in interaction with Saf1p. Importantly, we obtained a mutation in Aah1p that does not affect the protein interaction with Saf1p but abolishes Aah1p degradation. Because this mutated residue is an exposed lysine in the Aah1p three-dimensional model, we propose that it is likely to be a major ubiquitylation site. All together, our data strongly argue for Saf1p being a bona fide Skp1-Cullin-F-box subunit.

All together, our data strongly argue for Saf1p being a bona fide Skp1-Cullin-F-box subunit. Proteolysis is critical for proper regulation of many cellular functions. Degradation of soluble proteins is mainly achieved by the ubiquitin proteasome system (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin proteasome system catalyzes polyubiquitylation of target proteins, resulting in their subsequent degradation by a specific protease complex named proteasome. Polyubiquitylation of the substrate typically requires three distinct enzymatic activities, named E1, 5The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SCF, Skp1-Cullin-F-box; AD, activation domain; DB, DNA-binding domain; ADA, adenosine deaminase. 5The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SCF, Skp1-Cullin-F-box; AD, activation domain; DB, DNA-binding domain; ADA, adenosine deaminase. E2, and E3 (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar, 3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). First, a ubiquitin molecule is bound to the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and then transferred to the E2 conjugating enzyme and is finally attached to the target protein by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Repetition of this enzymatic sequence leads to polyubiquitylation of the target, which is then specifically recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex. In the polyubiquitylation reaction, the E3 enzymes are critical to provide the substrate specificity. Several families of E3 enzymes have been described, and among them the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) complexes have been widely studied (4Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 5Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These complexes contain three core constant subunits (cullin, Skp1, and Rbx1/Roc1) and one variable F-box subunit (for reviews, see Refs. 6Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar and 7Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In each SCF complex, a specific F-box protein interacts with the Skp1 core subunit through a conserved F-box motif and with the substrate via a specific protein-protein interaction domain. The latter is typically a leucine-rich repeat or a WD repeat. In yeast, 21 proteins containing an F-box domain have been identified on the basis of sequence alignments (8Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar); two of them carry a WD40 repeat, and 11 contain an leucine-rich repeat domain. We have recently characterized a new F-box protein named Saf1p (9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which does not contain a leucine-rich repeat or WD40 domain but carries RCC repeats and is therefore different from previously described yeast F-box SCF subunits. Because several yeast F-box proteins have been shown to exert their function independently of the SCF (10Galan J.M. Wiederkehr A. Seol J.H. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Deshaies R.J. Riezman H. Peter M. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the question arises as to whether Saf1p participates in a SCF complex dedicated to the degradation of specific substrates. Several lines of argument support this idea. First, Saf1p is involved in the degradation of adenine deaminase (Aah1p), which occurs upon transition from proliferation to quiescence and which also depends on the E2 Cdc34p and core subunits of the SCF (Skp1p and Hrt1p) (9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Second, Saf1p was copurified with Cdc34p, Skp1p, and Cdc53p in three independent interactome analyses (13Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Yu H. Zhong G. Guo X. Ignatchenko A. Li J. Pu S. Datta N. Tikuisis A.P.

To confirm the involvement of Saf1p in a SCF complex, we have undertaken to characterize Saf1p interaction with its partners both at the structural and functional levels. In this paper, we show that Saf1p interacts with both Aah1p and Skp1p and that this interaction is critical for proper degradation of Aah1p. Using deletion and point mutations, we functionally delineate the domains of Saf1p and propose structural models for these domains. Finally, we identified several point mutations in Aah1p that increase its stability. These data strongly argue for Saf1p being a bona fide SCF subunit. Yeast Strains and Media—The following yeast strains were used in this study: HY (MATa/MATα; ura3 his3 ade2 trp1 leu2 gal4 gal80 URA3-GAL1lacZ LYS2-GAL1HIS3); Y1624 (MATa; saf1::KanR; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0); Y1544 (MATα; saf1::KanR; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; ura3Δ0; lys2Δ0); BY4742 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; ura3Δ0; lys2Δ0); Y2972 (MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; ARG1-GFP-HIS3); Y2970 (MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; URA7-GFP-HIS3); Y1731 (MATa; saf1::KanR; ura3) MJ159 (skp1-11; ade2; trp1; can1; leu2; his3; ura3); W303 (ade2; trp1; can1; leu2; his3; ura3); Y2446 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; trp1::HIS3); Y2447 (MATα; saf1::KanR; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; trp1::HIS3). Yeast cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or in synthetic medium (0.17% nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium, and 2% of either glucose (SD), raffinose or galactose). SDcasa is SD medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) casaminoacids (Difco), and SDcasaWA is SDcasa supplemented with tryptophan (40 mg liter–1) and adenine (40 mg liter–1). Histidine (10 mg liter–1), lysine (10 mg liter–1), uracil (20 mg liter–1), and methionine (20 mg liter–1) were added when necessary. DNA Manipulations—Details of constructs and sequence of primers are available upon request. For two-hybrid experiments, SAF1, SKP1, and AAH1 open reading frames were fused with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) and GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DB) in pACTII (TRP1, 2μ) (16Durfee T. Draper O. Zupan J. Conklin D.S. Zambryski P.C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and pODB80 (LEU2, 2μ) (17Louvet O. Doignon F. Crouzet M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23 (820): 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) plasmids, respectively. Wild type and various alleles of AAH1 were amplified by PCR with primers 1076 and 1082; SAF1 (wild-type and mutant alleles) was amplified with primers 1075 and 1074; SAF1ΔF-box fragment was amplified with primers 1184 and 1075; and SKP1 was amplified with primers 1072 and 1073. These fragments were digested with SmaI and XhoI and cloned in pODB80 at SmaI/XhoI sites and in pACTII at SmaI/SalI sites. Plasmids obtained were named p2745 (Gal4DB-AAH1), p2747 (Gal4DB-SAF1), p2874 (Gal4DB-SAF1ΔF-box), p3220 (Gal4DB-saf1-5), p3222 (Gal4DB-saf1-6), p2780 (Gal4AD-AAH1), p3202 (Gal4AD-aah1-2), p3138 (Gal4AD-aah1-3), p3145 (Gal4AD-aah1-4), p3146 (Gal4AD-aah1-6), p3203 (Gal4AD-aah1-7), and p2741 (Gal4AD-SKP1). The tet-mycSAF1 plasmids were constructed as follows: SAF1 full length (wild-type and mutants) was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides 1137 and 681. Resulting BglII/NsiI fragments were cloned in BamHI/PstI p2717 derived from the tet plasmid pCM189 (see above). The SAF1ΔF-box fragment was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 1229 and 681 and was cloned in p2717 similarly to SAF1 full length. In order to express SAF1 driven by the GAL promoter, full-length SAF1 was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides 680 and 681, digested by BglII/NsiI, and cloned at the BglII/PstI sites of a derivative of pRS305 2μ (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the GAL1 promoter. The resulting GAL-SAF1 plasmid was named p2356. Screen for AAH1 Mutants Deregulated in Stationary Phase— This screen consisted in the selection of Aah1p alleles, allowing a high Aah1-β-galactosidase activity in stationary phase. A PCR mutagenesis was carried out on the AAH1 gene with oligonucleotides 102 and 450. The PCR fragment was then digested with StuI enzyme to eliminate the AAH1 promoter. Meanwhile, the p3093 plasmid carrying the AAH1-lacZ fusion was digested with XbaI and SalI in order to eliminate most of the AAH1 coding region. The PCR fragment and the digested plasmid were co-transformed in a wild type strain, and yeast cells carrying a recombined plasmid were selected in a medium selective for the plasmid (SDcasaWA). Transformants were then replicaplated in duplicate on SDcasaWA solid medium. One plate was conserved, and the other was tested for β-galactosidase activity by “agar overlay” as described previously (9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmids from yeast colonies showing a high β-galactosidase activity were extracted and further characterized. The mutations were finally identified by sequencing AAH1 open reading frame. Selection of Point Mutations in the SAF1 Gene—The BY4742 wild-type strain transformed with a plasmid expressing an AAH1-lacZ fusion (9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was treated with UV (70% survival). Colonies were then grown for 2 days on SDcasaWA medium, and β-galactosidase activity was revealed by agar overlay as described in Ref. 9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. Putative mutants showing a blue color, revealing a high expression of AAH1-lacZ in stationary phase, were subcloned and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Among 15,000 colonies, 20 deregulated mutants were selected and mated to a Δsaf1 strain. Expression of the AAH1-lacZ fusion was measured in the resulting diploids and found to be high in 16 of 20 diploids, indicating that these mutations do not complement the saf1 deletion and are therefore likely to affect the SAF1 gene. Western Blot Analyses—Western blots were done as previously reported (9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Adenine Deaminase Activity—Adenine deaminase assays were done as previously reported (9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Protein Two-dimensional Gel Analysis—Yeast cells expressing either a control vector or the tet-mycSAF1 plasmid were grown to OD 1. Radiolabeled [l-35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals) was added to a final concentration of 0.6 μm (600 μCi/ml); after 4 min, unlabeled methionine was added to 6 mm (final concentration); and then cells were harvested at time points 0, 15, 30, and 45 min. For each time point, the same volume of culture, corresponding to ∼3 × 107 cells, was removed. Protein extraction and two-dimensional gel analysis were performed as described (19Boucherie H. Monribot-Espagne C. Xiao W. Yeast Protocols. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2006: 47-64Google Scholar). Gel images were processed using the ImageMaster 2D Elite version 4.01 software (Amersham Biosciences). Drawings of the proteins were generated with Bobscript (20Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The F-box Protein Saf1p Interacts with both Skp1p and Aah1p—As mentioned above, the Saf1p protein carries in its N-terminal part a potential F-box domain. F-box proteins, when they participate to a SCF complex, serve as a link between Skp1p, a constant subunit of SCF, and the target protein. Clearly, Saf1p interacted with both Skp1p and Aah1p in a two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1). As expected, interaction with Skp1p was specifically abolished when the F-box domain was removed from the construct, whereas the Saf1pΔF-box construct was still able to interact with Aah1p (Fig. 1). Finally, we did not detect any direct interaction between Aah1p and Skp1p (Fig. 1). We conclude that the F-box domain of Saf1p is required for proper interaction with Skp1p but not with Aah1p and that Saf1p serves as a link between Aah1p and Skp1p. The F-box Domain of Saf1p Is Required for Degradation of Aah1p—To establish the functional role of the F-box domain of Saf1p, we expressed wild-type and F-box-deleted forms of SAF1 on a plasmid driven by a heterologous strong promoter. As expected, the Saf1pΔF-box mutant was unable to destabilize Aah1p in early stationary phase (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, overexpression of Saf1pΔF-box in a wild-type strain resulted in slight but reproducible stabilization of Aah1p in early stationary phase (PD lane in Fig. 2B). This result suggests that the Saf1pΔF-box, which cannot interact with the SCF subunit Skp1p but still interacts with Aah1p (Fig. 1), can somehow protect Aah1p from degradation. Such a dominant negative effect of the F-box subunit lacking its F-box domain has been reported previously (21Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and argues for Saf1p being a bona fide F-box subunit. In these experiments, we noticed that overexpression of Saf1p resulted in destabilization of Aah1p in exponential phase (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas deletion of SAF1 had no effect on Aah1p during exponential growth (Fig. 2A) (9Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This effect was confirmed by expressing Saf1p under control of a strong galactose-inducible promoter. Shifting exponentially growing cells from glucose to galactose resulted in a significant decrease of Aah1p levels and adenine deaminase activity (Fig. 2C). Finally, by treating the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, we could establish that overexpression of Saf1p indeed resulted in a shorter half-life for Aah1p, whereas overexpression of the truncated version had no effect (Fig. 2D). From these experiments, we conclude that Saf1p, when overexpressed, can interact with Aah1p during exponential growth and is sufficient to trigger its degradation. Saf1 Mutants Define Two Domains—To further delineate the important functional regions in the Saf1p protein, we searched for point mutations in SAF1 that abolish degradation of Aah1p in the early stationary phase. Among 20 yeast mutants selected for their ability to express an AAH1-lacZ fusion in early stationary phase (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”), functional complementation analysis revealed that 16 mutants were unable to complement the deletion of SAF1 and were therefore likely to be saf1 alleles. Sequencing of the SAF1 gene in these mutants revealed six premature STOP codons, four frameshifts, and six missense mutations. The six missense alleles were named saf1-1 to saf1-6. Stabilization of the fusion protein and the endogenous Aah1p in the original missense mutants is shown in Fig. 3A. From these data, it is clear that all six alleles strongly affect Aah1p degradation. However, when these mutant forms of SAF1 were expressed under control of the tet promoter, only two of them showed wild-type levels of Saf1p, whereas the four others appeared unstable (Fig. 3B). Of note, Saf1p is naturally very poorly expressed, and to be detected it has to be placed under the control of a heterologous promoter. Under these conditions, Saf1p migrates as a double band for unknown reasons. Intriguingly, the four unstable mutants (saf1-1 (G372V), saf1-2 (S387F), saf1-3 (L580S), and saf1-4 (R263K/R264K)) affect residues in the C-terminal part of Saf1p. The instability of these mutant proteins was independent of SCF and proteasome (data not shown). The two other mutants (saf1-5 (L24P) and saf1-6 (L35P)) affected conserved residues in the F-box domain of Saf1p (Fig. 3C) and, as expected, were unable to interact with Skp1p while they were still interacting with Aah1p (Fig. 3D). Using both sequence and secondary structure prediction alignments (Fig. 3C), the yeast N-terminal F-box domain of Saf1p in complex with Skp1p was modeled from the yeast Cdc4p-Skp1p-CPD complex structure (22Orlicky S. Tang X. Willems A. Tyers M. Sicheri F. Cell. 2003; 112: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E). In our structural model, the L24P and L35P mutations affect two interacting conserved residues involved in the hydrophobic interface with Skp1p and are therefore likely to affect the F-box domain structure. Mutations Stabilizing Aah1p Are Clustered in Distinct Domains—To identify the residues required for Saf1p-dependent degradation of Aah1p, we searched for mutations in the AAH1 gene that result in stabilization of Aah1p during postdiauxic growth. For this purpose, we generated a collection of plasmids carrying an AAH1-lacZ fusion in which the AAH1 coding sequence was mutated by error-prone PCR and fused in frame upstream of the lacZ gene in vivo by gap repair (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Five mutants displaying high β-galactosidase activity in early stationary phase and carrying a single amino acid substitution in the Aah1p sequence were obtained (substitutions were as follows: aah1-2, I69T; aah1-3, N72K; aah1-4, D219G; aah1-6, E237V; aah1-7, K329E). Western blot analysis confirmed that the Aah1p-β-galactosidase fusion was indeed stabilized in these mutants (Fig. 4A). Importantly, these aah1 mutants were still able to complement an aah1 deletion, indicating that they still have adenine deaminase activity and are therefore likely to be correctly folded (data not shown). When these mutants were tested for interaction with Saf1p in a two-hybrid assay, one mutant (K329E) was clearly still interacting with Saf1p, whereas the remaining four mutants showed very weak interaction with Saf1p (Fig. 4B). Strikingly, the aah1-7 mutant, while still interacting with Saf1p, was not affected by overexpression of Saf1p (Fig. 4C). On the contrary, aah1-3, aah1-6 (Fig. 4C), and aah1-2, aah1-4 (data not shown), were destabilized by overexpression of Saf1p. To get a better understanding of how these mutations might affect Aah1p, a modeling of Aah1p was done from Mus musculus (23Wang Z. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8314-8324Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and Plasmodium yoelii (24Ting L.M. Shi W. Lewandowicz A. Singh V. Mwakingwe A. Birck M.R. Ringia E.A. Bench G. Madrid D.C. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9547-9554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) adenosine deaminase (ADA) x-ray structures. This was possible due to high conservation in the adenine and adenosine deaminase superfamily (25Ribard C. Rochet M. Labedan B. Daignan-Fornier B. Alzari P. Scazzocchio C. Oestreicher N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The model is a (β/α)8 barrel from which the Lys329 residue is highly solvent accessible and protrudes from a loop at the bottom of the barrel (Fig. 4D). Clearly, the four mutations affecting Aah1p interactions with Saf1p are located on two distinct areas on the surface of the protein. Ile69 and Asn72 are together on the top, whereas the two acid residues Asp219 and Glu237 belong to the side of the barrel (Fig. 4D). We propose that in these four mutants, although interaction with Saf1p is diminished (Fig. 4C), overexpression of Saf1p can somehow compensate for this lower interaction and restore some degradation (Fig. 4B). In the case of the K329E mutant, interaction with Saf1p (Fig. 4C) is not sufficient to trigger degradation even when Saf1p is overexpressed (Fig. 4B). Thus, the mutated lysine residue appears crucial for degradation of Aah1p independently of its interaction with Saf1p. Since lysine are the most frequently ubiquitinated residues, it is tempting to speculate that lysine at position 329 could be a major ubiquitylation site in Aah1p. How Many Targets for Saf1p?—At this point, it is not clear whether Saf1p interacts with a limited number of specific target proteins or participates in a more general quality control process leading to degradation of multiple proteins. To address the issue of Saf1p target specificity, we took advantage of the effect of Saf1p overexpression in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 2B). We assessed the effect of Saf1p overexpression on the yeast proteome by pulse-chase combined with protein two-dimensional gel analysis (see “Experimental Procedures” for experimental details). Quantitative analysis of the gels revealed that among 855 measurable spots, Saf1p did affect 22 spots corresponding to 19 identified proteins (26Perrot M. Sagliocco F. Mini T. Monribot C. Schneider U. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Jeno P. Boucherie H. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 2280-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (example in Fig. 5A). The effect of Saf1p on these 19 proteins was further studied using C-terminal GFP fusion integrated at the cognate locus and expressed from their own promoter (27Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). Only two proteins, Arg1p and Ura7p, were clearly affected by Saf1p overexpression (Fig. 5B). It should be noticed that Aah1p, used as a positive control in these experiments, was much more affected by SAF1 overexpression than Arg1p or Ura7p. Finally, when placed under the control of a heterologous tet promoter, Ura7p was stabilized in the strain deleted for SAF1 and in the skp1-11 mutant, thus suggesting that Ura7p could be a target of Saf1p. On the contrary, Arg1p, when expressed from the tet promoter, was not affected by saf1 deletion. This result suggests that overexpression of SAF1 indirectly affects Arg1p expression. From these results, we conclude that overexpression of Saf1p does not lead to major changes in the yeast proteome but rather specifically affects a small number of target proteins. In this paper, we have characterized a new F-box protein named Saf1p. Among 21 yeast F-box proteins, only a few of them were clearly found to participate to a SCF complex. Our data and other results indicate that Saf1p is a bona fide SCF subunit. Indeed, interactome studies have shown that Saf1p copurifies with SCF core subunits (Skp1p (14Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and Cdc53p (15Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K.

Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). Additionally, Saf1p contains a consensual F-box domain (8Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), which is critical for its function. We have shown that deletion of this domain or point mutations in its conserved residues abolish interaction of Saf1p with Skp1p and result in stabilization of Aah1p. Finally, we observed that the F-box-deleted mutant shows a dominant negative effect on Aah1p degradation. Since Saf1pΔF-box can still interact with its target (Fig. 1), it could be that this interaction might protect it from degradation by the endogenous Saf1p. Such an observation has been reported for several other F-box subunits, such as βTrCP (21Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). All together, our data strongly argue for Saf1p being the F-box subunit of a new yeast SCF complex. An interesting particularity of Saf1p is that it does not contain a leucine-rich repeat or a WD40 domain but instead carries a RCC repeat. RCC repeats were first characterized in RCC1, a Ran-interacting protein (28Nishimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A search for an RCC1-like domain based on the consensus sequence suggests that the C-terminal domain of Saf1p (residues 95–637) probably adopts a seven-blade β-propeller fold similar to the previously described RCC1-like domain structure (Fig. 6). Interestingly, an insert of about 50 residues (residues 240–292) with four predicted strands and a weak similarity with the consensus could suggest the presence of an eighth blade. When placed on the putative structure, the G372V and S387F mutations appear buried and belong to strands A and C, respectively. These mutations could therefore affect the correct fold of the protein. The mutant L580S belongs to a conserved loop connecting C and D strands. Depending on the actual blade number, the double mutant R263K/R264K could be located either in an equivalent loop or in a small peripheral loop. Strikingly, all of the point mutations in the RCC1-like domain of Saf1p resulted in strong instability, although the reason for such an instability remains unclear. Only a few proteins associating with an RCC1-like domain folded as a seven-bladed β-propeller (29Renault L. Nassar N. Vetter I. Becker J. Klebe C. Roth M. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1998; 392: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with an F-box domain have been found, and Saf1p is the first example of such a protein shown to interact with Skp1p and contribute to ubiquitin proteasome system-dependent protein degradation. Although it is likely that Saf1p interacts with Aah1p through the RCC1 like domain, the precise mode of interaction is not known. Interestingly, it has been found that bovine ADA, which shares homology with Aah1p, and human dipeptidyl peptidase IV ectodomain, which adopts an eight-bladed β-propeller fold, bind laterally through interaction between two helices of ADA and loops of two blades in the β-propeller (30Weihofen W.A. Liu J. Reutter W. Saenger W. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43330-43335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To understand how Aah1p and Saf1p interact, we have isolated nondegradable Aah1p mutants. Five such mutants were characterized that affect residues lying on the surface of the predicted structure (Fig. 4D). It should be noticed that none of them affect phosphorylable residues. Four of the five mutants displayed weak interaction with Saf1p. Surprisingly, these four residues fall into two regions, which are about 40 Å apart on the three-dimensional structure (Fig. 4D). It is tempting to speculate that these domains directly contact Saf1p. The fifth mutant behaved very differently. First, it did not abolish interaction with Saf1p. Second, it was not degraded when Saf1p was overexpressed. Finally, it protected endogenous Aah1p from degradation (Fig. 4A). Together, these data argue for the mutated residue to affect Aah1p degradation but not its ability to interact with the SCF. Strikingly, this mutation affects a highly accessible lysine residue, which could thus be a major ubiquitylation site. An important specificity of the SCF-dependent degradation of Aah1p is that it takes place during entry into quiescence. The transition from proliferation to quiescence is associated with multiple physiological changes allowing yeast cells to adapt to starvation. Among those changes, degradation of specific proteins might be critical, and Saf1p could contribute to this adaptation. This important issue is technically difficult to assess on quiescent cells. To address the question of the role of Saf1p on the yeast proteome, we took advantage of Saf1p overexpression during exponential growth. Under these conditions, degradation of Aah1p by Saf1p efficiently takes place, suggesting that this could be the case for other Saf1p targets. Our protein two-dimensional gel analysis revealed that Saf1p overexpression affects a very small number of yeast proteins, and for most of them, such as Arg1p, the effect of Saf1p is likely to be indirect. From this experiment, Saf1p appears to be very specific for Aah1p. Since overexpression of Saf1p is sufficient to trigger degradation of Aah1p in exponential growth, we believe that no quiescence-specific modification of Aah1p is required prior to its Saf1p-dependent degradation. Although in most cases in yeast, SCF substrates are phosphorylated before being degraded, approaches such as two-dimensional gel analysis or mass spectrometry did not reveal any post-translational modification of Aah1p. This led us to think that the signal responsible for the degradation of Aah1p is not a phosphorylation. Our results rather suggest that the Saf1p/Aah1p ratio is critical for regulation of Aah1p stability. All together, our data establish that Saf1p participates in active degradation of Aah1p during postdiauxic growth. Very little is known about protein degradation during entry, maintenance, and exit from quiescence. Considering the major role played by protein degradation during proliferation, it might be expected that proteolysis will also play important roles during quiescence. We thank I. Sagot and B. Pinson for comments on the manuscript and S. Serrano, B. Pinson, and J. Camblong for selection and preliminary characterization of the saf1 mutants. We thank M. F.

https://openalex.org/W2049542496,"Background We applied the Virtual Northern technique to human brain mRNA to systematically measure human mRNA transcript lengths on a genome-wide scale. Methodology/Principal Findings We used separation by gel electrophoresis followed by hybridization to cDNA microarrays to measure 8,774 mRNA transcript lengths representing at least 6,238 genes at high (>90%) confidence. By comparing these transcript lengths to the Refseq and H-Invitational full-length cDNA databases, we found that nearly half of our measurements appeared to represent novel transcript variants. Comparison of length measurements determined by hybridization to different cDNAs derived from the same gene identified clones that potentially correspond to alternative transcript variants. We observed a close linear relationship between ORF and mRNA lengths in human mRNAs, identical in form to the relationship we had previously identified in yeast. Some functional classes of protein are encoded by mRNAs whose untranslated regions (UTRs) tend to be longer or shorter than average; these functional classes were similar in both human and yeast. Conclusions/Significance Human transcript diversity is extensive and largely unannotated. Our length dataset can be used as a new criterion for judging the completeness of cDNAs and annotating mRNA sequences. Similar relationships between the lengths of the UTRs in human and yeast mRNAs and the functions of the proteins they encode suggest that UTR sequences serve an important regulatory role among eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2076959365,"Certain patients suffering from chronic diseases such as AIDS or cancer experience a constant cellular secretion of tumor necrosis factor α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that results in a continuous release of nitric oxide (·NO) to the bloodstream. One immediate consequence of the deleterious action of ·NO is weight loss and the progressive destruction of muscular mass in a process known as cachexia. We have previously reported that caveolin-3, a specific marker of muscle cells, becomes down-regulated by the action of ·NO on muscular myotubes. We describe herein that the changes observed in caveolin-3 levels are due to the alteration of the DNA binding activity of the muscular transcription factor myogenin. In the presence of ·NO, the binding of transcription factors from cell nuclear extracts of muscular tissues to the E boxes present in the caveolin-3 promoter become substantially reduced. When we purified recombinant myogenin and treated it with ·NO donors, we could detect its S-nitrosylation by three independent methods, suggesting that very likely one of the cysteine residues of the molecule is being modified. Given the role of myogenin as a regulatory protein that determines the level of multiple muscle genes expressed during late myogenesis, our results might represent a novel mode of regulation of muscle development under conditions of nitric oxide-mediated toxicity.

The four members of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix protein family that orchestrate muscle differentiation are MyoD (Myf3), myogenin (Myf4), Myf5, and Myf6 (Mrf4/herculin). These regulatory factors contain one or two transactivation domains (at N and C termini), a conserved basic DNA-binding domain, and a helix-loop-helix motif required for heterodimerization (1Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 2Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). These transcription factors regulate cell lineage-specific transcription and proliferation and are able to activate the myogenic program in nonmuscle cells when ectopically expressed (3Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). In addition, the basic helix-loop-helix domain of these myogenic transcription factors can heteroassociate with other helix-loop-helix-containing proteins, such as E12, E47, HEB, Id, and twist. The heterodimers bind to E box elements (CANNTG motifs) and have been categorized into several “classes” based on tissue distribution, dimerization capabilities, and DNA binding specificities. Expression of these regulatory factors leads to the transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes, such as muscle creatin kinase, troponin I, α7 integrin, desmin, α-actin, and caveolin-3 (3Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar).Wasting of skeletal muscle (cachexia) is associated with a variety of chronic or inflammatory disorders, such as AIDS and cancer (5Tisdale M.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 862-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The detrimental effects of cachexia occur as a consequence of excessive wasting of skeletal muscle tissue resulting in the reduction of many markers of differentiated skeletal muscle cells, as well as the transcription factors responsible for the expression of muscular proteins (6Tisdale M.J. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6 (–D174): D164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Di Marco S. Mazroui R. Dallaire P. Chittur S. Tenenbaum S.A. Radzioch D. Marette A. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Cell.

The implication of the NOS2-derived ·NO in TNFα-induced muscle wasting was demonstrated by the use of a specific NOS inhibitor, nitro-l-arginine, which was shown to prevent the onset of cachexia in nude mice injected with Chinese hamster ovary cells that secreted TNFα (9Buck M. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of myogenin on Thr87 within the DNA-binding domain, such as that induced by basic fibroblast growth factor, has an inhibitory effect on the binding to and the transcription from the E box (10Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), it was conceivable that the effect exerted by ·NO might be due to the activation of a cellular kinase that might use myogenin as a substrate. Nevertheless, this in vivo effect of ·NO on the destruction of muscle tissues under high levels of circulating TNFα is not mediated by the direct phosphorylation of the myogenin molecule. This conclusion was reached after observing that phosphatase treatment of muscular nuclear extracts from TNFα mice did not reconstitute the DNA binding activity of myogenin toward the E box of the muscle creatin kinase (9Buck M. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Consequently, another ·NO-mediated modification of the myogenin polypeptide chain might be responsible for the observed decrease in muscle mass and total weight of the mice injected with TNFα-secreting Chinese hamster ovary cells.Among the various post-translational modifications induced by ·NO and related reactive nitrogen species, S-nitrosylation (the formation of a thionitrite, -S-N=O, in cysteine residues, also called S-nitrosation) is emerging as an important effector in cell signaling, involved in several physiological and pathophysiological contexts and could be considered as a potential new paradigm in signal transduction (11Stamler J.S.

Several transcription factors, including NF-κB or AP-1, have been reported to be regulated by S-nitrosylation, either by a direct alteration of their DNA binding properties or by other indirect modes of regulation (14So H.S.

Commun. 2005; 336: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).We have previously reported that induction of NOS2 in C2C12 myotubes with a mixture of LPS and IFN-γ resulted in the selective down-regulation not only of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 but also of the specific muscle cell marker, caveolin-3 (19Navarro-Lerida I. Portoles M.T. Barrientos A.A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Whereas the reduction in the levels of caveolin-1 and -2 was due to the direct activation by the cytokines of a route involving p42/p44 Erk, the down-regulation of caveolin-3 was apparently due to the effect of nitric oxide itself (19Navarro-Lerida I. Portoles M.T. Barrientos A.A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Among the three caveolin isoforms, caveolin-3 is muscle-specific and is found in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. We describe herein that nitric oxide, a molecule present in excess in several diseases that course with inflammation, is able to modify selectively the transcription factor myogenin. This observation rationalizes the observed destruction of muscle tissue and the disappearance of muscle-associated proteins when high levels of ·NO are present.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium), glutamine, antibiotics, transfection reagent Escort-IV, Hoechst, and rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma. Trypsin-EDTA and fetal bovine serum were from BioWhittaker Europe. The source of the various antibodies used in this work is as follows: anti-cav-3 monoclonal IgG1 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (610420); anti-β-tubulin I monoclonal clone SAP4G5 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (T-7816); myogenin Ab-1 (clone F5D) was purchased from Neomarkers (MS-1113). ECL reagents and streptavidin-peroxidase and Cy2- and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. DETA-NONOate was from Alexis Biochemicals (catalog number 146724-94-9). DEA-NONOate was from Cayman Chemicals (catalog number 82100). S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was from Calbiochem.Cell Culture and Materials—C2C12 mouse myoblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Margarita Lorenzo (Universidad Complutense de Madrid). The myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Differentiation of ∼70% confluent myoblasts into myotubes was performed in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with antibiotics and glutamine plus 50 nm insulin in the absence of serum for 3 days (20Conejo R. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Myotubes (muscular cells) are characterized by the formation of elongated, multinucleated tubules that express cav-3. The differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes has been previously reported (19Navarro-Lerida I. Portoles M.T. Barrientos A.A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). H9c2 rat myocytes were a generous gift from Dr. Lisardo Boscá (Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Bellvitge Barcelona), whereas mouse L929 fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Portolés (Universidad Complatense de Madrid).Recombinant Expression of Myogenin and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Cys Residues—The recombinant expression and purification of mouse myogenin was performed using a pET9 plasmid (generous gift of Dr. Maleki, Arkansas University). We followed the published protocol that included purification using a heparin-agarose resin followed by the elution with increasing concentrations of NaCl (21Maleki S.J. Hurlburt B.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22Maleki S.J. Royer C.A. Hurlburt B.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10888-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method using the wild-type myogenin pET9 as template. The complete sequence of myogenin as well as the desired mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing.Immunoblot Analysis and Cellular Fractionation—Cellular proteins were resolved by either 7% or 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were incubated for 2 h in PBS containing 2% powdered skim milk. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies (typically 1:1000 in PBS), washed, and finally incubated for 2 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce). Detection was performed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of the intensity of the bands was performed using the UVIband V97 software (UVItec St. John’s Innovation Centre).Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on 0.2% gelatin-coated glass coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The stock paraformaldehyde solution was prepared at 4% in PBS and was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature in a table-top microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material prior to dilution. After removal of the 2% paraformaldehyde solution, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with cold methanol at –20 °C for 10 additional min. The methanol was removed, and the coverslips were allowed to dry for 5 min. Then the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the desired primary antibodies at 37 °C. In general, an overnight incubation with the primary antibodies at a 1:200 dilution in a wet chamber followed by a 2-h incubation with the secondary antibody was performed. Finally, the slides were mounted using Fluoroguard anti-fade reagent (Bio-Rad). The subcellular localization was observed under a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope, using the excitation wavelength of 405 nm for the Hoechst fluorescence (nuclei staining), 488 nm for the Cy2 fluorescence, and 543 nm for the Cy3 fluorophore. A 60× oil immersion objective was used. Analysis of the pictures was performed with confocal assistant software (Free software by Todd Clark, version 4.02) as well as with Laserpix and Lasersharp software from Bio-Rad. Overlap of green and red labeling is depicted in yellow; overlap of green and blue labeling is depicted in light blue; overlap of red and blue is depicted in violet.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—H9c2 myocytes and L929 fibroblasts were plated at a 70% density 1 day prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with 5 μgof reporter plasmid using Escort IV as instructed by the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich). A detailed description of six pGL3-basic plasmids (Promega) containing various fragments of the caveolin-3 promoter (L1 to L6) has been reported elsewhere (23Biederer C.H. Ries S.J. Moser M. Florio M. Israel M.A. McCormick F. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26245-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, H9c2 cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 50 μl of lysis buffer following the instructions of the luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Afterward, 100 μl of luceferine solution was added, and the luminiscence of the total 150 μl was determined using the Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Addition of the nitric oxide-releasing compound DETA-NONOate was performed when the transfection reagent was removed and maintained for 48 h. 24-Well plates were used in all cases, and every point was performed in triplicate. In the case of the L1 to L5 constructs, a similar amount of total photon count was obtained, and for every case we considered the 100% luciferase signal that was obtained from the untreated samples. The decrease in luciferase expression for each plasmid in the presence of nitric oxide was correlated with that of the untreated sample. When the H9c2 cells were required to be in the presence of ·NO, the donor DETA-NONOate was added during the indicated times.Isolation of Cell Nuclear Extracts—The nuclear extracts from H9c2 myocytes, C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, and COS7 cells were isolated by means of a detergent method (24D'Acquisto F. Iuvone T. Rombola L. Sautebin L. Di Rosa M. Carnuccio R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) with the purpose of assaying the binding to the proximal E box of the caveolin-3 promoter. The cells were maintained in culture until confluent and were then washed with PBS and harvested through scraping in an Eppendorf tube. They were subsequently centrifuged at 2000 rpm in a refrigerated table-top microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in one volume of prechilled NAR A buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) in the presence of 1 mm DTT plus the protease inhibitors 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The mixture was kept in ice for 10 min. Afterward, 10% (v/v) of 1% Nonidet P-40 was added and allowed to sit for 3 min at room temperature. Then the samples were mixed in a vortex for at least 10 s until the appearance of a white pellet. The tubes were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated table-top microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was kept at –20 °C (cytoplasmic extracts). One volume of NAR C buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) was then added to the nuclei, and the mixture was vortexed at 4 °C for 30–60 min. The nuclei extracts were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (nuclear extracts) were then kept at –80 °C. To quantify the total amount of protein present in the nuclear extracts, a colorimetric Bradford microassay was carried out.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides that included the proximal E box-responsive element of the caveolin-3 promoter (23Biederer C.H. Ries S.J. Moser M. Florio M. Israel M.A. McCormick F. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26245-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were used: myogenin forward, 5′-GTGGGACAGCTGTCAGCCGC-3′, and myogenin reverse, 5′-GCGGCTGACAGCTGTCCCAC-3′ (the hexabase motif corresponding to the E box is in bold type). The forward oligonucleotide was labeled with biotin at the 3′ end. Both oligonucleotides were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio, heated up to 70 °C, and allowed to cool slowly at room temperature. In the experiments in which a mutated E box was tested, we used the oligomers: 5′-GTGGGAGCGCGCTCAGCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGCTGAGCGCGCTCCCAC-3′. The H9c2 nuclear extracts, both treated and nontreated with DEA-NONOate as well as the nuclear extracts obtained from DETA-NONOate-treated H9c2 cells were incubated with the dimeric probe for 30 min at 37 °C. Then a nondenaturing electrophoresis was performed in a 4% acrylamide gel which was subsequently transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After the transference, the membrane was incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase overnight at 4 °C and developed by ECL.Tissue Immunostaining—Mouse hearts were extracted in 30% sucrose in PBS and frozen in liquid N2, and serial 7-μm-thick sections were cut with a Leitz sledge microtome onto gelatinized glass coverslips. The preparations were fixed in a 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS, pH 7.4, for 45 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with cold methanol for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, the sections were incubated overnight with the indicated antibodies in PBS at 4 °C. The sections were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (labeled with Cy2 or Cy3) and treated with Hoechst 33258 for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was visualized on a MRC 1024 microscope (Bio-Rad) with Lasershap software.Analysis of Myogenin S-Nitrosylation—The biotin switch assay (25Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) was performed as previously described (26Martiínez-Ruiz A. Lamas S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Martiínez-Ruiz A. Lamas S. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) on recombinant purified wild-type and Cys mutants of myogenin first incubated with 1 mm GSNO or 1 mm DEA/NO for 15 min at room temperature, precipitated with acetone, and resuspended in HEN buffer. Wild-type myogenin S-nitrosylation was also determined by chemical reduction and chemiluminescence as previously described (28Fang K. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. MacDonald T. Gaston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Martiínez-Ruiz A. Villanueva L. Gonzalez de Orduna C. Lopez-Ferrer D. Higueras M.A. Tarin C. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Vazquez J. Lamas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). After treatment with 100 μm GSNO for 15 min, the protein was separated from GSNO by passing the sample through a Sephadex G-25 column. Eluted fractions were injected into an 8-ml anaerobic solution containing 100 μm CuCl, 1 mm cysteine, pH 6, at 50 °C, and purged continuously with nitrogen and analyzed in a Sievers 280 nitric oxide analyzer.Characterization of S-Nitrosylation by Mass Spectrometry—Recombinant myogenin (10 μg) was incubated with 1 mm GSNO for 15 min at room temperature in the darkness. S-Nitrosylated protein was digested by adding 0.5 μg of modified porcine trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega). In-solution digestion proceeds at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting tryptic peptides were injected onto a C-18 reversed phase nano-column (Discovery® BIO Wide pore; Supelco, Bellafonte, PA) and eluted at a flow rate of ∼300 nl/min with a continuous acetonitrile gradient to an electrospray ion source coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (Esquire HCT Ultra, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) for real time ionization and fragmentation. The multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to analyze the masses of interest.RESULTSCorrelation between Myogenin Expression and Detection of Caveolin-3 in Muscle Cells—Two different systems of muscular cells in culture have been used in this work: mouse C2C12 myoblasts and rat heart-derived H9c2 myocytes. When grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum, C2C12 myoblasts were unable to express muscle cells protein markers, such as myogenin or caveolin-3, unlike H9c2 myocytes, where both proteins were present (Fig. 1A). Myogenesis of C2C12 myoblasts was induced in a differentiation medium that contained either 50 nm insulin or 2% horse serum. Under these conditions, C2C12 myoblasts exited the cell cycle and fused forming multinucleated myotubes, and caveolin-3, troponin-C, and myogenin expression was observed (Fig. 1A). These differentiation conditions did not significantly alter either the caveolin-3 or myogenin levels of H9c2 muscular cells or their shape (data not shown). Caveolin-3 immunostaining was mostly restricted to the sarcolemma (plasma membrane) of both differentiated C2C12 cells and H9c2 myocytes (Fig. 1A).It is well established that muscular cells derived from heart tissues are extremely refractory to respond to a pro-inflammatory stimulus (LPS or cytokine mixtures) and fail to express inducible NOS (30Cuenca J. Martiín-Sanz P. Alvarez-Barrientos A. Bosca L. Goren N. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1567-1576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hence C2C12 myoblasts were converted into myotubes and then challenged with a mixture of LPS and IFN-γ. With this treatment, expression of NOS2 was apparent after 24 h and even more at 48 h (Fig. 1B, right panel). When NOS2 expression was induced in the presence of the inhibitor 1400W, the amount of nitrites that were measured in the extracellular medium diminished considerably (Fig. 1B). With that in mind, we determined the expression levels of both caveolin-3 and the transcription factor myogenin when NOS2 expression was induced in C2C12 myotubes in the presence of cytokines (Fig. 1B, left panel). Caveolin-3 is a well characterized marker of the conversion of myoblasts into myocytes (myogenesis), and its expression is known to be selectively regulated by the transcription factor myogenin (23Biederer C.H. Ries S.J. Moser M. Florio M. Israel M.A. McCormick F. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26245-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nitric oxide itself is responsible for the decrease in caveolin-3 levels in C2C12 myotubes, whereas the myogenin levels remain almost unchanged. Next, we established co-cultures of Raw 264.7 macrophages together with H9c2 myocytes in Transwell chambers. When the macrophages were challenged with a mixture of cytokines, large amounts of ·NO were released into the medium (data not shown). Analysis of the caveolin-3 protein levels 48 h post-induction of NOS2 expression revealed that only ∼5% of the initial caveolin-3 levels remained in the myocytes, whereas the myogenin levels were unchanged (Fig. 1C).We then inspected the distribution of caveolin-3 and of the constitutive endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS3) in ventricular sections of mouse hearts. Caveolin-3 immunofluorescence stained the sarcolemma of the myofibrils as well as the I-bands of the sarcomere repeats (Fig. 1D). We were unable to detect a strong NOS3 staining inside cardiac muscular cells but rather only in the endothelial cells of the veins and arteries that irrigate the tissue (Fig. 1D, left panel, red staining). When mice were injected with LPS to induce an inflammatory situation and we performed immunostaining of heart sections, we could observe the presence of infiltrated macrophages within the cardiac tissue (Fig. 1D, right panel, arrow). Consequently, either the ·NO released by the NOS3 present in the vessels that irrigate the heart or the ·NO released by the NOS2 present in infiltrated macrophages might be initiating the destructive effects of this gaseous radical on muscle tissues.Nitric Oxide Is Able to Down-regulate the Caveolin-3 Levels in Muscle Cells—We have previously shown that when NOS2 is induced in C2C12 muscular myotubes, a concomitant decrease in the protein levels of caveolin-1 and -2 can be observed together with a retarded decrease in caveolin-3 protein levels that responds to the released ·NO (19Navarro-Lerida I. Portoles M.T. Barrientos A.A. Gavilanes F. Bosca L. Rodriguez-Crespo I. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). With that in mind, we first tested whether nitric oxide could also induce the down-regulation of caveolin-3 levels in H9c2 cells. The addition of increasing concentrations of the ·NO-releasing drug DETA-NONOate to a culture of H9c2 myocytes resulted in the decrease of caveolin-3 levels when determined 48 h post-treatment (Fig. 2A). We chose this ·NO-liberating compound because it releases nitric oxide at slow rates, displaying a half-life of ∼20 h at 37 °C (31Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we maintained a 100 μm constant concentration of DETA-NONOate and determined the changes in caveolin-3 protein levels over a 3-day period. As shown in Fig. 2A, the caveolin-3 protein levels decreased after 24 h of treatment reaching 30–40% of the initial levels that rema"
https://openalex.org/W2085498907,"Programmed cell death signaling is a critical feature of development, cellular turnover, oncogenesis, and neurodegeneration, among other processes. Such signaling may be transduced via specific receptors, either following ligand binding-to death receptors-or following the withdrawal of trophic ligands-from dependence receptors. Although dependence receptors display functional similarities, no common structural domains have been identified. Therefore, we employed the Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation and the Motif Alignment and Search Tool software programs to identify a novel transmembrane motif, dubbed dependence-associated receptor transmembrane (DART) motif, that is common to all described dependence receptors. Of 3,465 human transmembrane proteins, 25 (0.7%) display the DART motif. The predicted secondary structure features an alpha helical structure, with an unusually high percentage of valine residues. At least four of the proteins undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis. To date, we have not identified a function for this putative domain. We speculate that the DART motif may be involved in protein processing, interaction with other proteins or lipids, or homomultimerization."
