In this study, we examine ceramide as a candidate intracellular mediator of serum factor dependence. In Molt-4 leukemia cells, serum withdrawal caused a significant arrest in cell cycle progression (80% of cells in G0/G1), accompanied by a modest apoptotic cell death (12%). Serum deprivation of these cells resulted in significant sphingomyelin hydrolysis (72%; corresponding to hydrolysis of 47 pmol/nmol phosphate), which was accompanied by a profound and progressive elevation (up to 10-15-fold) in endogenous levels of ceramide. Withdrawal of serum caused the activation of a distinct, particulate, and magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase. The addition of exogenous C6-ceramide induced a dramatic arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle comparable to the effects observed with serum withdrawal, albeit occurring much sooner. Unlike serum withdrawal, however, the addition of C6-ceramide resulted in more pronounced apoptosis. Because of the previously noted ability of exogenously added phorbol esters to inhibit ceramide-mediated apoptosis, we investigated the hypothesis that endogenous activation of the diacylglycerol/protein kinase C pathway may modulate the response to serum withdrawal. Indeed, serum withdrawal resulted in 3-4-fold elevation in endogenous diacylglycerol levels. The addition of exogenous diacylglycerols resulted in selective attenuation of ceramide's effects on apoptosis but not on cell cycle arrest. Thus, the combination of ceramide and diacylglycerol recapitulated the complex effects of serum withdrawal on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These studies identify a novel role for ceramide in cell cycle regulation, and they may provide the first evidence for an intracellular signal transduction pathway in mammalian cells mediating cell cycle arrest. These studies also underscore the importance of lipid second messengers and the significance of the interplay between glycerolipid-derived and sphingolipid-derived lipid mediators.

Serum deprivation is a powerful mechanism by which cells can be arrested in the cell cycle and induced to undergo programmed cell death (1Howard M.K. Burke L.C. Mailhos C. Pizzey A. Gilbert C.S.

As such, the serum deprivation model has been used extensively to study both of these events. However, a mechanistic basis for this growth arrest and apoptosis has yet to be found. With the discovery of the sphingomyelin cycle, sphingolipid-derived molecules have gained prominence as critical antimitogenic molecules of cells(4Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Ceramide, a product of regulated sphingomyelin hydrolysis, has been shown to be released within minutes to hours following stimulation of cells with agents such as 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(6Okazaki T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist-induced mobilization of ceramide has been found to precede the antimitogenic effects of the agonists, and exogenous addition of short chain membrane-permeable ceramides has been shown to reproduce the antiproliferative and differentiative effects of these agonists(7Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bielawska A. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the case of tumor necrosis factor α, ceramide has been implicated as a mediator of programmed cell death(13Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the antiproliferative effects of ceramide may be a consequence of apoptosis; however, an effect of ceramide on cell cycle progression has not been examined. Prompted by these findings and considerations, we investigated a role for ceramide in mediating the growth suppressive effects of serum deprivation. In this study, we show that ceramide levels respond progressively to serum withdrawal through activation of a magnesium-dependent, membrane-associated, neutral sphingomyelinase. Ceramide is found to induce a significant block in cell cycle progression accompanied by apoptosis. Interestingly, diacylglycerol (DAG) 1The abbreviations used are: DAGdiacylglycerolPCDprogrammed cell deathdiC8dioctanoylglycerolFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorting., which also increases with serum withdrawal, counters the effects of ceramide on apoptosis but not on cell cycle, suggesting a protective role for DAG. More importantly, the combination of ceramide and DAG recapitulates the effects of serum withdrawal on cell cycle arrest. The implications of these studies on the role of ceramide in cell cycle arrest are discussed. diacylglycerol programmed cell death dioctanoylglycerol fetal calf serum phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Molt-4 human leukemia cells and Wi38 human fibroblasts were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). RPMI 1640 and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. TLC plates were purchased from Fisher. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Molt-4 cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For general maintenance, Molt-4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and Wi38 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For treatment, Molt-4 cells in log phase growth were washed once with PBS and seeded at 5 × 105/ml in 2% FCS-supplemented RPMI 1640 or serum-free RPMI 1640. For treatment, Wi38 cells were seeded and allowed to grow for 3 days. Cells were then re-fed with normal growth media and treated. Time-matched controls were always run concurrently. Following the indicated times of treatment, 2 × 106 cells were harvested and prepared as described(14Walker P.R. Kwast-Welfeld J. Gourdeau H. Leblanc J. Neugebauer W. Sikorska M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS fixed in 4 ml of absolute ethanol and stored at −20°C. On the day of analysis, the fixation buffer was removed and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. To remove RNA prior to staining, cells were treated with 100 μl of 200 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were stained by treating with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml propidium iodide for 5-10 min and analyzed using a FACStar flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Flow cytometric analyses were performed using an argon laser at 488 nm. Apoptotic cells were evident as cells containing less than 2 N DNA. (2S,3R)-N-Hexanoylsphingosine (D-erythro-C6-ceramide) was synthesized by acylation of (2S,3R)-sphingosine with either hexanoyl chloride (15Herold P. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1988; 71: 354-362Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar) or N-succinimidylhexanoate(16Bielawska A. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18493-18497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (2S,3R)-Sphingosine was obtained via stereoselective synthesis using L-serine. Ceramide was purified via flash chromatography (EM-Science silica gel; 40-63 μ) using a methylene chloride-methanol system with increasing polarity from 100:0 to 96:4. The product from this was crystallized from methanol-water (1:1) to obtain pure product (yield 68%) as assessed by TLC and NMR analyses. TLC was done on Merck precoated Silica Gel 60 F-254 plates and methylene chloride-methanol (93:7) was used as solvent to develop plates. Detection was by: 1) UV, 2) iodine vapor, and 3) 5% potassium permanganate in 1 N potassium hydroxide. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a G.E. 500-MH2 Omega spectrometer. Chemical shifts () were indicated as parts/million relative to a TMS internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard 5988 GO/MS/DS system. The samples were analyzed using chemical ionization mass spectrometry. MS is m/z, 398 (M); 1H NMR (CD3OD) is as follows: 0.84 (6H, dt, CH3-C(17), CH3-C(6′)), 1.25 (26H, sbr, CH2), 1.38-1.42 (2H, m, CH2), 1.52-1.62 (2H, m, CH2), 2.00-2.08 (2H, m, CH2-C(6)), 2.14-2.22 (2H, t, CH2-C(2′)), 3.67 (2H, d, H2C(1)), 3.83-3.87 (1H, m, HC(2)), 4.04 (1H, t, HC(3)), 5.42-5.50 (1H, m, HC(4), 5.62-5.72 (1H, m, HC(5)), 7.66-7.72 (1H, m, NH). DL-Erythrodihydro-C6-ceramide was prepared via a similar procedure using DL-erythrodihydrosphingosine (Sigma D7033). Cells grown in serum-free media for the indicated times were harvested, and the lipids were extracted via the Bligh and Dyer method(17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41390) Google Scholar). Lipids, dried under nitrogen, were resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform, 25 μl was set aside for phosphate measurements(18Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 25 μl was used in the diacylglycerol kinase assay(19Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated lipids were extracted and run on TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1) as solvent. The ceramide-phosphate and phosphatidic acid spots were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Both ceramide and diacylglycerol were quantitated using external standards and were normalized to phosphate. Molt-4 cells serum-starved for the indicated times were harvested and the lipids extracted via the Bligh and Dyer method(17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41390) Google Scholar). Lipids dried under nitrogen were resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform, 10-μl duplicates were set aside for phosphate measurements(18Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 45 μl were run on TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:8:5) as the solvent. The sphingomyelin spots were visualized via iodine staining, scraped, and measured for phosphate. Sphingomyelin was quantitated using an external standard and was normalized to total phosphate. Sphingomyelin mass is represented as pmol/nmol phosphate. Molt-4 cells, serum-starved for the indicated times, were washed with PBS and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride) to attain a final concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were lysed via nitrogen cavitation (20 min at 350 p.s.i., 4°C), and post-nuclear supernatant was spun at 200,000 ×g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was designated the cytosol fraction and the pellet, resuspended in the original volume of lysis buffer, was designated the membrane fraction. Sphingomyelinase activity was assayed in all fractions using 14C-labeled sphingomyelin as described(21Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molt-4 T leukemia cells were found to require serum factors for growth in tissue culture; thus, withdrawal of serum factors led to both an arrest of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and programmed cell death (PCD) (Fig. 1). Cell cycle arrest was observed as early as 12 h following serum withdrawal. By 26 h, cell cycle arrest was pronounced, with almost 80% of cells in the G0/G1 stage as opposed to 61% in control cultures. By 48 h of serum starvation, very few cells could be found in either the S (2%) or the G2/M (2%) phases, and nearly all cells had arrested in G0/G1. Some cells also underwent PCD, which was observed by 26 h. By 48 h following serum deprivation, a significant proportion (12%) of cells appeared in a pre-G0/G1, apoptotic peak (Fig. 1, A and C). Therefore the growth arrest observed with serum deprivation involves predominantly cell cycle arrest with a small component of apoptosis. Since little insight is available concerning the mechanisms for the antimitogenic effects of serum factor withdrawal, we initially wondered whether ceramide, which has been implicated as an intracellular mediator of tumor necrosis factor α-induced apoptosis(13Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar), may play a role. Therefore, the response of endogenous ceramide to serum withdrawal was investigated. Serum starvation of Molt-4 cells led to a remarkable increase in endogenous ceramide (Fig. 2A). A 3-fold increase in ceramide levels could be observed as early as 24 h following the removal of serum. This initial elevation was comparable to agonist-induced ceramide elevations described in other cell systems. However, unlike other agonist-stimulated systems where ceramide levels returned to basal values(6Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prolonged serum starvation produced further elevations in ceramide. Thus, by 48 h an 8-fold increase in ceramide could be observed, and by 96 h ceramide had increased further to 15-fold above basal. Since ceramide levels were normalized for total phospholipid levels, these results reflected specific increases in ceramide levels. These increases in ceramide coincided with both the cell cycle arrest and PCD elicited by serum deprivation. Since the kinetics and magnitude of the ceramide response were sufficiently distinct and more pronounced than those previously observed with tumor necrosis factor α and other extracellular cytokines, it became important to determine the source of ceramide as well as the mechanisms involved in generating ceramide. The elevation in ceramide levels was paralleled by a concomitant decrease (from 64 to 17 pmol/nmol phosphate) in the mass of sphingomyelin (Fig. 2B). This loss in sphingomyelin (47 pmol/nmol phosphate at 72 h) accounts for most of the generated ceramide at the same time point (38 pmol/nmol phosphate). However, investigation of the mechanism of hydrolysis of sphingomyelin revealed that serum withdrawal did not induce any substantial activity in the cytosolic/magnesium-independent, neutral sphingomyelinase (Fig. 2C), which has been implicated previously in the mechanism of action of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(22Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, withdrawal of serum factors resulted in substantial activation of a particulate, magnesium-dependent, neutral sphingomyelinase with an increase from 10,000 to 24,000 cpm/mg protein (Fig. 2C). Thus, serum withdrawal appears to stimulate a signaling cascade distinct from agonist stimulation of the sphingomyelin cycle(6Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, the outcome of both pathways is the induction of sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation, although the magnitude and persistence of the ceramide response upon serum withdrawal reaches levels and durations not seen with agonist stimulation. We next investigated what role ceramide may play in mediating the effects of serum deprivation. A short chain synthetic ceramide, C6-ceramide, was employed to treat Molt-4 cells in the presence of serum. Addition of C6-ceramide not only caused PCD (Fig. 3), it also induced significant cell cycle arrest. Ceramide-induced cell cycle arrest occurred rapidly (within 4 h) and doses as low as 15 μM C6-ceramide (approximately 4 nmol/106 cells; comparable to doses achieved upon serum deprivation) were able to reproduce effects reminiscent of prolonged serum deprivation: almost complete G0/G1 arrest following 14 h of treatment. Higher doses (20-40 μM) were more rapidly effective (within 4 h) and lower doses (10 μM) exhibited decreased efficacy, illustrating that ceramide's effects on both PCD and cell cycle exhibited time and dose dependence (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore the effects of ceramide on cell cycle arrest was found to be a more generalized phenomenon, not restricted to the transformed Molt-4 cell line. In a number of non-transformed cells, including the human Wi38 human diploid fibroblast line, 15 μM C6-ceramide was able to produce substantial cell cycle arrest in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3D). Next, it became important to establish the specificity of ceramide action. Thus, Molt-4 cells were treated with the closely related lipid molecule, dihydroceramide, a biosynthetic precursor for ceramide. Dihydroceramide differs structurally from ceramide in only one respect; it lacks the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the sphingoid backbone. In Molt-4 cells, dihydro-C6-ceramide treatment, at concentrations and times comparable to those that were effective with C6-ceramide, proved to be ineffective at producing either cell cycle arrest or PCD (Fig. 3, E and F), although both molecules show similar kinetics of uptake and minimal metabolism(23Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the differences in biologic activity are not a result of differential delivery, but probably reflect specific interaction of ceramide with an intracellular target that does not interact with dihydroceramide. A possible candidate is ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, which is specifically activated in vitro by C6-ceramide and not by dihydro-C6-ceramide(24Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the specificity of action of ceramide was also supported by the lack of effect of diacylglycerol (a structurally related molecule) on cell cycle progression (see below). Thus, ceramide appears to regulate specifically the biological effects of serum deprivation. However, one critical difference between the biology elicited by ceramide and that elicited upon serum starvation related to the more pronounced effects of ceramide at stimulating PCD (compare Fig. 1C and Fig. 3C). This observation raised the possibility that other factors may operate in modulating cell viability following serum deprivation. In U937, HL60, L929/LM, and WEHI 164/13 cells, phorbol esters (activators of protein kinase C) have been noted to oppose the effects of ceramide on PCD(13Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, 25Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Forani F.A. Taylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether diacylglycerols (endogenous activators of protein kinase C) may play a role in the response to serum deprivation. During serum deprivation of Molt-4 cells, DAG levels were found to become elevated (Fig. 4A). By 24 h following serum starvation, DAG levels increased 1.5-fold (whereas ceramide levels had tripled). By 96 h, DAG levels increased by a total of 4-fold (Fig. 4A), demonstrating a progressive build-up of DAG levels, albeit to a level significantly less than that seen with ceramide (4-fold versus 15-fold at 96 h; compare Fig. 2A and Fig. 4A). We therefore investigated if the simultaneous increase in both ceramide and DAG could explain the decreased effect of serum deprivation on PCD. To test this hypothesis, a cell-permeable diacylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), was employed, both alone and in combination with ceramide for impact on cell cycle and PCD. Alone, diC8, at concentrations of 10 to 100 μM, was ineffective at causing either cell cycle arrest or PCD during 5-30 h (data not shown). However, in combination with C6-ceramide diC8 reversed the apoptotic effects of ceramide by more than 50% (Fig. 4B). In a quantitative analysis, diC8 and phorbol esters also inhibited ceramide-induced DNA fragmentation and loss of viability. 2In U937 cells, 30 μM diC8 and 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were both able to reverse DNA fragmentation induced by 10 μM C2-ceramide treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In U937 viability assays, C6-ceramide decreased viability by 50%; 10 μM diC8 restored viability to 70% of control, and 30 μM diC8 completely reversed C6-ceramide's effects on viability (L. Karolak, P. Jeancake, L. M. Obeid, and Y. A. Hannun, unpublished observations). In contrast, diC8 exhibited minimal effects in reversing ceramide-induced cell cycle arrest (at best, a 10-15% reversal was observed). These data suggest that the increase in endogenous DAG may account for the decreased PCD observed with serum deprivation compared to that found upon ceramide stimulation. Importantly, ceramide and diacylglycerol, together, faithfully recapitulated the effects of serum withdrawal on growth and viability. These studies identify a novel role for ceramide in regulating cell cycle progression whereby ceramide induces a significant G0/G1 arrest. This observation carries several implications. First, ceramide may emerge as an endogenous mediator of cell cycle arrest. As opposed to the myriad of candidate intracellular messengers and mediators of cell cycle progression, little is known on the operation of intracellular mediators of cell cycle arrest. Thus, these studies identify an important candidate for this role. This function for ceramide is likely in the context of serum withdrawal where endogenous ceramide levels accumulate to very high levels, and where exogenous ceramide induces very early effects on cell cycle progression. Further examination of this hypothesis awaits the development of specific inhibitors of ceramide generation and/or action. Second, these studies raise the tantalizing possibility that ceramide modulates the endogenous machinery regulating cell cycle progression. Indeed, in ongoing studies, support for such a role is provided by the ability of ceramide to induce dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product 3G. Dbaibo, M. Pushkareva, S. Jayadev, J. K. Schwartz, J. M. Horowitz, L. M. Obeid, and Y. A. Hannun, manuscript in preparation. with specificity, potency, and kinetics that match the ability of ceramide to induce cell cycle arrest. Third, the ability of diacylglycerol to oppose ceramide's effects on PCD preferentially over cell cycle arrest distinguishes these two outcomes of ceramide action as products of distinctly-regulated mechanisms. This raises the possibility that ceramide may function as a proximal sensor and transducer of cell deprivation/insult/injury with the ability to launch distinct programs of cell suppression (growth arrest and apoptosis), the outcome of which may be dependent on whether other modulatory signals (such as diacylglycerol) are also activated. Finally, this latter finding suggests that sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid signaling may be coupled or interrelated, with the opposing effects of ceramide and DAG of greater relevance in defining the outcome on growth and viability. A perturbation of this ratio, whether by changes in ceramide, DAG, or both, could therefore lead to changes in cell growth and viability. Previous studies have identified ceramide and DAG as rapidly mobilized second messenger molecules in the sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol cycles, respectively(6Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A.

With DAG, evidence is accumulating on more sustained DAG signals generated from either the phospholipase D pathway (30Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) or through de novo biosynthesis(31Ishizuka T. Hoffman J. Cooper D.R. Watson J.E. Pushkin D.B. Farese R.V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The current study shows that the role of ceramide (and DAG) in cell cycle arrest and PCD not only exhibits slower kinetics, it occurs over a prolonged period resulting in very high levels of accumulation. Moreover, the mechanism involved in this long term generation of ceramide (magnesium-dependent, particulate sphingomyelinase) is distinct from that operating in cytokine activated sphingomyelin cycle (magnesium-independent, cytosolic sphingomyelinase) and may represent the counterpart of phospholipase D in long term DAG signaling. This description of ceramide and DAG as long term effector molecules suggests a different perspective on lipid mediators. According to this hypothesis, sustained changes in ceramide and DAG levels (probably by distinct mechanisms, as shown here for ceramide) may induce long term, and perhaps permanent, reprogramming of cell function through the regulation of apoptotic and cell cycle machinery.

https://openalex.org/W1525701947,"Both the anabolic hormone insulin and contractile activity stimulate the uptake of glucose into mammalian skeletal muscle. In this study, we examined the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), a putative mediator of insulin actions, in the stimulation of hexose uptake in response to hormone and contraction. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate accumulate in skeletal muscle exposed to insulin but not hypoxia, which mimics stimulation of the contractile-dependent pathway of hexose transport activation. The fungal metabolite wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, completely blocks the appearance of 3′-phospholipids in response to insulin. Moreover, wortmannin entirely prevented the increase in hexose uptake in muscle exposed to insulin but was without effect on muscle stimulated by repetitive contraction or hypoxia. These results support the view that PI 3-kinase is involved in the signaling pathways mediating insulin-responsive glucose transport in skeletal muscle but is not required for stimulation by hypoxia or contraction. Furthermore, these data indicate that there exist at least two signaling pathways leading to activation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle with differential sensitivities to wortmannin.

https://openalex.org/W2087061260,"To elucidate the mechanism of the basal hyperinsulinemia of obesity, we perfused pancreata from obese Zucker and lean Wistar rats with substimulatory concentrations of glucose. Insulin secretion at 4.2 and 5.6 mM glucose was ∼10 times that of controls, whereas β-cell volume fraction was increased only 4-fold and DNA per islet 3.5-fold. We therefore compared glucose usage at 1.4, 2.8, and 5.6 mM. Usage was 8-11.4 times greater in Zucker islets at 1.4 and 2.8 mM and 4 times greater at 5.6 mM; glucose oxidation at 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose was >12 times lean controls. To determine if the high free fatty acid (FFA) levels of obesity induce these abnormalities, normal Wistar islets were cultured with 0, 1, or 2 mM long chain FFA for 7 days. Compared to islets cultured without FFA insulin secretion by FFA-cultured islets (2 mM) perifused with 1.4, 3, or 5.6 mM glucose was increased more than 2-fold, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was increased 3-fold, and glucose usage at 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose was increased approximately 2-fold (1 mM FFA) and 3-fold (2 mM FFA). We conclude that hypersecretion of insulin by islets of obese Zucker fatty rats is associated with, and probably caused by, enhanced low Km glucose metabolism and β-cell hyperplasia, abnormalities that can be induced in normal islets by increased FFA.

We conclude that hypersecretion of insulin by islets of obese Zucker fatty rats is associated with, and probably caused by, enhanced low Km glucose metabolism and β-cell hyperplasia, abnormalities that can be induced in normal islets by increased FFA. Hyperinsulinemia has long been recognized as a feature of obesity-related insulin resistance in man (1Yalow R.S. Berson S.A. Diabetes. 1960; 9: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Karam J.H. Grodsky G.M. Fosham P.H. Diabetes. 1963; 12: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and in rodents(3Bray G.A. York D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 719-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of this association is obscure. In perfused pancreata from one colony of obese hyperinsulinemic Zucker (fa/fa) rats we have reported a 30-fold increase in insulin secretion at 5.6 mM glucose compared with lean littermates (fa/+) (4Johnson J.H. Ogawa A. Chen L. Orci L. Newgard C.B. Alam T. Unger R.H. Science. 1990; 250: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a difference that could not be accounted for by an increase in β-cells(5Orci L. Ravazzola M. Baetens D. Inman L. Amherdt M. Peterson R.G. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9953-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Rather the β-cells of fa/fa rats appeared to be more sensitive than those of lean rats to glucose concentrations in the normal fasting blood glucose range(6Chan C.B. MacPhail R.M. Mitton K. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1993; 71: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The fact that insulin secretion by isolated pancreata of obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats perfused with 5.6 mM glucose exceeded that of pancreata of lean littermates (fa/+) or Wistar rats perfused with 20 mM glucose (4Johnson J.H. Ogawa A. Chen L. Orci L. Newgard C.B. Alam T. Unger R.H. Science. 1990; 250: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) suggested that basal hypersecretion of insulin at normoglycemic concentrations in obese rats may be due, at least in part, to an increase in the high affinity pathway of glucose metabolism in β-cells. In this study we show in obese Zucker rats a leftward shift of the glucose-insulin concentration-response curve of β-cells in the fasting and subfasting range of glucose concentration that can be attributed to an increased rate of glucose metabolism at low concentrations of the sugar and to hyperplasia of β-cells. We provide evidence that the hyperinsulinemia at low glucose concentrations, the hyperplasia, and the increase in low Km glucose metabolism can all be induced in normal islets by high concentrations of long chain fatty acids (FFA) ( 1The abbreviations used are: FFAfree fatty acidBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridine.) that occur in obesity. free fatty acid bromodeoxyuridine. Male Wistar rats and obese Zucker female rats of 8-16 weeks of age, purchased from Charles River Laboratories, were used in the study. This colony differs from the University of Indiana Zucker diabetic fatty colony previously studied by our group(4Johnson J.H. Ogawa A. Chen L. Orci L. Newgard C.B. Alam T. Unger R.H. Science. 1990; 250: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 5Orci L. Ravazzola M. Baetens D. Inman L. Amherdt M. Peterson R.G. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9953-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Rat pancreata were perfused by the method of Grodsky and Fanska(7Grodsky G.M. Fanska R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 39: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), as modified by this laboratory(8Hisatomi A. Maruyama H. Orci L. Vasko M. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In some experiments propranolol and phentolamine (10 μM) were added to block the effects of norepinephrine released from peri-insular sympathetic nerve endings during glucopenia(8Hisatomi A. Maruyama H. Orci L. Vasko M. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bouins-fixed paraffin-embedded serial sections of perfused pancreata (5-μm thickness) were stained for insulin by indirect immunofluorescence (5Orci L. Ravazzola M. Baetens D. Inman L. Amherdt M. Peterson R.G. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9953-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to determine the β-cell volume fraction. The ratio of the area of insulin-positive cells to the total pancreatic area was determined using the method of Weibel(9Weibel E.R. Weibel E.R. Stereologic Methods. Vol. 1. Academic Press, London1979: 101-161Google Scholar). Islets were isolated by a modification (10Johnson J.H. Crider B.P. McCorkle K. Alford M. Unger R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) of the method of Naber et al.(11Naber S.P. McDonald J.M. Jarett L. McDaniel M.L. Ludvigsen C.W. Lacy P.E. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Glucose usage was measured in freshly isolated islets using a modification of the method of Zawalich and Matchinsky(12Zawalich W.S. Matchinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Zawalich W.S. Pagliara A.S. Matchinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fifty-microliter aliquots of islets were pipetted into individual wells of a 24-well cell culture plate. Glucose was added to Hanks' balanced salt solution (prepared according to the recipe of Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) to give final glucose concentrations of 1.4, 2.8, or 5.6 mM in a volume of 250 μl. After gentle shaking for 5 min at 37°C, 5-[3H]glucose (DuPont NEN) was added to give a final specific activity of 2.5-3.5 dpm/pmol. Samples were then incubated at 37°C with continued shaking for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 N perchloric acid or 10% trichloroacetic acid (Fisher). The background (blank) counts were determined by incubating a well without islets for each glucose concentration tested. After cooling to room temperature, 200 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, placed in a scintillation vial containing 0.5 ml of unlabeled water, and incubated at 50°C for 18 h. To determine the equilibration coefficient (EQC), 5 μl of tritiated water was added to 195 μl of unlabeled water in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and the foregoing procedure repeated in parallel with the experimental samples. Ten milliliters of Ecolume (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) scintillation fluid was added to the vials, and the samples were counted in duplicate in a Beckman scintillation counter. Duplicates were averaged and glucose usage was derived from the following formula. dpm-blank(Specific activity)×(EQC)×(min)(Eq. 1) The per min usage was calculated and expressed as picomoles of glucose/h/islet. Glucose oxidation rates were determined by measuring the generation of 14CO2 from [U-14C]glucose by the method of Bernstein and Wood(14Bernstein I.A. Wood H.G. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 572-575Google Scholar). Approximately 50 islets from Zucker obese female or Wistar rats were pipetted into vials containing either 2.8 or 5.6 mM glucose in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (pH = 7.4), in a final volume of 1 ml. They were incubated at 37°C for 5 min, followed by the addition of [U-14C]glucose to a specific activity of 0.8 cpm/pmol. The samples were then incubated for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Each vial had a small well suspended from the rubber cap which contained 300 μl of benzethonium hydroxide (Sigma). After stopping the reaction with acid, the vials were left at room temperature for 3 h. Thereafter, the wells were removed and incorporation of 14CO2 was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Oxidation at each glucose concentration was measured in duplicate, and blank rates of 14CO2 evolution were measured by performing the same procedures on vials which contained no islets. The data was expressed as picomoles of glucose oxidized/h/islet. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared by the method of Rasschaert and Malaisse(15Rasschaert J. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Approximately 4500 Wistar islets and ∼1000 Zucker islets were suspended in 200 μl of cold homogenization buffer consisting of 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM Hepes, and 0.5 mM EDTA at pH 7.4 and then homogenized with a hand-held motor-driven (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) Teflon pestle using 20 strokes at full speed followed by centrifugation at 750 × g, 4°C for 5 min. The islet supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of homogenization buffer, homogenized as before, and centrifuged again at 750 × g, 4°C for 5 min. The two islet supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 12,000 × g, 4°C for 10 min. The supernatants from the higher speed centrifugation were saved as the cytosolic fraction, and the mitochondrial fraction (pellet) was resuspended in 200 μl of homogenization buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) kit. Citrate synthase, measured by the method of Srere(17Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), served as a mitochondrial marker enzyme. Glucose phosphorylation activity was measured in islet cytosolic and mitochondrial suspensions utilizing the radioisotopic method of Kuwajima et al.(18Kuwajima M. Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8849-8853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 100 μCi of [U14C]glucose (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) resuspended in 1 ml of 2X assay buffer (200 mM Tris pH = 7.4, 10 mM ATP, 20 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 mM glucose). The final reaction mixture consisted of 25 μl of 2 × assay buffer, 20 μl of islet cytosol or mitochondria (approximately 50-150 μg of protein), and 5 μl of either 100 mM glucose 6-phosphate or H2O. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 97% ethanol, 3% methanol. A 30-μl aliquot was then removed and spotted onto NA 45 DEAE-cellulose discs (Schleicher and Schuell) and dried. The discs were washed three times in a large volume of distilled water followed by a final overnight wash with gentle agitation. The next day the discs were dried on Whatman No. 3MMchr paper. The residual radioactivity on the discs was detected by liquid scintillation counting after addition of 10 ml of Ecolume mixture (ICN). The activity measured in the presence of 10 mM glucose 6-phosphate was considered to be glucokinase. Hexokinase activity was considered to represent the glucose 6-phosphate-inhibitable activity, obtained by subtracting noninhibitable phosphorylation from total phosphorylation. Activities were expressed as picomoles of glucose/min/μg of protein. Isolated islets were maintained in suspension culture in 60 mm glass Petri dishes at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% air for 7 days. The culture medium consisted of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml of penicillin, 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Miles, Kankakee, IL) either with or without a 2 mM mixture of oleate:palmitate (2:1) (Sigma). The glucose concentration in the medium was 8 mM. The medium was changed every 2 days. BrdUrd incorporation was quantitated in Bouins-fixed islets immobilized in gelatin and embedded in paraffin. Five-μm-thick sections were processed and serial sections stained by the previously described technic for insulin (5Orci L. Ravazzola M. Baetens D. Inman L. Amherdt M. Peterson R.G. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9953-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and for BrdUrd. The latter was quantitated using an anti-bromodeoxyuridine(BrdUrd) antibody (19Schutte B. Reynders M.M.J. Bosman F.T. Blijham G.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1343-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Boehringer Mannheim). Pooled islets from 20 Wistar rats were cultured in 8 different dishes for 7 days in medium containing either 0 or 2 mM FFA. BrdUrd was maintained at a 15 μM concentration throughout the 7 days. DNA was measured by the method of Hopcroft et al.(20Hopcroft D.W. Mason D.R. Scott R.S. Horm. Metabol. Res. 1985; 17: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that base-line insulin secretion by pancreata of obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF-drt) female rats perfused with 5.6 mM glucose averages approximately 30 times that of Wistar rats(4Johnson J.H. Ogawa A. Chen L. Orci L. Newgard C.B. Alam T. Unger R.H. Science. 1990; 250: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the present study of isolated pancreata from a different colony of obese Zucker rats (Charles River), perfusion with 1.4 mM glucose resulted in insulin levels more than twice those of pancreata of lean control rats perfused with 5.6 mM glucose (Table 1 A); progressive increases in glucose to 2.8, 4.2, and 5.6 mM elicited significant increases in insulin secretion (p < 0.05). By contrast, in age-matched lean Wistar rats insulin was virtually undetectable until glucose concentrations reached 4.2 mM and above (Table 1 A).Tabled 1 Glucopenia elicits a local release of catecholamines from adrenergic nerve endings in the pancreatic islets (8Hisatomi A. Maruyama H. Orci L. Vasko M. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and catecholamines inhibit insulin secretion(21Porte D. Girardier L. Seydoux J. Kanazawa Y. Poseternak J. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that the foregoing differences in the response of β-cells from lean and obese rats might have been caused by differences in the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings in the islets. Since the inhibitory effect of glucopenia on insulin secretion in perfused pancreata from normal rats can be largely abolished by adrenergic blockade(8Hisatomi A. Maruyama H. Orci L. Vasko M. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the experiments were repeated with 10 μM phentolamine and propranolol added to the perfusate. The combined α- and β-adrenergic blockade increased insulin secretion in both groups, but the significant differences between the insulin responses of lean and obese rats remained (Table 1 B). To determine if the hypersecretion of insulin in the obese rats was associated with an increased β-cell mass, we compared the volume fraction of insulin-positive cells in pancreatic sections from the two groups. The mean volume fraction of β-cells in six obese rats was 1.55 ± 0.2, compared with 0.39 ± 0.06 in six lean Wistar controls, a 4-fold difference. Islet DNA averaged 113.3 ± 25 ng/islet in the Zucker rats compared with 32 ± 7 ng/islet in controls, a 3.5-fold difference. These results were highly suggestive of β-cell hyperplasia in obese rats. In view of the well known relationship between glucose metabolism and insulin secretion(22Matchinsky F.M. Trus M. Burch P. Berner D. Ghosh A. Zawalich W. Weill V. Waldhausl W.K. Diabetes 1979. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1980: 154-159Google Scholar, 23Ashcroft S.J.H. Cooperstein S.J. Watkins D. The Islets of Langerhans. Academic Press, NY1981: 117-148Crossref Google Scholar, 24Meglasson M.D. Matchinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), the failure of glucopenia to suppress insulin secretion by pancreata of obese rats (Table 1) might reflect a higher rate of glucose metabolism at glucopenic levels of glucose. Therefore we measured glucose usage, at concentrations of 1.4, 2.8, and 5.6 mM glucose in islets of obese Zucker rats and in lean Wistar controls (Table 2). Obese Zucker female rats exhibited, respectively, 8-, 11.4-, and 3.9-fold increases in glucose usage/islet/h compared with age-matched Wistars. At 5.6 mM glucose, the normal fasting level, the increased glucose usage in islets of obese rats was exactly proportional to the increase in cells; however, at lower glucose concentrations glucose usage was >8 times that of controls, more than could be explained by the β-cell hyperplasia (Table 2).Tabled 1 [U-14C]Glucose oxidation was >12 times higher in islets of obese rats than in those of controls at both 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose concentrations (Table 2), i.e. more than three times greater after correction for differences in islet size. Overexpression of hexokinase I in rat islets results in enhanced glucose metabolism and insulin secretion at basal glucose concentrations, i.e. a β-cell phenotype similar to that of obesity(25Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the increase in glucose usage at low glucose concentrations in islets of obese rats reflected an increase in the activity of low Km enzymes of glucose metabolism such as hexokinase I, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared from pooled islets of both groups of rats. Total hexokinase activity was approximately three times greater in islets of obese rats, and mitochondrial hexokinase activity was twice as high (Table 3).Tabled 1 Plasma FFA levels have long been known to be high in obesity(26Gorden E.S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1960; 8: 740-747Crossref Google Scholar), and FFAs are known to stimulate insulin secretion acutely(27Madison L.L. Seyffert W.A. Unger R.H. Baker B. Metabolism. 1968; 17: 301-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Crespin S.R. Greenough W.B. Steinberg D. J. Clin.

More recently Zhou and Grill (32Zhou Y. Grill V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) have reported that insulin secretion at 3 mM glucose is increased after removal of islets from FFA-containing culture medium. To confirm this effect of FFA on β-cell function, we cultured islets of Wistar rats for 7 days in the presence or absence of a 2 mM concentration of a 2:1 mixture of oleate:palmitate and then perifused them at 1.4, 3, and 5.6 mM glucose (Table 4). At all 3 mM glucose concentrations, insulin secretion by the FFA-cultured islets was more than twice that of control islets cultured without FFA.Tabled 1 To determine if the islet hyperplasia observed in obese rats could also be attributed to the increased plasma FFA levels of obesity, we compared BrdUrd incorporations in islets of normal Wistar rats measured after 7 days of culture in either 0 or 2 mM FFA. BrdUrd incorporations were 3.2-fold greater in the FFA-cultured islets than in control islets averaging 10.7 ± 1.2 versus 3.3 ± 0.4 positive cells per islet in the controls (n = 4; p < 0.001). The incorporations appeared to be predominantly within β-cells (Fig. 1). To determine if FFA can induce in normal rat islets an increase in low Km glucose metabolism similar to that observed in the islets of obese Zucker rats (Table 2), we measured glucose usage at concentrations of 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose in Wistar rat islets cultured for 7 days in either 0, 1, or 2 mM FFA. Glucose usage at both 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose was between 2- and 3-fold greater (p < 0.01) in islets cultured in 1 or in 2 mM FFA (Table 5).Tabled 1 This study was designed to characterize the β-cells in obesity and to identify the mechanism by which an increase in adipose tissue results in an increase in basal insulin secretion. We observed a striking shift to the left in the glucose dose-response curve for insulin secretion in obese Zucker rats. The shift was not abolished by α- and β-adrenergic blockade, thus excluding the possibility that intergroup differences in norepinephrine released from peri-insular sympathetic nerve endings were responsible. In fact, at the glucopenic concentrations at which norepinephrine release should be greatest, adrenergic blockade magnified the difference between groups. Insulin secretion in obese rats was as great at 1.4 mM glucose (57 microunits/ml/min) as that in lean rats at 5.6 mM glucose (55.4 microunits/ml/min). Although the 4-fold increase in β-cell volume fraction in obese Zucker rats suggests that β-cell hyperplasia may account for the 4-fold hypersecretion of insulin at 5.6 mM glucose in the normal fasting range, the >10-fold increase in insulin secretion at glucopenic glucose concentrations below 3 mM pointed to intrinsic differences in low Km glucose metabolism. At 1.4, 2.8, and 5.6 mM concentrations glucose usage in obese islets ranged from ∼4 to 11 times that of control islets from lean rats (Table 2). Glucose oxidation in islets of obese rats was approximately 12 times greater than in lean controls at both 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose. Becker et al.(25Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that an 8-10-fold overexpression of recombinant hexokinase I in normal islets via recombinant adenovirus doubles both glucose usage and insulin secretion at 3 mM glucose. Overexpression of yeast hexokinase in islets of transgenic animals has similar effects(33Voss-McCowan M.E. Xu B. Epstein P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15814-15818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the similarity between the β-cell phenotypes caused by hexokinase overexpression and that of obesity, we quantitated the hexokinase activity in the islets of obese rats. There was a 3-fold increase in total enzyme activity in islets of Zucker rats compared with lean controls. Mitochondrial hexokinase activity, which is less inhibitable by glucose-6-PO4 than the cytosolic fraction(15Rasschaert J. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was almost twice as high in islets of obese rats as in lean controls. The mechanism by which an increase in adipose tissue increases insulin secretion in obese individuals with normal glucose tolerance is unknown. There are reasons to suspect that the elevated plasma FFA levels of obesity (26Gorden E.S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1960; 8: 740-747Crossref Google Scholar) may play a role; certainly the glucose-fatty acid cycle of Randle (34Randle P.J. Hales C.N. Garland P.B. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; 1: 785-789Abstract PubMed Scopus (3702) Google Scholar) is widely accepted as the cause of insulin resistance(35McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), as are the antilipolytic effect of insulin (36Nilsson N.Ö Stralfor S. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 1225-1230Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the insulinotropic action of FFA(27Madison L.L. Seyffert W.A. Unger R.H. Baker B.

Invest. 1994; 93: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the idea of an FFA-mediated adipocyte-β-cell feedback relationship has not been entertained as the cause of obesity-related changes in β-cells. The present study demonstrates that three of the most dramatic abnormalities in the β-cells of obese rats can be induced by culturing normal islets in FFA for 7 days. First, insulin secretion at 1.4, 3.0, and 5.6 mM glucose is doubled after 7 days in medium containing 2 mM FFA (Table 4), confirming by perifusion the work of Zhou and Grill (32Zhou Y. Grill V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) using a static incubation technic. Second, the 3-fold increase in BrdUrd incorporations in β-cells provides evidence that increased levels of FFA are capable of enhancing β-cell replication and thus causing or contributing to the ∼4-fold increase in the β-cell volume fraction of obese rats. Finally, the 3-fold concentration-dependent enhancement by FFA of glucose usage at a 2.8 and 5.6 mM glucose noted in islets cultured in 1 and 2 mM FFA for 1 week (Table 5) provides strong evidence that the FFA elevations observed in obesity(26Gorden E.S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1960; 8: 740-747Crossref Google Scholar, 37Campbell P.J. Carlson M.G. Nurjhan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E600-E605PubMed Google Scholar) are capable of inducing an increase in low Km glucose usage. Since insulin secretion is coupled to glucose metabolism (22Matchinsky F.M. Trus M. Burch P. Berner D. Ghosh A. Zawalich W. Weill V. Waldhausl W.K. Diabetes 1979. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1980: 154-159Google Scholar, 23Ashcroft S.J.H. Cooperstein S.J. Watkins D. The Islets of Langerhans. Academic Press, NY1981: 117-148Crossref Google Scholar, 24Meglasson M.D. Matchinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), the FFA-induced increase in low Km glucose metabolism could well be the cause of the hyperinsulinemia at substimulatory glucose concentrations. Finally, the inability of hyperinsulinemia of obesity to reduce FFA levels to normal implies a resistance of adipocytes to the antilipolytic action of insulin, as was reported in man(37Campbell P.J. Carlson M.G. Nurjhan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E600-E605PubMed Google Scholar). The potential implications of this relationship between adipocytes and β-cells are of clinical interest. If the twin abnormalities of obesity, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, are both secondary to increased plasma levels of FFA, they will both vary in parallel with changes in FFA levels. So long as insulin secretion is coupled to insulin resistance, euglycemia will be maintained, and this may account for the fact that most obese individuals remain normoglycemic. But if FFA levels continue to rise and exceed a critical level, β-cells may be unable to continue the insulin response required to match a progressively increasing FFA-mediated insulin resistance; at this point non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) will ensue. We have recently reported that when plasma FFA levels approach 2 mM in Zucker prediabetic fatty rats, the β-cell response to hyperglycemia disappears and NIDDM begins(38Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Also, obese Zucker rats are much more vulnerable than lean rats to other diabetogenic factors such as dexamethasone(39Ogawa A. Johnson J.H. Ohneda M. McAllister C. Inman L. Alam T. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phenotype described here represents a prediabetic state.

https://openalex.org/W1999756074,"The role of the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RSK/MAPK) signaling pathway in regulating glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity was investigated. In vitro studies showed that GSK-3 was inactivated by 50% upon incubation with RSK purified from epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated NIH/3T3 cells. Subsequently, the effect of EGF on GSK-3 activity was measured in NIH/3T3 cells that stably overexpressed mutated forms of MAPK kinase (MAPKK). The activation of RSK by EGF was markedly decreased in cell lines expressing the dominant negative MAPKK mutants S222A and K97A and was increased in cells expressing the S222E mutant as compared with control cell lines. EGF induced a rapid decrease in GSK-3β activity (50%) in control and S222E cells; however, only 25 and 10% inhibition in GSK-3β activity was observed in cell lines expressing the dominant negative mutants K97A and S222A, respectively, suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3 was partially blocked in these cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the action of EGF on GSK-3 inactivation is mediated by the RSK/MAPK signaling pathway in NIH/3T3 cells and provide evidence for a mechanism regulating GSK-3 activity in intact cells."

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, our previous report (14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that nonmyristoylated rARF1 strongly binds to phospholipids once it is activated by GTP γS does not support this hypothesis. Instead, we believe that myr-ARF GTPγS interacts with lipid bilayers mostly through the amphiphatic α helix found at the amino terminus (15Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the GTP-induced conformational change primarily affects that α helix rather than the fatty acid. In an attempt, therefore, to understand at which step of ARF activation myristoylation plays a role, we have compared in this study the myristoylated and nonmyristoylated forms of rARF1 for their interactions with phospholipids and their nucleotide exchange properties. We demonstrate that myristoylation of ARF allows GDP dissociation at physiological Mg 2+ concentrations, especially in the presence of phospholipids, because myr-rARF1 GDP interacts with lipid membranes in marked contrast to rARF1 GDP. This interaction appears to further open the nucleotide binding site and facilitate nucleotide exchange. Moreover, myristoylation enhances the phospholipid-dependent stabilization of the GTP- or GTP γS-bound form.

Nonmyristoylated Gly-2 ARF1 (rARF1) was expressed and purified by a single QAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography as described for Ile-2 ARF1(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For production of myristoylated ARF1 (myr-rARF1), BL21(DE3) bacteria were cotransformed with the pET11d/Gly-2 ARF1 and pBB131 (yeast N-myristoyltransferase) plasmids and selected for both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance. Transformed cells were grown at 37°C to A 600 = 0.6. Myristate (50 μM) bound to bovine serum albumin (6 μM) was added as a 100-fold concentrated solution prepared by slowly adding warm sodium myristate 100 mM, pH 9, to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. After 10 min, the coexpression of ARF1 and N-myristoyltransferase was induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was reduced to 27°C to increase the yield of myristoylation (see “Results”). After 3 h, the cells were harvested and lysed(17Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The supernatant was precipitated at 35% saturation of ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 5 μM GDP, dialyzed against the same buffer, and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT. The flow-through fractions containing ARF1 were pooled, concentrated on a Centricon-10 (Amicon) in 10 mM MES, pH 5.7, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and applied to a Mono S column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0-500 mM).

Samples of 50 μl were diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and filtered on 25-mm BA 85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of the same buffer, dried, and counted. rARF1 or myr-rARF1 (3 μM) was incubated with 1.5 mg/ml phospholipid vesicles and 50 μM GDP in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, for 30 min at 30°C, in 100 μl. After centrifugation for 6 min at 200,000 × g, the supernatant and the pellet (resuspended in 100 μl) were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was analyzed by densitometry after Coomassie Blue staining. rARF1 or myr-rARF1 (3 μM) was incubated with 10 μM GDP in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 g/liter DMPC and 4 g/liter sodium cholate, for 30 min at 30°C. A 200-μl sample was loaded on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia), equilibrated and eluted at room temperature with the same DMPC/cholate-containing buffer, which was supplemented with 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The flow rate was 30 ml/h, and 300-μl fractions were collected. When [3H]DPPC was included, radioactivity was determined by counting 20 μl of each fraction. For SDS-PAGE analysis, the fractions were concentrated by precipitation of the proteins with methanol/chloroform(18Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal.

As shown in Fig. 1B (lane2), it was even possible to detect three bands around 20 kDa in a cytosolic extract of bacteria induced at 37°C for coexpression of rARF1 and N-myristoyltransferase. Amino-terminal sequencing and labeling with [3H]myristate indicated that the three bands corresponded, with increasing mobility, to Met-1 rARF1, Gly-1 rARF1 formed by cleavage of the amino-terminal Met, and myr-Gly1 ARF1, respectively. Interestingly, decreasing the induction temperature from 37 to 27°C notably increased the efficiency of N-myristoylation with a marked fading of the Gly-1 rARF1 band (Fig. 1B, lanes2 and 3), which suggests that cleavage by methionine aminopeptidase becomes rate-limiting at this lower temperature. Nonmyristoylated rARF1 could be easily purified to near homogeneity by a single QAE-Sepharose chromatography (14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and appeared as a mixture of Met-1 and Gly-1 rARF1 (Fig. 1B, lane1). In contrast, myr-ARF1 was more strongly adsorbed on the QAE-Sepharose column and could not be efficiently purified by this method. Another purification procedure was therefore applied to the myristoylated form; myr-rARF1 was precipitated at 35% saturation of ammonium sulfate, which eliminated the majority of bacterial proteins and most of the nonmyristoylated ARF in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1A, lane3). Sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and Mono S columns removed the remaining contaminants (Fig. 1A, lanes4 and 5). myr-rARF1 was thus obtained with a purity > 95%, and it was estimated to be at least 85% myristoylated by densitometry of Coomassie-stained gels (Fig. 1A, lane5, and Fig. 1B, lane4). As previously reported(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nonmyristoylated rARF1 can be optimally loaded with [ 35S]GTP γS in the presence of phospholipids at 1 μM free Mg 2+ (Fig. 2A), whereas at physiological (mM) concentrations of Mg 2+, the exchange is extremely slow (Fig. 2B). myr-rARF1 behaved quite differently since, first, it was loaded with [ 35S]GTP γS much more rapidly at 1 μM Mg 2+, with a t ½of 1 min instead of 21 min for rARF1 (Fig. 2A) and, most importantly, it could be efficiently loaded with GTP γS at 1 mM Mg 2+, with a t ½of 35 min (Fig. 2B). Because [ 35S]GTP γS binding is very likely to be rate-limited by the dissociation of GDP, we directly investigated [3H]GDP dissociation from rARF1 and myr-rARF1 (Fig. 3, A and B). The ARFs were first loaded with [3H]GDP in the presence or absence of phospholipids. Optimal GDP-[3H]GDP exchange was obtained at 0.1 μM Mg 2+ in all cases except for myr-rARF1 in the presence of lipids; in this case, denaturation of nucleotide-free protein occurred at low Mg 2+ levels and the loading with [3H]GDP was therefore performed at 100 μM Mg 2+. When the plateau was attained in each condition, the concentration of free Mg 2+ was adjusted to either 1 μM (Fig. 3A) or 1 mM (Fig. 3B), and an excess of unlabeled GDP was added to initiate the release assay. As expected, very similar rates were found for [ 35S]GTP γS association and [3H]GDP dissociation under identical conditions. At 1 μM Mg 2+ in the presence of lipids, [3H]GDP dissociated much more rapidly from myr-rARF1 (t ½= 0.8 min) than from rARF1 (t ½= 13 min). The fact that the binding of GTP γS was slightly slower than the dissociation of GDP may be explained by the dissociation rate of GTP γS (see Fig. 3C). At 1 mM Mg 2+, [3H]GDP dissociation from rARF1 was undetectable, both in the presence and absence of phospholipids. Thus, the low level of [ 35S]GTP γS binding observed in Fig. 2B might be due to the presence in the rARF1 preparation of a small fraction of nucleotide-free ARF that renaturated upon binding of GTP γS. By contrast, GDP significantly dissociated from myr-rARF1 at 1 mM Mg 2+, and the rate of dissociation was doubled in the presence of phospholipids (Fig. 3B), reaching a value very similar to the rate of association measured for GTP γS (Fig. 2B).Figure 3:Dissociation of GDP and GTP γS from rARF1 and myr-rARF1. A and B, rARF1 (1 μM) was loaded for 60 min at 37°C with 10 μM [3H]GDP in the presence of 0.1 μM Mg 2+ (1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM MgCl2), with (○) or without (□) phospholipid vesicles; myr-rARF1 (1 μM) was loaded with 10 μM [3H]GDP for 60 min in the presence of 100 μM MgCl2 and phospholipid vesicles (•) or for 30 min at 0.1 μM Mg 2+ without phospholipids ( ▪). [3H]GDP dissociation was initiated by adding 1 mM unlabeled GDP with MgCl2± EDTA to give a final concentration of 1 μM (A) or 1 mM (B) free Mg 2+. The concentration of bound [3H]GDP just prior to the initiation of the exchange reaction (taken as 100%) was 0.60 and 0.50 μM for rARF1, and 0.46 and 0.40 μM for myr-rARF1 with and without phospholipids, respectively. The curves are best fits assuming first-order kinetics for nucleotide dissociation. At 1 μM Mg 2+ in the presence of phospholipids k off = 0.05 min -1 for rARF1 and 0.91 min -1 for myr-rARF1; at 1 mM Mg 2+, there was no detectable dissociation from rARF1, with or without phospholipids, whereas k off values were 15 × 10 -3 and 8 × 10 -3 min -1 for myr-rARF1 with and without phospholipids, respectively. C and D, in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, rARF1 (○) and myr-rARF1 (•) were loaded for 90 and 30 min, respectively, with 10 μM [ 35S]GTP γS (900 cpm/pmol) at 1 μM free Mg 2+. In the absence of phospholipids, loading was performed with 2 μM [ 35S]GTP γS (6000 cpm/pmol) for 1 h at 1 μM Mg 2+ for rARF1 (□) and for 3 h at 1 mM Mg 2+ for myr-rARF1 ( ▪). [ 35S]GTP γS exchange was initiated by the addition of 1 mM unlabeled GTP γS either alone (C) or with 1 mM Mg 2+, final concentration (D). 100% corresponds to 27 and 31 pmol (per 50-μl aliquot) in the presence of lipids, and to 6 and 1 pmol in the absence of lipids, for rARF1 and myr-rARF1, respectively. Dissociation rates are: 0.074 min -1 (○) and 0.027 min -1 with a maximal exchange of 77% (•) in C and 5 × 10 -4 min -1 (•), 5 × 10 -3 min -1 (○), 0.043 min -1 (□), and 0.54 min -1 ( ▪) in D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next compared the rates of dissociation of [ 35S]GTP γS from rARF1 and myr-rARF1 at low and high Mg 2+ (Fig. 3, C and D). We previously reported that phospholipids stabilize the GTP γS-bound form of rARF1 by decreasing the k off rate of GTP γS(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylation of rARF1 accentuates this effect, since in the presence of phospholipids the dissociation of [ 35S]GTP γS was notably slower from myr-rARF1 than from rARF1, both at low and at high Mg 2+ concentrations. In contrast, in the absence of lipids, GTP γS dissociated very rapidly from myr-rARF1, even at 1 mM Mg 2+ (Fig. 3D). For that reason, it was difficult to load myr-rARF1 with [ 35S]GTP γS in the absence of phospholipids. In the experiment described in Fig. 3D, only 2% of total ARF had bound [ 35S]GTP γS at time 0 of the dissociation, but we are confident that this fraction represented only myr-rARF1 because GTP γS loading was performed at 1 mM Mg 2+, which precluded nucleotide exchange on the contaminating rARF1. Thus altogether, the effect of phospholipids on the dissociation of GTP γS is much more dramatic for myr-rARF1 than for rARF1, since for the myristoylated protein the k off rate was ˜1000-fold lower in the presence of lipids. myr-rARF1 can also be loaded with GTP at 1 mM Mg 2+ in the presence of phospholipids but less efficiently than with GTP γS (Fig. 4A). This difference is not due to the hydrolysis of GTP by myr-rARF1 but to a faster dissociation of GTP than of GTP γS (Fig. 4B). Two observations demonstrate that myr-rARF1 lacks any GTPase activity: 1) similar kinetics were obtained with [α- 32P]GTP and [ γ- 32P]GTP both for GTP binding and dissociation (Fig. 4); 2) no liberation of 32Pi from [ γ- 32P]GTP could be detected with either myr-rARF1 or rARF1 (not shown) provided that 3 mM phosphate was included in the assay to inhibit a nucleotidase (or phosphatase) activity that frequently contaminated the ARF preparations to a varying degree. This contaminant, which appeared only slightly smaller than ARF by gel filtration, was very difficult to separate from rARF1 (myristoylated or not). It hydrolyzed ATP as well as GTP and could be completely inhibited by a few mM Pi or by AlFx (5 mM F – and 10 μM AlCl3). We cannot exclude that it might be a degradation product of ARF. The rate of dissociation of GTP from myr-rARF1 at 1 mM Mg 2+ in the presence of lipids (Fig. 4B) was intermediate between the rates of dissociation of GTP γS measured at 1 μM and 1 mM Mg 2+ (Fig. 3, C and D). This suggests that the interaction of Mg 2+ is stronger with GTP γS than with GTP on myr-rARF1. The same is true for rARF1, since GTP dissociates ˜8-fold more rapidly than GTP γS at 1 mM Mg 2+ (Fig. 3D and Fig. 4B). The observation that phospholipids accelerate the dissociation of GDP from myr-rARF1 (Fig. 3B) suggested an interaction between lipids and myr-rARF1 GDP. This was therefore directly investigated in a sedimentation experiment described in Fig. 5. Indeed, 40% of myr-rARF1 GDP sedimented with the phospholipid vesicles, whereas rARF1 GDP was almost entirely recovered in the supernatant, as previously reported(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It can be noted also that the small fraction of nonmyristoylated ARF contaminating the myr-rARF1 preparation remained totally in the supernatant. We previously reported that rARF1 GTPγS binds totally to phospholipid/cholate micelles and migrates with them on a gel filtration column(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, rARF1 GDP does not associate to micelles and elutes at a volume corresponding to a ˜20-kDa protein, as illustrated in Fig. 6B. A quite different result was obtained with myr-rARF1 GDP (Fig. 6A). Two peaks of ARF were obtained, a small one eluting at the same volume as rARF1 GDP, and corresponding to the contaminating nonmyristoylated ARF, as indicated by the SDS-PAGE analysis, and a major peak eluting more rapidly and containing only myr-rARF1. Labeling of the micelles with [3H]DPPC indicated that micelles eluted at a volume slightly smaller than the elution volume of myr-rARF1. This suggests that myr-rARF1 GDP binds to DMPC/cholate micelles but not as strongly as ARF GTPγS, which exactly coeluted with the micelles, whether myristoylated or not(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that myr-rARF1 GDP associates to and dissociates from micelles all along the column, whereas myr-rARF1 GTPγS and rARF1 GTPγS remain firmly bound to the micelles. This rather weak interaction between myr-rARF1 GDP and phospholipids can explain why only 40% of the myr-rARF1 GDP was found in the pellet in the sedimentation experiment of Fig. 5. Recombinant bovine ARF1 has been expressed in bacteria as unmodified ARF1 or N-myristoylated ARF1. In contrast to Randazzo et al.(10Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who could not separate the two forms, we found that myr-rARF1 and rARF1 migrate differently on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and can be efficiently separated in a few steps. Obtention of myr-ARF1 that is at least 85% myristoylated allowed us to compare the properties of the two forms with regard to their interactions with phospholipids and the Mg 2+ dependence of nucleotide exchange. Two major differences between myristoylated and nonmyristoylated ARF1 are described. The first one concerns the interaction of the GDP-bound form with phospholipids. Nonmyristoylated ARF1 binds to phospholipids exclusively when it is in the GTP-bound form. We confirm here with wild-type Gly-2 ARF1 what we previously reported for Ile-2 ARF1(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we have not detected any difference between nonmyristoylated Gly-2 and Ile-2 ARF1 proteins in their interactions with phospholipids or in the kinetics of nucleotide binding, despite the fact that the amino-terminal Met was partially cleaved in Gly-2 ARF1 and totally conserved in Ile-2 ARF1. In contrast with the nonmyristoylated protein, the GDP-bound form of myr-rARF1 also interacts with phospholipids, either as phospholipid vesicles or as phospholipid/cholate micelles. However, the interaction is weaker than for the GTP-bound form, consistent with the idea that in myr-rARF1 GDP only myristate interacts with lipids with a rather low affinity(19Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), while in myr-rARF1 GTP both the myristate chain and the amino-terminal hydrophobic residues of the protein moiety interact with phospholipids. Thus, myr-ARF GDP should not be considered as totally cytosolic as it is commonly described (20Donaldson J.G. Kahn R.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 21Walker M.W. Bobak D.A. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3230-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) but more likely as predominantly membrane-bound in intact cells due to the high cellular ARF concentration. Cell fractionation might cause its release into the soluble fraction as a consequence of the resulting dilution. Another salient difference between rARF1 and myr-rARF1 concerns the Mg 2+ dependence of nucleotide exchange. GDP can be released from nonmyristoylated ARF1 only at low (μM) concentrations of free Mg 2+(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No significant nucleotide exchange occurs at physiological (mM) Mg 2+ concentrations, which led us to hypothesize that a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor is required for ARF activation in vivo(14Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we show in the present study that, in marked contrast to the nonmyristoylated protein, myr-rARF1 can release its GDP at high Mg 2+ concentrations. GDP dissociation is slow in the absence of phospholipids (t ½= 90 min at 37°C) but is accelerated by about 2-fold in the presence of lipid vesicles. This suggests that hydrophobic interaction of the myristate chain with either the protein (in the absence of lipids) or, more efficiently, with the phospholipid bilayer somehow results in the opening of the nucleotide binding site. A possible mechanism is the displacement of the amino-terminal peptide, since its removal was shown to greatly increase the release of bound GDP(15Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If GDP can dissociate from myr-rARF1 with or without phospholipids, it should be noted that its replacement by GTP or GTP γS will efficiently occur only in the presence of lipids, because in their absence GTP or GTP γS dissociate much faster than GDP. However, if as discussed above myr-ARF GDP remains essentially membrane-bound in cells, the GTP-bound form should be immediately stabilized by interaction with the bilayer. Myristoylation appears to be crucial for the lipid-dependent stabilization of the GTP-bound form (Fig. 4B). It should be noted that with GTP γS, the importance of myristoylation is less obvious, as Mg 2+ seems to stabilize GTP γS more strongly than GTP in the nucleotide binding site and therefore GTP γS dissociates notably more slowly than GTP from both rARF1 and myr-rARF1 at 1 mM Mg 2+. Thus, in summary, myr-ARF1 can be spontaneously activated by GTP or GTP γS at physiological concentrations of Mg 2+ in the sole presence of phospholipids without any nucleotide exchange factor. However, the activation remains rather slow (t ½ ˜ 30 min), which does not preclude the existence in cells of such factors, which would accelerate the exchange and might also account for the specific localization of the various ARFs. Indeed, several groups have reported evidence of an ARF-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange activity in Golgi membranes (10Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 23Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and a partial purification of this activity from bovine brain cytosol has been recently described(24Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A inhibits the exchange activity in the crude preparation but no longer in the partially purified fraction(24Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that brefeldin A has no effect on the spontaneous lipid-dependent activation of myr-ARF1 described here (not shown). Nevertheless, in most cell-free systems in which myristoylation has been reported to be essential for ARF functions, including its role in intra-Golgi (4Taylor T.C. Kahn R.A. Melançon P.

Our present finding that at mM Mg 2+ concentrations only the myristoylated protein can be spontaneously activated provides a reasonable explanation for the observed requirement for myristoylation.

As a consequence, structurally altered sialic acids with substituted N-acyl side chains were incorporated into various glycoconjugates(15Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W.

In cells carrying modified sialic acids, we investigated virus-receptor interactions of three different members of the Polyomavirus genus. Polyoma viruses are small DNA tumor viruses with a 45-nm diameter, nonenveloped icosahedral particle consisting of the three nonglycosylated structural viral proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3.

Recent Advances in Clinical Virology. Livingstone, New York1971: 93-155Google Scholar) both use distinct sialylated receptors for infection(10Haun G. Keppler O.T. Bock C.T. Herrmann M. Zentgraf H.

D-Mannosamine hydrochloride was suspended to 10 mM in 30 ml methanol. At 0°C NaOMe/methanol (to 11 mM) and the corresponding carbonic acid anhydride (to 12 mM) were added. After stirring for 2 h at 0°C the solution was dried in a vacuum evaporator. The raw product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel 60 (Merck, Germany) with an elution solvent of acetic acid ethyl ester/methanol/H2O (5:2:1 to 10:2:1, depending on the polarity of the anhydride). Characterization was carried out by 1H NMR spectroscopy. N-Acyl-D-mannosamine derivatives were stored at 4°C and dissolved in PBS as a stock solution of 100-200 mM shortly before addition to cell cultures. Human B-lymphoma cell line BJA-B (21Menezes J. Leibold W. Klein G. Clements G. Biomedicine (Paris). 1975; 22: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar) (subclone K88) and African green monkey kidney epithelium cell line Vero (3Gottschalk A. Burnet F.M. Stanley W.M. The Viruses. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1959: 51-61Google Scholar) were propagated as described(10Haun G. Keppler O.T. Bock C.T. Herrmann M. Zentgraf H. Pawlita M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7482-7492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, BJA-B cells were cultivated at 2 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells/ml as suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Vero cells were cultivated as monolayers attached to plastic surfaces in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the same supplements and for harvesting were brought into suspension by incubation for 2-5 min in 0.2% (w/v) trypsin, 0.2% (w/v) versene (EDTA) in PBS. Unless stated otherwise, cells were cultivated for 48 h in the presence of 5 mMD-mannosamine derivative. Cells were washed three times in PBS and lysed by hypotonic shock in distilled water (1 h, 4°C); this was followed by 1 cycle of freezing and thawing. The crude membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet was lyophilized and delipidated by stepwise washing three times with methanol/chloroform (1:2, 1:1, 2:1 by volume) for 30 min(22Geilen C. Kannicht C. Orthen B. Heidrich C. Paul C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g (30 min, 4°C) the pellet was hydrolyzed for 2 h with 200 μl of 2 M acetic acid(23Varki A. Diaz S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The pH of the hydrolysate was adjusted to 4, and further purification was carried out on a cation exchanger (AG-50W-X12, H+ form, Bio-Rad, München, Germany). Neuraminic acids were chromatographed using an anion exchange column (Nucleosil SB 5 μm, 250 × 4 mm (inner diameter), Knauer, Berlin, Germany) with pulsed amperometric detection (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Eluent A contained distilled water while eluent B contained 45 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, pH 4.0. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, and all separations were carried out using a linear gradient from 100% A to 0% A during a 50-min period. NaOH (0.5 M) was added to the column effluent through a tee at 0.5 ml/min before the pulsed amperometric detection cell detector to minimize base-line drift. Pulse potentials and durations were: E1 = 0.10 V (t1 = 540 ms), E2 = 0.60 V (t2 = 60 ms), E3 = 0.60 V (t3 = 120 ms). Further purification and final quantification were achieved by reversed phase HPLC with fluorescent labeled compounds. The derivation was performed according to a method by Reuter and Schauer(24Reuter G. Schauer R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 168-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Labeled neuraminic acids were chromatographed using a reversed phase C18 column (Lichrosorb C18 5 μm, 250 × 4 mm (inner diameter), Knauer, Berlin, Germany) with a fluorescence detector. Eluent A contained distilled water while eluent B contained acetonitrile/methanol (60:40, v/v). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and all separations were carried out using a gradient that first ran for 20 min in the isocratic mode with 10% B; then was raised to 25% B in 25 min and finally to 50% B in another 15 min. Cellular N-acylneuraminic acids were isolated and purified by hydrolysis and HPLC as described above. Synthesis of O-SiMe3 ether and O-SiMe3 ester of neuraminic acids was performed according to the method of Sweeley et al.(25Sweeley C. Bentley R. Makita M. Wells W.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2497-2507Crossref Scopus (2158) Google Scholar) using a mixture of trimethylchlorosilane, hexamethyldisilane, and pyridine (1:2:10) at room temperature for 1 h, and samples were subsequently applied to gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as described previously (15, 26). Stocks of LPV (strain P12) were extracted from infected BJA-B cells after one cycle of freezing and thawing by hypotonic extraction as described(10Haun G. Keppler O.T. Bock C.T. Herrmann M. Zentgraf H. Pawlita M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7482-7492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SV40 stock was prepared from infected monkey kidney epithelium cells (TC7) displaying a massive cytopathic effect. After freezing and thawing of washed cells and resuspension of the cell lysate, the same extraction procedure was used as for LPV. Stocks of BKV (Gardner strain) were established from infected Vero cells following the method of Sinibaldi et al.(19Sinibaldi L. Goldoni P. Pietropaolo V. Longhi C. Orsi N. Arch. Virol. 1990; 113: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For virus infection cells were washed once with cold PBS and were then incubated either with LPV (BJA-B cells, 4°C, 3 h) or with BKV or SV40 (Vero cells, 4°C, various times). After removing unbound virus from the cultures by three washing cycles with medium, infected cells were cultured at 37°C. In BJA-B cells without prior treatment by N-acylmannosamines the applied LPV dose yielded 15-20% immunofluorescence-positive cells (see below) 48 h after infection. For BKV the infectious dose was chosen to yield 1.5-2.5% infected Vero cells in order to allow an exact determination of the increase in infection in ManNProp- and ManNBut-treated cells (see Fig. 3, a and c). BJA-B cell suspensions were allowed to settle on poly-L-lysine-coated slides (Bio-Rad adhesion slides, Bio-Rad, München, Germany), and Vero cells were cultivated as monolayers on glass coverslips. Cells attached to the glass surfaces were fixed and permeabilized in cold methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) at −20°C for 10 min. Viral antigens were first reacted for 30 min at 37°C with an LPV VP-specific rabbit antiserum(10Haun G. Keppler O.T. Bock C.T. Herrmann M. Zentgraf H. Pawlita M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7482-7492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a rabbit antiserum raised against purified BKV particles (kind gift of G. Noss), or mouse monoclonal antibody 1614 against SV40 T antigen(27Ball R.K. Siegl B. Quellhorst S. Brandner G. Braun D.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), respectively, followed by staining with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins or fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (both from Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Boehringer Mannheim). All antibody dilutions and washings between antibody incubations were done in PBS. The LPV binding capacity was determined by an indirect, nonradioactive assay as described previously(10Haun G. Keppler O.T. Bock C.T. Herrmann M. Zentgraf H. Pawlita M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7482-7492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once in PBS and then serially diluted in PBS containing 1% (w/v) gelatin. In 96-well tissue culture plates the cell suspension was incubated in a final volume of 180 μl with a constant amount of LPV particles (corresponding to 800 pg of LPV VP1) for 30 min at 37°C. After low speed sedimentation of the cells, the amount of free LPV VP1 in the supernatant was quantified by LPV VP1-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Vero cells (2 × 105 on a glass coverslip), which had been cultivated in the presence of N-acyl-D-mannosamines or an equivalent volume of PBS (control), were exposed for 2 h at 37°C to 200 μl of either sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18, acylneuraminyl hydrolase, neuraminidase) from Vibrio cholerae (Boehringer Mannheim) in PBS (0.2 unit/ml) or PBS alone. After thoroughly washing the cells with cold PBS, BKV infection was carried out as described above. Two cell lines, BJA-B(21Menezes J. Leibold W. Klein G. Clements G. Biomedicine (Paris). 1975; 22: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar), a human B-lymphoma line susceptible to infection by LPV (10Haun G. Keppler O.T. Bock C.T. Herrmann M. Zentgraf H. Pawlita M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7482-7492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Vero, an African green monkey kidney epithelium line susceptible to infection by BKV (18Gardner S.D. Waterson A.P. Recent Advances in Clinical Virology. Livingstone, New York1971: 93-155Google Scholar) as well as SV40(20Clayson E.T. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were exposed to three D-mannosamine derivatives containing elongated N-acyl groups (N-propanoyl (ManNProp), N-butanoyl (ManNBut), or N-pentanoyl (ManNPent); Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Cells treated with 10 mM ManNProp for 48 h showed no signs of toxicity or reduced proliferation. In ManNBut- and ManNPent-treated cultures cell proliferation was reduced by 30-40%. To demonstrate the biosynthesis of structurally modified sialic acids and their incorporation into glycoconjugates after pretreatment of BJA-B and Vero cells by either ManNProp, ManNBut, or ManNPent, extracted sialic acids were separated by HPLC (Fig. 2) and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Fig. 3), as has been shown previously for serum glycoproteins of ManNProp-treated rats(15Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting sialic acid derivatives carry the identical N-acyl group substitution as the applied sialic acid precursor analogue, thus resulting in an elongation of the physiological N-acetyl group at position C-5 of sialic acid by one, two, or three methylene groups, respectively (see chair conformations in Fig. 4a). The amount of modified sialic acids incorporated in pretreated cells relative to the amount of physiological N-acetylneuraminic acid was quantified after HPLC separation of the extracted sialic acids (Fig. 2). About 50% of physiological neuraminic acid was replaced by the N-acyl-modified neuraminic acid in both of the cell lines tested after treatment with each of the three D-mannosamine derivatives (Table 1).Tabled 1 It has been recently demonstrated that infection of BJA-B cells by LPV is sialic acid-dependent since enzymatic cleavage of terminal sialic acids by sialidase from V. cholerae reduced cell LPV binding capacity and susceptibility to LPV infection by approximately 80%(10Haun G. Keppler O.T. Bock C.T. Herrmann M. Zentgraf H. Pawlita M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7482-7492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this indicated that a strong reduction in virus binding can limit virus infection. Cultivation of BJA-B cells in the presence of the sialic acid precursor analogues ManNProp, ManNBut, or ManNPent for 2 days reduced their LPV binding capacity by 75, 86, and 85%, respectively (Fig. 5c). Similarly, the susceptibility of these pretreated cells to LPV infection was impaired by up to 97% in comparison with cells pretreated with control saline buffer (Fig. 4b, Fig. 5, a and b). 50% inhibition of LPV infection was reached at a concentration in tissue culture of approximately 0.4 mM for ManNProp and 0.8 mM for ManNBut (Fig. 5a). D-Mannosamine has been reported to inhibit the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors in mammalian cells(28Lisanti M.P. Field M.C. Caras I.W. Menon A.K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the observed inhibition of LPV infection was specific for the modified N-acyl group and not an effect of the D-mannosamine residue, cells were also pretreated with the physiological sialic acid precursor ManNAc, differing from ManNProp by only one methylene group. Yet, neither LPV binding (Fig. 5c) nor infection (Fig. 5a) was significantly affected by this D-mannosamine derivative. In order to examine whether pretreatment with ManNProp, ManNBut, or ManNPent, respectively, also had an effect on other steps of the virus replication cycle apart from virus binding, purified LPV DNA was transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. This experiment yielded similar amounts of virus for all cells, irrespective of their pretreatment (not shown), indicating that the impaired susceptibility to infection involves events prior to virus gene expression and DNA replication. Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest that already the first step of LPV infection, i.e. virus attachment, was impaired by the presence of structurally altered sialic acids in membrane glycoconjugates and by this mechanism hindered LPV infection. BKV infection of Vero cells is sensitive to treatment with sialidase from Clostridium perfringens(19Sinibaldi L. Goldoni P. Pietropaolo V. Longhi C. Orsi N. Arch. Virol. 1990; 113: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as well as from V. cholerae, the latter reducing the percentage of infected cells by over 80% (Fig. 6c). For this virus-host cell system, we analyzed the virus attachment phase indirectly. Pretreated cells were exposed to virus for different times at 4°C, unbound virus was removed, and after 48 h in culture successfully infected cells were scored by immunofluorescence. It is assumed that at 4°C only virus binding takes place since efficient virus uptake is an energy-dependent process. Surprisingly, ManNProp- and to a lesser extent ManNBut-pretreated Vero cells could be infected more efficiently (up to 7-fold) than controls (Fig. 4b and Fig. 6, a and c). ManNPent, however, rendered cells nearly resistant to infection by BKV. For attachment times of up to 3 h, infection increased more rapidly as a function of time in ManNProp- and ManNBut-treated cells than in controls (Fig. 6a). After an attachment time of 14 h, infection in control cells also reached high levels indicating that despite a slower rate of virus binding, the final level of virus attachment allowed BKV infection to occur. It has been shown previously that N-propanoylneuraminic acid, incorporated into glycoconjugates in vivo, can be enzymatically or chemically cleaved(15Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In ManNProp- and ManNBut-pretreated Vero cells V. cholerae sialidase reduced the elevated levels of BKV infection by 88 and 82%, respectively (Fig. 6c), demonstrating the essential role of terminal sialic acids on the cell surface for the enhanced susceptibility to BKV infection. SV40, a polyoma virus with 81% protein sequence identity to BKV in the major capsid protein VP1(29Seif I. Khoury G. Dhar R. Tooze J. DNA Tumor Viruses: Molecular Biology of Tumor Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 911-936Google Scholar), can also efficiently infect and replicate in Vero cells but uses a different, sialidase-resistant receptor(20Clayson E.T. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the marked effects seen for BKV, SV40 infection was unaffected in Vero cells carrying N-substituted sialic acids (Fig. 6b). This further supports that the incorporation of N-substituted sialic acids apparently does not affect transport or replicative steps in the polyoma virus infection cycle but rather interferes with the interaction of specific viruses with their sialylated receptors. These results provide evidence that the biosynthetically introduced hydrophobic modifications at the N-acyl group of sialic acids directly affected the capability of the sialylated receptor on Vero cells to bind BKV, with the N-propanoyl and N-butanoyl substitutions increasing and the even longer N-pentanoyl group drastically decreasing the affinity for BKV particles. In contrast to the effects seen with LPV and BKV, the binding of monoclonal antibodies and lectins, which recognize sialylated membrane components only, was unaffected by ManNProp pretreatment. For three monoclonal antibodies (LN1, HB-4, and HB-6), which recognize different sialylated epitopes on B cell differentiation antigens(30Bast B.J.E.G. Zhou L.-J. Colley K.J. Ernst T.J. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Keppler O.T. Moldenhauer G. Oppenländer M. Schwartz-Albiez R. Berger E.G. Funderud S. Pawlita M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2777-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), binding was not significantly altered on pretreated BJA-B cells as analyzed by flow cytometry (not shown). This suggests that N-acyl elongation might not affect binding of all types of ligands interacting with sialylated receptors. Similarly, fluorescence microscopy of ManNProp-treated BJA-B and Vero cells stained with biotinylated lectins Sambucus nigra(32Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Broekaert W.F. Nsimba-Lubaki M. Peeters B. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1596-1601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Maackia amurensis(33Wang W.C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which specifically detect sialic acid residues in α-2,6- or α-2,3-linkage, respectively, allowed the exclusion of gross alterations of the overall amount or pattern of sialylation. This study demonstrates drastic but selective biological effects of sialic acids modified in their N-acyl side chains, which have been synthesized and incorporated in high amounts into cellular glycoconjugates. These modified sialic acids have been biosynthesized in competition with physiological sialic acid in cells cultivated in the presence of N-substituted D-mannosamines, and amounts equal to the physiological N-acetylneuraminic acid can be reached. The N-substituted sialic acids drastically enhance and/or abolish in a dominant fashion host cell susceptibility to sialic acid-dependent virus infections. The high amount of modified sialic acids with elongated N-acyl groups synthesized indicates that enzymes and transport mechanisms in the sialic acid metabolic pathway cannot be very selective with respect to the N-acyl group of substrate intermediates. Also, the modified sialic acids and their precursors apparently are tolerated by the cells, at least in tissue culture. At 5 mMD-mannosamine derivative, when about 50% of total sialic acids with an N-pentanoyl instead of the physiological N-acetyl side chain was reached, cell viability was not affected, and cell proliferation was only slightly reduced. Similarly, in vivo treatment of Wistar rats with ManNProp had displayed no signs of acute toxicity. ( 3P. Stehling and W. Reutter, unpublished data.) This indicates that, at least in these established cell lines, either the metabolic and signaling pathways needed for cellular proliferation and survival in tissue culture are rather independent of sialic acids or are not very discriminatory with respect to the N-acyl side chain. In contrast to this rather inert behavior of central cellular functions, the minor modifications of the sialic acid side chain, i.e. the introduction of uncharged, hydrophobic methylene groups at C-5, had pronounced and specific effects on interactions of host cells with two viruses that are known to depend on cell surface sialic acid for infection. Most probably, the modification of sialic acid forming part of the viral receptor structures was responsible for alteration of the virus infections. The presence of physiological N-acetyl sialic acid and modified N-propanoyl sialic acid in about equal amounts in human B-lymphoma line BJA-B was sufficient to reduce binding of LPV 6-fold and infection over 10-fold. On the other hand, infection by BKV was enhanced 7-fold in monkey epithelium cell line Vero carrying the same modified sialic acid also in about equal amounts as the physiological sialic acid. The kinetic experiment suggests that the increase in infection was mainly due to faster binding, which may reflect an increase either in receptor number or, more probably, in receptor affinity. One could assume that a polyvalent cooperative interaction of the repetitive virus capsid with several cell surface receptor molecules is necessary for particle binding. If so, then even slight receptor affinity changes in either direction could add up to the strong, opposite effects seen here for the two viruses. The use of these sialic acid precursor analogues allowed the identification of the N-acyl group as a critical determinant of sialic acid-dependent polyoma virus-receptor interaction. This group has previously been implicated in host range determination of a completely different microorganism. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli with strain K99 fimbriae, which use sialylated intestinal glycolipids as receptors, specifically recognize N-glycolyl but not N-acetyl substitutions(34Teneberg S. Willemsen P. de Graaf F.K. Karlsson K.-A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to viral infections studied here, the principle of biosynthetic structural modification of sialic acid should be applicable to a wide variety of sialic acid-dependent ligand-receptor interactions including other bacteria(35Ko H.L. Bueuth J. Solter J. Schroten H. Uhlenbruck G. Pulverer G. Infection. 1987; 15: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), parasites(36Hadley T.J. Klotz F.W. Miller L.H. Annu. Rev.

INTRODUCTIONIn the developing mammalian central nervous system (CNS), ( 1The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemHLHhelix-loop-helixbHLHbasic HLHkbkilobasesbpbase pairsEembryonic dayRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction.) neural precursor cells are proliferating in the ventricular zone next to the lumen (Jacobson, 1991). When their fate is determined to become neurons or glial cells, these precursor cells stop cell division, migrate out of the ventricular zone, and undergo terminal differentiation. The underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet well understood, but recent evidence suggests that transcription factors with a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain may be involved in these developmental processes (Johnson et al., 1990; Sasai et al., 1992; Guillemot et al., 1993; Ishibashi et al., 1994). For example, null mutation of the basic HLH (bHLH) factor MASH1, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila achaete-scute complex (Johnson et al., 1990), results in severe loss of olfactory and autonomic neurons (Guillemot et al., 1993), suggesting that MASH1 is a positive regulator of neurogenesis. HES-1, another bHLH factor structurally related to the product of the Drosophila pair-rule gene hairy (Sasai et al., 1992), is a negative regulator of mammalian neurogenesis (Ishibashi et al., 1994). Thus, the balance between the positive and negative regulatory factors may be important for normal neurogenesis.Recent studies show that many other HLH factors, such as other members of HES family (Akazawa et al., 1992; Sasai et al., 1992; Ishibashi et al., 1993), Id-1 (Duncan et al., 1992), and Id-2 (Neuman et al., 1993), are expressed in the developing nervous system, suggesting that they are also involved in neural differentiation. Among these HLH factors, HES-5 has a unique transcriptional activity. Unlike most other bHLH factors, HES-5 does not bind to the CANNTG sequence (the E box), but it binds to the consensus sequence CACNAG (the N box) and represses transcription (Akazawa et al., 1992). Furthermore, like Id proteins, HES-5 also represses E box-dependent transcription by preventing other bHLH activators from binding to the E box (Benezra et al., 1990; Sun et al., 1991; Christy et al., 1991; Akazawa et al., 1992). Thus, HES-5 represses transcription in two different manners, depending on the motifs.HES-5 also shows a unique expression pattern in late embryos (Akazawa et al., 1992): 1) HES-5 is expressed exclusively in the developing nervous system, and 2) HES-5 is expressed at high levels throughout the ventricular zone where neural precursor cells are present, but the level decreases as neural differentiation proceeds. Thus, HES-5 expression correlates well to the undifferentiated stages of the neural cells. Here, we first examined HES-5 expression patterns in earlier embryos and showed that HES-5 is specific to the developing nervous system. To understand the molecular mechanism of this neural precursor cell-specific expression, we cloned mouse HES-5 gene and characterized its promoter. We found that the upstream region of the HES-5 gene directs specific expression in neural precursor cells. Further promoter analysis identified a regulatory element that activates undifferentiated neural-specific expression on a heterologous promoter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESWhole Mount in Situ Hybridization AnalysisMouse embryos of embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to in situ hybridization analysis, as described previously (Wilkinson, 1993). Digoxygenin-labeled antisense RNA corresponding to the 1057-nucleotide ApaI fragment of pHES-5 (Akazawa et al., 1992) was used as a probe. Hybridized RNA was visualized by overnight treatment with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxygenin antibody at 4°C followed by incubation in 0.34 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium and 0.18 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.Isolation of the Mouse HES-5 GeneThe mouse genomic library (Stratagene) was screened by hybridization in situ, as described previously (Takebayashi et al., 1994). The 1.3-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment of the rat HES-5 cDNA (Akazawa et al., 1992) was used as a probe. Two positive clones were obtained from 1 × 106 plaques, and the positive fragments were subcloned into pBluescript and subjected to sequence analysis.Southern Blot AnalysisMouse liver DNA digested by restriction enzymes was electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane filter. The 32P-labeled 0.6-kb BglII-SpeI fragment of the mouse genomic fragment was hybridized to the DNA at 65°C in a solution containing 0.75 M NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate, and 0.5% SDS.Reverse Transcriptase-mediated Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Primer Extension AnalysisRT-PCR was carried out, as described previously (Lee et al., 1988; Saiki et al., 1988). Total RNA prepared from E13 CNS was subjected to reverse transcription using oligo(dT) as a primer. Primers used for PCR were as follows: P1 (corresponding to nucleotide residues −16 to +2), 5′-TGGCGTGCTGGGGTCCAG-3′; P2 (+3 to +21), 5′-GTCGCGCCAGTCCGGGACG-3′; P3 (+113 to +132), 5′-TCGGTTTTTCTCCTTGGGAC-3′. P1 and P3 primers were used to detect the 148-base pair (bp) band, and P2 and P3 were used to detect the 130-bp band. After 30 cycles of the reaction (94°C 1 min → 60°C 1 min → 74°C 1 min), the products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel.For the primer extension experiment, the 52-nucleotide SacI-EcoT14I fragment labeled at the EcoT14I site was hybridized to the mouse E13 CNS poly(A) RNA (20 μg) at 42°C in a solution containing 80% (v/v) formamide and 0.4 M NaCl and subjected to the reverse transcription reaction as described previously (Takebayashi et al., 1994).Transient Transfection AnalysisThe reporter plasmids contained the luciferase gene under the control of either various lengths of the HES-5 promoter, the enhancer-less SV40 promoter (SV40 basic promoter, SV40b), three repeats of the HES-5 region (−120/-96) linked to the SV40b, five repeats of the GC stretch (GGCCGGCGCC) linked to the SV40b (GC5-SV40b), five repeats of the TG sequence (CTTTGTGC) linked to the SV40b, or no promoter sequence (promoterless). The GC5-SV40b was constructed by inserting the double-stranded oligonucleotide fragment (5′-CGCGTCGACGGCCGGCGCCAAGGCCGGCGCCTTGGCCGGCGCCACCAAGGCCGGCGCCTTGGCCGGCGCCA-3′) into the upstream portion of the SV40b-luciferase plasmid.Neural precursor cells were isolated from E10.5 mouse fetal heads, as described previously (Kitani et al., 1991). Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/well in 6-multiwell dishes coated with poly-D-lysine. C6 glioma (Benda et al., 1968), NCB20 neuroblastoma-brain hybrid (MacDermot et al., 1979), and C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells were seeded in 6-multiwell dishes at 2 × 105, 1.5 × 105, and 2 × 105 cells/well, respectively. 20-24 h later, 1.8 μg of the reporter plasmids was transfected by using 10-15 μl lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) per well. 0.2 μg of the cytomegalovirus promoter-directed β-galactosidase expression (CMV-βgal) vector was also transfected as an internal standard to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated with the transfection complexes for 6 h at 37°C. Then, the complexes were removed, and cells were harvested 42-48 h after the start of transfection. When NCB20 cells were induced to differentiate, the medium with 5% fetal bovine serum was changed to the medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum with 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP after the transfection complexes were removed (Nirenberg et al., 1983). Luciferase activity was measured, as described previously (Ow et al., 1986).For X-gal staining and immunostaining analysis, 2 μg of the vector containing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the HES-5 promoter was transfected into the neural precursor cell culture, as described above. After 48 h, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained in 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, K4Fe(CN)6, and 2 mM MgCl2 at 37°C for 6 h. After refixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with the rabbit polyclonal anti-nestin serum (1:500 dilution with phosphate-buffered saline) (Tomooka et al., 1993), which is kindly provided by Dr. Y. Tomooka. Nestin-positive cells were visualized by Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with diaminobenzidine.DNA Binding AnalysisFor preparation of the probe DNA, the double-stranded oligonucleotide fragment (one strand, 5′-CGCGTCGACGGCCGGCGCCAAGGCCGGCGCCTTGGCCGGCGCCA-3′; its complementary strand, 5′-GATCTGGCGCCGGCCAAGGCGCCGGCCTTGGCGCCGGCCGTCGA-3′) was labeled at both ends by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The wild-type competitor contained the same sequence as that of the probe. The mutant probe contained three repeats of the sequence GGAAATTGCC instead of GGCGCCGGCC. Preparation of nuclear extracts and the binding reactions were done according to the procedure described previously (Kageyama et al., 1991; Sasai et al., 1992). 4 μg each of nuclear proteins was incubated with the probe (104 counts/min) at 0°C for 20 min.RESULTSHES-5 Expression in Mouse EmbryosWe previously showed that HES-5 is specifically expressed in the developing nervous system of late embryos (Akazawa et al., 1992). To examine earlier expression patterns of HES-5, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization analysis using mouse embryos of E11.5, at which time more abundant neural precursor cells are proliferating. As shown in Fig. 1, HES-5 was expressed at high levels throughout the developing CNS. Prominent expression was observed in the wall of the brain vesicles as well as in the developing spinal cord (Fig. 1). No expression was detected in the other tissues. Thus, HES-5 expression seemed specific to the developing nervous system, making HES-5 a developing neural-specific marker.Structural Organization of Mouse HES-5 GeneTo understand the molecular mechanism of the neural-specific expression, we cloned the mouse HES-5 gene. Two genomic clones were isolated by screening 1 × 106 plaques of a mouse genomic library with the rat HES-5 cDNA probe. Both clones contained a ∼4.3-kb BglII fragment hybridized positively to the rat HES-5 cDNA, and the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined. Comparison with the full-length rat HES-5 cDNA sequence revealed that the mouse HES-5 gene consisted of three exons and two introns and that both introns were located within the protein coding region (Fig. 2). The exon-intron boundaries all possessed the consensus splicing signal conforming to the GT-AG rule. The deduced amino acid sequence of mouse HES-5 showed a complete match in the bHLH domain and 96% identity in the whole region to that of rat HES-5. On Southern blot analysis, a single band that matched the size of the mouse HES-5 gene was detected, suggesting that the mouse HES-5 gene is a single copy gene (Fig. 3B).Figure 2:The nucleotide sequence of the mouse HES-5 gene. The nucleotide sequence of the coding strand together with the deduced amino acid sequence of HES-5 is indicated. The upper- and lower-case letters represent the exon sequence and the flanking and intron sequences, respectively. The transcription initiation site, designated as +1, is shown by an arrow. The canonical TATA box (tatata) is boxed. The bHLH region is indicated by a bar above the amino acid sequence. The stop codon is depicted by asterisks. The GC stretches (ggccggcgcc or similar sequences, solid line) and a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA, broken line) are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Genomic organization of mouse HES-5.

Thin lines indicate the flanking and intron regions. Restriction sites of the cloned mouse HES-5 gene are shown. B, Southern blot analysis of the mouse HES-5 gene. DNA (10 μg each) isolated from the mouse liver was digested by a restriction enzyme indicated above each lane. The 0.6-kb BglII-SpeI fragment containing the 5′-flanking region was used as a probe. The marker sizes (kb) are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparison between mouse HES-5 and HES-1 (Takebayashi et al., 1994) and Drosophila hairy genes (Rushlow et al., 1989) showed that they had similar genomic organization (Fig. 3A). The first intron of the HES-5 gene was located within the bHLH region, and its position was well conserved when compared with that of the mouse HES-1 and Drosophila hairy genes. An intron equivalent to the second intron of the HES-1 gene was absent from the HES-5 gene, but the second intron of the HES-5 gene was present just downstream of the bHLH region, which is almost the same as that of the third intron of the HES-1 gene. These results suggest that mouse HES-5 and HES-1 and Drosophila hairy genes are related to each other and thus originated from the same or related ancestral gene.Determination of Transcription Initiation SiteTo determine the transcription initiation site, we first performed primer extension analysis (Fig. 4A). The SacI-EcoT14I fragment labeled at the EcoT14I site (41 nucleotides downstream of the translation initiation site) was used as a primer. This analysis demonstrated three specific bands with the sizes of 116, 118, and 120 nucleotides when RNA prepared from the CNS of E13 was used (Fig. 4A, lane 1), suggesting that the 5′ terminus of the HES-5 mRNA is 78 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation site.Figure 4:Determination of the transcription initiation site. A, primer extension analysis of the 5′ terminus of the HES-5 mRNA. Primer extension analysis was performed by using the 52-nucleotide SacI-EcoT14I fragment labeled at the EcoT14I site as a primer (shown by an arrow). 20 μg each of poly(A) RNAs isolated from the CNS of mouse embryos (lane 1) and adult liver (lane 2), and tRNA (lane 3) was used. The specific product was shown by an asterisk. The marker sizes (nucleotides) are indicated on the left. B, RT-PCR analysis. P1 primer (−16/+2): 5′-TGGCGTGCTGGGGTCCAG-3′, P2 primer (+3/+21): 5′-GTCGCGCCAGTCCGGGACG-3′, and P3 primer (+113/+132): 5′-TCGGTTTTTCTCCTTGGGAC-3′ are shown in the scheme. Total RNA of mouse E13 CNS was subjected to PCR either after reverse transcription (lanes 3 and 4) or without reverse transcription (lanes 1 and 2). As a positive control, subcloned genomic DNA was used as a template (lanes 5 and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the above result, we next carried out RT-PCR by using RNA of E13 CNS (Fig. 4B). When primers 2 (corresponding to nucleotide residues +3 to +21) and 3 (+113 to +132) were used, a ∼130-bp single band was clearly observed (lane 4). This band was not detected when reverse transcriptase was omitted (lane 2), suggesting that the region between +3 and +132 was amplified from the cDNA. However, when primers 1 (−16 to +2) and 3 were used, no band was detected (lane 3), suggesting that most of the region corresponding to primer 1 was not transcribed. Thus, the position 78 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation site was most likely a transcription start site and therefore designated as nucleotide residue 1 (see Fig. 2).Sequence examination of the promoter region revealed that there is a TATA motif (tatata) at nucleotide −26, which may direct precise transcription initiation (Fig. 2, boxed). Another feature is that there are multiple GC elements (Fig. 2, underlined).Transcriptional Analysis of HES-5 PromoterWe next analyzed the promoter activity of the HES-5 gene by a transient transfection method. A reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of the 5′-region of the HES-5 gene (from −1324 to +73) was transfected into various types of cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, HES-5 promoter directed the highest expression in neural precursor cells prepared from E10.5 mouse embryos (lane 1). Whereas undifferentiated NCB20 neuroblastoma-brain hybrid cells showed a moderate level of expression from the HES-5 promoter (lane 2), C6 glioma and C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells exhibited low levels of expression (lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that the 5′-region of the HES-5 gene (from −1324 to +73) is able to direct specific expression in undifferentiated neural cells.Figure 5:Analysis of tissue specificity of the HES-5 promoter. A, luciferase assay. The reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of the HES-5 promoter (−1324/+73) was transfected into neural precursor cells (NPC), NCB20 neuroblastoma-brain cell hybrid, C6 glioma, and C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells using lipofectamine reagent. The relative luciferase activities of the HES-5 promoter to that of the SV40 basic promoter were measured. Each value is the average of at least four independent experiments. The CMV-βgal vector was also transfected as an internal standard to normalize the transfection efficiency. B, staining of neural precursor cells with X-gal and anti-nestin serum. 2 μg of the plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the HES-5 promoter (−1324/+73) was transfected into neural precursor cells in a 6-well plate. 48 h after the transfection, cells were fixed and stained with X-gal and anti-nestin serum. X-gal-staining indicated by arrowheads was observed only in nestin-positive (brown) neural precursor cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the neural precursor cell culture prepared from mouse embryos contained some differentiating neural cells as well as a background level of fibroblasts, we next examined whether strong expression from the HES-5 promoter occurred in neural precursor cells. The culture was transfected with a plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the HES-5 promoter and subsequently stained with X-gal. The culture was also immunostained with antiserum to nestin, a neural precursor cell-specific intermediate filament (Lendahl et al., 1990). As shown in Fig. 5B, X-gal staining (blue, arrowheads) was observed only in nestin-positive neural precursor cells, which formed aggregates. No X-gal staining was detected in differentiating neural cells, which extended processes, or fibroblasts. These results confirmed that expression from the HES-5 promoter occurred specifically in undifferentiated neural cells.To determine a regulatory element responsible for HES-5 expression, reporter plasmids of the luciferase gene under the control of various lengths of HES-5 promoter were transfected into the neural precursor cell culture. As shown in Fig. 6, deletion of the sequence between −1324 and −800 showed no obvious change (lanes 1 and 2), whereas further deletion from −800 to −453, from −453 to −248, from −248 to −179, and from −179 to −141 serially reduced expression by 20-30% each (lanes 3-6). Another deletion from −121 to −95 led to a ∼2.9-fold reduction in activity, resulting in a quite low promoter activity (lane 8). These results suggest that HES-5 expression in neural precursor cells is controlled by multiple upstream promoter regions.Figure 6:Deletion analysis of the HES-5 promoter. The luciferase reporter plasmid containing either various lengths of the HES-5 promoter (lanes 1-9), no promoter (lane 10), the SV40 basic promoter (lane 11), or the SV40 basic promoter with three repeats of the HES-5 promoter region (−120/-96) (lane 12) was transfected into neural precursor cells. The 5′- and 3′-end points of the HES-5 promoter used in the luciferase reporter plasmids are shown on the left. Open and striped boxes represent the regions upstream and downstream of the transcription initiation site, respectively. The luciferase activity of the SV40 basic promoter was taken to be 1, and the relative luciferase activity of each promoter was measured. Each value of relative luciferase activities is the average of at least four independent experiments. The CMV-βgal vector was also transfected as an internal standard to normalize the transfection efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence examination of the multiple upstream regulatory regions revealed that these regions contained multiple copies of GC stretches (see Fig. 2, underlined), raising the possibility that these GC stretches may be involved in HES-5 expression. To examine this possibility, we made an artificial promoter containing three repeats of the region between −120 and −96 linked to the SV40 basic promoter. This region (−120/-96) contained two GC stretches and showed the most efficient activation (∼2.9-fold activation) (compare lanes 7 and 8). As shown in Fig. 6, the addition of this region significantly activated transcription from the SV40 basic promoter in neural precursor cells (compare lanes 11 and 12). This enhanced activity was almost comparable to that of the intact HES-5 promoter. Because the sequence between −120 and −96 also contained a TG sequence (TTTGTG) between the two GC stretches, we next examined which sequence was responsible for the transcriptional activation. We constructed two synthetic promoters: the SV40 basic promoter with five repeats of either the GC stretch or the TG sequence. As shown in Fig. 7A, the addition of the GC stretches significantly activated transcription in neural precursor cells (lane 1), while the addition of the TG sequence exhibited no significant change (lane 2). These results suggest that the multiple GC stretches play an important role in the HES-5 promoter activity in neural precursor cells.Figure 7:Transcriptional analysis of the GC stretches of the HES-5 promoter. A, transcriptional analysis of the GC stretch and the TG sequence in neural precursor cells. The luciferase reporter gene was under the control of the SV40 basic promoter (SV40b) linked to either five repeats of GGCCGGCGCC (lane 1), five repeats of CTTTGTGC (lane 2), or no additional sequence (lane 3). Plasmids were transfected into neural precursor cells, and relative luciferase activities were measured. The luciferase activity of SV40b was taken to be 1, and relative activities were measured. B, transcriptional analysis of the GC stretches of the HES-5 promoter. Luciferase activities from the SV40 basic promoter (SV40b) (lanes 2, 4, and 6) and the SV40 basic promoter linked to five repeats of the GC stretches (GC5-SV40b) (lanes 1, 3, and 5) were measured by transfection into undifferentiated NCB20 (lanes 1 and 2), C6 (lanes 3 and 4), and C3H10T1/2 cells (lanes 5 and 6). In each cell type, the luciferase activity of SV40b was taken to be 1, and relative activities were measured. C, effect of differentiation on transcriptional activities of the HES-5 and GC5-SV40b promoters. The reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of either the HES-5 promoter (lanes 1 and 2) or GC5-SV40b promoter (lanes 3 and 4) was transfected into NCB20 cells. The cells were either kept undifferentiated in a growth medium (lanes 1 and 3) or induced to differentiate (lanes 2 and 4). The relative luciferase activity of each promoter to that of the SV40b promoter was measured. In all these experiments, each value is the average of at least four independent experiments normalized by the β-galactosidase activity of the co-transfected CMV-βgal vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To see that the multiple GC stretches also show tissue specificity, we transfected the reporter plasmid of the luciferase gene under the control of the GC stretch-containing promoter into other types of cells. As shown in Fig. 7B, the GC stretches exhibited a moderate activation in undifferentiated NCB20 neuroblastoma-brain hybrid cells (lane 1). However, these stretches showed only a weak activation in C6 glioma (lane 3) and C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells (lane 5). Thus, these results suggest that the GC stretch can act as a positive element specifically in undifferentiated neural cells.NCB20 cells can differentiate into neuron-like cells under a low serum medium with dibutyryl cAMP. We thus examined whether HES-5 promoter activity changes in NCB20 after induction of differentiation. As shown in Fig. 7C, HES-5 promoter activity was reduced when differentiation was induced (lane 2), agreeing well with the observation that HES-5 expression decreases as neural differentiation proceeds. Furthermore, the multiple GC stretch-containing promoter also exhibited lower expression when differentiation was induced (lane 4). These results thus further support the notion that the GC stretch activates transcription specifically in undifferentiated neural cells.DNA Binding Analysis with the GC StretchTo investigate whether a GC stretch-binding protein exists in neural precursor cells, we next performed a gel mobility shift assay by using the GC stretch DNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 8, two bands were detected with nuclear extracts of neural precursor cells (lane 2, arrowheads). Both bands were competed by an excess amount of the cold GC stretch DNA (lane 4) but not by an excess amount of the cold mutant DNA which contained the AT sequence (lane 3), indicating that both bands represent specific binding. The upper band was also detected in the liver nuclear extract (lane 5), suggesting that the upper complex may be formed by a ubiquitous factor such as Sp1 (Kadonaga et al., 1986). However, the lower band was detected only in the extracts of the neural precursor cells. These results raise the possibility that the protein of the lower band may be involved in neural precursor cell-specific expression through the multiple GC stretches.Figure 8:Gel mobility shift analysis. The 32P-labeled synthetic probe containing three repeats of 5′-GGCCGGCGCC-3′ sequence was mixed with 4 μg each of nuclear extracts of neural precursor cells (NPC, lanes 2-4) and E13.5 mouse liver (lane 5). Reactions were carried out in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Lane 1 shows the probe only. Lanes 3 and 4 show the reactions with 25 ng each of the mutant competitor (AT, three repeats of 5′-GGAAATTGCC-3′) and the wild-type competitor (GC, three repeats of 5′-GGCCGGCGCC-3′), respectively. The two retarded bands are indicated by arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONNeural Precursor Cell-specific Expression of HES-5In this study, we showed that HES-5 is specifically expressed in the developing nervous system. This specific expression is directed by the multiple GC stretches present in the HES-5 promoter. Furthermore, we detected a specific GC stretch-binding protein in neural precursor cells. These results suggest that a neural precursor cell-specific factor regulates transcription of the HES-5 gene by interacting with the GC stretch sequences.The GC stretch sequence used in this study was GGCCGGCGCC. Multiple copies of the same or quite similar GC sequences are present in the HES-5 promoter (Fig. 2, underlined). The consensus sequence would be GGCCSGCGCC (S = G or C) although we do not have any evidence that all the GC stretches present in the HES-5 promoter show neural precursor cell-specific transcriptional activation. These GC stretches are very similar to the GC box (GGCGGG), and thus it is possible that they are recognized by Sp1, a ubiquitous transcriptional activator that regulates housekeeping genes (Kadonaga et al., 1986). Transient transfection assays showed that the addition of the GC stretches to a heterologous promoter resulted in a weak activation in cells other than undifferentiated neural cells. Thus, it seems that, at least in some cells, the GC stretches of the HES-5 promoter are recognized by a ubiquitous factor such as Sp1 when transfected transiently. In this regard, the slowly migrating band detected by the GC stretch probe on gel mobility shift analysis seems to exist ubiquitously and therefore could represent Sp1. However, HES-5 is not expressed in non-neural cells even though Sp1 is ubiquitously present (Kadonaga et al., 1986). Thus, in physiological conditions Sp1 may not interact with these GC stretches, or transcriptional repressors could antagonize the activity of Sp1. Therefore, a neural precursor cell-specific transcriptional activator, but not Sp1, may be responsible for the GC stretch-mediated HES-5 gene expression. We speculate that the neural precursor cell-specific protein detected on gel mobility shift analysis (the lower band) is the most likely candidate for the specific activator. Because HES-5 is an early neural-specific marker, the GC stretch-binding protein could be involved in early neural differentiation or neural fate determination.The addition of three repeats of the region between −120 and −96 (a total of six repeats of GC stretches) showed more than 10-fold activation in neural precursor cells (Fig. 6, compare lanes 11 and 12), while the addition of five repeats of the GC stretches led to about 5-fold activation (Fig. 7A, compare lanes 1 and 3). This different efficiency in activation could be due to the difference in number of the GC stretches, but the spacing between each GC stretch may be also important.Down-regulation of HES-5 Expression in the Course of Neural DifferentiationPreviously, we showed that HES-5 expression in the nervous system is down-regulated in the course of neural differentiation (Akazawa et al., 1992). In NCB20 cells, transcription from the intact HES-5 promoter as well as the synthetic promoter containing the multiple GC stretches was also reduced when differentiation was induced in low serum with dibutyryl cAMP (Fig. 7C). Thus, these results suggest that the down-regulation of HES-5 expression in the course of differentiation may be mediated by the GC stretches. This down-regulation in NCB20 cells is not the result of the direct effect of cAMP because transcription was also reduced when differentiation was induced only by low serum (data not shown). One simple mechanism for the down-regulation would be that the GC stretch-binding activator decreases as neural differentiation proceeds. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether the amount of the GC stretch-binding protein correlates with the level of HES-5 expression.In the upstream region (between −1.6 and −0.7 kb) of the HES-5 gene, there are five N box sequences (data not shown). Our previous data suggest that HES-5 represses transcription by binding to the N box (Akazawa et al., 1992). Thus, HES-5 may negatively regulate its own expression by binding to these N boxes. These results raise another possibility that down-regulation of HES-5 in the course of neurogenesis is mediated by negative autoregulation through the N box. However, when the HES-5 expression vector was cotransfected with the HES-5 promoter-directed luciferase plasmid, only a weak negative autoregulation was observed (∼25% reduction, data not shown). Thus, it remains to be determined whether negative autoregulation of HES-5 occurs in vivo.Possible Functions of HES-5 in Neural DifferentiationWhereas HES-5 acts as a transcriptional repressor, its exact function in neurogenesis is not yet known. Another member of HES family, HES-1, is also a transcriptional repressor, and its expression pattern in the nervous system is quite similar to that of HES-5. Persistent expression of HES-1 prevents neuronal and glial differentiation, indicating that HES-1 is a negative regulator of neural differentiation (Ishibashi et al., 1994). Thus, it is possible that HES-5 also acts as a negative regulator of neurogenesis. However, whereas HES-1 efficiently antagonizes the activity of E47, a ubiquitous activator with a bHLH domain, HES-5 only partially antagonizes it (Akazawa et al., 1992). Thus, it is likely that HES-5 and HES-1 target different factors. Further studies about the functions of HES-5 as well as the mechanism of HES-5 expression will help understand the molecular nature of mammalian neurogenesis. INTRODUCTIONIn the developing mammalian central nervous system (CNS), ( 1The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemHLHhelix-loop-helixbHLHbasic HLHkbkilobasesbpbase pairsEembryonic dayRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction.) neural precursor cells are proliferating in the ventricular zone next to the lumen (Jacobson, 1991). When their fate is determined to become neurons or glial cells, these precursor cells stop cell division, migrate out of the ventricular zone, and undergo terminal differentiation. The underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet well understood, but recent evidence suggests that transcription factors with a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain may be involved in these developmental processes (Johnson et al., 1990; Sasai et al., 1992; Guillemot et al., 1993; Ishibashi et al., 1994). For example, null mutation of the basic HLH (bHLH) factor MASH1, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila achaete-scute complex (Johnson et al., 1990), results in severe loss of olfactory and autonomic neurons (Guillemot et al., 1993), suggesting that MASH1 is a positive regulator of neurogenesis. HES-1, another bHLH factor structurally related to the product of the Drosophila pair-rule gene hairy (Sasai et al., 1992), is a negative regulator of mammalian neurogenesis (Ishibashi et al., 1994). Thus, the balance between the positive and negative regulatory factors may be important for normal neurogenesis.Recent studies show that many other HLH factors, such as other members of HES family (Akazawa et al., 1992; Sasai et al., 1992; Ishibashi et al., 1993), Id-1 (Duncan et al., 1992), and Id-2 (Neuman et al., 1993), are expressed in the developing nervous system, suggesting that they are also involved in neural differentiation. Among these HLH factors, HES-5 has a unique transcriptional activity. Unlike most other bHLH factors, HES-5 does not bind to the CANNTG sequence (the E box), but it binds to the consensus sequence CACNAG (the N box) and represses transcription (Akazawa et al., 1992). Furthermore, like Id proteins, HES-5 also represses E box-dependent transcription by preventing other bHLH activators from binding to the E box (Benezra et al., 1990; Sun et al., 1991; Christy et al., 1991; Akazawa et al., 1992). Thus, HES-5 represses transcription in two different manners, depending on the motifs.HES-5 also shows a unique expression pattern in late embryos (Akazawa et al., 1992): 1) HES-5 is expressed exclusively in the developing nervous system, and 2) HES-5 is expressed at high levels throughout the ventricular zone where neural precursor cells are present, but the level decreases as neural differentiation proceeds. Thus, HES-5 expression correlates well to the undifferentiated stages of the neural cells. Here, we first examined HES-5 expression patterns in earlier embryos and showed that HES-5 is specific to the developing nervous system. To understand the molecular mechanism of this neural precursor cell-specific expression, we cloned mouse HES-5 gene and characterized its promoter. We found that the upstream region of the HES-5 gene directs specific expression in neural precursor cells. Further promoter analysis identified a regulatory element that activates undifferentiated neural-specific expression on a heterologous promoter."

Most peptides presented by class I molecules are derived from endogenously synthesized proteins, whereas most peptides presented by class II molecules are from exogenous sources. This functional dichotomy can largely be achieved by the preferential intracellular association of the invariant chain (Ii) with MHC class II molecules, which may inhibit binding of endogenous peptides to class II molecules and direct them to endocytic compartments where extracellularly derived peptides can be sampled. Here, we show that Ii also can associate with a subset of MHC class I molecules and direct them to endocytic compartments. Ii was coprecipitated with class I molecules after lysis of human lymphocytes in mild detergent such as 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid or digitonin, and the association was more clearly visualized by the use of dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate], a homobifunctional chemical cross-linker. The class I•Ii complex was reconstituted in Ii negative cells by transfection of corresponding cDNA clones and was found to be transported through the Golgi to acidic endocytic compartments.

This functional difference is believed to be explained by the capability of class II molecules to bind intracellularly the invariant chain (Ii), which directs them to endocytic vesicles where they encounter exogenously derived peptides(4Teyton L.

Ii is a nonpolymorphic type II transmembrane glycoprotein that exists in humans in four forms, designated according to their molecular sizes as p31, p33, p41, and p43 (note that p31 and p33 are referred to as p33 and p35, respectively, by some authors)(7Claesson L.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These different forms of Ii are generated by the use of alternative translation initiation codons and alternative mRNA splicing(9Strubin M. Berte C. Mach B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues 12-15 (measured from the Ii p31 N-terminal cytoplasmic tail), which are shared among all the four forms of Ii, have been identified as critical residues for endosomal targeting(10Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Assembly of MHC class II α and β chains with Ii occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Newly synthesized Ii associates as a trimer with calnexin(11Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), an ER resident molecular chaperone(12Hochstenbach F. David V. Watkins S. Brenner M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Newly synthesized class II α and β chains also bind to calnexin and dissociate when a complete nonamer complex, containing three αβ dimers and an Ii trimer, is formed(11Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the class II•Ii complex exits the ER and is transported through the Golgi to a specialized endocytic compartment, distinct from early/late endosomes or dense lysosomes, where Ii is proteolytically cleaved and class II molecules acquire antigenic peptides of exogenous origin(15Peters P.J.

Wandinger-Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Following dissociation of Ii and binding of peptides, class II molecules are transported to the cell surface for recognition by CD4+ T cells(20Germain R.N. Hendrix L.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized class I heavy chains also bind to calnexin during their biosynthesis and assembly(21Degen E. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Sugita M. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated in human cells that, following association with β2m, class I heavy chains dissociate from calnexin and subsequently bind peptides of endogenous origin(22Sugita M. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These peptides are transported from the cytoplasm by TAP molecules, and their association with nascent class I chains in the ER might be facilitated by physical association of the class I heavy chain•β2m heterodimer with TAP molecules (23Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Fully assembled class I complexes leave the ER and are transported through the Golgi to the cell surface without intersecting the endocytic route(24Neefjes J.J. Stollorz V. Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Segregation of class I and class II takes place in the trans-Golgi reticulum, where class I molecules traffic to the plasma membrane while class II molecules are sorted to endocytic compartments(15Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Thus, the different origin of peptides presented by class I and class II molecules may reflect different intracellular pathways through which these molecules traffic in the cell, which apparently result from the ability of Ii to direct class II molecules away from the default secretory pathway by virtue of endosomal targeting/retention signals(25Hämmerling G.J. Moreno J. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 337-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. Immunol.

Accumulating evidence has shown that the dichotomy in presentation of antigen from endogenous and exogenous origin is not absolute. Some endogenous antigens can be presented by class II molecules(28Nuchtern J.G. Biddison W.E. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1990; 343: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Chen B.P.

Nature. 1992; 357: 702-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas exogenous antigens are in some cases presented by class I molecules(31Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 32Rock K.L. Gamble S. Rothstein L. Science. 1990; 249: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 33Pfeifer J.D. Wick M.J.

In this paper, we show that Ii can associate with a subset of class I molecules and direct them into acidic endosomal compartments. This observation suggests a mechanism that could explain how exogenous antigens can be presented by class I molecules and how self class I-derived peptides gain access to endosomal compartments for binding to class II molecules.

Anti-human calnexin antibody, AF8, was generated in our laboratory(12Hochstenbach F. David V. Watkins S. Brenner M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Per Peterson (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). HLA-B2705 cDNA as a 1.1-kilobase SalI-HindIII insert in phagemid pT7T3-18H was provided by Dr. William Biddison (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A SalI-HindIII fragment of HLA-B27 cDNA was first inserted into pBluescript SK to generate a SalI-XbaI fragment, which was then subcloned into pSRα-neo(43Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfection of HeLa cells with HLA-B27 cDNA in pSRα-neo either with pCMU4 vector or with Ii p31 cDNA in pCMU4 by the calcium phosphate precipitation method(44Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), HLA-B27-positive cells with or without Ii p31 expression were cloned from the G418 (0.5 mg/ml, Sigma)-resistant cell population. Metabolic labeling of cells with [35S]methionine was performed as described(22Sugita M. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled cells were lysed in 0.3% CHAPS in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8, either in the presence or absence of 0.1 mM dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] (DSP) (Pierce) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Chemical cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 10 mM glycine. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were precleared overnight at 4°C with Staphylococcusaureus Cowan strain I (Pansorbin, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Immunoprecipitation was performed with indicated mAbs, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). Pellets were washed 5 times with 0.3% CHAPS in Tris-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 × sample buffer containing 1.5% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min to cleave DSP. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions. The gels were fluorographed using Me2SO/2,5-diphenyloxazole, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR film. For peptide mapping, the gel slices containing Ii p31 after separation on an SDS-PAGE gel were overlaid with 0.5 μg of V8 protease (Promega, Madison, WI) and were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) digestion was performed as described(45Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). HeLa transfectant cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% digitonin (Aldrich), and incubated with mAb ME.1 followed by rhodamine B-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Tago, Burlingame, CA). After blocking free antigen binding sites of the goat antibodies with isotype-matched mouse control antibodies, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated PIN.1 antibody. In some experiments, transfectant cells, incubated for 2 h with 1 mg/ml of Texas red-conjugated ovalbumin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), were labeled with mAb ME.1 followed by detection with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Tago). The cells were viewed and photographed using a Nikon Optiphot-2 fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY) with FITC and rhodamine filter sets. T2 is a mutant cell line with a homozygous deletion in the MHC on chromosome 6, including all functional class II genes and the TAP-1 and TAP-2 peptide transporter genes. Thus, T2 cells completely lack the expression of MHC class II molecules and have impaired assembly of class I molecules due to restricted availability of peptides in the ER resulting in reduced class I expression on the cell surface. Class I heavy chains that are assembled with β2m were detected either by immunoprecipitation with conformation-dependent antibody, W6/32, or by coimmunoprecipitation with β2m-specific BBM.1 antibody (Fig. 1, lanes6 and 4, respectively). We observed that mAb BBM.1 immunoprecipitated 12-kDa β2m and 43-kDa class I heavy chain and coprecipitated a scant amount of 33-kDa protein barely detected on this gel exposure (see arrow, Fig. 1, lane4). This association was more clearly visualized by the use of the thiol-cleavable, bifunctional chemical cross-linker, DSP (Fig. 1, lane10). Radiolabeled protein that comigrated exactly with the 33-kDa protein was also detected by coimmunoprecipitation with the anti-calnexin AF8 antibody and with mAb HC10, which recognizes β2m-unassociated class I heavy chains (see arrow, Fig. 1, lanes8 and 11, respectively). mAb PIN.1 is an anti-Ii antibody that was generated by immunization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a sequence located in the cytoplasmic domain of all forms of Ii (residues 12-28, measured from the Ii p31 N terminus)(42Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3478-3482PubMed Google Scholar). Ii p31 is the most abundant form, and it was visualized prominently by immunoprecipitation with mAb PIN.1 (Fig. 2A, lane4). Importantly, the 33-kDa protein associated with class I (Fig. 2A, lanes2 and 3) or calnexin (lane1) comigrated with Ii p31. The identity of this 33-kDa protein with Ii p31 was confirmed by peptide mapping with V8 protease. The peptide map of either class I-associated or calnexin-associated 33-kDa protein was exactly the same as that of Ii p31 (Fig. 2B). Thus, we concluded that Ii p31 was associated with class I molecules in T2 cells. To rule out the possibility that this novel association might be achieved only in class II negative, mutant T2 cells with impaired class I assembly, we examined wild type T1 cells. Unlike T2 cells, T1 cells have normal class I assembly, which was manifested by the appearance of abundant assembled class I heavy chains detected with mAb W6/32 (Fig. 3, lane4) and fewer β2m-unassociated heavy chains detected with mAb HC10 (lane3). Importantly, mAb W6/32 coimmunoprecipitated a protein comigrating with Ii p31 (Fig. 3, lane4, shown with an arrow). The identity of this class I-associated protein to Ii p31 was confirmed by resolution on nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis/SDS-PAGE two-dimensional gels (not shown). This association was also observed in a human B cell line, JY (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that the association of Ii p31 with class I molecules was not attributable to the abnormal class I assembly in T2 cells but was a more general phenomenon that also occurred in cells with normal class I assembly and class II expression. In order to confirm the association of Ii p31 with class I molecules and to determine the intracellular transport and distribution of the complex, we reconstituted the association in HeLa cells, an Ii-negative cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line. HeLa cells were transfected with an HLA-B27 cDNA with or without an Ii p31 cDNA. After selection with G418, stable transfectant clones expressing either HLA-B27 alone (HeLaB27 mock) or both HLA-B27 and Ii p31 (HeLaB27Iip31) were obtained. No PIN.1-reactive material was immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled HeLaB27 mock cells (Fig. 4, lane5), and class I-associated 33-kDa protein was not detected in these cells (lanes2-4). In contrast, transfected Ii p31 was abundantly expressed in HeLaB27Iip31 cells (Fig. 4, lane10, shown at an arrow), and the association of Ii p31 with class I molecules could be demonstrated in these cells (lanes7-9, see arrow). The intracellular transport of the class I•Ii p31 complex was analyzed by pulse-chase experiments in which the susceptibility of the Ii to endo H digestion was examined. These experiments were performed either in the presence or absence of concanamycin B, a vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor(46Yilla M. Tan A. Ito K. Miwa K. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19092-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 10-min [35S]methionine pulse labeling of HeLaB27Iip31 cells, endo H-sensitive (S) radiolabeled Ii p31 decreased during the chase period, and endo H-resistant (R) Ii p31 appeared after a chase of 60 min (Fig. 5A, upperpanel). This endo H-resistant form of Ii p31 disappeared after a chase of 240 min in the absence of concanamycin B, while in its presence, persistence of the endo H resistant species was observed (Fig. 5A, lowerpanel). This could be explained by concanamycin B-mediated, impaired acidification of vacuolar organelles such as endosomes(47Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where Ii is proteolytically degraded by proteases that require an acidic environment for their activity(48Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 49Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3150-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 50Maric M.A. Taylor M.D. Blum J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that if the class I•Ii p31 complex exits the ER and is transported to acidic compartments, class I molecules might remain associated with Ii p31 that acquires resistance to endo H, and the association should be prolonged in the presence of concanamycin B. To examine this possibility, immunoprecipitation with mAb W6/32, specific for assembled class I molecules, was performed at each chase time (Fig. 5B). This experiment revealed that class I molecules associated with an endo H-sensitive form of Ii p31 (approximately 33 kDa) during earlier chase periods, and this became an endo H-resistant form of Ii p31 (35 kDa) after a 1-h chase (Fig. 5B, lanes1-4). Moreover, prolonged association of class I molecules with the endo H-resistant species occurred in the presence of concanamycin B (Fig. 5B, lanes5-8). Thus, we concluded that, following assembly of class I molecules with Ii in the ER, the complex left the ER and was transported through the Golgi to acidic compartments in which acidification depended on the function of vacuolar proton ATPases. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out to determine the subcellular localization of class I•Ii p31 complex. Staining of permeabilized HeLa transfectant cells expressing both HLA-B27 and Ii p31 (HeLaB27Iip31) with an HLA-B27-specific antibody revealed the presence of HLA-B27 in large vesicles as well as on the cell surface (Fig. 6A, left). In double-label experiments, the Ii-specific PIN.1 antibody also stained these vesicles (Fig. 6A, right), which indicated that HLA-B27 and Ii were colocalized in these intracellular compartments. These vesicles observed when Ii p31 is expressed in Ii-negative cells have been shown to correspond to endosomal compartments(5Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 51Romagnoli P. Layet C. Yewdell J. Bakke O. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We examined if these vesicular structures belonged to the endocytic system by incubating HeLaB27Iip31 cells in media containing Texas red-conjugated ovalbumin. Exogenously added ovalbumin is endocytosed into the cell and transported intracellularly via endocytic pathways so that endocytic compartments are labeled with Texas red(52Swanson J. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 29: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). With this method, the large vesicles were clearly visualized (Fig. 6B, right) and, importantly, were costained with the HLA-B27-specific antibody (Fig. 6B, left). Such a striking colocalization of HLA-B27 with endocytosed ovalbumin was not observed in Ii-negative HeLa cells (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that class I•Ii p31 complexes were transported into endocytic compartments in these transfectant cells. Using direct biochemical analyses of human lymphocytes (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:) and reconstitution by transfection in HeLa cells (Fig. 4), we have demonstrated an association between class I molecules and Ii. The association of class II molecules with Ii is fairly strong and is maintained in detergents such as 1% Triton X-100(11Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, the association of class I molecules with Ii was too weak at least in vitro to be maintained in 0.5% Triton X-100 (data not shown). We observed that a small amount of Ii was coimmunoprecipitated with class I molecules in milder detergents such as 0.3% CHAPS (Fig. 1) and 1% digitonin (not shown), and we succeeded in visualizing the association more clearly in a reproducible way by the use of low concentrations of the chemical cross-linker DSP (Fig. 1). Previously, mouse class I heavy chains were expressed artificially in human cells, and an association with human Ii was reported(53Cerundolo V. Elliott T. Elvin J. Bastin J. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate the presence of class I•Ii complexes under physiological conditions in untransfected human cell lines. Moreover, we show that the class I•Ii complex remained assembled in vivo during transport from the ER, through the Golgi, to endocytic compartments, which was evidenced by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 5) and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. 6). Thus, the association of Ii with class I molecules is stable in vivo and results in sorting of this pool of class I molecules out of the direct secretory pathway. What is the biological significance of this association? The colocalization of class I•Ii complex with endocytosed ovalbumin leads one to consider the possible involvement of this complex in presentation of exogenous antigens by class I molecules. Several reports have shown that exogenous antigens can be presented by class I molecules to T cells both in vivo and in vitro(31Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 32Rock K.L. Gamble S. Rothstein L. Science. 1990; 249: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 33Pfeifer J.D. Wick M.J. Roberts R.L. Findlay K. Normark S.J. Harding C.V. Nature. 1993; 361: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 34Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Clark K. Benacerraf B. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4942-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that cells capable of this presentation are phagocytic macrophages, and indeed phagocytosis by these cells of exogenous antigens, such as bacteria or ovalbumin linked to beads, and transport of these antigens to endosomal compartments are critical for antigen presentation(33Pfeifer J.D. Wick M.J. Roberts R.L. Findlay K. Normark S.J. Harding C.V. Nature. 1993; 361: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 34Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Clark K. Benacerraf B. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4942-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We speculate that Ii may transport a subset of class I molecules, as well as class II molecules, to endocytic compartments, where Ii is cleaved and class I molecules acquire peptides derived from endocytosed exogenous antigens. Although a recently identified compartment where peptide loading onto class II molecules takes place does not contain class I molecules, a small amount of class I molecules are found in endosomes in a human B cell line, JY(15Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), in which no internalization from the cell surface is detected for class I molecules(24Neefjes J.J. Stollorz V. Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine definitively the extent to which class I molecules (colocalized with Ii and with class II molecules) are present in endocytic compartments. Another possible function of class I•Ii complexes is to provide the source of self class I-derived peptides for binding to class II molecules. Analysis of naturally processed peptides bound to HLA-DR1 shows that self HLA-A2 derived peptides as well as those derived from Ii are found in association with DR1 molecules(54Chicz R.M. Urban R.G. Lane W.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Vignali D.A.A. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), and indeed MHC class II molecules have been shown to present endogenous class I-derived peptides to cytotoxic T cells in a Brefeldin A-sensitive manner(29Chen B.P. Madrigal A. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the limited internalization of class I molecules from the cell surface, Ii-mediated transport of class I molecules to endocytic compartments might be crucial to the supply of certain self antigens (such as MHC class I proteins) for presentation by class II molecules. Finally, based on these results and previous studies from our laboratory(22Sugita M. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we believe that calnexin may act as a molecular chaperone in the assembly of class I•Ii complexes. Calnexin has been shown to play an important role in the assembly of both class I and class II molecules(11Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Degen E. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Sugita M. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 55Schreiber K.L. Bell M.P. Huntoon C.J. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. McKean D.J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the case of class II molecules, calnexin binds newly synthesized α, β and Ii chains and remains associated with assembling intermediate complexes until the complete nonamer, containing three αβ dimers and the Ii trimer, is formed (11Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the case of class I assembly, we recently showed that newly synthesized class I heavy chains bind to calnexin and that association with β2m triggers heavy chains to dissociate from calnexin(22Sugita M. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since the interaction between class I heavy chains and Ii was also observed in β2m deficient Daudi cells (data not shown), we speculate that calnexin may mediate association of a subset of class I heavy chains with Ii, and that, following association with β2m, class I heavy chain•β2m•Ii complex may dissociate from calnexin. These findings potentially indicate stronger parallels between the assembly of class II molecules and a subset of class I molecules than previously have been recognized.

Incubation of plasma concentrations of factor V with monocytes (5 × 106/ml) resulted in the time-dependent cleavage of the 330-kDa protein. Activation occurred via several high molecular mass intermediates (≥200 kDa) to yield peptides of 150, 140, 120, 94, 91, 82, and 80 kDa, which paralleled the expression of cofactor activity. The cleavage pattern observed differed from that obtained with either thrombin or factor Xa as an activator. The incubation time required to achieve full cofactor activity was dependent on the monocyte donor and ranged from 10 min to 1 h and was consistently slightly lower than that obtained with thrombin-activated factor Va. Cofactor activity was not diminished by additional incubation. The cofactor activity generated bound to the monocyte such that a competent prothrombinase complex was formed at the monocyte membrane surface. Furthermore, within 5 min of factor V addition to monocytes, near maximal cofactor activity (∼70%) was bound and expressed on the monocyte membrane. The proteolytic activity toward factor V was associated primarily with the monocyte membrane, as little proteolytic activity was released into the cell-free supernatant. Proteolytic activity was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. However, the inhibitor profile obtained with α1-antiproteinase inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin, and α2-macroglobulin suggested membrane-bound forms of elastase and cathepsin G were mediating, in large part, the proteolysis observed. These data were confirmed using purified preparations of both proteases and a specific anti-human leukocyte elastase antibody. Thus, expression of these proteases at the monocyte surface may contribute to thrombin generation at extravascular tissue sites by catalyzing the activation of the essential cofactor, factor Va, which binds to the monocyte surface and supports the factor Xa-catalyzed activation of prothrombin.

https://openalex.org/W2028736279,"PC2 and PC3, which is also known as PC1, are subtilisin-like proteases that are involved in the intracellular processing of prohormones and proneuropeptides. Both enzymes are synthesized as propolypeptides that undergo proteolytic maturation within the secretory pathway. An in vitro translation/translocation system from Xenopus egg extracts was used to investigate mechanisms in the maturation of pro-PC3 and pro-PC2. Pro-PC3 underwent rapid (t < 10 min) processing of the 88-kDa propolypeptide at the sequence RSKR83 to generate the 80-kDa active form of the enzyme. This processing was blocked when the active site aspartate was changed to asparagine, suggesting that an autocatalytic mechanism was involved. In this system, processing of pro-PC3 was optimal between pH 7.0 and 8.0 and was not dependent on additional calcium. These results are consistent with pro-PC3 maturation occurring at an early stage in the secretory pathway, possibly within the endoplasmic reticulum, where the pH would be close to neutral and the calcium concentration less than that observed in later compartments. Processing of pro-PC2 in the Xenopus egg extract was much slower than that of pro-PC3 (t = 8 h). It exhibited a pH optimum of 5.5-6.0 and was dependent on calcium (K0.5 = 2-4 mM). The enzymatic properties of pro-PC2 processing were similar to that of the mature enzyme. Further studies using mutant pro-PC2 constructs suggested that cleavage of pro-PC2 was catalyzed by the mature 68-kDa PC2 molecule.

https://openalex.org/W1984753974,"T-DNA processing during agroinfection of plants is initiated by site- and strand-specific incision at the T-DNA border sequences of the Ti plasmid. Two proteins are required for this reaction: VirD2 (49.6 kDa), catalyzing a site-specific cleaving-joining reaction on single-stranded DNA in vitro (Pansegrau, W., Schoumacher, F., Hohn, B., and Lanka, E.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 11538-11542), and VirD1 (16.1 kDa), an accessory protein required for VirD2-mediated specific cleavage of double-stranded DNA. Following efficient overproduction, VirD1 was isolated in active form from inclusion bodies and purified to near homogeneity. The protein was applied together with purified VirD2 protein for specific cleavage of double-stranded T-DNA border sequences in vitro. The reaction proceeds on negative superhelical DNA and requires Mg2+ ions. Relaxed DNA is not cleaved. The 5′ terminus of the broken DNA strand is covalently associated with protein, most probably VirD2, and the cleavage site is located at the same position that is found in vivo, indicating that the in vitro reaction mimics the one that takes place in induced agrobacteria. Relaxation of plasmid DNA occurs only upon addition of protein denaturants, suggesting that the DNA in the VirD1/VirD2 complex is topologically constrained by strong protein-DNA interactions. The characteristics of the VirD1/VirD2-mediated cleavage reaction strongly resemble those observed with relaxosomes of IncP plasmids involved in initiation of transfer DNA replication during bacterial conjugation. T-DNA processing during agroinfection of plants is initiated by site- and strand-specific incision at the T-DNA border sequences of the Ti plasmid. Two proteins are required for this reaction: VirD2 (49.6 kDa), catalyzing a site-specific cleaving-joining reaction on single-stranded DNA in vitro (Pansegrau, W., Schoumacher, F., Hohn, B., and Lanka, E.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 11538-11542), and VirD1 (16.1 kDa), an accessory protein required for VirD2-mediated specific cleavage of double-stranded DNA. Following efficient overproduction, VirD1 was isolated in active form from inclusion bodies and purified to near homogeneity. The protein was applied together with purified VirD2 protein for specific cleavage of double-stranded T-DNA border sequences in vitro. The reaction proceeds on negative superhelical DNA and requires Mg2+ ions. Relaxed DNA is not cleaved. The 5′ terminus of the broken DNA strand is covalently associated with protein, most probably VirD2, and the cleavage site is located at the same position that is found in vivo, indicating that the in vitro reaction mimics the one that takes place in induced agrobacteria. Relaxation of plasmid DNA occurs only upon addition of protein denaturants, suggesting that the DNA in the VirD1/VirD2 complex is topologically constrained by strong protein-DNA interactions. The characteristics of the VirD1/VirD2-mediated cleavage reaction strongly resemble those observed with relaxosomes of IncP plasmids involved in initiation of transfer DNA replication during bacterial conjugation."

The results shown indicate that the thiolate ion detected at 229 nm should be assigned exclusively to Cys-47. The contribution of Lys-54 to the activation of Cys-47 is assessed by the spectral properties of the K54A mutant enzyme.

Among several enzymes catalyzing the conversion of PGH2 to PGD2 (for review, see (4Urade Y. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. J.

It has been recently demonstrated that a major protein constituent of human cerebrospinal fluid, classically termed β-trace, is identical to PGD synthase(8Hoffmann A. Conradt H.S. Gross G. Nimtz M.

Concurrently, sleep of unrestrained rats has been found to be inhibited by the intracerebroventricular administration of selenocompounds(10Matsumura H. Takahata R. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9046-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which inhibit the rat brain PGD synthase activity without affecting the activities of three other enzymes in the arachidonate cascade, GSH-requiring PGD synthase, PGF synthase, and 11-keto PGD2 reductase(11Islam F.

Furthermore, when PGD2 was infused into the subarachnoid space near the ventral surface of the rostral basal forebrain, the sleep-promoting effect of PGD2 in rats was found to be more remarkable than the intracerebroventricular administration or the infusion into the brain parenchyma(12Matsumura H.

A homology search in data bases of protein primary structure revealed that the enzyme is a member of the lipocalin superfamily(15Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O.

Brew K. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). PGD synthase is the only known exception, being an enzyme rather than a lipophilic ligand-carrier protein. Based on the observed sequence homology, the enzyme was deduced to form an eight- or nine-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel structure with a hydrophobic pocket in which Cys65 is located(15Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4020-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Among members of the lipocalin family, the cysteine residue is conserved only in rat and human brain PGD synthases and in a major secretory protein from amphibian choroid plexus(21Achen M.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23170-23174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter of which has the highest homology to the enzyme. Therefore, Cys65 has been assigned to be a putative active site of this enzyme(15Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we investigated the structural and functional significance of cysteine residues of GSH-independent PGD synthase by site-specific mutagenesis and chemical modification. Our results demonstrate that Cys65 is an essential thiol of the enzyme and that both the intrinsic and extrinsic sulfhydryl groups are necessary for the catalysis effected by this enzyme. The reaction mechanism of this enzyme is also proposed. An EcoRI insert (∼0.8 kilobase pairs) from a λgt 11 clone, which contains a full-length cDNA of rat brain PGD synthase composed of 189 amino acid residues (M61900)(15Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M.

The vector construct was then used to infect E. coli JM109. Transformants carrying the cDNA insert in the correct orientation were selected by a restriction enzyme analysis of the plasmid DNA with both BamHI and PstI. The plasmid was cleaved with BamHI/SphI and then partially digested with exonuclease III at 25°C for various periods of time (4-20 min). The digested plasmid was incubated with Mung bean nuclease followed by T4 polymerase, self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Kilo-Sequence deletion kit, Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan), and then employed for infection of E. coli. The deletion mutants with a correct coding frame were immunoscreened with polyclonal antibodies against PGD synthase purified from rat brain (3Pentreath V.W. Rees K. Owolabi O.A. Philip K.A. Doua F.

The C-terminal truncated mutants were produced by introducing a stop codon (TAA) into the desired positions of the cDNA and removing the downstream coding sequence. The site-specific mutagenesis was achieved by nucleotide replacement of the codon for Cys to that of Ala (GCC) or Ser (TCT). The mutated cDNAs were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction (22Higuchi R. Innis M. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols; A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Orland, FL1990: 177-183Google Scholar) with primers of 25-30 base pairs long that contained the replaced codon in a center portion. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing by the dideoxynucleic acid sequencing method(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). E. coli transfected with the reconstructed plasmid were cultured at 37°C overnight in 500 ml of LB medium in the presence of 2.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested, sonicated at 4°C in a 10-fold volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The protein in the supernatant was precipitated in the presence of 80% saturated ammonium sulfate, redissolved in 15 ml of the buffer solution containing 10 mM DTT, and applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (bed volume, 500 ml) equilibrated beforehand with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. The fractions containing the enzyme were collected and adjusted to pH 4.5 by the addition of acetic acid. After centrifugation to remove denatured proteins, the supernatant was loaded onto an S-Sepharose column (bed volume, 30 ml) in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5) containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT. The column was washed and then eluted with an NaCl gradient (0-0.8 M). The oxidized isoforms of the enzyme were purified in the absence of DTT by the same procedures as described above. The elution profile of the enzyme was monitored by measuring the enzyme activity and immunoblotting analysis as described below. The PGD synthase activity was measured by incubation at 25°C for 1 min with [1-14C]PGH2 (final concentration, 40 μM) in 50 μl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence of 1 mM DTT unless otherwise stated(3Pentreath V.W. Rees K. Owolabi O.A. Philip K.A. Doua F. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1990; 84: 795-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). [1-14C]PGH2 was prepared from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (2.20 GBq/mmol; DuPont NEN) as described previously(3Pentreath V.W. Rees K. Owolabi O.A. Philip K.A. Doua F. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Bensadoun and Weinstein(25Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, E. coli lysates or the purified recombinant enzyme were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) after solubilization with 1% SDS in the presence or absence of 1%β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were immunostained with polyclonal rabbit anti-rat brain PGD synthase antibodies (3Pentreath V.W. Rees K. Owolabi O.A. Philip K.A. Doua F. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1990; 84: 795-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). CD spectra were recorded on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscope, Tokyo, Japan) with the sample in a 1-mm path length cuvette at 10°C. The spectrometer was calibrated with ammonium d-(+)-10-camphor sulfonate at 290.5 nm and with d-(-)-pantoyllactone at 219 nm. The mean residue ellipticity, Q, which has the units of deg cm2 dmol-1, was calculated by using a molar absorption coefficient of the enzyme, ɛ280, of 25,131 M-1 cm-1. The content of the secondary structure components was calculated by the method of Provencher and Glöckner(26Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). A given amount of the purified enzyme was incubated at 25°C for 5 min with various amounts of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA. After incubation, the reaction mixture was divided into two halves. One half was used for determining free sulfhydryl content of the enzyme after incubation at 25°C for 5 min with 400 μM 5, 5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) by the method of Ellman(27Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). The other half was used for determining the residual enzyme activity after addition of an excess amount of DTT to quench the sulfhydryl modification. For reversible modification of the cysteine residue, the enzyme was incubated with a mixture of each 1 mM of GSH and the oxidized form of GSH in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 0.1 M KCl containing 1 mM EDTA. After the incubation at 4°C overnight, the cysteine residue was autooxidized to form a GS-adduct. The modification was confirmed by the decrease in the free sulfhydryl content of the enzyme, and the increase in Mr of the enzyme was determined by time of flight mass spectrometry after matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (Maldi-Tof mass monitor LDI-1700, Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). The modification was removed by incubation at 4°C overnight with excess DTT. A multiple sequence alignment was obtained by the randomized iterative algorithm (28Berger M.P. Munson P.J. Comput. Appl.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7769-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The iteration was initiated from an alignment constructed by the tree-based algorithm (31Feng D.F. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and repeated 500 times. McLachlan's score matrix (32McLachlan A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) was used for the alignment. The aligned positions of six motifs highly conserved among the lipocalin family (20Pervaiz S. Brew K. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were fixed during the calculation. cDNA for rat brain PGD synthase was unidirectionally deleted from 5′ terminus and incorporated into a PUC 119 expression vector. After infection of E. coli with the reconstructed plasmids after N-terminal deletion up to 29 amino acid residues, the enzyme of various sizes was expressed in the soluble fraction. Further deletions resulted in integration of the expressed protein into an inclusion body or its degradation within the cell. Typical results are shown in Fig. 1A. The PGD synthase activity was detected in the soluble fraction of Δ1-19, Δ1-23, and Δ1-29 mutants (0.58, 0.65, and 0.60 μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) but not of the shorter mutants such as Δ1-34 and Δ1-47 mutants (<0.01 μmol/min/mg of protein). In the precipitate fraction of all samples, no enzyme activity was detected. When we removed a sequence of Thr-Met-Ile-Thr-Pro-Ser-Leu coded in a linker portion of the plasmid from the Δ1-29 enzyme, the amount of the enzyme produced in E. coli was significantly decreased (data not shown). Therefore, the Δ1-29 enzyme containing the 7 additional residues was used for the further mutagenesis studies. We then constructed C-terminal truncated mutants by introducing the stop codon into the positions of the amino acid residues of 154, 171, and 183 of the Δ1-29 enzyme. The Δ(1-29, 183-189) enzyme was efficiently, but partly, expressed into the soluble fraction and associated with the enzyme activity (0.42 μmol/min/mg of protein). However, the shorter mutants, the Δ(1-29, 171-189) and Δ(1-29, 154-189) enzymes, were completely recovered in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B) and had no enzyme activity (<0.01 μmol/min/mg of protein). Thus, the Δ(1-29, 183-189) mutant was an active enzyme of the smallest size produced by terminal truncation, being composed of 153 amino acid residues from the cDNA plus 7 residues from the plasmid with a calculated Mr of 18,136. The core region from Val30 to Gln182, essential for stable expression of the recombinant enzyme with the catalytic activity, ranges from upstream of the first β-strand (A-strand) to downstream of the last β-strand (I-strand) assigned in the multiple alignment with other members of the lipocalin family (Fig. 2). Recently the N-terminal amino acid sequence of rat brain PGD synthase was determined to be Gly-His-Asp-Thr-Val-Gln-Pro after digestion with pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase, indicating that Gln25 is the N terminus of the mature enzyme. 2Y. Urade, N. Eguchi, and T. Tanaka, unpublished results. PGD synthase in human cerebrospinal fluid, β-trace, is also processed posttranslationally, with the first N-terminal 22 amino acid residues being cleaved(7Urade Y. Kitahama K. Ohishi H. Kaneko T.

Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the secretion into the cerebrospinal fluid. These results agree with the finding that the N-terminal sequence upstream of Val30 was not essential for the activity of the enzyme. PGD synthases purified from rat brain (14Urade Y. Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Fujii Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1041-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human cerebrospinal fluid (7Urade Y. Kitahama K. Ohishi H. Kaneko T. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9070-9074Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) are N-glycosylated at two positions, Asn51 and Asn78. However, since the recombinant enzyme displayed the enzyme activity, the glycosyl residues are also not considered to be essential for the enzyme activity. We then systematically replaced all cysteine residues at three positions of 65, 89, and 186 of the Δ1-29 enzyme with alanine or serine to examine the structural and catalytic significance of these residues. In the multiple alignment (Fig. 2), Cys65 is located in or at the edge of the B-strand, Cys89 in the D-strand, and Cys186 in a tail sequence downstream of the I-strand. Two cysteine residues corresponding to Cys89 and Cys186 of the enzyme are highly conserved among members of the lipocalin superfamily and construct an intramolecular disulfide linkage. As judged by SDS-PAGE of the lysates under reducing conditions, all mutant enzymes were efficiently expressed in E. coli to be a major protein and a single immunoreactive protein with anti-rat brain PGD synthase antibodies at a position of Mr of ∼20,000. Alternatively, after SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, various isoforms of the enzyme were observed in the lysates. Typical results for replacement by alanine are shown in Fig. 3. Major components of nonreduced isoforms of the parent, Ala65, Ser65, Ala89, and Ser89 enzymes migrated in the gel faster than the reduced forms. These isoforms possessed intramolecular disulfide bonds: a Cys89-Cys186 linkage in the Ala65 and Ser65 enzymes, a Cys65-Cys186 linkage in the Ala89 and Ser89 enzymes, and both linkages in the parent enzyme. These results suggest that Cys186 is accessible to both Cys65 and Cys89 probably due to the location of Cys186 in a flexible C-terminal sequence of the enzyme. In Western blot, the enzymes with the Cys65-Cys186 bond were less immunoreactive than those with the Cys89-Cys186 bond, suggesting that the antigenic epitopes of the enzyme were masked by the formation of the Cys65-Cys186 disulfide bond. Alternatively, the intramolecular disulfide linkage was not found between Cys65 and Cys89 of both Ala186 and Ser186 mutants, indicating that these 2 residues are kept at a distance from one another in the enzyme molecule. This finding is also consistent with the model structure of the enzyme (14Urade Y. Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Fujii Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1041-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which three β-strands, the Cys65-containing B-strand, the Cys89-containing D-strand, and the C-strand, construct a β-sheet structure, and the former two β-strands are separated by the C-strand in the same β-sheet structure. For all mutants without Cys186, the major component existed as an isoform without disulfide bridge and migrated to a position identical to that seen under reducing conditions. The Cys65-possessing enzymes, but not other mutants without Cys65, showed an additional major band at a position of slightly higher Mr. Since the additional band disappeared after incubation with excess DTT, it was considered to be due to sulfhydryl modification of Cys65 that endogenously occurred during expression of the enzyme in E. coli. The modification was not found at other 2 cysteine residues, Cys89 and Cys186. Thus, Cys65 is an active thiol of the enzyme in terms of the endogenous modification. Intermolecular disulfide formation was observed in all enzymes except for the Ala65,89,186 enzyme without cysteine residues. The parent and all single mutants formed dimers, trimers, and oligomers via intermolecular disulfide bonds among the available cysteine residues. The double mutants formed only dimers via an intermolecular disulfide bond at a unique cysteine residue of each mutant. These dimers and oligomers were completely dissociated into the corresponding monomers after incubation with excess DTT. Among the double mutants, the ratio of a dimer to a monomer was higher in the Ala65,89 and Ala65,186 enzymes than in the Ala89,186 enzyme, suggesting that the disulfide bond is formed more preferentially at Cys89 and Cys186 than at Cys65. Therefore, Cys89 and Cys186 may be exposed on the surface of the enzyme molecule to a greater extent than Cys65. It is in agreement with the predicted tertiary structure of the enzyme(14Urade Y. Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Fujii Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1041-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which Cys65 exists in the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme and an intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys89 and Cys186 occurs at the outside of the barrel structure. To determine the PGD synthase activity of the parent and mutant enzymes, they were purified to apparent homogeneity by Sephadex G-50 and S-Sepharose chromatographies under reducing conditions in the presence of 1 mM DTT. Typical results of purification of the Δ1-29 Ala89,186 enzyme are summarized in Fig. 4A and Table 1. The elution profiles and recoveries from these two chromatographies were almost the same among all recombinant enzymes; the enzyme was eluted with a peak at a position of Mr of ∼20,000 from Sephadex G-50 column and at NaCl concentrations of ∼0.4 M from S-Sepharose column. These results indicate that the tertiary structure of the enzyme in the buffer solution remained unchanged significantly by substitution of the cysteine residues.Tabled 1 The oxidized isoforms of the Ala65 and Ser65 enzymes with the intramolecular Cys89-Cys186 linkage were also purified to apparent homogeneity in the absence of DTT, giving almost the same elution profiles and recoveries as those of the reduced isoforms in the presence of 1 mM DTT. The findings suggest that the tertiary structure of the enzyme was unchanged by formation of the intramolecular disulfide linkage. Alternatively, in the absence of DTT, other mutants showed heterogeneous peaks of various isoforms in the two chromatograms. The elution profiles of the Ala89 enzyme purified in the absence of DTT are shown in Fig. 4B. The dimeric and oligomeric isoforms with the intermolecular disulfide bond were eluted at positions of higher Mr from Sephadex G-50 column. The monomeric isoforms with the endogenously modified Cys65 and the intramolecular Cys65-Cys186 linkage were eluted from S-Sepharose column with peaks at NaCl concentrations of about 0.2 and 0.6 M, respectively. These results revealed that those isoforms were distict from others in terms of the net charge at pH 4.5; the former isoform was charged less positively and the latter more positively than other isoforms. From the difference of Mr between the modified and unmodified enzymes, Mr of the endogenous modifier was calculated to be about 800, although the chemical structure remains unidentified. Typical results of SDS-PAGE of the monomeric isoforms purified under the nonreducing conditions are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6A shows the CD spectrum of the purified Δ1-29 Ala89,186 enzyme, which revealed characteristics of a β-sheet structure (35Johnson C.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) with a broad minimum peak at around 214 nm, and was remarkably similar to that of β-lactoglobulin(36Townend R. Kumosinski T.F. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4538-4545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . The content of secondary structural components of the enzyme was calculated to be 17%α-helix, 47%β-strand, and 36% unordered structure. The parent and all of the other mutant enzymes showed the same CD spectra as that of Δ1-29 Ala89,186 enzyme, in which the oxidized isoforms of the Ala65 and Ala89 enzymes with the intramolecular Cys89-Cys186 and Cys65-Cys186 linkage, respectively, were also included. Furthermore, the CD spectrum remained unchanged when the disulfide bond of these isoforms was cleaved by incubation with excess DTT. These results also indicate that the tertiary structure of the enzyme is unchanged by the formation of the disulfide linkage. However, as shown in Fig. 6B, the CD spectrum of the isoform with the endogenously modified Cys65 was clearly different from that of other isoforms, suggesting that the modifier has the minimum θ value at about 220 nm. The CD spectrum of the modified enzyme returned to that of the unmodified enzyme after incubation with excess DTT, which removed the modification to produce the free sulfhydryl group. The PGD synthase activity of the reduced form of the purified Δ1-29 enzyme and its single and double mutants containing Cys65 was comparable with that of the enzyme purified from rat brain (∼3 μmol/min/mg of protein, Table 2). All of these active enzymes required sulfhydryl compounds, such as DTT, β-mercaptoethanol, glutathione, or cysteine, for catalysis. In the absence of sulfhydryl compounds, the enzymes were completely inactive (<0.01 μmol/min/mg of protein), similar to the enzyme purified from rat brain(3Pentreath V.W. Rees K. Owolabi O.A. Philip K.A. Doua F. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1990; 84: 795-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Alternatively, even in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds, the PGD synthase activity was not detected in any of the single, double, and triple mutants lacking Cys65 (<0.01 μmol/min/mg of protein, Table 2). The PGD synthase activity was neither detected in the Δ1-29 Ala89 and Δ1-29 Ala89,186 enzymes containing the endogenously modified Cys65 residue, the Δ1-29 Ala89 enzyme with an intramolecular Cys65-Cys186 bond, nor the Δ1-29 Ala89,186 enzyme conjugated with GSH to form the GS-adduct at Cys65 (<0.01 μmol/min/mg of protein). All of these inactive enzymes became active (∼3 μmol/min/mg of protein) after incubation with excess DTT, which reproduced a free sulfhydryl group of Cys65.Tabled 1 When the purified Δ1-29 Ala89,186 enzyme was incubated with various amounts of NEM, the enzyme activity and the content of free sulfhydryl group of the enzyme decreased dose-dependently in a parallel fashion and disappeared almost completely after incubation with excess amounts of NEM (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the inactivation of this enzyme was due to stoichiometric chemical modification of Cys65 by NEM and that Cys65 is an essential thiol of the enzyme. The Cys65 residue is conserved among rat and human brain PGD synthases and a major secretory protein from cane toad choroid plexus (21Achen M.G. Harms P.J. Thomas T. Richardson S.J. Wettenhall R.E.H. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23170-23174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is not present in any of the other members of the lipocalin superfamily(15Nagata A. Suzuki Y.

The toad secretory protein has the highest homology with PGD synthase among lipocalins identified to date; the identity and similarity are 41.4 and 66.1% to the rat enzyme and 39.8 and 64.5% to the human enzyme, respectively (Fig. 2). The toad protein and PGD synthase also share several common features for the tissue distribution; both the protein and the enzyme are selectively expressed in the central nervous system, actively produced in the choroid plexus, and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid(6Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Kaneko T. Konishi A. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15132-15136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Urade Y. Kitahama K. Ohishi H. Kaneko T. Mizuno N.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23170-23174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The toad protein may, therefore, be an amphibian counterpart of the mammalian enzyme and may also be associated with the PGD synthase activity, acting as the enzyme in the central nervous system of amphibians. In conclusion, our results have shown that Cys65 is an essential thiol for the activity of PGD synthase and that both intrinsic and extrinsic sulfhydryl groups are necessary for catalyzing the conversion of PGH2 to PGD2. The extrinsic sulfhydryl group was required for the reaction but not consumed stoichiometrically during the reaction. After the conversion of PGH2 to PGD2, configuration of chiral carbon at C-9 is retained. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 8, PGD2 formation is considered to be initiated by the transient formation of an S-O linkage between the active intrinsic thiol of Cys65 and the oxygen at C-11 of PGH2. The extrinsic sulfhydryl group then withdraws the hydrogen at C-11 of the intermediate to produce PGD2. PGD synthase is known to be rapidly inactivated during reaction(3Pentreath V.W. Rees K. Owolabi O.A. Philip K.A. Doua F. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1990; 84: 795-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The suicidal property of this enzyme might be due to nucleophilic attack of the extrinsic sulfhydryl group toward the carbon at C-11 instead of the hydrogen, as shown by dottedarrows in Fig. 8. In consequence, PGD synthase may be inactivated by oxidation of the intrinsic thiol of Cys65. The reaction mechanism may also be applicable to PGE synthase because this enzyme shows several enzymatic characteristics identical to PGD synthase(37Ogino N. Miyamoto T. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 890-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Moonen P. Buytenhek M. Nugteren D.H.

For example, both of the enzymes are sensitive against sulfhydryl modifiers, require the extrinsic sulfhydryl compound as an essential cofactor, and are rapidly inactivated during the reaction. The extrinsic sulfhydryl compound is not oxidized stoichiometrically during the reactions catalyzed by these two enzymes. Thus, the reaction mechanism of PGE synthase may be the same as that of PGD synthase and different from the previously speculated mechanism analogous to the glyoxylase I reaction(40Lands W. Lee R. Smith W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 180: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PGE, PGI, and thromboxane A synthases in the arachidonic acid cascade also catalyze the nonoxidative rearrangement of 9,11-endoperoxide of PGH2. Since the reaction mechanisms of these enzymes are still a matter of speculation, the proposed mechanism in this study for PGD synthase is useful to predict their reaction mechanisms. We thank Dr. A. Nagata, Tokyo University, for guidance during the early stage of this study and Dr. S. Sri Kantha for critical reading of the manuscript. We also thank H. Kondoh, E. Kitakuni and I.

A number of studies have identified domains in rhodopsin that are important for the activation of Gt.

To identify regions that participate in these processes, a series of alanine mutations were generated in the three cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin and transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells. Membranes prepared from these cells were reconstituted with the opsin chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and characterized for their ability to undergo light-dependent phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase and to catalyze GTPS (guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) binding to Gt.

Mutations at 13 residues within the Mu A protein were analyzed for precise excision of Mu DNA in vivo. A subset of the defective variants (altered at Asp269, Asp294, Gly348, and Glu392) were tested in specific steps of transposition in vitro. It is possible that at least some residues of the Asp269-Asp294-Glu392 triad may have functional similarities to those of the conserved Asp-Asp-Glu motif found in several transposases and retroviral integrases. Mu A(D269V) is defective in high-order DNA-protein assembly, Mu end cleavage, and strand transfer. The assembly defect, but not the catalytic defect, can be overcome by precleavage of Mu ends. Mu A(E392A) can assemble the synaptic complex, but cannot cleave Mu ends. A mutation of Gly348 to aspartic acid within Mu A permits the uncoupling of cleavage and strand transfer activities. This mutant is completely defective in synaptic assembly and Mu end cleavage in presence of Mg2+. The assembly defect is alleviated by replacing Mg2+ with Ca2+. Some Mu end cleavage is observed with this mutant in the presence of Mn2+. When presented with precleaved Mu ends, Mu A(G348D) exhibits efficient strand transfer activity."

It is strongly dependent on double stranded DNA, and there is a marked preference for substrates that are colocalized to the same DNA fragment(19Walker A.I. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Anderson C.W.

DNA-PK has a 350-kDa catalytic component (11Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 15Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I.

In the current study, we report an additional property of DNA-PK, which is that activity is directly stimulated by certain transcriptional activators in vitro. We find that DNA-PK exhibits behavior consistent with that of a signal transduction kinase, responding to certain proteins by phosphorylating others. This suggests that DNA-PK could be part of a signaling pathway which is initiated by certain transcriptional activators and results in the phosphorylation of other nuclear proteins. DNA-PK was purified from HeLa cells (21Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the phenyl-Superose step sometimes omitted. GAL4 derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (24Lin Y.-S. Carey M.F. Ptashe M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were lysed in Buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 μM ZnCl2, 20 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 M NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After polyethyleneimine fractionation and (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, material was sequentially chromatographed on DE52 (flowed through in Buffer A with 0.1 M NaCl), heparin-agarose (elution in Buffer A with 0.2-1.0 M NaCl gradient) and Superdex 75 HR16/60 (elution in TZ buffer (0.1 M KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μM ZnCl2, 20% glycerol, 20 mM 2-mercaptoethanol)). HSF1 was expressed in E. coli, and lysates were prepared in HEMGN buffer as described(25Rabindran S.K. Giorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Crude HSF1 was sequentially chromatographed on heparin-agarose (elution in HEMGN with 0.15-0.5 M KCl step), Mono Q HR5/5 (elution in HEMGN with 0.1-0.5 M KCl gradient), and Superdex 200 HR 16/60 (elution in TZ buffer). CTD fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described(17Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Sp1CTD contained Sp1 amino acids 527-638 inserted between the GST and CTD domains of GCTD. Experiments with GAL4 used DNA fragments derived from pG5E4T, which has five tandem GAL4 binding sites(26Carey M. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Experiments with HSF1 used fragments from pHSPΔ50HSE2, which has two tandem heat shock elements (HSEs). Each of the two HSEs was composed of three nGAAn elements and is expected to bind a single HSF1 trimer(27Becker P.B. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4109-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Some experiments with HSF1 also used pHSPΔ50HSE0, pHSPΔ50HSE1, pHSPΔ50HSE4, pHSPΔ50HSE5, and pHSPΔ50HSE7, which are similar to pHSPΔ50HSE2 except that they contain zero, one, four, five, and seven tandem HSEs, respectively. The plasmid pHSPΔ50HSE0 contained a 52-bp ApaI/SmaI fragment from the pBluescript polylinker in place of the HSF1 binding sites. To prepare other pHSPΔ50HSE2 derivatives, a BamHI site downstream of the hsp70 coding sequence was first ablated. The plasmid pHSPΔ50HSE1 was then created by digesting pHSPΔ50HSE2 with ApaI and BamHI to excise the distal HSE. The resulting ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and the plasmid was religated. The plasmids pHSPΔ50HSE4, pHSPΔ50HSE5, and pHSPΔ50HSE7 were constructed by digesting pHSPΔ50HSE2 with BamHI, which cleaves between the two HSEs, and inserting synthetic oligonucleotides containing additional HSEs. The orientation and the number of inserts were determined by DNA sequencing. Standard phosphorylation reactions contained 50 nM GCTD fusion protein(17Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), 0.2 nM of a 440-bp HindIII/EcoRI DNA fragment from pG5E4T (26Carey M. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) or a 453-bp KpnI/XbaI fragment of pHSPΔ50HSE2(27Becker P.B. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4109-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), 0.125 μl of the p350 subunit of DNA-PK(16Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), 12.5 μM [γ-32P] ATP (8 Ci/mmol), 0.5 × TZ buffer, and activator protein as described in the figure legends, in a volume of 20 μl. Reactions were performed at 30°C for 30 min. GAL4-DNA binding reactions contained 0.5 nM32P-labeled 115-bp HindIII/BamHI fragment from pG5E4T, 0.5 × TZ buffer, and GAL4 derivatives as described in figure legends, in a volume of 10 μl. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 25°C and analyzed by 5% PAGE. HSF1-DNA binding reactions contained 0.1 nM of a singly endlabeled DNA fragment, as indicated in figure legends. Reactions also contained HSF1 derivatives, as described in the figure legends, and 0.5 × TZ buffer, in a volume of 50 μl. DNase I footprinting was performed as described(28Dynan W.S. Genet. Eng. 1987; 9: 75-87Crossref Google Scholar). Initial studies were performed with a 147-amino acid N-terminal GAL4 derivative, GAL4-(1-147). This protein contains a DNA binding domain and adjacent sequences that activate transcription in vitro(24Lin Y.-S. Carey M.F. Ptashe M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We discovered its effect on DNA-PK serendipitously, in the course of studies using GAL4 fusion proteins. The phosphorylation reactions shown in Fig. 1 contained purified DNA-PK catalytic subunit, a DNA fragment with five GAL4 sites and a core promoter, and a model substrate with sequences from the CTD of the large subunit of RNAP II. The basal level of DNA-PK activity in this system was very low, and phosphorylation increased 20-fold in the presence of GAL4-(1-147). Input substrate (CTDA) was shifted to a lower mobility form (CTD0), indicative of multiple phosphorylation. Although the substrate used here contained a DNA binding domain from the transcription factor Sp1, separate experiments showed that its DNA binding activity was very weak (not shown), and the same substrate without Sp1 sequences responded similarly to activators (see Fig. 3).Figure 3:Transcriptional activators promote phosphorylation of multiple DNA-PK substrates. A, effect of GAL4-(1-147). Phosphorylation was assayed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 except with 20 ng of GCTD fusion protein, 400 ng of HSP 90, or 200 ng of α-casein as substrate. Concentrations of GAL4-(1-147) are indicated in μM. Products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Arrows indicate the position of the phosphorylated substrates. B, effect of HSF1. Phosphorylation was assayed as in A, except with concentrations of HSF1 as indicated in nM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA binding assays were performed using GAL4-(1-147) and a subfragment of the G5E4T DNA used in the phosphorylation assays. The amount of GAL4-(1-147) required to stimulate the kinase approximately correlated with the amount required to saturate the binding sites in the probe (compare Fig. 1, B and C). Specific GAL4 sequences outside the DNA binding domain influenced the ability to stimulate the kinase. GAL4-(1-94), which contains only a minimal DNA binding and dimerization domain, showed a reduced ability to stimulate the kinase (Fig. 1B). The difference between the two GAL4 derivatives could not be attributed to differences in DNA binding affinity, as binding approached saturation with the same amount of each GAL4 derivative (Fig. 1C). Separate experiments confirmed previous reports that GAL4-(1-147) strongly activates transcription in vitro, and GAL4-(1-94) does not(24Lin Y.-S. Carey M.F. Ptashe M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 29Workman J.L. Taylor I.C. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, in vitro transcription and kinase stimulatory activities are both influenced by sequences within a 53-amino acid region of GAL4. The correlation between transcription and kinase stimulatory activities is not perfect; however, since GAL4-(1-94) showed some residual activity in the kinase assay at the highest concentration tested, whereas no activity was detected in an in vitro transcription assay (data not shown). We next tested the effect of a different factor, the human heat shock transcription factor, HSF1, in similar experiments. Whereas GAL4 had been identified serendipitously, HSF1 was chosen for study because of prior evidence that protein phosphorylation plays a role in the heat shock transcription response. Heat shock increases total CTD kinase activity in cell extracts(30Legagneux V. Morange M. Bensuade O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that CTD phosphorylation may be involved in release of RNAP II arrested at heat shock promoters(30Legagneux V. Morange M. Bensuade O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Lis J. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Recent cytologic and biochemical studies show that phosphorylation of Drosophila RNAP II accompanies heat shock transcriptional induction in vivo(32O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 33Weeks J.R. Hardin S.E. Shen J. Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2329-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reactions in Fig. 2 contained bacterially expressed HSF1, which is constitutively active for DNA binding and transcription, a DNA fragment containing two HSF binding sites, and the same CTD model substrate as before. HSF1 increased phosphorylation about 6-fold. The concentration of HSF1 required for maximal stimulation was at least 15-fold lower than with GAL4-(1-147), probably reflecting the higher affinity of HSF1 for DNA. In this experiment, somewhat higher concentrations of HSF1 were required to activate the kinase than to saturate the binding sites in the probe. However, this result appears to be anomalous, as later experiments demonstrated a closer correlation (see Fig. 4). The variability in activation at low concentrations of HSF1 has not been explained, but could reflect nonspecific loss of HSF1 at low protein concentrations, as no carrier protein was present in the assay.Figure 4:Dependence of DNA-PK stimulation on HSF1 binding sites. A, schematic diagram of HSF1 binding DNA fragments, constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Arrows indicate the orientation of HSEs, relative to pHSPΔ50HSE2. B, phosphorylation of GCTD fusion protein was assayed in the presence of 439-565-bp KpnI/XbaI fragments derived from constructs shown in A. Reactions were performed with variable amounts of HSF1 as indicated. Radiolabeled products were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. C, binding of HSF1 to DNA fragments derived from constructs used in A. DNase footprinting was as described under “Materials and Methods.” Probe DNAs were a BglI/EspI fragments singly end-labeled at the EspI site in the hsp70 gene, downstream of the HSEs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HSF1 was itself phosphorylated by DNA-PK (Fig. 2A). HSF1 is phosphorylated during the heat shock response in vivo(34Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 35Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), although the sites of phosphorylation have not been mapped and it is not known if they are the same as are used by DNA-PK in vitro. As with GAL4, specific sequences in HSF1 were required for stimulation of the kinase. A 202-amino acid derivative, HSF1 M3, contains only the minimal DNA binding and trimerization domains (25Rabindran S.K. Giorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and lacks transcriptional activity(36Peterson, S. R., 1993, Phosphorylation of the Carboxyl-terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II by a DNA-dependent Protein Kinase. Ph.D. thesis, University of Colorado.Google Scholar). 2S. R. Peterson, S. A. Jesch, T. N. Chamberlin, A. Dvir, S. K. Rabindran, C. Wu, and W. S. Dynan, unpublished results. This mutant failed to stimulate the kinase (Fig. 2B). Although wild type HSF1 had a 2-fold greater affinity for DNA than HSF1 M3 (Fig. 2C), this could not account for the difference in activity, since HSF1 M3 worked poorly even at concentrations sufficient to drive DNA binding to completion. Additional experiments showed that stimulation of DNA-PK activity is not a universal property of transcriptional activators(36Peterson, S. R., 1993, Phosphorylation of the Carboxyl-terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II by a DNA-dependent Protein Kinase. Ph.D. thesis, University of Colorado.Google Scholar). It is now recognized that activators fall into a number of classes, which may work by different mechanisms. The acidic class is the best studied. We tested several fusion proteins containing GAL4 sequences joined to the prototypical acidic activation domain from herpes virus VP16. The kinase stimulatory activity of the GAL4-VP16 fusion proteins was no greater than that of GAL4-(1-147) and in some constructs was less, suggesting that the VP16 sequences hindered the ability of the GAL4 domain to activate the kinase(36Peterson, S. R., 1993, Phosphorylation of the Carboxyl-terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II by a DNA-dependent Protein Kinase. Ph.D. thesis, University of Colorado.Google Scholar). VP16 binds a number of transcription factors in vitro(37Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1990; 345: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 38Lin Y.-S. Ha I. Maidonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); its inability to stimulate the kinase underscores the specificity of the activator-kinase interaction. It was of interest to determine whether the stimulation of CTD phosphorylation by GAL4-(1-147) and HSF1 was a special case or whether stimulation occurred with other kinase substrates as well. We compared the phosphorylation of GCTD, a model substrate similar to Sp1CTD but lacking the Sp1 sequences, and the weak substrates hsp90 and casein (Fig. 3). Although higher concentrations of hsp90 and casein were needed to obtain equivalent labeling, the effect of the activators was the same as with the CTD substrates. The ability of the activators to stimulate phosphorylation of unrelated substrates suggests that they influence the kinase itself, rather than the conformation or DNA binding properties of a particular substrate. The dependence on activator binding sites was investigated in detail for HSF1. Derivatives of the original two-HSE plasmid were prepared with zero, one, four, five, and seven tandem HSEs binding sites, as diagrammed in Fig. 4A. Fragments from each derivative were tested in a phosphorylation assay (Fig. 4B). In addition, the ability of each fragment to bind HSF1 was determined in parallel DNase footprinting assays, which were performed separately using the same batch of HSF1 (Fig. 4C). Neither the HSE0 nor the HSE1 derivative was effective in promoting DNA-PK activity, despite the fact that HSF1 bound relatively well to the HSE1 construct. By contrast, HSE2 was effective in promoting DNA-PK activity. Maximal activation of the kinase appeared to correlate with occupancy of the second HSE (compare Fig. 4, B and C). Together, these data suggest that two DNA-bound HSF molecules are required for a high level of stimulation and therefore that the interaction of HSF and DNA-PK may be cooperative. Interestingly, HSE4, HSE5, and HSE7 were less able to promote DNA-PK activity than HSE2. This was unexpected, and the explanation has not yet been determined. It could be that in some instances a long array of tandem sites rendered the DNA less able to assume a conformation required for interaction with the bulky 350-kDa DNA-PK catalytic subunit. The ability to support activation was not critically dependent on the orientation of the HSEs. A construct similar to HSE4 with the central two HSEs inverted behaved similarly to HSE4 in a phosphorylation assay (data not shown). The dependence of GAL4-(1-147) activation on GAL4 DNA binding sites was also investigated, although not in as much detail as for HSF1. Stimulation was 5-fold greater when DNA containing GAL4 sites was used in the reaction, compared with DNA without GAL4 sites. There was also virtually no stimulation when DNA was omitted (data not shown). Taken together, the dependence on factor binding sites, seen with both HSF1 and GAL4, implies that binding of the activators to DNA is necessary to activate the kinase. Previous work has shown that the activity of DNA-PK is regulated by the Ku autoantigen(16Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). It was of interest to test the effect of Ku protein in combination with activators. Under the conditions of these experiments, we found that Ku protein stimulated the kinase in a concentration-dependent manner by up to 5-fold. GAL4-(1-147) alone stimulated 20-fold, and Ku and GAL4-(1-147) together stimulated up to 100-fold (Fig. 5). Similar synergy was seen between Ku protein and HSF1 (data not shown). This synergy suggests that Ku protein and the activators may work by different mechanisms. Consistent with this, Ku protein has been shown to work by recruiting the p350 catalytic subunit of DNA-PK to DNA(16Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In similar experiments, GAL4-(1-147) had no direct effect on p350-DNA binding. 3S. A. Jesch and W. S. Dynan, unpublished observations. In the present study, we have shown that two proteins that activate RNAP II transcription also stimulate the activity of a template-associated protein kinase, DNA-PK. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized behavior of DNA-PK. DNA-PK acts as a molecular transducer, in that it responds to one kind of signal, the presence of certain DNA-bound activator proteins, by generating another kind of signal, the modification of target proteins by phosphorylation. Three observations are relevant to the mechanism by which activator proteins stimulate DNA-PK. First, stimulation was seen with all substrates tested (Fig. 3), indicating that the activators interact directly with the kinase, rather than influencing the conformation or DNA binding properties of a single substrate. Second, stimulation is dependent on DNA, and is greatest with DNA containing relevant factor binding sites, suggesting that an activator-DNA complex is required. Finally, the activation is synergistic with Ku protein. As the major function of Ku protein is believed to be to recruit DNA-PK to DNA, it is likely that the kinase is also bound to DNA when the activation occurs. Thus, stimulation of DNA-PK most likely involves a functional interaction between proteins that are each bound to DNA. The suggestion that DNA-PK may play a role in transcription arises from circumstantial evidence. DNA-PK is associated with the transcriptional template and is regulated by known transcriptional activators. For both GAL4-(1-147) and HSF1, sequences outside the minimal DNA binding domain were required for stimulation of the kinase, although in neither case has a fine scale genetic analysis been performed to identify these sequences precisely or to establish their exact relationship to the transcriptional activation domain. The effect of HSF1 on DNA-PK is of special interest because of previous suggestions that the heat shock transcription response involves phosphorylation of RNAP II(30Legagneux V. Morange M. Bensuade O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Lis J. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 32O'Brien T.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2329-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A protein kinase with the properties of DNA-PK is a strong candidate to be involved in the CTD phosphorylation event known to accompany induction of transcription in vivo in certain organisms(32O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Caution is warranted, however, since several other protein kinases are activated during heat shock, and the situation in vivo may be complex(39Dubois M.-F. Bensaude O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). It is possible that transcription factor-mediated activation of DNA-PK stimulates localized phosphorylation of proteins bound at nearby promoter sites. Alternatively, activation could be a more generalized phenomenon, stimulating phosphorylation of proteins throughout the nucleus. These alternatives have not yet been distinguished experimentally. There are several plausible mechanisms by which an increase in DNA-PK activity could influence transcription. We emphasize that none of these mechanisms has been definitively tested, and some may operate only in vivo, not with in vitro transcription systems. DNA-PK phosphorylates the CTD of RNAP II, and an increase in CTD phosphorylation could facilitate the transition to the elongation phase of the transcription reaction(42Dahmus M.E. Dynan W.S. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 109-128Google Scholar). A similar model has been invoked to explain the ability of another DNA-bound CTD kinase, c-abl, to enhance GAL4-VP16-mediated transactivation in vivo(43Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA-PK phosphorylates a number of transcriptional activator proteins. At certain promoters, one activator may induce phosphorylation of another, perhaps altering the ability of the second activator to interact with the transcriptional machinery. Finally, DNA-PK phosphorylates histone H1(15Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which could affect the ability of histone H1 to repress transcription. To better address which targets are relevant to the physiological function of DNA-PK, it will be helpful to establish systems in which the role of DNA-PK and its different substrates can be studied more directly.

However, the nature of their downstream effectors appears to be quite divergent; adenylyl cyclase and a protein kinase Raf-1, which do not share any structural homology with each other, are effectors of Ras in the budding yeast and in higher organisms, respectively. We show here that a protein kinase Byr2, which has been known to act downstream of Ras1 in a mating pheromone signal transduction system of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, binds directly to Ras proteins in a GTP-dependent manner. The region of Byr2 responsible for the Ras binding was mapped by a gene deletion analysis to its N-terminal segment of 206 amino acid residues, which does not possess any significant homology with the other effectors of Ras. The affinity of the Byr2 N terminus for Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras2 was determined by measuring its activity to competitively inhibit Ras-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity and found to be comparable with those of yeast adenylyl cyclase and human Raf-1, with a dissociation constant (K) of about 1 nM. Furthermore, Byr2 inhibited a Ras GTPase-activating activity of Ira2, a S. cerevisiae homologue of neurofibromin.

The activation pathway of μ-CANP may thus consist in the reversible Ca-dependent translocation of the unautolyzed form of the enzyme to the plasma membrane, where the protease could attack its preferred targets (membrane and cytoskeletal proteins like the Ca-ATPase, band 3, and spectrin). In this model the PEST sequences would have no important role in the activation of μ-CANP in vivo.Studies by Wang et al.(9Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that the presence of sequences with high PEST score and of CaM-binding regions are good indications that the protein is a preferred CANP substrate. The plasma membrane Ca-ATPase indeed is the preferred μ-CANP substrate in vivo, at least in erythrocytes(10Salamino F. Sparatore B. Melloni E. Michetti M. Viotti P.L. Pontremoli S. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), i.e. it is partially proteolyzed by the unautolyzed 80-kDa form of the protease at very low Ca concentrations(8Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27992-27995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). μ-CANP cleaves both the plasma membrane inserted and the isolated pump as well as a number of expressed or synthesized peptides corresponding to its C-terminal portion in the CaM-binding domain. The Ca-ATPase contains 2 sequences with high PEST score (A18, residues 1079-1096, score = 14.0, and B28, residues 1153-1180, score = 8.3) surrounding the CaM-binding domain (C28, corresponding to amino acids 1101-1128) (see Table 1 for the amino acid sequences of the peptides used). These findings made the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase an ideal tool to investigate the importance of the PEST sequences in the substrate susceptibility to μ-CANP digestion.Table 1 Open table in a new tab The correlation between the PEST score and the susceptibility of the ATPase to μ-CANP digestion was initially studied by deleting the high PEST score sequences in synthetic C-terminal portions of the Ca-ATPase and then by inserting mutations lowering the PEST scores in the sequences surrounding the CaM-binding domain of the ATPase expressed in Escherichia coli. The results have shown that the PEST sequences near the μ-CANP cleavage site in the substrates play no significant role in CANP susceptibility.MATERIALS AND METHODSμ-CANP PurificationThe μ-CANP used for these experiments was isolated from freshly collected human erythrocytes by a modified version of the procedure described by Melloni et al.(11Melloni E. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Michetti M. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).One unit of freshly drawn venous human blood in citrate buffer was filtered through a Pall™ filter (Pall Schweiz AG, Muttenz, Switzerland) to eliminate the white cells. The filtrate was centrifuged at 800 ×g for 15 min to obtain the erythrocytes. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. After three washings with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, the packed erythrocytes (250 ml) were lyzed in 5 volumes of 10 mM sodium acetate containing 2.5 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2. The hemolysate was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 20 min to remove the cell membranes. The membrane-free lysate was incubated with 165 g of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) previously equilibrated with a 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.7, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). The pH was adjusted to 6.7, and the suspension was stirred for 30 min. The lysate-loaded DEAE-Sepharose was washed in a Buchner funnel with 10 liters of buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl and packed in a glass column (5 × 10 cm). The peak (400 ml) containing the μ-CANP activity was eluted in a single step with 0.2 M NaCl in buffer A. The protein was precipitated with 45% saturated ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mM NaCl (buffer B) and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g, and the supernatant was rechromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose column with a linear gradient of 0.05-0.2 M NaCl in buffer B. The fractions containing μ-CANP activity were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against buffer B, and further purified on a butyl-agarose column as described by Melloni et al.(11Melloni E. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Michetti M. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Peptide Synthesis by Solid PhaseThe peptide substrates used for the assays (see Table 1) were derived from the C-terminal portion of isoform 1CI (12Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) of the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (hPMCA1CI). The portion consists of about 100 residues(1079-1180) and follows the 10th intramembrane domain of the ATPase. μ-CANP cleaves the pump both in vivo and in vitro in the CaM-binding site (residues 1101-1128).The peptide substrates A18 (PEST sequence 1), B28 (PEST sequence 2), C28W (CaM-binding domain), C24W (a shortened version of the CaM-binding domain lacking the first 4 N-terminal residues), C24W-P (a phosphothreonine derivative of the same peptide), and C49 (PEST sequence 1 + the CaM-binding domain) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Peptide Synthesizer model 431A using the standard scale FastMoc™ chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Their syntheses have been described elsewhere: peptides A18 and C28W in Vorherr et al.(13Vorrherr T. James P. Krebs J. Enyedi A. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24298-24303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of all synthetic products was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry.Expression of the C-terminal Fragments in E. coliThe expression of portions of the C-terminal domain of the hPMCA1CI (Met-A18-B28) and the purification of the expressed fragment are described in(17Hofmann F. James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10252-10259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated Met-A18∗-B28∗ fragment was expressed and purified by the same procedure.Introduction of Mutations Lowering the PEST ScoreMutations lowering the PEST score of sequences A18 and B28 surrounding the CaM-binding site of the expressed C-terminal peptide were introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA coding for the C terminus of the pump with mutated oligonucleotides. The 5′-primer was 37 nucleotides long and contained a NcoI restriction site and a methionine codon followed by the codons of the first 10 amino acids of the fragment to be expressed: 5′-GGCC ATG GAA CAA ATA CCT CAG CAG CAA TTA GCA CAG-3′. The mutations of the DNA-sequence (in boldface) coding for the A18 region changed the protein sequence from EEIPEEELAE to EQIPQQQLAQ, lowering the PEST score from 14.0 to −3.2. The 3′-primer was 33 bases long and contained the complementary sequence of the B28 region to be mutated: 3′-CGG GTT TTA TTA CGA GGA TGT TTT GCA TTG AGG-5′. The mutations in the DNA-sequence (in boldface) coding for the B28 region changed the protein sequence from AEDDAPTKRNS to AQNNAPTKRNS lowering the PEST score from 8.3 to −2.7 (the PEST scores were calculated with the algorithm proposed by Rogers et al.(1Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). A MaeIII restriction site permitted the addition of the missing DNA portion coding for the last 6 amino acids of the A18∗-B28∗ sequence: 5′-GT AAC TCC AGT CCT CCA TAG G-3′, 3′- AGG TCA GGA GGT ATC CCT AG- 5′. The introduction of the mutations was confirmed by DNA and amino acid sequencing.Phosphorylation of the Expressed Fragment A18-B28The fragment was phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase following the procedure described by James et al.(18James P. Pruschy M. Vorherr T. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4253-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).μ-CANP Proteolysis of the Peptide SubstratesThe substrate susceptibility to μ-CANP was examined at various free Ca concentrations (Fig. 1) and substrate to protease ratios (Fig. 2). 1-4 nM substrate-peptides were dissolved in an incubation buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA. The proteolysis rate at 25°C was followed upon the addition of Ca and purified μ-CANP. The free Ca concentration was calculated using a computer program(19Fabiato A. Fabiato F.J. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Additional assays were performed in the presence of equimolar amounts of CaM or synthetic A18 and B28 peptides. The proteolysis was stopped by the addition of excess EDTA. The reaction mixtures were examined by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (Nucleosil C18, 300-5 column) using the following gradient: 0-5 min 20% B, 5-50 min to 75% B, 50-60 min to 100% B. A contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and B contained 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid, 70% acetonitrile. The disappearance of the peaks corresponding to the unproteolyzed peptides and the concomitant appearance of the proteolytic-fragments was recorded.Figure 1:Ca dependence of substrate proteolysis by μ-CANP.

Additional details are found under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFig. 1 offers a general view of the Ca dependence of the μ-CANP proteolysis of the substrate peptides; as mentioned, μ-CANP cleaves the intact ATPase as well as its expressed and synthetic C-terminal portion in the CaM-binding region (i.e. peptide C28).The expressed peptides A18-B28, A18-B28-P, and A18∗-B28∗ all contain the CaM-binding domain and were thus good μ-CANP substrates, i.e. they were about 85% proteolyzed in the presence of 14 μM free Ca and completely proteolyzed in the presence of 75 μM Ca after 1 h of incubation. No significant differences in the rate of proteolysis of the three peptides were detected at the Ca concentrations and incubation times used for the experiments. The phosphorylation of peptide A18-B28 (Ser-1178, located in the high PEST score sequence 2, see the Introduction) increased the acid character of the latter and was thus expected to increase its Ca-sequestration ability. This ought to have led to enhanced susceptibility of the peptide to μ-CANP digestion, especially at low Ca concentrations. Similarly, lowering of the PEST score of the region surrounding the CaM-binding domain by mutating some of its acidic residues could have been expected to increase the resistance of the peptides to the protease. However, both expectations proved fallacious; the decrease of the PEST score of the sequence A18 from 14.0 to −3.2 and of the sequence B28 from 8.3 to −2.7, respectively, had no influence on the proteolysis rate. Similarly, no appreciable differences were detected in the rates of digestion of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated A18-B28 peptide. By contrast, phosphorylation of the CaM-binding peptide C24 on the Thr, which is the substrate for protein kinase C(21Wang K.K. Wright L.C. Machan C.L. Allen B.G. Conigrave A.D. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decreased its proteolysis rate by more than 50% (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained by adding CaM to the incubation mixtures; the proteolysis rate of all peptides was strongly reduced (Fig. 3), showing that μ-CANP needed a free CaM-binding domain to efficiently cleave the peptides. Possibly, a free CaM-binding domain is also needed for the proper recognition of the substrates by μ-CANP. Other indications in this direction were provided by experiments in which peptides C28, A18, or B28, were added to the reaction mixture containing μ-CANP and the substrate-peptide A18-B28. Equimolar concentrations of C28 slowed down the proteolysis rate of the latter, while a 10-fold excess of the two high PEST score sequences A18 and B28 failed to influence it (data not shown). These observations thus strongly indicate that the PEST sequences did not compete with the endogenous recognition site for μ-CANP on the pump. Their importance in the induction of μ-CANP proteolysis thus appears to be minor.Figure 3:Ca dependence of substrate proteolysis by μ-CANP in the presence (dotted lines) and in the absence (solid lines) of CaM. The expressed peptides (, A18-B28; □, A18∗-B28∗) and the synthetic peptide (+, C28) were incubated with μ-CANP in the presence of equimolar amounts of calmodulin or in its absence. Additional details are found under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results have shown that the larger peptides were more sensitive to μ-CANP, i.e. they were more efficiently proteolyzed not only by lower Ca concentrations (Fig. 1), but also by lower protease/substrate ratio (Fig. 2). The length of the peptide thus appears to be a determining factor for the rate of proteolysis, especially at very low Ca concentrations. Between 81 and 85% of peptides A18-B28, A18∗-B28∗, and A18-B28-P (all were 103 amino acids in length) was proteolyzed after 1 h of incubation with μ-CANP by 14 μM free Ca. By contrast, only about 70% of C49 (49 residues) was proteolyzed during the same period of time; higher concentrations of free Ca (up to 40 μM) and higher protease/substrate ratio were necessary for an equivalent digestion of the shorter substrate-peptide C28 (28 amino acids). A shorter version of the CaM-binding region (peptide C24, 24 amino acids) was digested less efficiently than the complete CaM-binding region (C28). The two high PEST score sequences (peptide A18, 18 amino acids, and peptide B28, 28 amino acids, both lacking the CaM-binding site where μ-CANP cleaves the other peptides) were practically insensitive to μ-CANP even at very high Ca concentrations (up to 200 μM).

Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 20Rechsteiner M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have shown that proteins with intracellular half-lives of less than 2 h are unusually rich in PEST regions (i.e. sequences rich in proline (P), glutamic and aspartic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T)) flanked by clusters containing positively charged amino acids. PEST sequences were found to be common in a number of proteins rapidly degraded by a non-ubiquitin-mediated process. They proposed that the PEST sequences sequestered Ca, thus creating a microenvironment of higher Ca concentration favorable to the attack by CANP (see also (2Rechsteiner M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 433-440PubMed Google Scholar). The activation mechanism of CANP is still poorly understood. A widely accepted model (3Suzuki K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 103-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar) claims that partial CANP autolysis is an obligatory step in the activation of the enzyme and in the cleavage of substrates. One problem with this model is that in vitro experiments have shown that even μ-CANP 1The abbreviations used are: μ-CANPCa-activated neutral protease (calpain)CaMcalmodulin.(the “low Ca-requiring” form of the protease) needs 140-150 μM Ca for half-maximal rate of controlled autolysis(4Cong J. Goll D.E. Peterson A.M. Kapprell H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10096-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. Ca concentrations that cells presumably never experience, at least during their normal functional cycle. These problems made the PEST sequence suggestion of Ca sequestration very attractive since it potentially explained CANP action in vivo, i.e. in the presence of physiological Ca concentrations.

The activation pathway of μ-CANP may thus consist in the reversible Ca-dependent translocation of the unautolyzed form of the enzyme to the plasma membrane, where the protease could attack its preferred targets (membrane and cytoskeletal proteins like the Ca-ATPase, band 3, and spectrin). In this model the PEST sequences would have no important role in the activation of μ-CANP in vivo. Studies by Wang et al.(9Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that the presence of sequences with high PEST score and of CaM-binding regions are good indications that the protein is a preferred CANP substrate. The plasma membrane Ca-ATPase indeed is the preferred μ-CANP substrate in vivo, at least in erythrocytes(10Salamino F. Sparatore B. Melloni E. Michetti M. Viotti P.L. Pontremoli S. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), i.e. it is partially proteolyzed by the unautolyzed 80-kDa form of the protease at very low Ca concentrations(8Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27992-27995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). μ-CANP cleaves both the plasma membrane inserted and the isolated pump as well as a number of expressed or synthesized peptides corresponding to its C-terminal portion in the CaM-binding domain. The Ca-ATPase contains 2 sequences with high PEST score (A18, residues 1079-1096, score = 14.0, and B28, residues 1153-1180, score = 8.3) surrounding the CaM-binding domain (C28, corresponding to amino acids 1101-1128) (see Table 1 for the amino acid sequences of the peptides used). These findings made the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase an ideal tool to investigate the importance of the PEST sequences in the substrate susceptibility to μ-CANP digestion. The correlation between the PEST score and the susceptibility of the ATPase to μ-CANP digestion was initially studied by deleting the high PEST score sequences in synthetic C-terminal portions of the Ca-ATPase and then by inserting m"
https://openalex.org/W1968038037,"We have isolated a metallopeptidase from rat liver. The peptidase is primarily located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it interacts non-covalently with the inner membrane. The enzyme hydrolyzes oligopeptides, the largest substrate molecule found being dynorphin A; it has no action on proteins, and does not interact with α2-macroglobulin, and can therefore be classified as an oligopeptidase. We term the enzyme oligopeptidase M. Oligopeptidase M acts similarly to thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15) on bradykinin and several other peptides, but hydrolyzes neurotensin exclusively at the -Pro+Tyr- bond (the symbol + is used to indicate a scissile peptide bond) rather than the -Arg+Arg- bond. The enzyme is inhibited by chelating agents and some thiol-blocking compounds, but differs from thimet oligopeptidase in not being activated by thiol compounds. The peptidase is inhibited by Pro-Ile, unlike thimet oligopeptidase, and the two enzymes are separable in chromatography on hydroxyapatite. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of rat mitochondrial oligopeptidase M contains 19 out of 20 residues identical with a segment of rabbit microsomal endopeptidase and 17 matching the corresponding segment of pig-soluble angiotensin II-binding protein. Moreover, the rat protein is recognized by a monoclonal antibody against rabbit soluble angiotensin II-binding protein, all of which is consistent with these proteins being species variants of a single protein that is a homologue of thimet oligopeptidase. The biochemical properties of the mitochondrial oligopeptidase leave us in no doubt that it is neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16), for which no sequence has previously been reported, and which has not been thought to be mitochondrial.

Avian and mammalian tissues contain a Pz-peptide-hydrolyzing enzyme that is not a collagenase, and was for a time simply termed Pz-peptidase, but is now known as thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15)(4Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thimet oligopeptidase is a primarily cytosolic, thiol-activated metalloendopeptidase, which is confined to action on oligopeptides of up to about 17 amino acid residues(5Dando P.M. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

Since the determination of the amino acid sequence of thimet oligopeptidase (8Pierotti A. Dong K.-W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9McKie N. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) a family of homologous metalloendopeptidases has been discovered (for review (10Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N. Rawlings N.D. Serizawa A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The family contains exopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and endopeptidases and is thus of exceptional diversity. Two homologues, oligopeptidase A and peptidyl-dipeptidase A, have been identified in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium(11Conlin C.A. Miller C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and peptidase F of Lactococcus lactis is also related(12Monnet V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press _)PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic members in addition to thimet oligopeptidase include mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (EC 3.4.24.59), which is a matrix protein in the mitochondria of rat and yeast(13Isaya G.

Two additional homologues of thimet oligopeptidase that are of particular importance here are pig-soluble angiotensin II-binding protein and rabbit microsomal endopeptidase. Soluble angiotensin II-binding protein was discovered in the course of work directed at the identification of receptors for angiotensin II. This protein is clearly a homologue of thimet oligopeptidase, but is a separate gene product(9McKie N. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Kato et al.(16Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that pig-soluble angiotensin II-binding protein has the capacity to degrade radiolabeled angiotensin. A monoclonal antibody that was raised against rabbit-soluble angiotensin II-binding protein by Soffer et al.(17Soffer R.L. Kiron M.A.R. Mitra A. Fluharty S.J. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 5: 192-203Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) has been valuable in the present study. It was also noted by McKie et al.(9McKie N. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Kato et al.(16Kato A. Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the deduced sequence of pig-soluble angiotensin II-binding protein is so similar to that of the rabbit enzyme termed microsomal endopeptidase (18Kawabata S. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10331-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kawabata S. Nakagawa K. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12498-12503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as to indicate that the proteins are species variants of a single enzyme. The microsomal metalloendopeptidase has been suggested to be responsible for the post-translational processing of -carboxyglutamic acid-containing blood coagulation factors. A further metallopeptidase that we need to introduce is one that has been termed neurotensin-degrading enzyme, and for which the recommended name is now neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16). The enzyme is present in the cytosol and membrane fractions of brain, kidney, and other tissues, and it has been proposed to have the physiological function of destroying neurotensin and other bioactive peptides(20Barelli H. Fox-Threlkeld J.E.T. Dive V. Daniel E.E. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Mentlein R. Dahms P. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In many respects, the activity of neurolysin resembles that of thimet oligopeptidase, but neurolysin is distinguished by its cleavage of neurotensin at the -Pro+Tyr- bond(22Barelli H. Vincent J.-P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), its sensitivity to inhibition by Pro-Ile(23Dauch P. Vincent J.-P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and lack of thiol activation. Despite much work on the enzyme, no amino acid sequence data have been reported for neurolysin. Heidrich et al.(24Heidrich H.G. Prokopova D. Hannig K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1969; 350: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Heidrich H.-G. Kronschnabl O. Hannig K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) described Pz-peptidase activity in rat liver mitochondria, and Tisljar and Barrett (26Tisljar U. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) established that the mitochondria enzyme is distinct from thimet oligopeptidase, although there are similarities in substrate specificity. In particular, both enzymes hydrolyze a quenched fluorescence substrate related in structure to the Pz-peptide, QF02. In the present paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of the mitochondrial peptidase, which we term oligopeptidase M. Our study of oligopeptidase M leads us to conclude that oligopeptidase M, soluble angiotensin II-binding protein, microsomal endopeptidase, and neurolysin are all one. In consequence of this, we find ourselves in possession of detailed knowledge of the primary structure and enzymology of a new member of the thimet oligopeptidase family of metallopeptidases. Bz-Gly-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAb, and the quenched fluorescence (QF) substrates QF01, QF02, QF34, and QF37 were provided by Dr. C. G. Knight of the Strangeways Research Laboratory, following synthesis as described (27Barrett A.J. Knight C.G. Brown M.A. Tisljar U. Biochem.

Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) or by standard methods. QF02 was also purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. (United Kingdom) (product 03-32-5024). Z-Thioprolylthiazolidine was given by Dr. Tadashi Yoshimoto (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852, Japan). W-1 was from Sigma. Bradykinin, the dynorphin-related peptides, neurotensin, and Pro-Ile were from Sigma. Thimet oligopeptidase was purified from rat testis (5Dando P.M. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or E. coli expressing the rat testis enzyme(30McKie N. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), as specified in the text. Pig prolyl oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) was given by Dr. S. R. Stone (Department of Haematology, MRC Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 2QH, U.K.). Monoclonal antibody M3C to rabbit-soluble angiotensin II-binding protein was given by Dr. R. L. Soffer, Cornell University Medical College, New York. Biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and avidin-peroxidase were from Vector Laboratories, Peterborough U.K. Antiserum against recombinant rat thimet oligopeptidase was raised in three rabbits, each of which was injected subcutaneously with 50 μg of the recombinant enzyme at 0, 1, 2, and 7 months. The immunogen was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant for the first injection and incomplete adjuvant subsequently. Sera from bleeds taken 8 days after the third and fourth injections were combined. Immunoglobulin G was prepared by triple precipitation from 2.7 M ammonium sulfate, and the final precipitate was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and dialyzed against the same. Specific antibody was affinity purified by use of a column in which the recombinant enzyme was immobilized on activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The antibody eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.3, was termed R646/P. Antiserum against oligopeptidase M was raised in a sheep by two intramuscular injections of 50 μg emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, 1 month apart. Sera from bleeds taken at 7, 10, and 14 days after the second injection were combined. Immunoglobulin G was prepared by triple precipitation with ammonium sulfate as above and termed K118. Quenched fluorescence assays were made with QF02 as substrate, essentially as described previously for thimet oligopeptidase(28Tisljar U. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except that the temperature was 30°C. When activity only of mitochondrial oligopeptidase was to be measured, the activator of thimet oligopeptidase, mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, was omitted. Selective assays for either oligopeptidase M or thimet oligopeptidase were made on the basis that mammalian tissues contain three enzymes that hydrolyze QF02, prolyl oligopeptidase (a serine peptidase), thimet oligopeptidase, and oligopeptidase M (see “Results”). The activity of prolyl oligopeptidase was eliminated by use of its inhibitor, Z-thioprolylthiazolidine (0.05 μM) (31Tsuru D. Yoshimoto T. Koriyama N. Furukawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and immunoinhibition allowed discrimination between the two metallopeptidases (see below). Selective immunoinhibition of the respective enzymes was achieved by preincubation of the sample with either (a) an equal volume of a 240 μg/ml solution of antibody R646/P for 10 min at room temperature, for thimet oligopeptidase, or with 10 mg/ml of antibody K118, for oligopeptidase M. Tests with the pure enzymes established that these conditions produced 100% inhibition of thimet oligopeptidase with 0% inhibition of oligopeptidase M (R646/P) and 5% inhibition of thimet oligopeptidase with 100% inhibition of oligopeptidase M (K118), respectively. Values of K for the hydrolysis of quenched fluorescence substrates by oligopeptidase M were determined in continuous fluorimetric assays controlled by the FLUSYS software(32Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 118-119PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dando P.M. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The method included restandardization of the fluorimeter at each substrate concentration to compensate for quenching by the substrates at high concentrations(33Knight C.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 247: 45-48Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and comparative measurements were made with recombinant rat testis thimet oligopeptidase. Values for V were converted to k on the basis that the highest specific activities determined during a number of preparations of the homogeneous enzymes correspond to those of the fully active enzymes. These values (in the standard assay with QF02) were 4.0 unit/mg for oligopeptidase M and 6.0 unit/mg for thimet oligopeptidase. Values for k/K were determined directly when activity could be determined at substrate concentrations far below K, by use of the equation: k/K = v/E0S0. Values for K were determined with correction for the effect of substrate on the assumption of simple competition(7Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All steps were at 0-4°C. Rat liver (10-20 g) was rinsed with saline, chopped with scissors, and homogenized in 4 ml/g of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 M sucrose. The tissue was homogenized with two up and down strokes in a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer running at 1,000 revolutions/min, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min. The post-debris supernatant was centrifuged at 7,500 ×g for 10 min to yield a mitochondrial fraction, centrifuged again at 15,000 ×g for 10 min to give a crude lysosome/peroxisome pellet, and finally recentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to give microsomes (pellet) and cytosol. Marker enzymes were cytochrome oxidase for mitochondria(34Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), β-galactosidase and cathepsins B and L for lysosomes(35Barrett A.J. Heath M.F. Dingle J.T.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and glucose-6-phosphatase for endoplasmic reticulum(37Swanson M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 541-543Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A mitochondrial matrix marker was 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase(38Brown J.P. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by use of the Bio-Rad kit, and all results were calculated as described by de Duve et al.(39de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). Sprague-Dawley (CFY) rats were starved overnight and killed by cervical dislocation, and livers were removed immediately. All subsequent steps were at 0-4°C. Mitoplasts were first prepared by a method similar to that of Kalousek et al.(40Kalousek F. Isaya G. Rosenberg L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Rat liver (406 g) was homogenized in 4 ml/g of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (TS buffer), followed by centrifugation as described above to yield a post-debris supernatant. The first supernatant was recentrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 ×g, and the pellet (crude mitochondria) was resuspended in 1 volume of TS buffer. Digitonin (as a 5% w/v stock solution) was added to 0.045% to lyse lysosomes and peroxisomes(41Loewenstein J. Scholte H.R. Wit-Peeters E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 223: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After 5 min with gentle stirring, a further three volumes of TS buffer was added, and the mitochondria were washed twice by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 15 min) and resuspension in TS buffer. The washes were discarded, and the pellet (purified mitochondria) was diluted to a protein concentration of 100 mg/ml with TS buffer. Digitonin stock solution was added to make 0.55% digitonin, and after 15 min with occasional stirring three volumes of TS buffer was added, and the resulting mitoplasts were washed twice by centrifugation (25,000 ×g, 15 min) and resuspension in TS buffer. The mitoplast pellet was diluted to a protein concentration of 50 mg/ml in TS buffer, and W-1 stock solution (10%, w/v) was added to make 1.1%. After 30 min with occasional stirring, the suspension was diluted with an equal volume of TS buffer, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant formed the source for the chromatographic isolation of oligopeptidase M. A column (26 × 380 mm) of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.05% Brij-35, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, and 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The sample was run on the column with a 2-liter linear gradient from 0 to 0.3 M NaCl in the buffer. 15-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing activity against QF02 were combined, concentrated to about 40 ml by ultrafiltration over an Amicon PM-30 membrane, and dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Brij-35, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2 (PB buffer). A column (16 × 80 mm) of hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad Bio-Gel HT) was equilibrated with PB buffer, and the sample was run with a 400-ml linear gradient from 10 to 300 mM sodium phosphate. Fractions (3.0 ml) were collected at 7.5 ml/h. The active fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 2-3 ml. The preparation was next run on a column (26 × 650 mm) of Sephacryl S-300 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2. Fractions (5 ml) were collected at 24 ml/h. The active fractions were combined and diluted with an equal volume of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.05% Brij-35, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2. The solution was passed through a 1-ml column of Pharmacia HiTrap Blue in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2. The procedure was completed by Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2. Elution was with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.2 M NaCl run at 0.5 ml/min over 30 min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Active fractions were combined to form the final product. Electrophoresis was in 10% polyacrylamide gels (42Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Separated protein bands were electroblotted on to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) for immunochemical detection, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and glycoprotein detection(43Devine P.L. Warren J.A. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 492-495PubMed Google Scholar). Automated N-terminal sequence analysis was done by Dr. R. A. Harrison, MRC Molecular Immunopathology Unit, Cambridge. The immunoblots were developed with the monoclonal antibody against angiotensin II-binding protein (M3C) as primary antibody and biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G as second antibody. The results of a typical purification of oligopeptidase M are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. A preparation on the scale described typically yields 0.4 mg of the pure enzyme, with a specific activity of 3.0 units/mg in the assay with QF02. The enzyme can be stored in solution at 4°C for some weeks with little loss of activity.Table 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 1:Purification of oligopeptidase M from rat liver mitochondria. A, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of samples obtained during the purification of oligopeptidase M. Samples were a, mitochondria; b, W-1 extract of mitoplasts; c, DEAE-cellulose fraction; d, hydroxyapatite fraction; e, Sephacryl S300 HR fraction; f, Hitrap Blue-Sepharose fraction; g, Mono Q fraction (final product).

B, immunoblot of lanes g and h from a gel duplicating A, above, developed with monoclonal antibody M3C against rabbit-soluble angiotensin II-binding protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When run in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, oligopeptidase M (Fig. 1A, lane g) appears as a single band of protein corresponding to a molecular mass of 76 kDa, about 2 kDa less than that of thimet oligopeptidase (lane h). A persistent contaminant (seen as the strongest band in lane e) was identified by N-terminal sequence analysis (data not shown) as serine-tRNA ligase and was almost completely removed by the HiTrap Blue column. The immunoblot of a similar gel developed with monoclonal antibody M3C to soluble angiotensin II-binding protein showed a strong reaction with oligopeptidase M and none with thimet oligopeptidase (Fig. 1B). A parallel electroblot was stained for glycoproteins by the periodate-Schiff method, with transferrin as positive control. The reaction of oligopeptidase M was completely negative. The N-terminal sequence determined for oligopeptidase M by automated sequencing from a blot is shown in Fig. 2, aligned with those of related enzymes. The activity of oligopeptidase M on QF02 was determined across the pH range 6.8-8.0 in both 10 mM sodium phosphate and 10 mM Tris-HCl buffers. In both buffers, maximal activity was seen at pH 7.5-7.6. The effect of dithiothreitol on the activity of oligopeptidase M was determined in the range 0-1 mM. At no concentration of dithiothreitol was there any stimulation of the enzymatic activity, but above 0.5 mM there was inhibition, increasing to 30% at 1 mM. The activity of oligopeptidase M was decreased to 31% in the presence of 1.0 mMN-ethylmaleimide, and to zero by 50 μMp-chloromercuribenzoate or 10 μM HgCl2. Bonds hydrolyzed in a range of peptide substrates were determined as described previously (5Dando P.M. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, both thimet oligopeptidase and oligopeptidase M hydrolyzed the Pz-peptide, Bz-Gly-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAb, QF01, QF02, bradykinin, and dynorphin A in the same way. In contrast, some peptides were cleaved differently (Fig. 3B). The hydrolysis of neurotensin solely at the -Pro+Tyr- bond by oligopeptidase M was particularly striking, having been reported previously only for neurolysin(22Barelli H. Vincent J.-P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of dynorphin A by oligopeptidase M also was distinctive, since this peptide was not cleaved by thimet oligopeptidase, and indeed proved to be a potent inhibitor (data not shown). Moreover, the -Leu5+Arg- bond cleaved in dynorphin A was resistant in dynorphin A. QF34 is a quenched fluorescence analogue of dynorphin A, which again shows the cleavage of the -Leu+Arg bond hydrolyzed in the natural peptide. Suppression of hydrolysis of this bond by substitution of Leu by Ile shifted the cleavage positions by both enzymes toward the C terminus, and created a remarkably good substrate for oligopeptidase M (see Table 3 below).Table 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of the four quenched fluorescence peptides by oligopeptidase M and thimet oligopeptidase are shown in Table 2. In considering the values obtained for oligopeptidase M with QF34, it must be remembered that two bonds were cleaved (Fig. 3), but despite this, QF37 had a much higher specificity constant.Table 2 Open table in a new tab In addition to the thiol-blocking agents mentioned above, oligopeptidase M was totally inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mM, instantaneous) and EDTA (30 min of incubation with 10 mM).

DNA bending could play a structural role by altering contacts between the protein and DNA. Alternatively, DNA bending could play a more direct role in transcription activation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we inserted two to eight copies of the intrinsic bending sequence, AAAAAACGTG, into a minimal promoter containing only a TATA box. The intrinsic DNA bending sequence was a potent activator of transcription in both in vivo transfection experiments and in a cell-free transcription system. A protein binds to the intrinsic bending sequence with high specificity in gel mobility shift assays and was required for its transcription in cell-free extracts. The intercalator, distamycin, which eliminates the ability of the sequence to bend, specifically reduced its transcription by about 60%. Mutations in the sequence which abolished DNA bending reduced transcription by approximately 70% in vivo.

Protein-protein contacts between transcription factors bound at nonadjacent sites require distortion of the structure of the DNA helix by DNA looping (4Ptashne M.

Studies in which DNA bending appears to play a structural or architectural role in bringing nonadjacent sites on the DNA into closer proximity provide the clearest demonstration of a role for DNA bending. This was first shown in experiments in which the bacteriophage λ integration host factor-induced DNA bend was replaced by either an intrinsic DNA bend or by a DNA bend induced by another protein (13Robertson C.A.

A structural or architectural role for protein-induced DNA bending has also been proposed from studies of viral and cellular transcription regulatory proteins such as HMGI/Y(17Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), the lymphocyte enhancer factor (LEF-1)(18Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R.

Instead of acting as direct and independent activators of transcription, these proteins appear to function by providing a proper architectural framework in which other transcriptional regulatory proteins can function.

For these proteins, which are independent transcription activators, protein-induced DNA bending could play a direct role in transcription activation, as is seen in some prokaryotic systems(10McAllister C.F.

Alternatively, the protein-induced DNA bend could increase contacts between the protein and the DNA, helping to stabilize binding of the protein to its recognition sequence(42Paolella D. Palmer C.R. Schepantz A. Science. 1994; 264: 1130-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test these possibilities and to evaluate the role of intrinsically bent DNA, which is present in the promoter regions of the estrogen-regulated vitellogenin genes(8Dobbeling U. Ros K. Klein-Hitpas L. Morley C. Wagner U. Ryffel G.U. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we generated a series of bending plasmids containing phased multimers of the synthetic A6CGTG intrinsic DNA bending sequence(14Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), linked to a minimal promoter, containing only a TATA box. Binding of a transcription factor to this sequence makes it a potent eukaryotic transcription activator both in vivo and in vitro. Since transcription factor binding did not alter the DNA conformation, we were able to make a direct assessment of the role of intrinsically bent DNA in factor binding and transcription. Mutants in this sequence which do not bend DNA show a 3-4-fold reduction in transcription. Similarly, eliminating the DNA bend through the use of the intercalating agent, distamycin, reduced transcription in our HeLa cell extracts by 2-3-fold. In competition gel mobility shift assays the transcription factor bound equally well to mutants in which DNA bending was abolished and to the original intrinsic bending sequence. This indicated that the ability of the intrinsic DNA bend to potentiate transcription was not based on enhancement of DNA binding. DNA bending therefore appears able to play a direct structural role in eukaryotic transcription, presumably by bending the DNA and facilitating contacts between the bound transcription factor and components of the basal transcription apparatus. The series of A6 and T6 intrinsic bending plasmids were constructed by inserting a single copy of a 31-base pair oligonucleotide (TCGAGCACAACGTGAAAAAACGCGAAAAAAC) containing two A6 tracts (or two T6 tracts, depending on the direction of insertion) and a new DraIII site into the SalI site of the TATA box containing plasmid ATC0(43Chang T.-C. Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 346-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most 3′ A6 and T6 tracts begin 31 and 40 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box, respectively. A 10-base pair oligonucleotide (GTGAAAAAAC) containing only one A6 tract (or T6 tract) was ligated to itself so that it could form multimers and was inserted into the DraIII site(14Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The A9, T9, and A20 series of plasmids and the other control plasmids, 4(A2CA3CGTG), 4(A2C2A2CGTG), and 7(A2C2A2CGTG) were generated by inserting one or more copies of the following blunt ended, 20-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotides AAAAAAAAAGAAAAAAAAAG, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, AACAAACGTGAACAAACGTG, and AACCAACGTGAACCAACGTG into the SalI site of ATC0. The control plasmid, 4(A6GCGC), was constructed by isolating a DNA fragment containing the 4(A6GCGC) sequence from the plasmid HN (44Churchill M.G.A. Suzuki M.

For cell-free transcription studies DNA fragments containing zero to eight copies of the A6CGTG intrinsic bending sequence were inserted into the TATA-C2AT plasmid (45Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) after digestion with SphI and BglII. For DNA bending analysis using the circular permutation assay, the DNA fragments bearing 4(A6CGTG), 4(A6GCGC), 4(A2CA3CGTG), and 4(A2C2A2CGTG) were inserted into the multiple cloning site(SmaI/BglII) of the PCY7 DNA bending vector(46Prentki P. Pham M.H. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10060-10069Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was performed by calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation with glycerol shock(38Nardulli A.M. Greene G.L. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 43Chang T.-C. Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 346-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with a total of 8 μg of DNA, including 2 μg of bending plasmid, 0.5 μg of TK luciferase plasmid as an internal standard, and 5.5 μg of carrier DNA (pTZ18U plasmid). 48 h after a 3-min shock in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20% glycerol, the cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline and broken by three rounds of freeze-thawing in 50-300 μl of TNE (40 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity and for CAT activity by our quantitative mixed phase assay(47Nielsen D.A. Chang T.-C. Shapiro D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CAT activity is reported as counts/min/μg of protein in cell extracts. Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Blue reagent (Bio-Rad). HeLa cell transcription extracts were prepared as we have described(48Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 44-55Google Scholar). Standard in vitro transcription reactions (total volume, 30 μl) contained 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, 3 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CTP, 3 μM UTP, 500 μM 3-O-methyl-GTP (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and 25 μCi of [32P]UTP, 1 μg of pTZ18U plasmid(49Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), and 0.5 μg of sonicated herring sperm DNA as carrier DNAs, 12.5-50 ng of reporter template, 6.25-25 ng of an adenovirus major late promoter (pML300) internal control template. Reactions were initiated by adding 3 μl (60 μg of protein) of HeLa cell nuclear extract and incubated for 50 min at 30°C. At the end of the incubation, 120 units of RNase T1 was added, and the reaction was incubated for 10 more min. For in vitro competition transcription experiments, all of the components were added except for the NTP mix and preincubated on ice for 10 min. The reaction was started by addition of the NTP mix. The reaction was terminated by addition of 180 μl of stop buffer (7 M urea, 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA), extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated, and separated on 6% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gels. Quantitation of radioactive bands was carried out with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Transcription activity of the reporter template (R) was normalized using the internal control template (IC). DNA fragments containing the eight A6 sequence were obtained by digesting the plasmid DNA with HindIII and BglII, filled in with Klenow in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP, fractionated on an acrylamide gel, and eluted overnight in TE. Competitor DNAs were prepared by digesting plasmids containing the intrinsic bending sequences, 2A6, 4A6, and 8A6, with HindIII and BamHI, and electroeluting the fragments. To prepare CHO cell nuclear extracts, 2 packed cell volumes of 5 × TEG buffer (1 × TEG: 50 mM Tris-HCl3, pH 7.4, 7.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin) were added to the cell pellet, and the cells were broken with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 s, the supernatant was discarded. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in two-thirds of the original packed cell volume of 5 × TEG containing 0.5 M KCl. After incubation for 20 min at 4°C, the nuclear extract was sedimented at 46,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was retained. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described(37Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Nardulli A.M. Greene G.L. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 10,000 cpm of the 32P-labeled DNA fragment was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with the following: CHO cell nuclear extract, 1 μg of sonicated salmon testis DNA, 2 μg of sonicated herring sperm DNA, 10% glycerol, 80 mM KCl, 15 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 0.4 mM dithiothreitol in a final volume of 20 μl. In the competition experiment, the indicated amounts of unlabeled DNA fragments were preincubated with the reaction mixture for 10 min on ice before the labeled DNA probe was added. Radioactive bands were quantitated with a PhosphorImager. The PCY7-derived bending plasmids were digested with EcoRI, EcoRV, and HindIII, which generated DNA fragments of identical size which differ only in the location of the intrinsic DNA bending sequences and the mutated sequences. The samples were then fractionated by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. To test whether binding of the protein factor induced DNA bending, DNA fragments containing the mutant sequence 4(A2CA3CGTG), which does not induce DNA bending, located near the end or the middle of the DNA fragment(37Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), were incubated with CHO cell nuclear extract and analyzed for DNA bending as we have described(37Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Phased multimers of A6CGTG and CACGT6 tracts have been shown to be highly effective inducers of DNA bending(14Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 50Koo H.-S. Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). We constructed plasmids containing two to eight A6CGTG or CACGT6 sequences, repeated in phase at 10-nucleotide intervals upstream of the Xenopus vitellogenin TATA box. Since A6N4 or T6N4 DNA sequences appear to induce an 18° bend in the DNA(14Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 50Koo H.-S. Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 51Crothers D.M. Haran T.E. Nadeau J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7093-7096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Koo H.-S. Drak J. Rice J.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4227-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the bending angles induced by the intrinsic bending sequences ranged from 36° to 144°. Plasmids containing the A6 sequences on the same DNA strand as the TATA box were designated the A6 series. The plasmids were transfected into CHO cells. Plasmids containing multiple A6 or T6 tracts were potent transcription activators and exhibited a progressive increase in transcription with increasing numbers of intrinsic DNA bending sequences (Fig. 1). The plasmids containing two to eight A6 tracts consistently showed a higher level of transcription activation than the plasmids containing two to eight T6 tracts. The most powerful transactivator tested, 8A6, exhibited an increase of approximately 100-fold in transcription relative to the basal TATA-CAT (ATC0) plasmid. The 8A6 plasmid exhibited a level of transcription activation greater than the thymidine kinase promoter(53Chang T.-C. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8176-8182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but less than the adenovirus major late promoter (Fig. 1). Since intracellular nucleosome formation and supercoiling could potentially alter bending of the circular DNA used in the transfections, we evaluated the ability of the intrinsic bending sequence to activate transcription in a cell-free system. The intrinsic bending sequences were cloned into a plasmid containing the C2AT sequence (45Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and assayed in a HeLa cell extract(48Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 44-55Google Scholar). With either linear or circular DNA templates, there was a gradual increase in transcription with increasing numbers of intrinsic bending sequences. Interestingly, the linear templates (Fig. 2, right panel) were almost four times more effective in activating transcription than the supercoiled circular templates (Fig. 2, left panel). These data demonstrate that in both intact cells and in a cell-free extract the intrinsically bent DNA is a potent activator of eukaryotic transcription. In preliminary experiments we demonstrated that a protein in nuclear extracts from CHO, HeLa, and MCF7 cells, but absent in COS cell extracts, bound specifically to A6CGTG multimers (data not shown). The three gel-shifted bands we observed (Fig. 3, top panel) were most likely due to different levels of occupancy of the multiple A6 binding sites. To determine if the increasing ability to activate transcription we observed with increasing numbers of A6 tracts (Figure 1:, Figure 2:) correlated with increased binding by the nuclear protein, we carried out competition gel mobility shift assays under conditions in which the samples contained the same total number of A6 tracts. The most highly bent DNA fragment, the 8A6 fragment was the most effective competitor. The DNA fragment containing 4A6 tracts was also an effective competitor, reducing binding by 50% at a 12.5-fold molar excess (Fig. 3, lower panel). In contrast, even at a 100-fold molar excess the DNA fragment containing 2A6 tracts did not reach 50% inhibition of binding. These data are consistent with the effect of increasing numbers of copies of the A6 sequence on transcription. To test whether the protein binding to the A6CGTG intrinsic bending sequence played a role in transcription activation we carried out a competition experiment in the cell-free transcription system. Increasing amounts of the unlabeled 8(A6CGTG) DNA fragment progressively inhibited transcription of the reporter DNA containing the 8A6 sequence (Fig. 4), but not of the adenovirus major late promoter (Fig. 4, upper panel, IC). These data indicate that the nuclear protein which binds specifically to the A6CGTG sequence in gel mobility shift assays is essential for transcription activation. These studies (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:) do not discriminate between the possibility that the protein recognizes and binds to a bent DNA structure, the possibility that the protein exhibits sequence-specific interaction with the bending sequence, and the possibility that a transcription activator protein binds to the multiple AT-rich sequences. Our observation using circular permutation analysis (37Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that binding of the factor to its recognition sequence did not induce DNA bending (data not shown) greatly simplified our analysis of potential mechanisms. Since binding of the factor did not induce DNA bending, we were able to evaluate the effects of intrinsic DNA bending on factor binding and transcription in an experimental system in which binding of the protein does not alter DNA bending. To evaluate these hypotheses we prepared several variants of the A6CGTG intrinsic bending sequence. Multimers of (A9N1)n, and long homopolymeric A:T tracts with the sequence (A20)n, which cause only a very slight deformation of the DNA structure(49Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), were cloned into the minimal promoter at the same site used for the A6CGTG sequence. To determine the contributions to transcription activation of the specific nucleotide sequence and of the distortion of the DNA structure produced by the intrinsic DNA bend, we also constructed plasmids which contain DNA bends, or binding sites for the nuclear protein, or both. We employed a widely used gel electrophoresis assay (11Schroth G.P. Siino J.S. Cooney C.A. Th'ng J.P.H. Ho P.S. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9958-9964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) to measure DNA bending. The reduced electrophoretic mobility of DNA fragments containing the intrinsic binding sequences 4(A6CGTG) and 4(A6GCGC) near the middle indicates that they induce significant DNA bending (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the sequences 4(AACAAACGTG) and 4(AACCAACGTG) exhibited minimal DNA bending (Fig. 5A). We then examined the ability of the nuclear protein to bind to these DNA sequences in gel mobility shift assays. Protein-DNA complexes were only detected with the DNA fragments in 4(A6CGTG), 4(AACAAACGTG) (Fig. 5B), and 4(AACCAACGTG) (data not shown), which all contained the potential protein binding motif ACGTGA. Since the protein binds to two fragments, 4(AACAAACGTG) and 4(AACCAACGTG), which are ineffective in inducing DNA bending and failed to bind to A6GCGC, which effectively induced DNA bending (Fig. 5A), binding of the proteins to the A6CGTG intrinsic bending sequence is sequence-specific rather than bend-specific. In transient transfections all of the sequences which contained homopolymeric A or T tracts were ineffective in activating transcription (Fig. 6, A20, A40, 6A9, and 8T9). The 4(A6GCGC) sequence which is effective in inducing DNA bending, but does not bind the nuclear transcription factor, was unable to activate transcription (Fig. 6), indicating that DNA bending alone is insufficient for transcription activation. The sequences which contained the factor binding site, but had little or no ability to induce DNA bending, all showed a 3-4-fold reduction in their ability to activate transcription relative to the A6CGTG sequence (Fig. 6, compare 4(A6CGTG) and 6(A6CGTG) to 4(A2CA3CGTG), 4(A2C2A2CGTG), and 7(A2C2A2CGTG). These data suggest that the presence of a bent structure adjacent to the transcription factor recognition sequence is important to its activity. The experimental data from the DNA bending analysis, the gel mobility shift assays, and the transfections are summarized in Fig. 7. Because the two mutations which abolish DNA bending and reduce transcription by approximately 70% are in the middle of the oligo(A) tract, these mutations inevitably resemble each other. To avoid the possibility that the changes in the nucleotide sequence of the mutations, rather than their failure to bend the DNA, were responsible for the loss of transcription, we used a system in which the ability of the intrinsic DNA bending sequence to bend DNA was altered biochemically and assayed in the cell-free transcription system. The oligopeptide antibiotic, distamycin, disrupts the structure of the DNA bend by preferentially binding to the oligo(A) sequence(6Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 55Griffith J. Bleyman M. Rauch C.A. Kitchin P.A. Englund P.T. Cell. 1986; 46: 717-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It has been reported that at low doses, distamycin does not abolish protein-DNA interactions and selectively prevents DNA bending(6Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Low levels (6.6-20 ng) of distamycin, which abolish DNA bending, selectively inhibited transcription from the intrinsic bending template (Fig. 8). Since the data plotted represent the ratio of transcription of the intrinsic bending sequence to transcription of the adenovirus major late promoter internal control (Fig. 8, lower panel), it represents specific inhibition of transcription from the intrinsic bending sequence. These data lend additional support to the view that the ability of the intrinsic DNA bending sequence A6CGTG to induce DNA bending plays an important role in its ability to activate transcription. Our data did not distinguish between the view that DNA bending acts by increasing the affinity of the nuclear transcription factor for its recognition sequence and the idea that DNA bending acts more directly to facilitate protein-protein contacts important in the assembly or function of the transcription complex. We therefore used competition gel mobility shift assays to determine if a mutation which virtually abolished DNA bending, and reduced transcription activation by 3-4-fold, altered the affinity of the nuclear protein for the 4(A6CGTG) intrinsic bending sequence. Increasing amounts of the unlabeled DNA fragments, 4(A6CGTG) and 4(A2CA3CGTG), were added as competitors. The competition curves for the 4(A6CGTG) DNA fragment, which both induces DNA bending and effectively activates transcription, and the 4(A2CA3CGTG) DNA fragment, which does not induce DNA bending and is 3-4-fold less effective in activating transcription, were virtually identical (Fig. 9, lower panel). These data clearly demonstrate that reduced transcription activation on abolition of DNA bending is not due to a reduced affinity of the transcription factor for the unbent DNA fragment and strongly suggest that DNA bending contributes in a more direct way to transcription activation. Insertion of multimers of the sequence A6CGTG upstream of a TATA box is sufficient to create a powerful promoter in both intact cells and in cell-free extracts (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Transcription activation by the A6CGTG sequence might be due to the presence of multiple AT-rich sequences near the TATA box. Binding of α-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase to an AT-rich region is important in prokaryotic transcription(56Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon K. Igarashi K. Zou C. Irishama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). AT-rich sequences are found in several bacterial and yeast promoters(10McAllister C.F. Achberger E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10451-10456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, plasmids containing multimers of the A9N1 and T9N1 sequences and the A20 and A40 sequences did not activate transcription (Fig. 6), indicating that transcription activation by the A6N4 and T6N4 tracts did not result from either structural deformation of the DNA (57Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or from activator proteins binding to the AT-rich sequences. Although intrinsically bent DNA can directly activate transcription by purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase(23Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the sequence A6GCGC, which retained the ability to bend DNA ((44Churchill M.G.A. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and Fig. 5A), failed to bind the factor, and did not activate transcription (Fig. 5B and Fig. 6). These data demonstrate that intrinsically bent DNA is not an independent activator of transcription in a simple eukaryotic promoter. Our observation that the intrinsic bending sequence can titrate out an essential factor required for transcription by the A6CGTG sequence lends strong support to the view that a protein transcription factor binds specifically to the intrinsic bending sequence and is responsible for its ability to activate transcription. The dramatically greater ability of multimers of the A6CGTG sequence to act as competitors in gel mobility shift assays is consistent with both transfection and cell-free transcription data showing that multimers of the sequence are far more effective in stimulating transcription (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Also, our observations that moving the intrinsic bending sequence an additional 55 or 110 nucleotides upstream had little effect on its ability to activate transcription and that changing the phase of the bend by inserting an additional 5 or 6 nucleotides reduced transcription by approximately 50% (data not shown), are consistent with the idea that a protein transcription factor binds to the intrinsic bending sequence. This conclusion is also supported by our data that all of our plasmids containing four to eight copies of the sequence ACGTGA show significant ability to activate transcription, and none of the plasmids which lack this sequence are able to activate transcription. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the ability of the intrinsic DNA bending sequence to activate transcription is based on binding of a sequence-specific transcription factor. In scanning the DNA sequence data base for protein binding sites related to the binding motif in the intrinsic DNA bending sequence, we found only the sequence TCACGT which matches the ACGTGA sequence inverted. This sequence is located very close to the transcription initiation site (−23 to −27) in a chorion gene, is important in transcription activation(58Wong Y.C. Pustell J. Poerel N. Kafatos F.C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1985; 92: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and is conserved in several Drosophila chorion genes(58Wong Y.C. Pustell J. Poerel N. Kafatos F.C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1985; 92: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One piece of data consistent with a role for DNA bending in transactivation is our observation that transcription of a linear DNA fragment containing the intrinsic DNA bending sequence is approximately four times more efficient than transcription of a supercoiled fragment (Fig. 2). Preferential transcription of a linear template is not a general feature of this cell-free system, as it is not observed with the benchmark Adenovirus major late promoter(47Nielsen D.A. Chang T.-C. Shapiro D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is possible that the covalently closed circular template resists DNA bending. To more directly test the role of DNA bending in transcription activation, we constructed plasmids which contain interruptions in the A6 tract and therefore have negligible ability to bend DNA, but preserve the factor binding site. In transient transfections, these mutants exhibited a 3-4-fold reduction in activity relative to the A6CGTG intrinsic bending sequence. Additional support for this conclusion stems from our observation that the intercalator, distamycin, which prevents the DNA from bending(6Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 55Griffith J. Bleyman M. Rauch C.A. Kitchin P.A. Englund P.T. Cell. 1986; 46: 717-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), specifically reduces transcription from the A6CGTG sequence 2-3-fold. Taken together, our data strongly support the view that the intrinsic DNA bend induced by the A6CGTG sequence plays an important role in transcription activation. The interaction of a transcription factor with the basal transcription apparatus is often cell type and promoter specific. Our experiments were carried out with two different cell types, CHO cells and HeLa cells, and two different transcription initiation regions. The transfection experiments employ the Xenopus vitellogenin B1 promoter TATA box and its flanking DNA, whereas the C2AT cassette (45Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) used in the cell-free transcription studies uses the transcription start site from the adenovirus major late promoter. Since both the transfection and cell-free transcription studies yield similar effects of DNA bending, the data are likely to be generally applicable. DNA bending can alter protein-protein interactions by influencing the structure of the promoter region(17Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 19Natesan S. Gilman M.Z. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 59Wolffe A.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1100-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, DNA bending near protein binding sites may increase or decrease protein binding(26O'Ñate S.A. Predergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Lundin M. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2339-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To discriminate between effects of DNA bending due to altered affinity of the factor for its binding site rather than direct effects on transcription, we compared the ability of four copies of the A6CGTG intrinsic bending sequence and of the mutant sequence A2CA3CGTG to compete for binding in the gel mobility shift assay. The competition curves of the two DNA fragments were virtually identical (Fig. 9), demonstrating that the 3-4-fold reduction in transcription we observe with the A2CA3CGTG sequence is not due to a reduction in the affinity of the transcription factor for its recognition sequence. Since the A2CA3CGTG fragment exhibits identical binding to the transcription factor, greatly reduced ability to bend DNA, and a 3-4-fold reduction in its ability to activate transcription, the intrinsic DNA bend appears to play a significant role in the ability of the bound protein to activate transcription. Whatever the mechanism by which DNA bending stimulates transcription, we have developed a system in which the effect of intrinsic DNA bending on transcription can be studied in the absence of protein-induced DNA bending. We demonstrated that the intrinsic bend in the DNA sequence potentiates transcription by severalfold. Finally, we find that in this system the intrinsic DNA bending does not stimulate binding of the transcription factor to its recognition sequence. This suggests that by altering the structure of the promoter region, DNA bending may bring the bound transcription factor closer to the basal transcription complex and thereby facilitate direct proteinprotein contacts with components of the basal transcription apparatus.

https://openalex.org/W1549450785,"The catalytic sector, F1, and the membrane sector, F0, of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex are joined together by a 45-Å-long stalk. Knowledge of the composition and structure of the stalk is crucial to investigating the mechanism of conformational energy transfer between F0 and F1. This paper reports on the near neighbor relationships of the stalk subunits with one another and with the subunits of F1 and F0, as revealed by cross-linking experiments. The preparations subjected to cross-linking were bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) and F1-deficient SMP. The cross-linkers were three reagents of different chemical specificities and different lengths of cross-linking from zero to 10 Å. Cross-linked products were identified after gel electrophoresis of the particles and immunoblotting with subunit-specific antibodies to the individual subunits α, β, , , OSCP, F6, A6L, a (subunit 6), b, c, and d. The results suggested that the two b subunits form the principal stem of the stalk to which OSCP, d, and F6 are bound independent of one another. Subunits b, OSCP, d, and F6 cross-linked to α and/or β, but not to or . The COOH-terminal half of A6L, which is extramembranous, cross-linked to d but not to any other stalk or F1 subunit. No cross-links of subunits a and c with any stalk or F1 subunits were detected. In F1-deficient SMP, cross-linked b+b and d+ F6 dimers appeared, and the extent of cross-linking between b and OSCP diminished greatly. The addition of F1 to F1-deficient particles appeared to reverse these changes. Treatment of F1-deficient particles with trypsin rapidly hydrolyzed away OSCP and F6, fragmented b to membrane-bound 18-, 12-, and 8-9-kDa antigenic fragments, which cross-linked to d and/or with one another. Trypsin also removed the COOH-terminal part of A6L, but the remainder still cross-linked to subunit d. Models showing the near neighbor relationships of the stalk subunits with one another and with the α and β subunits at a level near the proximal end (bottom) of F1 and at the membranematrix interface are presented. The catalytic sector, F1, and the membrane sector, F0, of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex are joined together by a 45-Å-long stalk. Knowledge of the composition and structure of the stalk is crucial to investigating the mechanism of conformational energy transfer between F0 and F1. This paper reports on the near neighbor relationships of the stalk subunits with one another and with the subunits of F1 and F0, as revealed by cross-linking experiments. The preparations subjected to cross-linking were bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) and F1-deficient SMP. The cross-linkers were three reagents of different chemical specificities and different lengths of cross-linking from zero to 10 Å. Cross-linked products were identified after gel electrophoresis of the particles and immunoblotting with subunit-specific antibodies to the individual subunits α, β, , , OSCP, F6, A6L, a (subunit 6), b, c, and d. The results suggested that the two b subunits form the principal stem of the stalk to which OSCP, d, and F6 are bound independent of one another. Subunits b, OSCP, d, and F6 cross-linked to α and/or β, but not to or . The COOH-terminal half of A6L, which is extramembranous, cross-linked to d but not to any other stalk or F1 subunit. No cross-links of subunits a and c with any stalk or F1 subunits were detected. In F1-deficient SMP, cross-linked b+b and d+ F6 dimers appeared, and the extent of cross-linking between b and OSCP diminished greatly. The addition of F1 to F1-deficient particles appeared to reverse these changes. Treatment of F1-deficient particles with trypsin rapidly hydrolyzed away OSCP and F6, fragmented b to membrane-bound 18-, 12-, and 8-9-kDa antigenic fragments, which cross-linked to d and/or with one another. Trypsin also removed the COOH-terminal part of A6L, but the remainder still cross-linked to subunit d. Models showing the near neighbor relationships of the stalk subunits with one another and with the α and β subunits at a level near the proximal end (bottom) of F1 and at the membranematrix interface are presented. The bovine heart mitochondrial ATP synthase complex isolated in our laboratory contains 13 well characterized subunits (Galante et al., 1979; Hekman et al., 1991), exhibits completely oligomycin-sensitive ATPase and ATP-Pi exchange activities (Stiggall et al., 1978; Galante et al., 1979), and can drive via ATP hydrolysis a second mitochondrial proton pump when coincorporated in liposomes (Eytan et al., 1990). The polypeptide components of the ATP synthase are the α, β, , , and subunits of the catalytic sector F1, plus OSCP, a (subunit 6), b, c, d, F6, and A6L, which together make up the stalk and the membrane sector F0. Preparations of the ATP synthase complex also contain substoichiometric amounts of the ATPase inhibitor protein, IF1. The stoichiometry of F1 subunits is α3β3, and the stoichiometry of OSCP, d, A6L, b, and F6, as determined by radioimmunochemical techniques in well coupled SMP 1The abbreviations used are: SMPbovine heart submitochondrial particlesAppNP5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphateASU particleF1-deficient SMPEDC1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimideDCCDN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimideDSTdisuccinimidyl tartarateNHSN-hydroxysulfosuccinimideEGSethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate)EEDQN-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinolineMBP4-(N-maleimido)benzophenonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideTPCKN-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone.(Hekman et al., 1991), is 1:1:1:2:2. Bovine ATP synthase also contains multiple copies of subunit c (Graf and Sebald, 1978; Sebald et al., 1979; Kiehl and Hatefi, 1980), but the precise number remains to be determined. In intact mitochondria, there is 1 mol of IF1/mol of F1 (Hekman et al., 1991). By comparison, the Escherichia coli ATP synthase is composed of only eight subunits, with the F1-F0 stoichiometry α3β3-ab2c (Fillingame, 1990). Mitochondrial subunits α, β, and have considerable sequence similarity to their E. coli counterparts. Mitochondrial OSCP and are analogous to E. coli and , respectively, and, largely on the basis of hydropathy profiles, mitochondrial subunits a, b, and c are considered analogous to the E. coli a, b, and c, respectively (Fillingame, 1990). bovine heart submitochondrial particles 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate F1-deficient SMP 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide disuccinimidyl tartarate N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) N-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. Bovine and the rat F1 have been crystallized, and quaternary structures, respectively, at 6.5 and 3.6 Å resolution have been reported (Abrahams et al., 1993; Bianchet et al., 1991). More recently, the structure of bovine F1 containing four molecules of AppNP, and one molecule of ADP has been published, showing at 2.8 Å resolution the three-dimensional structures of the α and β subunits plus about 50% of the (Abrahams et al., 1994). However, structural information regarding the remainder of the ATP synthase complex is limited. Subunit c is considered to be shaped like a hairpin, with the hydrophobic arms forming α-helices that traverse the membrane and the hydrophilic hairpin bend protruding from the membrane on the F1 side. Recent two-dimensional NMR data for the isolated E. coli subunit c in a chloroform-methanol-water solvent are in agreement with the hairpin model (Girvin and Fillingame, 1993, 1994). Small-angle neutron scattering studies of bovine OSCP (molecular weight 20,967) have suggested an elongated shape of approximately 90 × 30 × 30 Å, with 43%α-helical structure as calculated from circular dichroism measurements (Dupuis et al., 1983). Other than hydropathy profiles, information regarding the structures of other ATP synthase subunits is not available. Because OSCP can be readily and reversibly removed from SMP together with F1 (Steinmeier and Wang, 1979; Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi, 1984), it is considered to be a stalk component required for proper binding of F1 to F0. In addition, our previous data, based on accessibility of ATP synthase subunits in SMP and mitoplasts (mitochondria denuded of outer membrane) to proteases and subunit-specific antibodies, indicated that OSCP, b, d, F6, and the COOH-terminal half of A6L were accessible from the matrix but not from the cytosolic side of the inner membrane, whereas subunits a and c were not accessible to the above reagents from either side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Hekman et al., 1991). This paper presents the results of cross-linking experiments involving the ATP synthase subunits in SMP. The data are consistent with the results of our earlier topography studies described above and provide information regarding the near neighbor relationships of OSCP, b, d, F6, and A6L, which appear to contribute to the formation of the stalk of the bovine ATP synthase complex. Disuccinimidyl tartarate (DST), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS), ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS), and N-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) were obtained from Pierce; nitrocellulose membrane (0.2-μm pore size) from Schleicher and Schuell; SDS, acrylamide, and prestained SDS-PAGE standards (broad range) from Bio-Rad; TPCK-treated trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone (MBP) and Tween 20 from Sigma; goat horseradish-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from Calbiochem; and an Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit from Amersham. F1-ATPase and F1-depleted ASU particles, prepared as described previously (Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi, 1984), were gifts of Dr. Akemi Matsuno-Yagi. SMP were diluted and washed with buffer and then adjusted to a protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in a medium containing 50 mM triethanolamine and 0.25 M sucrose, pH 8.0, and incubated with 1.0 mM DST for 30 min at 20°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ammonium acetate to 50 mM. After a 10-min incubation an equal volume of Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) containing 6 M urea was added. In other experiments, samples of SMP at 1.0 mg/ml in 50 mM HEPES, 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.2, were treated with 5 mM EDC in the presence of 5 mM NHS. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 20°C and were then quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, to 100 mM. After a 10-min incubation, samples were treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer as above. F1-depleted ASU particles were cross-linked at 0.5-1.0 mg/ml in the same manner as SMP. When F1 was used for cross-linking, an aliquot of the ammonium sulfate suspension of F1 was desalted on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml in the triethanolamine/sucrose buffer described above, and ATP was added to 1 mM. The preparation was then treated with 1 mM DST for 30 min at 20°C before the addition of 50 mM ammonium acetate to terminate the cross-linking. Treatment of cross-linked F1 for SDS-PAGE was the same as described above. For cross-linkings involving sulfhydryl groups, the photoactivable heterobifunctional MBP was used. MBP dissolved in dimethylformamide was added at 1 mM to SMP at l mg/ml in 20 mM HEPES, 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.2, and the mixture incubated for 25 min at 20°C in dim light. Unreacted MBP was either removed by centrifugation or first quenched by the addition of 10 mM dithiothreitol and then removed by centrifugation. After resuspension in HEPES/sucrose buffer, the particles were irradiated with an 8-watt longwave UV lamp at a distance of 5 cm for 10 min on ice, with occasional mixing. The particles were then prepared for gel electrophoresis by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE buffer as indicated above. For control, particles were preincubated with 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide for 20 min before the addition of MBP and UV irradiation. Under these conditions, no cross-linking was observed. Furthermore, SMP or ASU particles were treated with MBP and then subjected to UV irradiation at 1.0 as well as 0.1 mg/ml and analyzed for cross-linked products by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. There was no evidence of additional cross-linking at the higher particle concentration, but at 0.1 mg of particle protein/ml there was a higher yield of the cross-linked products, consistent with the less shielding effect of the particles against UV irradiation at the lower protein concentration. F1-depleted ASU particles were suspended at 3-4 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.5. TPCK-treated trypsin was added up to 0.8 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C. At various times, aliquots were withdrawn, proteolysis was arrested by the addition of 1 mM PMSF plus a 5-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and after 10 min on ice the soluble and particulate fractions were separated by centrifugation. The supernatant proteins were precipitated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antibodies to F0-stalk subunits. The particulate fraction was washed by suspending in buffer and recentrifuging, then a portion was suspended in triethanolamine/sucrose buffer plus 1 mM PMSF for cross-linking with DST, and another portion in HEPES/sucrose buffer plus 1 mM PMSF for cross-linking with EDC + NHS. Conditions for cross-linking and sample preparation for SDS-PAGE were the same as described above. Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (1951). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (1970), routinely using a separating gel containing 15% acrylamide. For optimal separation of high molecular weight cross-linked products, 10% PAGE was employed. The polyclonal antisera to ATP synthase subunits a, b, d, F6, and A6L used here were those described previously by Hekman et al.(1991). The OSCP antiserum used was from Belogrudov et al.(1988). Antisera to the F1 subunits α, β, , and were obtained previously in this laboratory, using homogeneous preparations of each F1 subunit as antigen. Antipeptide antibodies were raised in the rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-10 of subunit c (DCCD-binding protein), using the procedure described elsewhere (Hekman et al., 1991). The IgG fractions used for immunoblotting were affinity purified according to Olmsted(1981), using as a source of antigen homogeneous subunits or subunits transferred to nitrocellulose membranes after SDS-PAGE of F1 or purified ATP synthase complex. The affinity-purified antibodies were stored in small aliquots at −20°C. Conditions for immunoblotting were the same as before (Belogrudov and Hatefi, 1994), except that electroblotting was performed at 100 V for 1 h. Where necessary, nitrocellulose sheets containing the same cross-linked samples were cut into separate strips for blotting with different antibodies. The immunoblots were developed using the Amersham Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Even though our preparations of the ATP synthase complex display the same activities and inhibitor-response properties as the ATP synthase complex in SMP, we chose to carry out our studies of the near neighbor relationships of the ATP synthase subunits primarily on well coupled SMP lest the purification process, which involves the use detergents, might have introduced some structural changes in the isolated enzyme. For example, the highly purified ATP synthase complex has a low phospholipid content and an absolute requirement for added phospholipids to display ATPase and ATP-Pi exchange activities (Galante et al., 1979). In some cases, however, we used F1-depleted ASU particles to expose to cross-linking stalk subunits that F1 might mask. Among the cross-linkers employed were DST and EGS, which react with amino groups separated, respectively, by 6.4 and 16.1 Å, and EEDQ and EDC, which activate carboxyl groups for interaction with a nucleophile (e.g. amino group) to result in zero length cross-linking. EDC was used in the presence of NHS, which is thought to react with the unstable O-acylisourea adduct of EDC to produce the more stable reactive NHS ester and improve the yield of the EDC-mediated cross-linked product (Staros et al., 1986). In all cases, cross-linking conditions were optimized with respect to the concentrations of the cross-linkers and SMP, the duration of cross-linking, and the temperature of the reaction mixture. The cross-linked products were identified after SDS-gel electrophoresis of the samples and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose sheets by immunoblotting to affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised to each purified ATP synthase subunit, α, β, , , OSCP, F6, a, b, c, and d. The anti-A6L antibodies used were antipeptide antibodies raised to synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 30-43 and 54-66 of this subunit. Attempts to raise antibodies or antipeptide antibodies to the subunit of bovine F1 have not been successful to date. It should also be mentioned that Walker and co-workers (Walker et al., 1991; Collinson et al., 1994b) have recently reported the presence of three other polypeptides, designated e, f, and g, in their preparations of ATP synthase complex, which appear to have no ATP-Pi exchange activity and only partially oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity (Lutter et al., 1993; Collinson et al., 1994b). Whether e, f, and g are present in stoichiometric amounts in our highly purified ATP synthase complex is not known at this time, but their presence in SMP does not appear to have complicated the interpretation of the cross-linking data shown below. 2Coupling factor B (Sanadi, 1982) with Mr of 11-12 × 103 (You and Hatefi, 1976), which is present in SMP and restores ATP-Pi exchange and ATP-driven transhydrogenation and reverse electron transfer to ammonia-EDTA treated SMP (Stiggall et al., 1979; Sanadi, 1982), has been considered to be a component of the bovine ATP synthase (Sanadi, 1982). However, we and Walker's laboratory (Walker et al., 1991) have not detected factor B in our respective ATP synthase preparations. Representative of the cross-linking pattern observed with the reagents mentioned above are the results shown in Fig. 1, where DST was the cross-linking reagent. Fig. 1A exhibits immunoblots of a 15% SDS gel, which favors transfer to nitrocellulose molecular mass species <80 kDa, and Fig. 1B shows immunoblots of a 10% SDS gel, which contains cross-linked products of higher molecular mass. The top of each lane states the antibody with which that nitrocellulose strip was blotted. In these and subsequent figures, the fastest moving (lowest) protein band is the uncross-linked subunit, except that in Fig. 1B all of the uncross-linked F6 and parts of uncross-linked OSCP and d ran out of the gel. It might also be noted that there are no immunoreactive protein bands below uncross-linked b, OSCP, and d in Fig. 1A and below α and β in Fig. 1B. This indicates the absence of immunoreactive fragments (e.g. due to proteolysis) of these subunits in the SMP preparations used, which is an important consideration in the identification of cross-linked products. In Fig. 1A, the cross-linked products of b+ OSCP, b+ F6, and d+ A6L are marked. Also marked are two species of b+d, which are better separated in Fig. 1B. These could be the result of two types of cross-linking between d and the same molecule of b or of different types of cross-linking between d and the two molecules of b. The unlabeled top bands in Fig. 1A are cross-linked products of each subunit with α/β, which are also clearer in Fig. 1B. These species appear to be α+β, β+b, β+ OSCP, α+ OSCP, α+b, α+d, and α+ F6. The unmarked cross-linked bands seen in the upper parts of the lanes in Fig. 1B are presumably cross-linked trimers and more complex products. Essentially a similar cross-linking pattern was obtained when SMP were treated with EDC in the presence of NHS. The product of d+ A6L was particularly favored under the latter conditions, and the major cross-linked products between the stalk and F1 subunits were α+b, α+ OSCP, α+ F6, and β+d (data not shown). Although not shown in Fig. 1, SMP cross-linked with either DST or EDC + NHS and immunoblotted to anti-a or anti-c antibodies showed no cross-linked products involving these subunits. A close scrutiny of Fig. 1, A and B, suggests the absence of cross-linked products involving the stalk subunits and the small subunits of F1. For example, one would expect the cross-linked products of the subunit of F1 with b, OSCP, and d to produce a protein band immunoreactive to anti-b, anti-OSCP, or anti-d in the Mr region of 50-60 kDa. However, as is clear in Fig. 1B, this region of these lanes is devoid of any such protein band. To investigate this issue further, SMP and purified F1-ATPase were separately treated with DST and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies to the individual F1 subunits α, β, , and . The results are shown in Fig. 2. The paired lanes compare the cross-linked products of the F1 subunits as marked in the figure in SMP and isolated F1-ATPase. In the first and thirdlanes from the left, the bands not seen in the second and fourth lanes are the cross-linked products, respectively, of α and β with the stalk subunits (see Fig. 1B). Other bands common in the first four lanes are the cross-linked products of α+β and α+β plus one or another small subunit of F1. The important message of Fig. 2 is contained, however, in the last four lanes. It is seen that in SMP or isolated F1 the cross-linked products of and are essentially the same in each case, even though the yields of the cross-linked products of appear to be less in SMP (perhaps due to shielding of ) than in isolated F1. These results suggest, therefore, that in SMP and do not cross-link to any stalk subunit in the presence of DST as the cross-linking agent. Similar results were obtained when EDC + NHS were used. However, since and produced a number of cross-linked products common to SMP and isolated F1, it is clear that they are accessible to cross-linkers in SMP. The question, therefore, is how and are located in SMP in relation to b, OSCP, d, F6, and A6L. MBP is a photoactivable sulfhydryl reagent that can alkylate a thiol via its maleimido moiety. Then, upon irradiation (at about 350 nm) the aromatic ketone moiety goes into a diradicaloid triplet state, resulting in an electrophilic electron-deficient oxygen that is highly reactive, especially toward the C-H bonds of protein backbones (Dormán and Prestwich, 1994). The result is the formation of a C-C bond between the ketone carbon and the protein and cross-linking at a distance in the case of MBP of about 10 Å. Among the ATP synthase subunits under consideration here, those that contain cysteine residues are the α, , and subunits of F1 plus b, OSCP, d, and c, of which α has 2 cysteine residues/mol and the others 1 cysteine residue each. The experiments with MBP were carried out by incubating SMP (1 mg/ml) with 1 mM MBP for 25 min. Unreacted MBP was removed by centrifugation. SMP were resuspended in buffered sucrose solution, subjected to UV irradiation as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against 6 of the 7 cysteine-containing subunits mentioned. As seen in Fig. 3, only two cross-linked products were detected, one between b and OSCP at about 42 kDa, and another between b and F6 at about 34 kDa. The formation of these products required both the MBP pretreatment of SMP and the subsequent UV irradiation. When the SMP were first treated with 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide before the addition of MBP and UV irradiation, the cross-linked products shown in Fig. 3 were not formed (data not shown). As mentioned above, subunit b contains a single cysteine residue at position 197, which is close to its COOH terminus, and F6 has no cysteine residues. Therefore, the MBP-mediated cross-linking between F6 and b indicates that the COOH terminus of b is located near F6. It is also possible that cross-linking of b and OSCP involves this same Cys of b. In isolated OSCP, Cys, which is near the center of the chain, is modifiable by substituted maleimides (Dupuis et al., 1985). However, whether this cysteine is accessible for modification in SMP is not known. It was of interest to see whether the removal of F1 from SMP might alter the cross-linking of stalk subunits. F1-depleted ASU particles were prepared essentially according to Racker and Horstman(1967). These preparations are depleted with respect to F1 and suffer partial loss of OSCP. The addition of F1+ OSCP reconstitutes particles with high ATP synthase activity (Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi, 1984). The remainder of OSCP can be removed by further alkaline extraction of ASU particles, but this was not done here because our aim was to investigate the effect of F1 removal. When treated with MBP, ASU particles produced two major cross-linked products among the cysteine-containing subunits of the F1-depleted ATP synthase. One was b+ F6 as in Fig. 3, the other was a band at about 44 kDa, whose mobility and singular reactivity with only anti-b IgG suggested that it is a cross-linked b+b dimer (Fig. 4, lane 2). There were also detectable amounts of b+ OSCP (Fig. 4, lane 6). The addition to ASU particles of F1 (2 and 6 mol/mol F0, respectively, in the third and fourth lanes of each set in Fig. 4) increased the yield of b+ OSCP dimer and diminished the yield of the putative b+b dimer. There are two possible explanations for these results: (i) removal of F1 caused a partial separation of b and OSCP so that b-MBP was too distant from OSCP to cross-link upon photoactivation or (ii) removal of F1 resulted in masking of the thiol group of OSCP, making it unable to form OSCP-MBP to cross-link with b upon photoirradiation. We prefer the first possibility because structural perturbation of the stalk may also bring the two MBP-modified b subunits closer to one another for cross-linking after photoactivation of their benzophenones. As seen in Fig. 4, the cysteine-containing subunit d in ASU particles (or in SMP) did not form any MBP-mediated cross-linked products. As was shown previously, subunit d in SMP and ASU particles is resistant to trypsinolysis. It is possible, therefore, that much of subunit d, including its cysteine residue, is shielded by other ATP synthase subunits in SMP and ASU particles. These experiments were carried out with ASU particles that had been extracted twice with urea to divest them of F1. They were then treated with trypsin under relatively mild (1:25 weight ratio of trypsin to particle protein for 1 h at 37°C) or severe (1:5 weight ratio of trypsin to particle protein for 1 h at 37°C) conditions. Proteolysis was arrested as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the particles were separated from the soluble protein fragments by centrifugation and washing. Aliquots of the particles were then subjected to cross-linking with DST and EDC + NHS, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with antibodies to subunits b, d, OSCP, and F6. Before trypsin treatment cross-linking of the F1-depleted particles produced a b+ OSCP dimer in a fairly good yield when the cross-linker was DST and in very poor yield when it was EDC + NHS. This agrees with our conclusions regarding cross-linking of ASU particles with MBP and suggests that removal of F1 results in separation of OSCP from b to the extent that DST (molecular length, 6.4 Å) can still bridge the distance between them, but EDC + NHS (zero length cross-linking) cannot. By contrast, cross-linking of the F1-depleted particles with either DST or EDC produced a b+ F6 dimer in good yield (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6, second heavy band from bottom), just as it was shown in Fig. 1 for SMP. After treatment of the particles with the lower concentration of trypsin, OSCP and F6 were completely degraded in agreement with previous results (Joshi and Burrows, 1990; Hekman et al., 1991), and no cross-linked products containing antigenic fragments of these subunits were detected by immunoblotting. Also, in agreement with previous results (Joshi and Burrows, 1990; Hekman et al., 1991), subunits a and c were unaffected by trypsin and did not produce any cross-linked products when the trypsin-treated ASU particles were subjected to cross-linking with DST or EDC + NHS (data not shown). The COOH-terminal end of A6L was removed by trypsin (Hekman et al., 1991), but the remainder of the molecule, including the antigenic residues 30-43, survived, and this truncated A6L cross-linked to subunit d (see Fig. 5A, lane 9, first arrowhead from bottom) when the trypsin-treated ASU particles were treated with DST. The effect of trypsin (1:25 weight ratio of trypsin to particle protein) on subunits b and d agreed with the results of others (Collinson et al., 1994a; Walker and Collinson, 1994), which showed that b was hydrolyzed at Arg-Gly, Lys-Arg, and Arg-His, and d at Lys4-Leu5 (see Fig. 5A, lanes 2-4 and 8-10). Hydropathy analysis of subunit b shows two hydrophobic clusters of about 20 residues each near the NH2 terminus followed by a 130-residue-long hydrophilic region to the COOH-terminal end. This suggests that the molecule is anchored to the membrane via its two hydrophobic clusters and that its short hydrophilic NH2 terminus 30 residues) and its 130-residue-long hydrophilic tail are extramembranous on the F1 side. According to this picture, the tryptic cleavages at Arg-Gly and at Lys-Arg (or Arg-His) would produce two membrane-bound fragments, respectively, about 18-19 and 12-14 kDa. These b fragments, which still reacted with our polyclonal ant"

We have addressed this issue by using a multiple technical approach. Western blotting analysis with an antibody raised against human erythroid whole band 3 protein, the so-called protein that mediates the Cl-/HCO3- exchange in erythrocytes, showed that adult cardiomyocytes expressed two proteins immunologically related to the erythroid band 3. These proteins migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent molecular masses of 80 and 120 kDa. They were specifically found in the membrane but not in the cytosolic or the myofibril fractions of adult cardiomyocytes. Confocal microscopy further indicated that the immunostained proteins were mainly located at the sarcolemma and along T-tubules, typical membrane structures of adult cardiomyocytes. Using an antibody raised against a cardiac amino-terminal domain of rat AE3, we found that the 120-kDa protein is the translation product of the AE3 gene specifically expressed in heart and brain. Using an antiserum raised against a specific domain of mouse erythroid band 3 (AE1), which is not shared by AE3, we showed that the 80-kDa protein is likely to be a truncated translation product of the AE1 gene. Microinjection of the anti-human erythroid whole band 3 antibody into single isolated cardiac cells significantly inhibited the Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. Furthermore, the anti-AE1 antibody strongly decreased the efficiency of 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate to inhibit the ionic exchange. We thus suggest that the 80-kDa or both the 80- and the 120-kDa proteins immunologically related to the erythroid band 3 protein perform the anionic exchange in rat cardiomyocytes.

INTRODUCTIONIntracellular pH (pHi) modulates various cellular events including metabolism, ionic conductances, Ca2+ homeostasis, and cell division. In cardiac muscle, both Ca2+ homeostasis and Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments, which closely regulate contractility, are affected by changes in pHi(1Orchard C.H. Kentish J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C967-C981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHi also modulates gap junction conductances and in turn cardiac conduction(2White R.L. Doeller J.E. Verselis V.K. Wittenberg B.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A fine regulation of pHi is thus required to maintain cardiac function. To such an end, the cardiac cell possesses membrane ionic transporters sensitive to intracellular pH. Under acid loads, a Na+/H+ antiport is mainly activated to extrude protons from the myocyte(3Piwnica-Worms D. Lieberman M. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C422-C428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Frelin C. Vigne P. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8880-8885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Na+- and HCO3--dependent transporter was also recently reported to participate in pHiregulation from acidosis(5Liu S. Piwnica-Worms D. Lieberman M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 1247-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Lagadic-Gossman D. Buckler K.J. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 458: 361-384Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast, a rise in pHiactivates a Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, which operates as a HCO3- extruder(7Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 295: 111-137Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have been devoted to the Na+/H+ antiport in many cell types including cardiomyocytes. More specifically, the cDNA encoding the cardiac Na+/H+ antiport was recently cloned, and the protein responsible for the cationic exchange was immunologically identified(8Fliegel L. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Barr A. FEBSLett. 1991; 279: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although under physiological conditions the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger is the only ionic transporter able to alleviate alkaline loads in cardiac tissue, much less data are available in regard to the protein responsible for cardiac anionic exchange.The best characterized Cl-/HCO3- exchanger in tissues so far investigated is the erythrocyte band 3 glycoprotein. The protein is responsible for the extrusion of HCO3- ions generated by the hydration of intracellular CO2. The anionic flux allows HCO3- equilibration between plasma and erythrocyte following CO2 transport. The glycoprotein represents 30% of erythrocyte membrane proteins and has a molecular mass of 90 kDa(9Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar, 10Salhany J.M. Erythrocyte Band 3 Protein. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar). Band 3-like proteins, which share some antigenic properties with erythrocyte band 3, were identified in various nucleated somatic cells but not in cardiac cells(11Kay M.M.B. Tracey C.M. Goodman J.R. Cone J.C. Bassel P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6882-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Drenckhahn D. Zinke K. Schauer U. Appell K.C. Low P.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 34: 114-150Google Scholar). Such proteins were suggested to perform the ionic exchange function in hepatocytes (13Cheng S. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2637-2640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and brain(14Kopito R.R. Lee B.S. Simmons D.M. Lindsey A.E. Morgans C.W. Schneider K.

A. 1991; 88: 2778-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Numerous studies using molecular biology approaches show that band 3-like proteins belong to a family of broadly distributed proteins in vertebrate cells. They have been classified into three groups, namely the anion exchangers AE, ( 1The abbreviations used are: AEanion exchangerPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminSNARF1/AMseminaphthorhodafluor acetoxymethylesterBAPTA/AM1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N-N-N[prime]-N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethylesterDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonateECLenhanced chemiluminescencePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.) AE2, and AE3 on the basis of the gene that encodes them(16Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). More specifically, the AE1 gene encodes the erythroid band 3 as well as a truncated form of the polypeptide in kidney(17Brosius III, F.C. Alper S.L. Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7784-7785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AE1 transcripts were also recently found in heart(18Kudrycki K.E. Newman P.R. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 462-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AE2 ones are mainly expressed in stomach and intestine, while the AE3 transcripts are the major ones in brain and heart(14Kopito R.R. Lee B.S. Simmons D.M. Lindsey A.E. Morgans C.W. Schneider K. Cell. 1989; 59: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Kudrycki K.E. Newman P.R. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 462-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac AE3 cDNA giving the most abundant 3.8-kilobase transcript was recently cloned from a rat heart cDNA library. It is identical to brain AE3 cDNA except for one exon, and it predicts a polypeptide of 113 kDa(19Linn S.C. Kudrycki K.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7927-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).While Northern blotting studies led to the characterization of the AE mRNA transcripts in whole heart, it is not known whether the respective translation products are present in cardiomyocytes and if so, whether these proteins are anionic exchangers. Therefore, this study was designed to identify band 3-like proteins expressed in cardiac cells and to investigate whether these proteins exert the anionic exchange function. Members of AE family (i.e. AE1, AE2, and AE3) share significant (60%) sequence identity(16Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Between AE1 and AE3, sequence identity reaches 81% in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain(20Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a hydrophyllic region expected to be one of the most immunogenic. Accordingly, a polyclonal antibody raised against the purified erythroid band 3 was first used to identify band 3-like proteins in cardiac tissue. Band 3-like proteins of apparent molecular masses of 80 and 120 kDa were found in adult hearts. The two proteins were detected only in the membrane fraction prepared from adult rat isolated cardiac cells, a preparation devoid of contaminating non-muscle cells. Confocal microscopy of immunostained adult rat myocytes showed the location of the proteins at the sarcolemma and T-tubule level. Using an antiserum specific to AE1 and an antibody specific to AE3, the 80- and 120-kDa proteins were tentatively characterized as products of AE1 and AE3 genes, respectively. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that either or both proteins perform the anionic exchange in cardiac cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Human Erythrocyte Band 3 and of Its Cytosolic Domain; Preparation of AntibodiesUnsealed washed erythrocyte ghosts were prepared according to Dodge et al.(21Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar) from freshly collected human blood. Whole band 3 protein was purified taking special care to eliminate the smallest amounts of contaminant glycophorin and phospholipids(22Vasseur C. Truskolawski A. Bertrand O. Bursaux E. Prep. Biochem. 1988; 18: 293-301PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, band 3 was extracted from erythrocyte membrane by 0.5% Triton X-100. The purification of the protein above 95% was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on a DE52-cellulose column and subsequent elution from a thiol-exchange affinity column (p-carboxymethyl biogel ethylagarose 4B). The protein was eluted by 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol.The cytosolic fragment of human band 3 was isolated from the ghosts by the method of Bennett and Stenbuck(23Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6424-6432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the ghosts were depleted of most of their extrinsic proteins by incubating them with 10 volumes of 0.17 M acetic acid at 20°C and subsequent washings with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7. The membranes were collected at 14,000 × g for 20 min and digested with 1 μg of chymotrypsin/ml for 40 min at 0°C. The proteolysed membranes were discarded after centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied on the top of a DE52-cellulose column. The cytosolic fragment of human band 3 was dialysed against 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 and stored in liquid nitrogen. The preparation was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the molarity of the cytosolic fragment of human band 3 was measured spectrophotometrically in the dialysis buffer with ɛ280 = 27 mM-1 cm-1(24Cassoly R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3859-3864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Two mg of each of the highly purified antigens were run in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 42 and 100 kDa bands corresponding to the cytosolic fragment of human band 3 and whole band 3, respectively, were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and excised from the gel. The gels were homogeneized in PBS and finally dialysed against PBS containing 10% methanol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5% NaN3, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 15 g/liter DE52 pre-swollen phosphocellulose. Two New Zealand rabbits were selected for the absence of immunoreaction with their preimmune serum as assessed by Western blotting of human erythroid ghosts. The antigens were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant (v/v) for subcutaneously injections. The injections were repeated at 3-week intervals with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Blood samples were collected 5 and 6 weeks after the first injection. The reactivity and specificity of the sera were monitored by immunoblotting. The antibodies were purified at 4°C by reversible absorption with their respective antigens coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions. The pure antibodies were dialyzed versus PBS, 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C.Preparation of an Anti-rat AE3 AntibodyAn antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the predicted (19Linn S.C. Kudrycki K.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7927-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) amino-terminal domain of rat cardiac AE3 (sequence PGDTEDRGPGRN), which is not shared by brain AE3. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and to BSA. Two New-Zealand rabbits were selected for the absence of immunoreactivity of their preimmune sera as assessed by Western blotting of cardiac membranes. The rabbits were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant following three subcutaneous injections every 3 weeks. Blood was collected 1 week after the last injection and every 10 days. The antibody was affinity purified by reversible absorption on the BSA-peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. The pure antibody was dialyzed versus PBS, 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C.Preparation of Rat Ghosts, Whole Organ Homogenates, and Isolated Cardiac CellsRat ghosts were prepared from freshly collected blood according to Fairbanks et al.(9Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar).Hearts and brains from two adult rats were quickly removed from anesthetized animals, and the hearts were perfused for 5 min in a Ca2+-containing solution to wash out blood. The organs were cut into small pieces, extensively washed, and homogenized using a glass homogenizer in a Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 250 mM sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μM E64. The homogenates were centrifugated for 15 min at 15,000 × g to discard the myofilaments. The supernatants were saved and added with 4 × Laemmli electrophoresis buffer.Isolated rat ventricular cells were prepared as described previously (25Pucéat M. Clément-Chomienne O. Terzic A. Vassort G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H310-H319PubMed Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Briefly, the hearts from 250-g Wistar male rats were quickly removed and perfused in a nominal Ca2+-free medium for 5 min and then with 1.2 mg/ml of collagenase added with 30 μM CaCl2. After 1 h, the heart was removed and cut into several pieces. The tissue was then gently dissociated through a wide-bore tip pipette. The cells were filtered on 250-μm nylon mesh and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Meanwhile, Ca2+ concentration of the incubation medium was increased step by step up to 1 mM. The preparation provided at least 6 × 106 rod-shaped cells. Cells were kept at 37°C in Hepes-buffered medium adjusted to pH 7.4 and containing 117 mM NaCl, 5.7 mM KCl, 4.4 mM NaHCO3, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 1.7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 21 mM Hepes, 11 mM glucose, 10 mM creatine, 20 mM taurine, and 0.5% BSA for at least 8 h.Preparation of Whole Cell Lysate, Cytosolic and Membrane Fractions from Isolated CellsAfter spinning down the adult rat cardiac cells, the pellet was resuspended in a 50 mM glycerophosphate buffer adjusted to pH 7.4 and added with 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μM E64. The lysate was incubated at 4°C for 15 min and centrifugated at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was added with 4 × Laemmli electrophoresis buffer. In some experiments designed to fully prevent proteolysis, the cells were quickly pelleted and boiled in Laemmli electrophoresis buffer.For subcellular fractionation, the cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mM glycerophosphate, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μM E64 using a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifugated at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer added with 1% Triton X-100. The sample was kept on ice for 30 min and was spun down at 15,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was saved as the crude membrane fraction. The myofibril pellet was rinsed with the Triton-containing buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Both cytosolic and membrane fractions were added with Laemmli electrophoresis buffer prior to Western blotting.In some experiments designed to further investigate the presence of band 3-like proteins in the cytoskeleton, the Triton X-100 insoluble extract was washed in imidazole buffer containing 30 mM imidazole, 108 mM potassium acetate, 4.2 mM magnesium acetate, 30 mM sodium acetate, 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM EGTA adjusted to pH 7.1 and incubated in high ionic strength buffer (0.6 M KCl) added with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4°C. The extract was spun at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant added with 4 × Laemmli buffer prior to Western blotting.Electrophoresis and Western Blot AnalysisProtein content was estimated according to Bradford(26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213195) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 6, 7.5, or 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli(27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar). Immediately after electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (70 V, 1.5 h) according to Towbin et al.(28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44703) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites of nitrocellulose sheets were then blocked for 1 h at 37°C with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20. After washing with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, the sheets were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody or antiserum (rabbit anti-human erythrocyte band 3, 1/500; anti-mouse AE1 1/200, anti-rat cardiac AE3 1/1000). After washing, the nitrocellulose membranes were probed with the secondary antibody coupled to peroxydase (anti-rabbit IgG 1/2000) or to biotin (anti rabbit IgG 1/20,000) for 1 h at 37°C. In the latter case, the sheets were washed and finally incubated with 10 μg/ml extravidin-peroxydase for 1 h at 20°C. Proteins were revealed using nitro blue tetrazolium as substrate for peroxydase or the ECL detection system used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ECL films were exposed for 3-30 min or for 10-30 s when the extravidin-biotin system was used.Immunostaining of Cells and Analysis in Confocal MicroscopyFor immunostaining, the cells were attached to laminin-coated coverslips. They were quickly rinsed with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then incubated in 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (w/v) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS containing 1% BSA and blocking nonspecific sites by incubating in PBS added with 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mM MgCl2 for 20 min at 37°C, the cells were probed overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody (anti-human erythroid whole band 3 1/50 or anti-myosin light chain 1/200 diluted in blocking buffer). After washing the cells with PBS containing 1% BSA, they were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of Texas red- or fluorescein-conjugated affinity purified goat anti-rabbit IgG used at a dilution of 1/100 and 1/200, respectively, followed by extensive washing. For double immunostaining, sheep anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody was used to label myosin. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides in citifluor.The immunostained cells were observed in confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad) mounted on an Optiphot II Nikon microscope. Images were collected using an oil immersion 60× objective (numerical aperture, 1.4, plan Apochromat). An argon ion laser (514-nm line) and an helium-neon laser (543-nm line) were used for fluorescein- and Texas-red excitation, respectively. Confocal system was set to a resolution of 0.5-μm field depth. Kalman filtering was used to integrate the signal collected over eight frames to decrease the noise with a scan time of 4 s/frame and a rastor size of 512 lines. Photographs were made using a camera mounted on a VM1710 Lucius and Baer film recorder.Measurement of Intracellular pHIntracellular pH was measured in single isolated cells attached to laminin-coated coverslips and loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator SNARF1/AM as described previously(29Pucéat M. Clément O. Vassort G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 444: 241-256Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For such experiments, the cells were bathed in a control solution containing 120 mM NaCl, 5.7 mM KHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 1.7 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM CaCO3, and 20 mM Hepes adjusted to pH 7.4 at 32°C. In the Cl--free solution used to reverse the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, sodium gluconate replaced NaCl. All of the experiments were performed in the presence of 1 μM ethylisopropyl amiloride to prevent the Na+/H+ antiport activity. pHi was calibrated in situ using the nigericin method(29Pucéat M. Clément O. Vassort G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 444: 241-256Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Microinjection of Cardiac CellsTo prevent Ca2+ overloading and contracture during microinjection, the cells attached to laminin-coated coverslips were loaded with BAPTA by incubating them for 20 min in 25 μM BAPTA/AM. BAPTA slightly decreases resting intracellular Ca2+ and buffers any further variation in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration(30Pucéat M. Clément O. Scamps F. Vassort G. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Then, the cardiomyocytes were kept at 37°C in Hepes-buffered medium containing 5 mM 2,3-butanedionemonoxime. 2,3-Butanedionemonoxime inhibits the generation of actomyosin cross-bridges and thus further prevents cell contracture. In preliminary experiments, we checked that BAPTA loading of noninjected cells did not affect Cl-/HCO3- activity. 2,3-Butanedionemonoxime was washed out 30 min before the pHi measurement experiments and appeared not to affect the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activity as assessed by the lack of significant difference in the ionic exchange activity between untreated and 2,3-butanedionemonoxime-treated cells.Isolated cells were transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot, Nikon) and were bathed in control medium containing only 0.5 mM Ca2+. The anti-human erythroid band 3 antibody as well as rabbit affinity-purified IgG were diluted to a final concentration of 90 μg/ml in the injection buffer containing 150 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.025 mM EGTA, and 1 mM Pipes adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The micropipettes were pulled on a vertical puller, and the tips (diameter about 1 μm) filled by soaking them into a small drop of either the anti-human whole erythroid band 3 antibody or the IgG solutions allowing a short column of solution to enter the pipette by capillarity. Cells were injected using a Picopritzer II microinjection system (Biologic, France). The antibody or control rabbit affinity-purified IgG was expelled from the pipette by increasing the pressure into the pipette up to 2.5 atm for 100 ms. Transient swelling of the injection area indicated that the cell had been injected. Injected cells were then allowed to incubate for at least 1 h at 37°C before the experiments.Statistical AnalysisData are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significances were estimated by Student's t test. Results are considered significant at p < 0.01.MaterialsCollagenase (CLS4) was purchased from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). Ethylisopropyl amiloride was from RBI (Natick, MA). E64 was from Boehringer Mannheim. SNARF1/AM, BAPTA/AM, and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). ECL detection system reagents were from Amersham Corp. Rabbit affinity-purified IgG and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWestern blotting analysis with an anti-human whole erythroid band 3 antibody was used to investigate the presence of band 3-like proteins in total homogenates prepared from adult hearts. The purified human band 3 recognized by the antibody appeared as a wide band around 100 kDa characteristic of the glycoprotein. The antibody also reacted with rat band 3 in rat ghosts (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B further shows that in adult cardiac homogenate, the antibody strongly reacted with two proteins that migrated with apparent molecular masses of 80 and 120 kDa. Both these immunoreactive bands were no more demonstrable when the anti-human erythroid band 3 antibody was used in the presence of 10 μg/ml of purified human band 3 (Fig. 1B). The antibody also reacted with the 80 and 120 kDa proteins in a whole cell lysate prepared from adult rat isolated cardiac cells in EGTA and protease inhibitors containing buffer (Fig. 1B) or in isolated cells quickly denaturated in boiling Laemmli electrophoresis buffer (not shown). Altogether, these findings suggest that the 80 kDa band is not a proteolytic product of the 120-kDa protein.We next addressed whether the proteins were products of two different genes, namely the AE1 and AE3 genes since their mRNA transcripts were found in whole heart(18Kudrycki K.E. Newman P.R. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 462-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of such proteins was thus investigated in brain homogenate as a tissue that exhibits the most abundant AE3 transcript. Two proteins having apparent molecular masses of 80 and 120 kDa were recognized by the antibody in this tissue as well. However, the band at 120 kDa appeared to be more pronounced in brain than in cardiac homogenate while the 80 kDa band was rather lightened (Fig. 1B). Using an antiserum raised against a specific external domain of mouse AE1 (amino acids 571-583, see (31Alper S.L. Natale J. Gluck S. Lodish H.F. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which is not shared by rat AE3, Western blotting of cardiac membrane fraction proteins revealed mainly a 80 kDa band and two bands of lower molecular mass (i.e. 70 and 60 kDa) (Fig. 1C). In contrast, an antibody raised against the amino-terminal cytoplasmic 42-kDa fragment of human erythroid band 3 (see “Experimental Procedures”) did not react with any protein in cardiac whole cell lysate or membrane fraction (Fig. 1D) while it recognizes rat band 3 (not shown). An antibody raised against a cardiac specific amino-terminal domain of rat AE3 (not shared by mouse AE1) strongly reacted with the 120-kDa protein but not with the 80-kDa one in cardiac membrane prepared from isolated cardiomyocytes. The 120-kDa immunoreactive band was no more seen when the blot was probed with the antibody in the presence of the peptide (10 μg/ml), which served as antigen (Fig. 1E). The antibody did not recognize any protein in human or rat ghosts (not shown). When the membrane proteins were run in the same gel and the blot was cut and probed with both the anti-cardiac AE3 and the anti-human erythroid band 3 antibodies, the protein recognized by the anti-AE3 antibody migrated to the same apparent molecular mass as the high molecular weight protein (120 kDa) recognized by the anti-erythroid band 3 antibody. Taken together, the data suggest that the 80- and 120-kDa proteins are encoded by two different genes. The 120-kDa protein is close to the anticipated size (113 kDa) of the cardiac AE3 cDNA product(19Linn S.C. Kudrycki K.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 199"
https://openalex.org/W2085566578,"Hydrostatic pressures up to 2 kbar have been used to form monomers from the 14-subunit oligomer of the chaperonin, Cpn60. The fluorescence of 1,1'-bi(4-anilino) naphthalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid (bisANS), followed at high pressure, demonstrated an increase in hydrophobic exposure on dissociation. Cpn60 dissociated with first order kinetics. The transition occurred between 1.3 and 2 kbar (P50 = 1.75 kbar), and it was facilitated by MgATP (P50 = 1.1 kbar). With MgATP, the fluorescence showed a rapid first order phase (t1/2 = 3.7 min) in addition to a phase that was similar to the single phase for Cpn60 alone (t1/2 = 11.4 min). The bisANS fluorescence decreased slowly after depressurization, and the relaxation was faster at 25 degrees C (t1/2 = 58 h) than at 4 degrees C (t1/2 = 86 h) and faster still if the sample at 4 degrees C contained MgATP when it was pressurized (t1/2 = 18 h). There was no significant effect if the MgATP was added after depressurization. Analytical ultracentrifugation, after depressurization, confirmed that metastable monomers were produced that slowly reassociated to form the oligomers (t1/2 = 150 h at 25 degrees C). Immediately after depressurization, the monomers (a) had all three sulfhydryl groups exposed for labeling with 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein, (b) showed a proteolytic susceptibility that was intermediate between native Cpn60 and Cpn60 in 2.5 M urea, and (c) were not able to capture a folding intermediate of the enzyme rhodanese. After incubation at atmospheric pressure, monomeric Cpn60 regained the ability to interact with rhodanese intermediates, and the sulfhydryl reactivity fell before significantly reassociating to 14-mers. The different rates of recovery of the native properties indicate that a complex series of conformational events occur following depressurization. Finally, the monomers resulting from pressure were different from those produced from Cpn60 by the action of 2.5 M urea. These results demonstrate that there is a fast, pressure-induced dissociation of the Cpn60 14-mer followed by a conformational drift of the dissociated monomers that can be influenced by the presence of MgATP."

Here we show that a mutant strain, pay2, is disrupted for the import of proteins targeted by either peroxisomal targeting signal-1 or −2. Electron microscopy of pay2 cells revealed the presence of small peroxisomal “ghosts,” similar to the vesicular structures found in fibroblasts of patients with the human peroxisome assembly disorder, Zellweger syndrome. Functional complementation of pay2 with a plasmid library of Y. lipolytica genomic DNA identified a gene, PAY2, that restores growth of pay2 on oleic acid, import of catalase and multifunctional enzyme into peroxisomes, and formation of wild type peroxisomes. The PAY2 gene encodes Pay2p, a hydrophobic polypeptide of 404 amino acids. An antibody raised against Pay2p recognizes a polypeptide of ∼42-kDa whose synthesis is induced by growth of Y. lipolytica on oleic acid. Pay2p is a peroxisomal integral membrane protein, as it localizes to carbonate-stripped peroxisomal membranes. Pay2p shows no identity to any known protein. Our results suggest that Pay2p is essential for the activity of the peroxisomal import machinery but does not affect the initial steps of peroxisomal membrane proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W1984916149,"The molecular basis for the commitment of multipotential myeloid progenitors to the eosinophil lineage, and the transcriptional mechanisms by which eosinophil-specific genes are subsequently expressed and regulated during eosinophil development are currently unknown. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a T cell and mast cell-derived cytokine with actions restricted to the eosinophil and closely related basophil lineages in humans. The high affinity receptor for IL-5 (IL-5R) is composed of an α subunit (IL-5Rα) expressed by the eosinophil lineage, that associates with a βc subunit shared with the receptors for IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). As a prerequisite to studies of the transcriptional regulation of the IL-5Rα subunit gene, we used three different methods, including primer extension, RNase protection, and 5′-RACE to precisely map the transcriptional start site to a position 15 base pairs (bp) upstream of the 5′ end of the published sequence of IL-5Rα exon 1. To initially identify the IL-5Rα promoter, 3.5 kilobases (kb) and 561 bp of the 5′ sequence flanking the transcriptional start site were subcloned into the promoterless pXP2-luciferase vector. Transient transfection of these constructs into an eosinophil-committed HL-60 subline, clone HL-60-C15, induced the expression of ∼240-fold greater luciferase activity than the promoterless vector, identifying a strong functionally active promoter region within the 561 bp of sequence proximal to the transcriptional start site and with activity equivalent to pXP2 constructs containing the entire 3.5 kb of upstream sequence. To more precisely localize the cis-acting regulatory elements in this region important for promoter activity, a series of 5′ deletion mutants of the 561-bp region were generated in the pXP2-luciferase vector. Deletion of the region between bp −432 and −398 reduced promoter activity by more than 80% in the HL-60-C15 cell line. Further analyses of the activity of the IL-5Rα promoter constructs in various other eosinophil, myeloid, and non-myeloid cell lines indicated that the promoter was relatively myeloid and eosinophil lineage-specific in its expression. Consensus sequences for known transcription factor binding sites were not present in the 34-bp region of the promoter required for maximal activity, suggesting unique myeloid- and possibly eosinophil-specific regulatory elements. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have identified a nuclear factor(s) that binds to the 34-bp functional region of the the promoter and that is expressed in the myeloid and eosinophilic cell lines in which the promoter is active, but not in non-myeloid or non-hematopoietic lines. This functional promoter segment likely serves as the binding site for a myeloid- and possibly eosinophil-specific transcription factor(s). Further study of the IL-5Rα promoter should elucidate unique transcriptional features of this gene whose expression is essential to the commitment and differentiation of multipotential myeloid progenitors to the eosinophil lineage and to the functional activation of the mature cell.

Both IL-3 and GM-CSF have activities on other hematopoietic lineages, whereas IL-5 is more eosinophil-specific and plays a crucial role in regulating the differentiation and development of the eosinophil lineage(10Sanderson C.J. Immunol. Ser. 1990; 49: 231-256PubMed Google Scholar). Although IL-3 and GM-CSF participate in the proliferation and commitment of progenitors to the eosinophil lineage, IL-5 is both necessary and sufficient for eosinophil development to proceed(10Sanderson C.J.

In humans, the high affinity receptor for IL-5 is apparently restricted to eosinophils and hematopoietically related basophils(12Lopez A.F. Shannon M.F. Chia M.M. Park L. Vadas M.A. Immunol.

Thus, the expression of the high-affinity receptor for IL-5 is an important prerequisite and very early lineage-specific event in the hematopoietic program for these granulocytes. Of interest, IL-5 is active in vitro both in the production of eosinophils from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood progenitors as well as in the priming, activation, and enhanced survival of mature eosinophils. Overexpression of IL-5 is observed in many eosinophil-associated diseases(15Owen W.F. Rothenberg M.E. Petersen J. Weller P.F. Silberstein D. Sheffer A.L. Stevens R.L. Soberman R.J. Austen K.F. J.

The gene encoding the IL-5Rα subunit is located on chromosome 3 in the region 3p26(29Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Baker E. Sutherland G. Brusselle G. Fiers W. Devos R. Tavernier J. Eur Cytokine Network. 1992; 3: 451-459PubMed Google Scholar). The organization of this gene reflects the functional domains of this protein and shares many characteristics with other members of the cytokine/hemopoietin receptor gene family(9Goodall G.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K.

Several alternatively spliced transcripts have been identified in the mRNA and reflect the membrane versus soluble isoforms(30Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Aside from its ability to bind IL-5 in vitro(31Devos R. Guisez Y. Cornelis S. Verhee A. Van der Heyden J. Manneberg M. Lahm H.W. Fiers W. Tavernier J. Plaetinck G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6581-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the in vivo function(s) of the soluble form of the IL-5R have not been elucidated. Like other hematopoietic genes, expression of the cytokine receptor genes are likely regulated in part at the transcriptional level in a lineage-specific and temporal, developmental manner. Regulation of IL-5R expression is extremely pertinent to an understanding of the processes involved in the commitment and differentiation of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors to the eosinophil lineage. However, the mechanisms for the transcriptional control and tissue-specific expression of human cytokine receptor genes such as IL-5Rα are currently unknown. To investigate the regulation of human IL-5Rα expression, we first isolated the 5′ upstream region of the gene and mapped the transcriptional start site. We have identified a functional promoter region upstream of the transcriptional start site that is highly active in eosinophil-inducible myeloid leukemic cell lines and is active in a myeloid- and eosinophil-specific manner, and we have localized the minimum cis-acting sequence required for promoter activity to a 34-bp region between bp −432 and −398 of the gene. Two human genomic libraries, prepared from placental DNA in the λFIX II phage vector (Stratagene), were screened as described previously(29Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Baker E. Sutherland G. Brusselle G. Fiers W. Devos R. Tavernier J. Eur Cytokine Network. 1992; 3: 451-459PubMed Google Scholar). A KpnI fragment from the λghIL5Rα-2 clone (29Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Baker E. Sutherland G. Brusselle G.

HL-60-C15 cells (2 × 105/ml) were induced with 0.5 mM butyric acid (Sigma), and total RNA was isolated after 1, 3, and 5 days of culture.

Total RNA was prepared from HL-60-C15 cells, HeLa cells, and peripheral blood eosinophils obtained from a patient with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) as described previously(38Zon L.I. Yamaguchi Y. Yee K. Albee E.A. Kimura A. Bennett J.C. Orkin S.H. Ackerman S.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 3234-3241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was used to investigate whether there was an additional exon upstream of exon 1 of the IL-5Rα cDNA. Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I. After removal of the DNase I by extracting twice with phenol, cDNA was synthesized with 9 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) using 0.1 μM oligo(dT) primer in a total volume of 20 μl. Three to five μl of cDNA was added to a standard PCR mixture containing a 1 μM concentration of each primer. The PCR reaction was performed on a thermal cycler using 40 cycles of 1 min, 45 s at 94°C, 30 s at 48°C, and 45 s at 72°C. The final polymerization step was extended an additional 10 min at 72°C. Two upstream primers were used for this experiment: one forward primer, 5′-GTCTTTTGAAAGGATCT-3′, was identical in sequence with the 5′ end of the IL-5Rα cDNA as described by Murata et al.(28Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the second, 5′-CCGCATTTCTCAGGCCAG-3′, spanned the exon 1-2 boundary. The reverse primer for this reaction, 5′-GGGAGAAGTGAAATCTTTTCATC-3′, spanned the exon 4-5 boundary. Primer extension was performed essentially as described previously(39Ausubel F.M. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of a reverse primer spanning the exon 4-5 boundary (see above) was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled primer was hybridized with 20 μg of RNA from either HL-60-C15 or HeLa cells at 33°C overnight. After precipitation with 100% ethanol, the sample was dried and resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. The extension reaction was performed with 40 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase under standard conditions at 42°C for 90 min. The specific cDNA fragments were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gel. We generated a hybrid cDNA/genomic DNA probe by PCR which consisted of a fusion between part of exon 2 (95 bp), all of exon 1, and 194 bp of upstream genomic sequence. This 325-bp DNA fragment was cloned into a pGEM-T-vector (Promega). The complementary sense RNA (cRNA) probe for RNase protection was synthesized with T7 polymerase using linearized plasmid. Twenty μg of DNase I-treated total RNA from HL-60-C15 and HeLa cell lines were hybridized overnight at 46°C with the [32P]UTP-labeled cRNA probe in 40 μl of 80% formamide, 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.5, containing 400 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. After hybridization, unhybridized cRNA probe was removed by digestion for 20 min at 37°C with 40 μg/ml RNase A and 1 μg/ml RNase T1 in 350 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA, with 5 μg of carrier RNA added. Protected fragments were ethanol-precipitated and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel as above. The IL-5Rα cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 10 μg of total RNA isolated from the butyrate-induced HL-60-C15 cell line using the same exon 4-5 boundary primer used for primer extension. The cDNA was diluted to 1 ml with water, and excess primers were removed by two rounds of centrifugal ultrafiltration on a Centricon 100 filter (Amicon) for 20 min at 1,000 × g. The retentate was further reduced to 10 μl by evaporation and treated with 30 units of terminal transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 200 μM dATP in a final volume of 20 μl at 37°C for 13 min, followed by incubation at 67°C for 5 min. The tailed cDNA was diluted to 300 μl with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, with 1 mM EDTA, and 10 μl were amplified by PCR as described above, using 7 pmol of an oligo(dT)-adapter primer and 25 pmol of both the short adapter primer and a specific reverse primer, 5′-GGCGAGGACCGTGTCTGTCGTGTCTAT-3′, from exon 2 of the IL-5Rα sequence. The PCR products were cloned into a pBluescript-T-vector and sequenced with T3 or T7 universal primers. For analysis of the putative promoter region of the human IL-5Rα subunit gene, three reporter constructs in the promoterless pXP2-luciferase vector were prepared as shown in Fig. 6; a 2.9-kb BamHI/KpnI DNA fragment from the λghIL5Rα-2 clone(29Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Baker E. Sutherland G. Brusselle G. Fiers W. Devos R. Tavernier J. Eur Cytokine Network. 1992; 3: 451-459PubMed Google Scholar), a 612-bp fragment covering all of exon 1 and 561 bp of upstream sequence, and a 3.5-kb fragment including both the 2.9-kb and 612-bp regions were cloned into the promoterless pXP2-luciferase vector in the BamHI/KpnI, KpnI/XhoI, and BamHI/XhoI sites, respectively (Fig. 6A). Deletion mutants from the 5′ end of the −561/IL-5Rα-pXP2 plasmid were generated using PCR amplification of the appropriate region with oligonucleotide primers, cloning into a pBluescript-derived T-vector, followed by subcloning into the pXP2-luciferase vector at BamHI and XhoI sites. Deletion mutants containing 561, 517, 469, 432, 398, 179, and −561/-377 bp of upstream sequence were prepared; all deletion mutants were sequenced in their entirety to identify potential PCR-generated errors and to confirm the 5′ end of each mutant. The promoterless luciferase plasmid pXP2 was used for all promoter studies (40Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). A cytomegalovirus-human growth hormone (CMV-hGH) plasmid, for use as an internal control in transfections, was provided by Dr. Leonard Zon (Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Plasmid DNA was prepared, and cells were transfected as described previously using 1-1.5 × 107 cells per transfection with minor modifications(34Gomolin H.I. Yamaguchi Y. Paulpillai A.V. Dvorak L.A.

The HL-60-C15 subline and parental HL-60 cells were electroporated at 310 and 300 V, 960 μF, respectively, and the AML14.eos subline and AML14 parental cells at 350 V, 960 μF, conditions optimized for these cell lines. The U937, BJA-B, REX, and HeLa lines were electroporated at 300, 220, 220, and 150 V, 960 μF, respectively, optimal conditions previously utilized for these lines(34Gomolin H.I. Yamaguchi Y.

Luciferase activity in cell lysates prepared 5 h post-transfection was measured as relative light units (RLU) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) as described previously(34Gomolin H.I.

The CMV-hGH co-transfection provided for standardization among the different myeloid and non-myeloid lines, different plasmid DNA preparations, and individual transfection experiments(43Burn T.C. Satterthwaite A.B. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1992; 80: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the carrier DNA decreased variability due to differences in the DNA preparations for the individual IL-5Rα promoter-pXP2 constructs(45Showe M.K. Williams D.L. Showe L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An enhancer-containing vector, CMV-pXP2, was used as a positive control for each transfection as well. Growth hormone production was measured by assaying the culture supernatants from transfected cells with a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The RLU from individual transfections were normalized for transfection efficiency based on the number of nanograms of growth hormone produced per ml of culture supernatant. Individual transfection experiments were repeated a minimum of three times with at least two different preparations of plasmid DNA, and the results are reported as mean RLU/ng/ml hGH (± S.E.) or as the mean percentage (± S.E.) of the activity of the −561/luc construct in each experiment. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HL-60, HL-60-C15, AML-14, AML-14.eos, U937, BJA-B, and HeLa cell lines, essentially according to the method of Dignam et al.(46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M.

We have previously reported the cDNA cloning and transcriptional regulation of the murine mitochondrial GPAT (mGPAT). We now report the cloning of the 5′-flanking region of the murine mitochondrial GPAT. The transcription start site was identified by primer extension and RNase protection assays. A TATA box-like motif (TTATTAT) was located between −34 and −29 and a reverse CCAAT box (ATTGG) was located between −78 and −74, relative to the transcription start site. To begin studying mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of the mGPAT gene, chimeric luciferase (LUC) plasmids containing serial deletions, from −1447 to −38, of the 5′-flanking region of the murine mGPAT gene were prepared and transfected into 3T3-L1 cells. The fusion construct −1447 GPAT.LUC showed high promoter activity and deletions to −1353, −747, −322, and −86 did not markedly change the promoter activity. With all constructs, luciferase activity was 2-fold higher when plasmids were transfected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, deletion of sequences between −86 and −55 resulted in a 9-fold decrease in LUC activity in both preadipocytes and adipocytes. Deletion of sequences between −55 and −38 did not alter promoter activity. DNase I footprint analysis revealed a protected region between −95 and −65 which included the putative CTF/NF1 binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a single protein-DNA complex formation. Oligonucleotides synthesized according to the CTF/NF1 consensus sequence or the adenovirus NF-1 site showed a different and more complex pattern of protein-DNA interaction and were not able to compete away the mGPAT promoter-protein complex, indicating that a distinct protein was bound to −86/-55, a region important for the basal promoter activity in 3T3-L1 cells. Luciferase activity was increased 2.8- and 8-fold when adipocytes stably transfected with −322 GPAT.LUC were treated with 5 and 25 mM glucose, respectively, in the presence of 10 nM insulin.

https://openalex.org/W2064865655,"Raising the external Ca2+ concentration from 0.05 to 1.8 mM stimulated membrane-associated protein kinase Cs (PKCs) activity as strongly as the specific PKCs activator, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in BALB/MK mouse keratinocytes. This was indicated by the increased phosphorylation of a PKC-selective peptide substrate, Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2, by membranes isolated from the Ca2+- or TPA-stimulated keratinocytes. Raising the external Ca2+ concentration to 1.8 mM also triggered a 4-fold rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. As reported elsewhere (Moscat, J. Fleming, T. P., Molloy, C. J. LopezBarahona, M., and Aaronson, S. A.(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11228-11235), TPA stimulated the phosphorylation of the PKCs substrate, the 85-kDa myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate (MARCKS) protein, in intact keratinocytes, but Ca2+ did not. Furthermore, Ca2+-pretreatment reduced the TPA-induced phosphorylation of the 85-kDa protein in intact cells. There was no significant increase in MARCKS phosphorylation when keratinocytes were treated with a Ca2+•CaM-dependent phosphatase inhibitor, cyclosporin A, before stimulation with 1.8 mM Ca2+. Ca2+•calmodulin suppressed the ability of isolated membranes to phosphorylate the 85-kDa MARCKS holoprotein in vitro in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors such as fluoride, pyrophosphate, and vanadate, and this inhibition was overcome by a calmodulin antagonist, the calmodulin-binding domain peptide. Thus, the ability of 1.8 mM Ca2+ to strongly stimulate the membrane PKCs activity without stimulating the phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in keratinocytes is consistent with the possibility of Ca2+•calmodulin complexes, formed by the internal Ca2+ surge, binding to, and blocking the phosphorylation of, this PKC protein substrate. Raising the external Ca2+ concentration from 0.05 to 1.8 mM stimulated membrane-associated protein kinase Cs (PKCs) activity as strongly as the specific PKCs activator, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in BALB/MK mouse keratinocytes.

BALB/MK mouse keratinocytes, like primary human and mouse keratinocytes, proliferate in medium containing EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorTGFtransforming growth factorMARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substratePKCprotein kinase CTPA12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate[Ca2+]iintracellular calcium concentrationE-MEMEagle's minimum essential mediumPNFpost-nuclear fractions. and a low concentration of Ca2+ (e.g. 0.05 mM), but they stop cycling and start differentiating (e.g. form cornified envelopes) when the Ca2+ concentration in the medium is raised above 1.0 mM (Falco et al., 1988; Moscat et al., 1989; Weissmann and Aaronson, 1983, 1985; Whitfield et al., 1992). The Ca2+-activated receptors on the BALB/MK cells' surfaces stimulate phospholipase C which catalyzes the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides and the generation of inositol trisphosphates (Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4)P3), sn-1,2-diacylglycerols, and an alkylether glyceride (Moscat et al., 1989). The Ins(1,4,5)P3 triggers a Ca2+ surge, and the diacylglycerols would be expected to stimulate the PKCs which are widely believed to be principal mediators of keratinocyte differentiation (Dlugosz et al., 1992; Yuspa, 1993; Yuspa et al., 1988, 1991). Surprisingly, however, raising the external Ca2+ concentration does not appear to stimulate PKCs as judged by the lack of down-regulation of the EGF receptor, a PKCs target, and the lack of phosphorylation of 80-85-kDa MARCKS protein (Moscat et al., 1989), a ubiquitous principal substrate of cellular PKCs and a widely used indicator of PKCs activation (Aderem, 1992; Blackshear, 1993; Nairn and Aderem, 1992). This unexpected observation has cast considerable doubt on the PKCs having a role in the Ca2+-induced keratinocyte differentiation program (Brown, 1991; Moscat et al., 1989). epidermal growth factor transforming growth factor myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate protein kinase C 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate intracellular calcium concentration Eagle's minimum essential medium post-nuclear fractions. Here we show that raising the Ca2+ concentration in the medium from 0.05 to 1.8 mM does in fact stimulate membrane-associated PKCs activity in these keratinocytes, and it does so as strongly as the potent PKCs activator, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). However, we, like Moscat et al.(1989), have found that Ca2+ does not stimulate the phosphorylation of the 85-kDa MARCKS protein in intact cells as does TPA. Evidently, some Ca2+-dependent process(es) blocks the phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein, and presumably other substrates such as the EGF receptor (Mocat et al., 1989) and a 26-kDa protein found in the present study, by the stimulated PKCs in intact cells. In this study we focused on the MARCKS protein and will present some evidence which is consistent with the failure of the activated PKCs in Ca2+-stimulated keratinocytes to phosphorylate their MARCKS protein substrate being due to a direct blockage of the substrate's phosphorylation site domain by Ca2+-induced Ca2+•calmodulin complexes rather than due to dephosphorylation of PKCs' phosphorylated substrate by a Ca2+-stimulated phosphatase. EGF was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Bovine calmodulin and TPA were from Sigma. Bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X (BIS), calphostin C, and calmodulin-binding domain peptide H-LKKFNARRKLKGAILTTMLA-OH were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Fura-2-acetoxy methyl ester (Fura-2/AM) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Protein reagent was from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphoric acid (9000 Ci/mmol) were from New England Nuclear (Du Pont Canada Inc., Mississauga, Ontario). Cyclosporin A (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals) was a generous gift of Dr. J. P. MacManus of this institute. The PKC-selective oligopeptide substrate Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 was synthesized in this laboratory as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1991). Heat-treated cytosol containing the 85-kDa PKC substrate was prepared from S49 T-lymphoma cells as described by Chakravarthy et al.(1989). The Ca2+-responsive, differentiation competent BALB/MK keratinocytes were the generous gift of Dr. S. A. Aaronson (Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD), and were the same as the keratinocytes used by Moscat et al.(1989). The EGF-dependent BALB/MK keratinocytes were cultured as described by Weissmann and Aaronson(1983, 1985) and Whitfield et al.(1992). Briefly, the cells were grown in low Ca2+ (0.05 mM) complete medium consisting of 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 90% (v/v) Eagle's minimum essential medium (E-MEM, Biofluids, Rockville, MD) with 2 mM glutamine, 0.02 mM Ca2+-pantothenate, 20 ng EGF/ml, and 100 units of penicillin-G/ml. The cultures were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Stock BALB/MK cells were plated in 100-mm dishes in 10 ml of complete medium, and 3 days later the spent medium was replaced with 12.5 ml of fresh medium. On the fifth day, when the cultures contained 5-6 × 106 cells, the medium was discarded, the cell monolayers washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 5 ml of fresh serum-free E-MEM containing 0.05 mM Ca2+ was added. Two h later, the monolayers were either left untreated or exposed to either 1.8 mM Ca2+ or 1 μM TPA for 10 min at 37°C. The medium was then removed, cells washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell membranes prepared as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1991). Briefly, the washed cells were covered with 1.2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis medium (1 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), left on ice for 2 min, and then the swollen cells were scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman and lysed by vortexing vigorously for 2 min. Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, and membranes in the post-nuclear fractions (PNF) were sedimented at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The 100,000 × g supernatant was the cytosol fraction. The sedimented membranes were suspended in 200 μl of the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 μM CaCl2, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 100 μM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by triturating with a pipette. Membrane-associated PKC activity was measured directly in isolated membranes (without prior extraction and reconstitution of the enzyme in artificial phospholipid membranes) by determining the incorporation of 32P into a PKC-selective peptide substrate, Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 (Chakravarthy et al., 1991, 1992, 1994; Whitfield et al., 1992). This peptide corresponds to residues 160-166 of the phosphorylation site domain (151-175) of the MARCKS protein, a specific cellular substrate of PKC (Aderem, 1992; Blackshear, 1993). It and the MARCKS protein's phosphorylation site domain to which it belongs are highly selective substrates for PKC. Thus, their phosphorylation is not significantly catalyzed by other protein kinases such as cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases or calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I, II, III (Chakravarthy et al., 1991; Blackshear, 1993; Heemskerk et al., 1993; Orr et al., 1992; Williams et al., 1992). Moreover, the substrate peptide is phosphorylated equally by the several PKC isoforms (Heemskerk et al., 1993). The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 10 μg of membrane protein, 75 μM PKC-selective peptide substrate, and 50 μM [32P]ATP (220 counts/min/pmol) in assay buffer. After incubation for 10 min at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5% acetic acid and the samples clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. A 90-μl sample of each supernatant was applied to P81 Whatman paper which was then washed twice for 10 min in 5% acetic acid (10 ml/piece of paper). The radioactivity bound to the washed paper was determined with a LKB 1217 RACKBETA liquid scintillation spectrometer. To calculate the amount of radioactivity incorporated specifically into the peptide substrate, the nonspecific binding of 32P to the P81 papers was determined as above in the absence of the peptide. Cytosolic PKC activity was determined with a mixed micellar assay using Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 peptide substrate as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1991). BALB/MK cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (250 μCi/100-mm dish) in serum-free, low Ca2+ medium for 2 h to label their ATP pool. The labeled cells were then either left untreated or incubated with 1.8 mM Ca2+ and/or 1 μM TPA for 10 min. At 10 min, the culture medium was rapidly removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS. The 85-kDa MARCKS protein was extracted with 40% acetic acid as described by Robinson et al.(1993) with slight modification. Briefly, the cells were hypotonically lysed by suspending them in ice-cold 1 mM NaHCO3 solution containing 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 100 μM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and vortexing vigorously. Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant was solubilized in electrophoresis buffer (Laemmli, 1970). The solubilized samples were adjusted to contain 40% acetic acid, left on ice for 1 h, and the precipitated proteins were removed by microfuging at top speed for 5 min. Acetic acid extract containing the MARCKS protein was processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Robinson et al.(1993), and the phosphorylation of MARCKS protein was visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film. Phosphorylation of exogenous 85-kDa MARCKS holoprotein (prepared from S49 T-lymphoma cytosol) by isolated keratinocyte membranes was determined as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1989). Briefly, the cells were hypotonically lysed, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant cytosolic fraction was collected and heated in boiling water for 5 min. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the MARCKS protein was lyophilized. For experiments, the lyophilized samples were solubilized in PKC assay buffer and used for phosphorylation studies. The assay conditions were as described above for the direct assay except that heat-treated lymphoma cytosol (10 μg) containing the 85-kDa MARCKS holoprotein replaced the Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 peptide and the [32P]ATP concentration was 25 μM (900 counts/min/pmol) instead of 50 μM (220 counts/min/pmol). The reaction was carried out in the presence and absence of calmodulin and/or calmodulin-binding domain peptide (Payne et al., 1988) and was stopped by adding equal volumes of 2 × electrophoresis buffer (Laemmli, 1970). The 85-kDa protein was extracted with 40% acetic acid, resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and its phosphorylation visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film as described above. BALB/MK cells were hypotonically lysed, and PNF was prepared as described above. The PNF was adjusted to contain 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 μM CaCl2, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 100 μM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 160 μl of PNF was incubated with the indicated additions and [32P]ATP (25 μM, 900 counts/min/pmol) for 10 min at 25°C in a final reaction volume of 200 μl. The 85-kDa MARCKS protein was then extracted and the level of its phosphorylation determined by autoradiography as described above for the phosphorylation of exogenous 85-kDa protein. In some experiments, heat-treated cytosol from untreated and 1.8 mM Ca2+-treated BALB keratinocytes were prepared, and the MARCKS protein in the heated cytosol (10 μg/100 μl reaction volume) was phosphorylated in the presence and absence of calmodulin-binding domain peptide by PKCs in membranes isolated from untreated keratinocytes as described above for the phosphorylation of exogenous MARCKS protein. For the determination of [Ca2+]i, keratinocytes were plated on glass coverslips (Canadawide Scientific, Ottawa, Canada) in low Ca2+ (0.05 mM) E-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 ng/ml EGF. The medium was changed on day 3 and [Ca2+]i responses determined on day 5. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the Ca2+-sensitive fluroprobe, fura-2, as described in detail previously (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985; Morley and Whitfield (1993). Briefly, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in low Ca2+, serum-free E-MEM containing 2.5 μM fura-2AM. The cells were washed twice, and the fluorescence measurements were performed on small groups of 8-10 cells in the monolayer cultures using a variable diameter aperture. The figure shown is a fluorometric tracing of the ratio of the fura-2 fluorescence intensities at 505 nm following excitation at 350 and 380 nm. Protein contents were measured according to the method of Bradford(1976). Raising the [Ca2+]i concentration in the medium from 0.05 mM to 1.8 mM did not significantly stimulate the phosphorylation of the endogenous 85-kDa MARCKS protein in BALB/MK cells whose ATP pools had been prelabeled with [32P] orthophosphate (Fig. 1). Densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram revealed that the increase in MARCKS phosphorylation in Ca2+-stimulated cells was only 10-15% over control unstimulated cells. Thus, as reported by Moscat et al.(1989), Ca2+ appeared not to stimulate PKCs in BALB/MK keratinocytes. By contrast, adding a potent PKC stimulator, TPA (1 μM), to the low Ca2+ (0.05 mM) medium caused a 2-fold increase in the phosphorylation of the 85-kDa protein (Fig. 1). However, this TPA-induced phosphorylation was suppressed by 80% when BALB/MK cells were exposed to 1.8 mM Ca2+ for 2 min before adding TPA (Fig. 1). This suggested that Ca2+ induced a blocker of PKC-mediated MARCKS protein phosphorylation. As expected from these results, adding TPA (1 μM) for 10 min to the low Ca2+ (0.05 mM) medium more than doubled the ability of membranes isolated from the treated cells to phosphorylate the Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 PKC substrate peptide corresponding to a part of the MARCKS protein's phosphorylation site domain (Fig. 2A). However, although raising the external Ca2+ concentration from 0.05 to 1.8 mM did not stimulate the phosphorylation of the 85-kDa holoprotein in intact keratinocytes (Fig. 1), it, like TPA, more than doubled the ability of membranes from the stimulated cells to phosphorylate the MARCKS-derived Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 peptide in vitro (Fig. 2A). This phosphorylating activity was mainly that of PKCs because, as has been shown previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1991; Whitfield et al., 1992), more than 95% of it was inhibited by adding the PKC-selective pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor PKC-(19-36) (House and Kemp, 1987) to the reaction mixture. This was further confirmed by the fact that depleting cellular PKCs by prolonged treatment with 300 nM TPA for 20 h (Chakravarthy et al., 1989; Chida et al., 1986) substantially reduced the ability of isolated keratinocyte membranes to phosphorylate the peptide substrate and completely abolished both Ca2+- and TPA-induced increases in the membrane-associated peptide-phosphorylating activity (Fig. 3). Furthermore, bisindolylmaleimide and calphostin C, believed to be among the most specific of PKCs inhibitors (Toullec et al.; 1991, Kobayashi et al., 1989), also almost completely inhibited the basal as well as Ca2+- and TPA-induced increases in the membrane-associated peptide-phosphorylating activity (Fig. 4). Therefore, the Ca2+-induced increase in the phosphorylation of AcFKKSFKL-NH2 must have been due to activated PKCs. The increase in membrane-associated PKCs activity appeared to be due to the translocation of cytosolic PKCs to membranes because both Ca2+ and TPA significantly reduced the cytosolic PKCs activity (Fig. 2B). Thus, although Ca2+ stimulated membrane-associated PKCs activity as strongly as TPA in BALB/MK keratinocytes, the stimulated PKCs could not phosphorylate their 85-kDa MARCKS substrate.Figure 3:Prolonged TPA-pretreatment of BALB/MK cells abolishes Ca2+-induced increase in membrane-associated AcFKKSFKL-NH2phosphorylating activity. BALB/MK cells were incubated with (hatched bars) or without (open bars) 300 nM TPA for 20 h before being exposed to either 1 μM TPA or 1.8 mM CaCl2 for 10 min.

This protein appeared to be a PKC substrate because TPA strongly stimulated its phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lane B). Moreover, Ca2+ treatment not only failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of this protein but also suppressed its TPA-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lane D). Furthermore, as mentioned in the introduction, Moscat et al.(1989) found that Ca2+ stimulation did not down-regulate the EGF receptor, which should have happened if PKCs had phosphorylated the receptor. This failure of stimulated PKCs in Ca2+-treated cells to phosphorylate at least three substrates which were phosphorylated by the stimulated PKCs in TPA-treated cells could have been the result of a general dephosphorylation of the substrates due to the activation of a Ca2+•calmodulin-dependent phosphatase such as PP2B/calcineurin. To assess the role of this phosphatase in the failure of MARCKS protein phosphorylation in Ca2+-stimulated keratinocytes, the cells were treated for 15 min with 1 μM cyclosporin A (believed to be a highly specific inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, PP2B/calcineurin (Groblewski, et al., 1994)) before stimulation with Ca2+. As can be seen in Fig. 5B, cyclosporin A did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein either in unstimulated keratinocytes (lanes A and C) or in Ca2+- stimulated keratinocytes (lanes B and D) which suggested that the apparent failure of PKCs to phosphorylate the MARCKS protein in Ca2+-stimulated cells was not due to rapid dephosphorylation by calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. This is consistent with the recent report (Clarke et al., 1993) that neither the MARCKS protein nor a peptide substrate derived from it was a significant substrate for the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Since the failure to phosphorylate MARCKS was not attributable to Ca2+-dependent phosphatase activity, it must have been due to something else, perhaps the direct binding of Ca2+•calmodulin complexes to MARCKS which is known to occur in vitro (Aderem, 1992; Blackshear, 1993; Nairn and Aderem, 1992) and believed to occur in vivo (Hinrichen and Blackshear, 1993). Thus, we attempted to find out whether Ca2+•calmodulin might prevent PKCs from phosphorylating MARCKS protein by binding to the protein and blocking its phosphorylation site domain. For Ca2+•calmodulin complexes to prevent PKCs from gaining access to the MARCKS protein's phosphorylation site domain, they must be produced before the PKCs are activated. Raising the Ca2+ concentration in the medium from 0.05 to 1.8 mM triggered a Ca2+ surge (Fig. 6) which peaked by 3 min at a value (394 ± 66 nM; n = 5) which was 4.6 ± 0.9-fold higher than the basal value (85 ± 16 nM; n = 5). This Ca2+ surge clearly preceded the PKCs activation which peaked at 10 min (data not shown). Such a rapid and large internal Ca2+ surge would generate Ca2+•calmodulin complexes, which are known to be able to bind to the MARCKS protein and modulate its activities (Aderem, 1992; Albert et al., 1984; Blackshear, 1993; Nairn and Aderem, 1992), well before PKCs activation. To find out whether the interaction of MARCKS protein with Ca2+•calmodulin could in fact block its phosphorylation by PKCs, the ability of membranes from unstimulated keratinocytes to phosphorylate the 85-kDa MARCKS holoprotein in vitro was determined in the presence of various concentrations of exogenous calmodulin in a reaction mixture containing 1 μM added Ca2+. Since the contaminating Ca2+ in the assay medium was 4 μM (as determined by atomic emission spectrometry, Chakravarthy et al., 1994), the total Ca2+ concentration in the reaction mixture was 5 μM. It should also be noted that the reaction mixture contained three phosphatase inhibitors, sodium vanadate, sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium fluoride. It is apparent from Fig. 7A that Ca2+•calmodulin blocked the phosphorylation of the MARCKS holoprotein in a dose-dependent manner with the maximally effective concentration being 6 μg/100 μl (4 μM) which is within the physiological range of cellular calmodulin concentration (Blackshear, 1993; Klee and Vanaman, 1982). This inhibition of MARCKS phosphorylation (Fig. 7B, lane B) was completely overcome by a calmodulin antagonist, the calmodulin-binding domain peptide, H-LKKFNARRKLKGAILTTMLA-OH (Payne et al., 1988) which would compete with MARCKS for Ca2+•calmodulin (Fig. 7B, lanes C and F). It should be noted that the calmodulin-binding domain peptide itself did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of the 85-kDa protein (Fig. 7B, lanes D and E) or Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 (data not shown). Thus, the failure of Ca2+ to stimulate the phosphorylation of the 85-kDa MARCKS protein in the BALB/MK keratinocytes, despite a large increase in the ability of their membranes to phosphorylate the MARCKS-derived Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 peptide, could have been due to a direct interference by Ca2+•calmodulin complexes.Figure 7:Ca2+•calmodulin inhibits the phosphorylation of the exogenous 85-kDa protein by isolated keratinocyte membranes and the inhibition is overcome by the calmodulin antagonist, H-LKKFNARRKLKGAILTTMLA-OH. A, phosphorylation of the exogenous 85-kDa protein by membranes isolated from untreated BALB/MK cells was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” in the presence of 0 (A), 2 (B), 4 (C), 6 (D), 8 (E), and 10 (F) μg of calmodulin in the reaction mixture. B, phosphorylation of the exogenous 85-kDa protein by keratinocyte membranes was determined as described above. The reaction was carried out with no additions (A), with 10 μg of calmodulin (B), with 10 μg of calmodulin and 5 μg of calmodulin antagonist (C), with 5 μg calmodulin antagonist (D), with 10 μg of calmodulin antagonist (E), and with 10 μg of calmodulin and 10 μg of calmodulin antagonist (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To find out whether the failure of the Ca2+-induced increase in membrane PKC activity to stimulate the phosphorylation of the 85-kDa MARCKS protein occurred only in intact cells, phosphorylation of this protein was determined in BALB/MK cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 8A, treating a keratinocyte PNF with 100 μM Ca2+ almost tripled the membrane-associated PKCs activity as indicated by the increased phosphorylation of Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 peptide by the subsequently isolated membranes. Unlike the Ca2+-stimulated PKCs in intact cells, the Ca2+-stimulated PKCs in the post-nuclear fraction were able to phosphorylate the endogenous MARCKS protein (Fig. 8B), probably because the endogenous calmodulin concentration had been reduced to an ineffective level by dilution during the preparation of the fraction. Indeed the MARCKS phosphorylation was suppressed by adding calmodulin to the reaction mixture, and this suppression was overcome by the calmodulin-binding domain peptide (Fig. 8B). These results also eliminated the possibility that the inability of Ca2+ to stimulate MARCKS protein phosphorylation in intact cells was due to the stimulation of PKC isoform(s) for which this protein was a poor substrate. Parenthetically, phosphatases could not have affected the phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in PNF because of the presence of three general phosphatase inhibitors used in the experiments of Fig. 7. Thus, the suppression of MARCKS phosphorylation by calmodulin was probably not due to the stimulation of endogenous Ca2+• calmodulin-dependent phosphatase(s). The results presented so far suggested that the failure of MARCKS protein to be phosphorylated significantly by the stimulated PKCs in Ca2+-treated BALB/MK keratinocytes might be due to the binding of Ca2+•calmodulin complexes to the MARCKS protein. The possibility of a physiologically significant intracellular association of calmodulin and MARCKS has been strongly suggested by the results of experiments of Hinrichen and Blackshear(1993) which showed that microinjection of MARCKS-derived peptide into Paramecium could reverse Ca2+•calmodulin-induced ciliary beating. To try to demonstrate an in vivo interaction of MARCKS and Ca2+•calmodulin in intact BALB/MK keratinocytes, cells were treated with 100 μM calmodulin antagonists, calmidazolium or the naphthalene sulfonamide W-7 for 20 min before stimulation with 1.8 mM Ca2+. But we observed only a marginal increase (about 20%) in the phosphorylation of MARCKS protein in Ca2+-stimulated cells, possibly because these agents, besides affecting Ca2+•calmodulin, also have other effects such as reducing PKCs activity and/or affecting movement of ions, including Ca2+, across the cell membrane (Busse et al., 1988; Hegemann and Mahle, 1991). We have also found that 10 μM calmidazolium could by itself induce a 4-fold increase in [Ca2+]i in BALB/MK keratinocytes (data not shown). Since MARCKS and calmodulin are heat-stable proteins (Chakravarthy et al., 1989; Sharma and Wang, 1979), an alternative approach was taken to find out whether calmodulin could bind MARCKS protein under physiological conditions. Cytosolic fractions from untreated and Ca2+-treated keratinocytes were first heated in boiling water for 5 min to eliminate enzyme activities while preserving MARCKS protein and calmodulin. Then the ability of the PKCs in standard membranes from untreated BALB/MK cells to phosphorylate the MARCKS protein in the heated cytosol was determined in the presence and absence of calmodulin-binding peptide. As can be seen in Fig. 9, adding the calmodulin-binding peptide to the reaction mixture significantly increased the phosphorylation of MARCKS protein in the heated cytosol from untreated and Ca2+-treated keratinocytes by the PKCs in intact keratinocyte membranes. This result is consistent with pre-existence in the cytosol of MARCKS•calmodulin complexes which could be dissociated by the calmodulin-binding peptide to render the MARCKS protein maximally phosphorylatable by PKCs in the test membranes. It is unlikely that the MARCKS•calmodulin complexes were formed during cell lysis because of a large dilution of calmodulin in the lysis medium as discussed for the PNF experiments (Fig. 8). It should be noted that these results indicate that binding of calmodulin to MARCKS protein can occur at physiological concentrations of calmodulin because there was no exogenous calmodulin present during the preparation of heat-treated cytosol. Although these results provide strong, albeit indirect, evidence supporting the hypothesis that calmodulin binding modulates the PKCs-mediated phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in BALB/MK keratinocytes, other ways must be found (e.g. use of permeabilized cells to get calmodulin-binding peptide into the cell) to prove more directly that Ca2+•calmodulin complexes can inhibit the phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in intact keratinocytes as they can in broken cell preparations (Fig. 8). In conclusion, the Ca2+-triggered differentiation signal in BALB/MK keratinocytes includes a large internal Ca2+ surge followed by a strong stimulation of membrane-associated PKCs activity. However, the stimulated PKCs cannot phosphorylate one of their principal intracellular substrates, the 85-kDa MARCKS protein as well as others such as a 26-kDa protein (Fig. 5) and EGF receptor (Moscat et al. 1989). The reason why the Ca2+-stimulated membrane-associated PKCs do not stimulate the MARCKS protein phosphorylation could be the binding of Ca2+•calmodulin complexes (produced by the intracellular Ca2+ surge (Fig. 6)) to the protein's actin-binding site before the stimulation of membrane-associated PKCs (Aderem, 1992; Blackshear, 1993; Nairn and Aderem, 1992). Regardless of what the mechanism responsible for blocking PKCs action turns out to be in BALB/MK cells, it is clear that the phosphorylation of the ubiquitous 85-kDa MARCKS protein does not serve as a marker of PKCs activation in some cells, especially if the agonist should rapidly trigger a large intracellular Ca2+ surge. It is apparent that the phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein by PKCs is not needed for Ca2+-induced keratinocyte differentiation. Thus, the physiological significance of Ca2+•calmodulin's inhibition of MARCKS phosphorylation is unclear, but it could affect different functions in these and other cells. Ca2+•calmodulin's interference with the PKCsmediated phosphorylation is not limited to MARCKS protein and may have broad significance. For example, in a separate study 2B. R. Chakravarthy, R. J. Isaacs, P. Morley, and J. F. Whitfield, manuscript in preparation. we have found that the PKCs-mediated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in the post-nuclear fractions of murine BALB/MK keratinocytes and human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells is also blocked by Ca2+•calmodulin and that this blockade is overcome by the calmodulin-binding domain peptide. This inhibition of phosphorylation and hence down-regulation of keratinocyte EGF/TGF-α receptors by PKCs would enhance the response to EGF and TGF-α. Another example is neuromodulin (also known as GAP-43, F1, P-57), a neuron-specific calmodulin-binding PKCs substrate whose phosphorylation by PKCs is also blocked by calmodulin (Chan et al., 1986; Alexander et al.,1987). It is likely that the blockade of its phosphorylation by Ca2+•calmodulin would profoundly affect neurite outgrowth and presynaptic neurotransmission. Clearly, further work needs to be done to better understand the cellular functions of MARCKS and how it is affected by modulation of its phosphorylation by Ca2+•calmodulin. We thank Dr. R. E. Williams for synthesizing PKC-specific peptide substrate Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2."

The results show that the transcription factor AP-2 may play an important role in regulation of transcription of the mouse Na+/H+ exchanger gene. The Na+/H+ exchanger is a mammalian plasma membrane protein that mediates the exchange of intracellular protons for extracellular sodium. It is involved in pH regulation(1Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 81: 29-52Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar), control of cell volume(2Grinstein S. Clarke C.A. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 619-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and is stimulated by growth factors(3Pouyssegur J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 453-455Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several different isoforms of the protein exist which have been designated NHE-1 to NHE-4. The NHE-1 isoform is the widely distributed “housekeeping” isoform of the family present in most, if not all, mammalian cells(4Fliegel L. Frohlich O. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of regulation of protein levels is extremely important, only a few studies have examined the human NHE-1 gene(5Miller R.T. Counillon L. Pages G. Lifton R.P. Sardet C.

Of these sites, only AP-1 has been implicated to have a possible role in activating the NHE-1 gene(7Horie S. Moe O. Yamaji Y. Cano A. Miller R.T. Alpern R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5236-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, a more in-depth study of the human NHE-1 gene has analyzed the proximal regulatory elements of the promoter(6Kolyada A.Y. Lebedeva T.V. Johns C.A. Madias N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To date, however, there has been no direct identification of any specific transcription factor responsible for regulating the NHE-1 promoter. Expression of the message and activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger has been shown to vary greatly depending on the state of differentiation (8Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and a variety of other stimuli(9Moe O.W. Miller R.T. Cano A. Preisig P.A. Alpern R.J. J. Clin.

The regulation of the NHE-1 gene, however, involves the link between DNA-binding protein motifs located in promoter and enhancer sequences and the general transcription machinery. Various cis elements of the gene may be able to activate transcription through responses to certain extracellular messages. One such element is the transcription factor AP-2. Transcriptional activation by AP-2 involves the 52-kDa AP-2 protein binding to a specific DNA motif found in the cis-regulatory region of the gene(12Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). AP-2 activity is regulated in a cell type-specific manner (13Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W.J. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and is induced by phorbol esters, retinoic acid, and cAMP(12Williams T. Tjian R.

Additionally, mRNA levels of AP-2 have been shown to increase dramatically upon differentiation indicating that the expression of AP-2 is regulated during differentiation(14Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate, for the first time, a specific region within the Na+/H+ exchanger gene that is involved in regulating transcription. Moreover, we have shown that this DNA motif interacts with AP-2 or an AP-2-like transcription factor. We report the sequence of the upstream region of the mouse NHE-1 gene, the identification and characterization of an AP-2 site, and the importance of this region for NHE-1 gene transcription.

After 30 min at 42°C the reaction was terminated by the addition of loading dye and the samples were analyzed on a 7% polyacrylamide/urea gel. NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from Dr. J. Stone of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta. They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Hep G2 cells were provided by Dr. Z. Yao of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta. These cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media with 2 mML-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and a pH of 7.2. pXP-1MP was constructed by digesting a 2.2-kb fragment containing the promoter/enhancer region with PstI and SmaI. An intermediate plasmid that contained a PstI site flanked by a HindIII and SalI was used to transfer the PstIsmaI 1.1-kb fragment into the HindIII and SalI site of pXP-1. The 1.1-kb fragment contains base pairs −1085 to +22 of NHE-1. To construct pMP+AP2 plasmid, two oligonucleotides were used as primers for polymerase chain reaction (no. 1, ttgg atc CGT GAC ACT TCC TTC CCT and no. 3, cc ttc gaa GGG TCC CGC GGT AGC GGA) were synthesized to amplify base pairs −125 to +22 of the gene. The polymerase chain reaction product had the restriction enzyme sites BamHI and SmaI generated on either end and was inserted directionally into pXP-1. Similarly, pMP-AP2 plasmid was made using the product of the primers no. 3 and no. 2 (no. 2, ttgg atc CTG CAC CGC GCG GGC GCT) and the 114-bp product (−92 to +22) was inserted into pXP-1. Mutations in pMP(MUT)AP2 were generated by polymerase chain reaction, using a mismatched oligonucleotide (no. 1-mut, ttgg atc CGT GAC ACT TCC TTT TTT AAG TAA TAT AAG CCG CTG CAC CG) similar to oligonucleotide no. 1 above. Other mutations in the AP-2 containing region were made using a similar procedure. pRSV-AP2 was constructed by digesting pRSVAP2 with EcoRI and removing the AP2 gene. All plasmids were sequenced to verify proper orientation and fidelity of polymerase chain reaction. Cells were plated onto 35-mm dishes. Each dish received 5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control. In some cases (i.e. Hep G2 cells), 5 μg of a third plasmid was also cotransfected (i.e. pSV±AP2). Both NIH 3T3 cells and Hep G2 cells were transiently transfected using the CaPO4 precipitation technique(17Argentin S. Sun Y.L. Lihrmann I. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23315-23322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 36 h, cells were harvested and the cell lysate was assayed for both luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity. Each luciferase assay contained 30 μl of the cell lysate and 100 μl of the luciferase assay reagent (20 mM Tricine, 1.07 mM magnesium carbonate, 2.67 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM DTT, 470 μM luciferin, 530 μM ATP, 270 μM coenzyme A, and 1 ng/ml bovine serum albumin). The β-galactosidase assay included 5 μl of cell lysate, 95 μl of H20, and 20 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Luciferase activity was assayed with an LKB luminometer and normalized to β-galactosidase for efficiency of transfection. Results are reported as mean ± S.E.; where not shown the S.E. was to small to be displayed. The 206-bp probe for DNase I footprinting was isolated from pXP-1MP using the restriction enzymes RsaI and HindIII. The DNA probe was gel purified and was radiolabeled by filling in the protruding 5′-end generated by the HindIII. The reaction mixture contained dATP, dGTP, dTTP, [γ-32P]dCTP, and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The fragment contained the mouse NHE-1 promoter region −171 to + 22 along with 13 bp of the 5′-end of the pXP-1 plasmid. The DNA (30,000 counts/min) was incubated with 50 μg of NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts at 4°C overnight and then treated with DNase I at room temperature for 10 s to 2 min. It was terminated with 2.5 μl of stop solution (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mM EDTA, 3% SDS) and proteins removed by phenol/chloroform extraction. After precipitation the sample was resuspended in 98% formamide dye and electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gel. Nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells according to the procedure of Schreiber et al.(18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotides of the sequence 5′-TTC CTT CCC TGG GCG ACA GGG GCC-3′ (MPAP2a) and 5′-GGC CCC TGT CGC CCA GGG AAG GAA-3′ (MPAP2b) were made corresponding to the mouse promoter AP-2 region. Alternatively, the mutant oligonucleotides of the sequence 5′-TTC CTT TTT TAA GTA ATA TAA GCC-3′ (MUTAP2a) and 5′-GGC TTA TAT TAC TTA AAA AAG GAA-3′ (MUTAP2b) were also used for analysis. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. They were heated to 95°C for 2 min and cooled to room temperature overnight for annealing. DNA binding reactions were for 10 min at room temperature and contained: 30,000 CPM of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides was mixed with purified AP-2 (1.4 μg) or NIH 3T3 nuclear extract (5 μg) in a binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). After electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 16 h. The non-competing oligonucleotide SP-1 was 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′. In some experiments nuclear extracts were treated to specifically remove AP-2 protein before gel mobility shift assays were performed. 20 μl of a 10% solution of Protein A was incubated with 2.5 μg of AP-2 antibody (IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h at 4°C. After 1 h the solution was washed three times (20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), mixed with 5 μl of NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts, and incubated at 4°C for 16 h. The mixture was then spun at 6,500 revolutions/min for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. Control experiments contained equal amounts of irrelevant IgG. To examine if the Na+/H+ exchanger gene could directly bind purified AP-2 protein, we isolated and end labeled a DNA fragment of the gene from bp −171 to +22 of the promoter. This fragment contained the putative AP-2-binding site and the surrounding nucleotides. Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described above. Two positive clones were obtained by library screening with NHE-1 probes. Clone 3-1 contained most of the coding region along with the entire 3′-untranslated region, and clone 3-3 included a section of the coding region, the 5′-untranslated region, and approximately 10 kb upstream from the 5′-untranslated region. A 2.2-kb fragment from clone 3-3 was sequenced in both directions using exonuclease digestions. The deduced sequence of the first 40 amino acids of the mouse 5′-coding region was compared with other Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE 1-4) from a variety of species. It was 90 to 83% identical to the other NHE-1 isoforms with the hamster showing the greatest identity. No significant identity was seen with the other isoforms of the exchanger (NHE 2-NHE 4, not shown). The sequence of the mouse promoter/enhancer region is shown in Fig. 1. It contains putative recognition sites for several transcription factors. This includes a TATA box, two CAAT boxes, an SP-1 site, a CREB site, and an AP-2 site (Fig. 1). The sequence TATAAA in the mouse NHE-1 gene is identical to the well characterized consensus sequence for the mammalian TATA box. Two CAAT boxes are present at sites −407 to −401 and −568 to −562 along with an SP-1 site at position −600 to −592. Both CAAT and SP-1 are characteristic binding sites for transcriptional regulatory proteins seen in many eukaryotic promoters(19Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 20Jones K.A. Tjian R. Nature. 1985; 317: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The CREB site, at position −789 to −784, is a putative cAMP response element that can activate transcription upon cAMP or Ca2+ stimulation(21Fenstermaker R.A. Milsted A. Virgin J.B. Miller W.L. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The site may be of significance since it has been shown that cAMP can modulate exchanger activity acutely(22Miller R.T. Pollock A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9115-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a putative binding site for one of the more well known transcription factors, AP-2, is located −111 to −94 and was also a candidate for transcriptional regulation. The start sites for transcription were demonstrated to occur at base pairs +1 and +5 (Fig. 1) and occur at nucleotides that are 26 and 30 bp from the TATA box. The two start sites and their distance from the TATA box are identical to that reported for the human promoter(5Miller R.T. Counillon L. Pages G. Lifton R.P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10813-10819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial experiments tested whether a 1.1-kb sequence upstream from the start site was indeed a promoter, and if so its relative ability to direct transcription in mouse NIH 3T3 cells. When the level of luciferase activity from pXP-1MP was compared to pXP-1, a 73-fold increase in activity was seen (Fig. 2A). Transfection experiments also (Fig. 2B) showed that pXP-1MP induced 23.8-fold less luciferase activity than the Rous sarcoma virus RSV promoter located 5′ to the luciferase gene (pRSVLUC). This indicates that the promoter for the mouse NHE-1 gene is relatively weak at directing transcription in comparison to pRSVLUC. These results could provide an explanation for the low levels of exchanger protein and mRNA present in mammalian tissues(4Fliegel L. Frohlich O. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Another set of experiments examined the relative ability of an 8-kb fragment of the NHE-1 promoter/enhancer region to direct transcription. This fragment did not stimulate transcription greater than the 1.1-kb fragment (not shown). To examine which of the identified consensus sequences are involved in regulation of NHE-1 transcription, we constructed several different plasmids containing varying fragments of the promoter/enhancer region. We initially removed all base pairs upstream of the AP-2 site from pXP-1MP. This construct was named pMP+AP2. The second construct, pMP-AP2, was identical to pMP+AP2 except for the further deletion of the AP-2 site. We then examined the ability of these two plasmids to direct transcription of the luciferase gene. They were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells along with pSV-β-galactosidase which was used to normalize for any differences in transfection efficiency. Panels C and D in Fig. 2 are comparisons between the plasmid containing the entire sequenced region (pXP-1MP), the plasmid containing the AP-2-binding site (pMP+AP2) and the plasmid with the AP-2-binding site removed (pMP-AP2). Deleting all the putative transcription factor binding sites except AP-2 caused some decrease in NHE-1 transcription (Fig. 2D). Further removal of the AP-2 containing region, however, decreased transcription 6-fold (Fig. 2D). To confirm the importance of the 33-bp deleted region, we introduced several mutations into the AP-2 consensus sequence of the pMP+AP2 construct. The substitutions are shown in Fig. 3A. When the mutant construct no. 1 (pMP(MUT)AP2) is transfected into NIH 3T3 cells we see a 7.9-fold decrease in the level of luciferase activity (Fig. 3B). This decrease is comparable to the levels seen when the entire AP-2 region is deleted. To localize the nucleotides involved in this activity, two other mutations were generated (Fig. 3B). Mutation no. 2 involved a 5 base pair modification of the putative AP-2 site but had little effect on the activity of the promoter. When another two mutations were added to these existing five (mutation no. 3) a small decrease in luciferase activity was seen. The mutational analysis indicates that the region at approximately −106 to −95 may be important for regulating transcription in NIH 3T3 cells. To confirm the data from the mutational analysis, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments to determine if the specific protein from NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts could interact with the DNA sequence containing this AP-2 consensus site. A nuclear protein protected a region corresponding to −106 to −95 of the mouse NHE-1 promoter region (Fig. 4). This region lies within the AP-2 consensus site which is located in the 33-bp fragment of DNA.Figure 4:DNase I footprinting analysis of the mouse NHE-1 promoter. DNase I footprint analysis was performed with the −171 to +22 fragment of the NHE-1 promoter (lanes 1-5). The naked fragment of DNA was treated with DNase I (0.1 units (lane 1) and 0.2 units (lanes 2 and 3)) for 10 s at room temperature. The fragment of DNA was also treated with DNase I (1.0 units (lane 4) and 2.0 units (lane 5)) for 2 min at room temperature after incubation with nuclear extracts from NIH 3T3 cells. Lane M represents the [γ-32P]dATP end-labeled molecular weight markers whose lengths are shown to the left. The protected region of DNA is indicated to the right as an open box, and the numbers correspond to the position of the nucleotides in the DNA sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NIH 3T3 cells have one of the most abundant AP-2 levels of a number of murine cell lines and tissues(13Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W.J. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 23Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Hep G2 are human liver hepatoma cells which have been shown to be deficient in AP-2 mRNA and have little, if any, AP-2 binding and transcription activity(14Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To confirm that AP-2 protein or an AP-2-like protein regulates transcription of the mouse NHE-1 gene Hep G2 cells were transfected with pMP+AP2 and cotransfected with either a plasmid expressing AP-2 protein (pRSVAP2) or the identical plasmid that cannot express AP-2 protein (pRSV-AP2). The results (Fig. 5) show that cotransfection with an AP-2 expression plasmid causes a large 2-fold increase in the activity of the NHE-1 promoter. When the mutated construct pMP(MUT)AP2 is transfected into Hep G2 cells along with pRSVAP2 there is no increase in activity of the mouse NHE-1 promoter as compared to the wild-type containing plasmid (Fig. 5). To investigate the role of AP-2 protein as an enhancer of NHE-1 transcription in more detail, we examined the ability of the AP-2 motif to bind AP-2 protein. A short double-stranded oligonucleotide (MPAP2a, b) of 24 base pairs was synthesized that consisted of the sequence 5′-TTC CTT CCC TGG GCG ACA GGG GCC-3′. Gel retardation assays showed that this oligonucleotide bound to the purified AP-2 protein (Fig. 6A, lane 1). Competition experiments were done to show specific binding of AP-2, using unlabeled MPAP2a, b oligonucleotide as the competitor and an unlabeled SP-1 oligonucleotide as a non-competitor. Competitor concentrations of 6, 12, and 50 times blocked the protein-DNA interaction while 100 times excess of non-competitor had no effect (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-5, respectively). To further characterize the protein binding ability of the mouse AP-2 consensus site, nuclear extracts from NIH 3T3 cells were used. The results with purified AP-2 protein were similar to those seen in experiments with nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 cells bound to the AP-2 containing synthetic oligonucleotide (MPAP2a, b) and 12 and 25 times excess unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide decreased the binding (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 3), while 100 times excess of non-competitor did not (lane 4). Some binding of smaller size was apparent, but competition experiments revealed that the interaction was nonspecific (lanes 2 and 3). We also examined whether a 193-bp fragment cut directly from the promoter could bind purified AP-2 protein. The results are shown in Fig. 6C. An intense band was seen indicative of AP-2 binding to the labeled fragment of the gene. In the absence of the protein, the band was not apparent. The synthetic oligonucleotides containing the sequence for the mutated mouse putative AP-2 binding site (MUTAP2a, b) were used in another bandshift assay. The oligonucleotides MUTAP2a, b only bound small amounts of protein from nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 6D, lane 2) in comparison to MPAP2a, b (Fig. 6D, lane 1). In addition, the unlabeled mutated oligonucleotides were unable to compete with MPAP2a, b confirming their reduced ability to bind to the protein. Finally, AP-2 was specifically removed from the nuclear extract by immunoprecipitation with anti-AP-2 antibody. This resulted in greatly reduced binding to MPAP2a, b by the nuclear extracts (Fig. 6E). Previous studies have shown that the level of Na+/H+ exchanger mRNA and transcription itself can be increased due to a wide variety of treatments including chronic acid loading (9Moe O.W. Miller R.T.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and treatments causing cell differentiation(8Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To date, however, there have been few studies on the NHE-1 promoter. One of these studies identifies the regions of the human promoter/enhancer region which are capable of binding nuclear factors (6Kolyada A.Y. Lebedeva T.V. Johns C.A. Madias N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), while the second indirectly examines the role of AP-1(7Horie S. Moe O. Yamaji Y. Cano A. Miller R.T. Alpern R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5236-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was suggested that AP-1 could play a role in activating the antiporter especially during acidosis mediated increases in antiporter activity. Alternatively, it was suggested that some other protein kinase C-dependent pathway could mediate the effects of acidosis through AP-1 (7Horie S. Moe O. Yamaji Y. Cano A. Miller R.T. Alpern R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5236-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To date, however, there has been no direct examination of the role of specific transcription factors on the actual NHE-1 promoter. Our analysis suggests that base pairs −106 to −95 play an important role in regulation of expression. Mutation of these base pairs reduced both in vivo transcription and binding of nuclear extracts to this region. DNA footprinting analysis also localized the binding of a protein to this region. It is likely that the transcription factor AP-2 or a closely related AP-2-like protein is involved in binding to this region. The evidence supporting this is that cotransfection of Hep G2 with an AP-2 expression plasmid increased NHE-1 transcription levels. In addition purified AP-2 protein bound to this sequence and removal of AP-2 protein from nuclear extracts by immunoprecipitation greatly reduced their ability to bind to the AP-2 consensus sequence. However, it is possible that an AP-2-like protein could be responsible for some of the observed effects. Future experiments will attempt to purify the protein binding to this region of the gene. It is of note that base pairs −95 to −105 are perfectly conserved in sequence and location in the human gene (5Miller R.T. Counillon L. Pages G. Lifton R.P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10813-10819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while more upstream distal regions are not. This may indicate an important regulatory function. It should be noted that AP-2 is not the only transcription factor involved in regulation of NHE-1 expression, and other regions have also recently been suggested to be of importance(6Kolyada A.Y. Lebedeva T.V. Johns C.A. Madias N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We examined the mouse NHE-1 promoter because of the widespread availability of a number of useful mouse cell lines. Our results show that we have isolated the NHE-1 isoform since our probes for screening the genomic library originated from the NHE-1 isoform and the clone hybridized under relatively high stringency. We also show that the promoter for the housekeeping isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger family is activated by the transcription factor AP-2 or an AP-2-like transcription factor. Although housekeeping genes such as NHE-1 are normally not acutely regulated, there are examples of such promoters that are activated by cis elements. One such example is the second promoter of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene (24Park K. Kim K-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12249-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose activation is mediated through an AP-2-like sequence(25Park K. Kim K-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17811-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This example may be analogous to the NHE-1 promoter. Both AP-2 and NHE-1 transcription rate increase in some models of cellular differentiation. For example, during retinoic acid induced differentiation of human leukemic cells (HL-60), there is an 8.3-fold increase in NHE-1 transcription(8Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additionally, retinoic acid-induced differentiation of human NT2 teratocarcinoma cells shows increased AP-2 mRNA and protein expression levels(14Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The relationship between increased AP-2 levels during differentiation induced by retinoic acid and the increase in NHE-1 transcription seems to be an important issue. Experiments are currently underway which may help to explain this relationship. The results from this paper have, for the first time, directly examined the role of a specific transcription factor in the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene. We have suggested that this transcription factor is AP-2 or an AP-2-like protein, and we have located the region of the gene where it is able to bind. While the extent to which this protein regulates the Na+/H+ exchanger in specific cellular events is not yet known, the identification of a DNA binding protein motif has provided enough information to warrant further interest. AP-2 is involved in the regulation of a number of cellular events including growth and differentiation(14Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The involvement in these events is an interesting characteristic AP-2 has in common with the Na+/H+ antiporter(4Fliegel L. Frohlich O. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Rao G.N. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Berk B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Future studies will focus on these specific cellular events and how they work together to control regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger levels and growth and differentiation of the cell. We thank Dr. J.

This 39-43 amino acid peptide is derived from a larger precursor, the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) 1The abbreviations used are: β-APPβ-amyloid precursor proteinKPIserine proteinase inhibitor domain of the Kunitz familyTLCKNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. which can be expressed in multiple isoforms. The two major isoforms are distinguished by the presence (751 amino acids) or absence (695 amino acids) of a serine proteinase inhibitor domain of the Kunitz family (KPI)(1Kang J. Lemaire H.-G.

Recently, it has been shown that β-amyloid peptide is a naturally generated soluble protein. The peptide has been detected in the medium of a variety of cultured mammalian cells(9Haass C.

The β-amyloid peptide seems to be a minor degradation product of β-APP catabolism, the production of which appears directly correlated with the expression of excess or aberrant β-APPs(13Zhong Z. Quon D. Higgins L.S. Higaki J. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the biology of β-amyloid formation in vitro has been a focus of study, the fate of this peptide after it is secreted from the cell has not been examined. Both the synthesis and clearance of this protein may potentially contribute to increased levels of β-amyloid and to the development of insoluble deposits. Therefore, to begin to understand the catabolic aspects of β-amyloid biology we characterized the turnover of this protein produced in vitro. The CP-6 cell line was established by transfecting the human cDNA encoding the 695-amino acid isoform of β-APP, driven by the β-actin promoter, into Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts using calcium phosphate according to standard procedures. Individual transfectants were isolated, subcloned, and characterized for β-APP expression. CP-6 cells were propagated in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and Coon's F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in 10-cm dishes (∼1 × 106 cells/dish). The SK-N-MC cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and was cultured on 10-cm dishes in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. To prepare conditioned medium, cell monolayers were washed three times with saline and then placed in 2 ml of serum-free medium and incubated at 37°C for either 4 or 24 h. After the conditioned medium was harvested, it was clarified by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. To metabolically radiolabel protein with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN), CP-6 cell monolayers were washed three times with saline, placed in serum-, methionine-, and cysteine-free medium for 30 min after which time 167 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine was added. Culture dishes were radiolabeled for various times depending on the experimental design. For pulse-chase experiments, 10-cm dishes of CP-6 cell cultures (∼1 × 106 cells) were labeled for 60 min with 167 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine in 2 ml of methionine/cysteine-free medium after which time the cell monolayers were washed, placed in complete serum-free medium lacking isotope, and incubated for varying lengths of time prior to harvesting. Clarified media were kept at 4°C prior to analysis of the samples. Equivalent amounts of total radioactivity (∼2 ml of medium) were used for immunoprecipitation of β-amyloid peptides. Preparation of the BA1 and BA2 antisera used in the radioimmunoassay and for immunoprecipitation, respectively, was identical and has been previously described for BA2(13Zhong Z. Quon D. Higgins L.S. Higaki J. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding epitopes for both antisera were characterized by radioimmunoassay. Epitopes recognized by each antiserum map to the carboxyl terminus of β-amyloid 1-40 but to different sites. Preparation and purification of 125I-β-amyloid 1-40 tracer was as follows. Ten micrograms of synthetic β-amyloid peptide 1-40 (Bachem, Torrance, CA) was radiolabeled with 1 mCi of 125I by the chloramine-T method. At the completion of the 1-min reaction, the reaction was diluted with an equal volume of H2O and passed through a Sepak C18 cartridge to separate the labeled peptide from unincorporated isotope. The 125I-labeled β-amyloid peptide was found to elute from Sepak C18 in 50% CH3CN. The specific activity of the 125I-β-amyloid peptide was calculated to be ∼5 × 107 cpm/μg. The peptide was further purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C8 cartridge (4.6 mm × 3 cm, Brownlee). The HPLC column was run in a linear gradient from 5-45% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Gradient fractions containing the labeled peptide were pooled and used within 3 days. The radioimmunoassay was carried out by the following procedure. The BA1 antiserum was made to a final dilution of 1/900, a dilution previously determined to bind 30% of 125I-β-amyloid peptide in the absence of competing ligand. The dilution was made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. Labeled tracer (7000-9000 cpm) was used for each assay. Unknown sample or standard (β-amyloid 1-40 synthetic peptide) was incubated with tracer and antibody overnight at 4°C. The assay was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of normal rabbit serum followed by the addition of 800 μl of polyethylene glycol (Mr = 6000-8000, 15.8% in the antibody dilution buffer). The samples were incubated for 10 min at 4°C, and bound from free radiolabeled material was separated by low speed centrifugation. Pellets containing bound material were counted in a γ counter. Quantification of β-amyloid protein in an unknown sample was made by comparison of the amount of bound material to a standard curve generated with dilutions of β-amyloid 1-40 synthetic peptide. All determinations, unknowns and standards, were made in duplicate or triplicate. An IC50 of ∼1 nM for BA1 binding was obtained from the standard curve. Samples of conditioned medium (2-3 ml) required concentration and purification prior to assaying. To do so, the medium was bound and eluted from a Sepak C18 cartridge. Previous analyses determined that β-amyloid protein and peptides elute from the Sepak C18 column in 50% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid after washing with 5% CH3CN 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and with 25% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 50% CH3CN eluate (2 ml) was dried and resuspended in 10% isopropyl alcohol in H2O to 250 μl. Synthetic β-amyloid peptide standard was resuspended in 10% isopropyl alcohol and H2O. Aliquots of 50 μl were assayed in the radioimmunoassay. Sample preparation, immunoprecipitation with BA2 antiserum, and analysis of the recovered products by 16.5% Tris/Tricine/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Zhong et al.(13Zhong Z. Quon D. Higgins L.S. Higaki J. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of immunoprecipitated β-amyloid peptides was made by densitometry of films using a Lynx 4000 (Applied Imaging Corp.) and by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Equal volumes (1.5 ml) of 4-h and 24-h conditioned medium were mixed and incubated for 25 h at 37°C. As an experimental control, the media were mixed but not incubated. For another control, 4-h medium was mixed with serum-free medium never exposed to cells and incubated for 25 h at 37°C. Some incubations were carried out in the presence or absence of proteinase inhibitors. Proteinase inhibitors were obtained from the following sources: both p-aminobenzamidine and Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) from Sigma, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Dade (Cambridge, MA), and aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, E64, and phosphoramidon from Boehringer Mannheim. The 57-amino acid KPI domain, generated by recombinant methods, was purified as described previously(14Schilling J. Wang Y. Lau K. Smith L. Cordell B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For boiling experiments, the 24-h medium was incubated at 100°C for 40 min, cooled, mixed with 4-h conditioned medium, and incubated as described above. Potential effects of buffers and organic solutions used to solubilize several inhibitors were examined in the protection assay and were found to be negligible at the concentrations employed. A clonal line of cultured Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts which was stably transfected and expresses the human 695-amino acid isoform of β-APP (termed CP-6) was used as a source of β-amyloid protein. Based on recent reports, cultured mammalian cells have been demonstrated to produce and secrete β-amyloid peptides which include an intact 4-kDa β-amyloid peptide and an amino-terminally truncated 3-kDa peptide derived from the secretory cleavage of β-APP(5Johnson S.A. McNeill T. Cordell B. Finch C.E. Science. 1990; 248: 854-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Johnson S.A. Pasinetti G.M. May P.C. Ponte P.A. Cordell B. Finch C.E. Exp.

The single methionine residue present in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the β-amyloid peptide permits metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine of both the 3- and 4-kDa β-amyloid peptides. To examine the temporal profile of β-amyloid expression, we employed a pulse-chase experimental format. Multiple cultures of CP-6 cells were metabolically radiolabeled for 1 h by addition of [35S]methionine/cysteine to the medium. Following the pulse period, the isotope-containing medium was removed, and the cell cultures were replenished with fresh medium lacking isotope and incubated. At 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h post-pulse, the conditioned medium was harvested. The fate of [35S]methionine-labeled β-amyloid peptides secreted into the culture medium over the 12-h incubation period was followed by immunoprecipitation with a β-amyloid-specific antiserum and electrophoresis on a 16.5% Tris/Tricine/polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 1 displays the results from the pulse-chase experiment. Maximum accumulation of both the 4- and 3-kDa β-amyloid peptides was observed 6 h into the chase which remained high for 2 h then declined. By 12 h after pulse-labeling, modest amounts of the β-amyloid peptides remained. When the chase period was extended to include a 24-h time point, little β-amyloid was detected (data not shown). It should be noted that CP-6 cells were viable and metabolically active during the 24-h serum-free treatment, and, therefore, this was not a factor in the observed reduction of β-amyloid peptides. In fact, levels of several labeled cell-associated proteins remained unchanged over the 24-h chase period indicating general cellular proteolysis mediated by serum deprivation was not responsible for the observed decrease in β-amyloid peptides. The time to eliminate the bulk of [35S]methionine-labeled β-amyloid peptides from the serum-free medium after maximum levels are reached was determined using densitometry and found to be >12 h. Similar results were obtained for identical experiments performed with CP-6 cells of different passage. The secretion and elimination of the β-amyloid peptides by CP-6 cells was analyzed using a different assay, a radioimmunoassay. This radioimmunoassay employs a second β-amyloid-specific antiserum from that used for immunoprecipitation. Each serum recognizes a different epitope within the carboxyl-terminal region of the β-amyloid sequence. Consequently, both the 4- and 3-kDa peptides are scored in both assays. The secretion of soluble β-amyloid peptides into serum-free culture medium was followed utilizing the radioimmunoassay. Identical with the results obtained by immunoprecipitation, the radioimmunoassay revealed peak levels of peptide ∼6 h into the time course followed by a substantial decrease in levels by 24 h (Fig. 2). Some variation from experiment to experiment was noticed, however, in the β-amyloid peptide level at 24 h. Generally, 10-30% of maximum levels were present at 24 h; however, in one experiment, as much as 50% remained. Approximately 2.5 ng/ml β-amyloid protein was present in the conditioned medium at peak times (∼6 h) which is roughly equivalent to the level described that was released from a human brain primary cell culture(12Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormack R. Wolfert R. Selkoe D.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Similar to a previous report(7Neve R.L. Finch E.A. Dawes L.P. Neuron. 1988; 1: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), the absolute level of β-amyloid protein, however, fluctuated with cell type. Levels also varied slightly with cell passage. These experiments, assayed by either immunoprecipitation or radioimmunoassay, indicated that the secreted β-amyloid peptides were depleted from the culture medium over time. To determine whether the peptides were removed due to cellular uptake or to proteolytic degradation, we investigated the potential catabolic effects of conditioned medium on β-amyloid peptides in the absence of cells by performing mixing experiments. Medium which had been conditioned by CP-6 cells for 24 h was mixed with either unlabeled or [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled serum-free medium harvested 4 h after addition to the cell monolayer. 4-h conditioned medium represents a time when levels of soluble β-amyloid peptide were high. The combined 24- and 4-h media (1:1 volume) were incubated at 37°C, in the presence or absence of proteinase inhibitors, after which the mixed media were assayed for β-amyloid protein. As a control treatment, 4-h conditioned medium was mixed (1:1 volume) with medium never exposed to cells. By performing a time course for the 37°C treatment, it was determined that ∼25 h was a desirable incubation period (data not shown) and was, consequently, used for all experiments. The data presented in Fig. 3 are a compilation of multiple mixing experiments using unlabeled media followed by radioimmunoassay scoring of β-amyloid protein. When 4-h CP-6 cell-conditioned medium was combined with control medium and incubated at 37°C for 0 or for 25 h, the level of β-amyloid protein was unchanged and remained at ∼3 ng/ml. In contrast, when the 4-h medium was incubated with 24-h conditioned medium, the amount of β-amyloid protein was reduced by greater than 50% after the 25-h incubation. No depletion was observed with 4- and 24-h media which were mixed but not incubated. An increase of β-amyloid protein (∼1 ng/ml) was frequently measured for the unincubated 4- plus 24-h sample over the level present in only 4-h medium. It is probable that this increase was derived from residual β-amyloid peptides present in the 24-h medium which, when mixed with the 4-h medium, resulted in slightly higher initial amounts. Significantly, a reduction in β-amyloid protein after incubation with 24-h conditioned medium was prevented by the addition of a collection of proteinase inhibitors. The mixture of inhibitors (mix-C) used and the concentration of each is summarized in Table 1. Since protection of β-amyloid peptides was seen in the presence of proteinase inhibitors, these data suggest that proteolytic enzymes were involved in the observed reduction of this protein. It should be noted that on occasion some samples of 4-h CP-6 conditioned media showed slight β-amyloid peptide catabolic activity; however, most preparations lacked this effect. This suggests that the degrading proteolytic enzymes were not released or sufficiently accumulated in the medium until after 4 h.Tabled 1 The above result was confirmed and extended in experiments using 4-h conditioned media containing [35S]methionine-labeled β-amyloid peptides and an immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4). Again, the β-amyloid peptides were depleted after incubation at 37°C for 25 h with 24-h CP-6 cell-conditioned medium but, if incubated in the presence of the proteinase inhibitor mixture, protection against degradation was observed. Both the 4- and 3-kDa peptides were degraded in the absence of proteinase inhibitors. No significant reduction in the [35S]methionine-labeled peptides was seen when the sample was identically incubated with control medium. The proteolytic activity released by CP-6 fibroblasts which degrades the β-amyloid peptides was found to be present in media conditioned by other cell types. Fig. 5 illustrates this point in which 24-h conditioned medium was prepared from a human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-MC, and tested. The SK-N-MC conditioned medium was mixed with 4-h CP-6 medium, incubated at 37°C for 25 h in either the presence or absence of proteinase inhibitors described in Table 1(mix-C). The SK-N-MC medium promoted a 50% reduction in β-amyloid peptides which was prevented by the addition of the collection of proteinase inhibitors. To identify the type of proteinase(s) responsible for the clearance of the β-amyloid peptides, we examined the inhibitory effects of individual proteinase inhibitors present in the mixture. This inhibitor mixture consisted of a number of commonly used proteinase inhibitors covering the four major classes of proteinases; serine, metallo, aspartyl, and thiol. A standard concentration of each inhibitor was used for the mixture. When each inhibitor was individually evaluated for its ability to block β-amyloid peptide degradation using analysis by radioimmunoassay, none was effective (data not shown). This result suggested that multiple proteinases may be involved in the degradation of these proteins. Therefore, we studied the effects of inhibitor combinations. These combinations were based on class or classes of enzyme target. The inhibitor combinations tested are outlined in Table 1. We repeatedly found that a mixture of leupeptin and pepstatin partially protected the breakdown of β-amyloid and that the addition of EDTA and phosphoramidon to this mixture fully protected the β-amyloid peptides (Fig. 6 and Table 2). Other proteinase inhibitor combinations proved ineffective (Fig. 6 and data not shown). To provide further evidence that enzymes are responsible for the protein depletion, we characterized the effect of boiled 24 h conditioned CP-6 medium on the catabolism of the β-amyloid peptides. No degradation was seen when 4-h medium was incubated at 37°C for 25 h with boiled 24-h medium (Table 2).Tabled 1 The inhibitory effects seen with leupeptin, pepstatin, EDTA, and phosphoramidon indicated that thiol, aspartyl, and metalloproteinases together comprise the β-amyloid peptide degrading activity. Since leupeptin can also inhibit select serine proteinases, in addition to thiol proteinases, we were interested in determining whether the KPI domain, a serine proteinase inhibitor, harbored within the 751- and 770-amino acid isoforms of β-APP could block the breakdown of β-amyloid peptides. We have previously described the recombinant production, purification, and activity of the 57-amino acid KPI domain derived from β-APP(14Schilling J. Wang Y. Lau K. Smith L. Cordell B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Kido H. Fukutomi A. Schilling J. Wang Y. Cordell B. Katunuma N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 716-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A mixing experiment was performed in which [35S]methionine-labeled β-amyloid peptides present in 4-h conditioned CP-6 medium were incubated with 24-h conditioned medium in the absence or presence of 50 μM KPI. After the standard incubation, the radiolabeled β-amyloid peptides were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7). Partial protection (quantified at 50%) was found upon addition of the β-APP Kunitz inhibitor domain to the mixed media. In the absence of KPI inhibitor, the 3- and 4-kDa β-amyloid peptides were completely eliminated. Accumulation of β-amyloid peptide appears to have a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Substantial evidence, both direct and indirect, implicate this protein as a major contributing factor in the initiation and progression of this disorder (reviewed in (17Cordell B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (18Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Several properties of the β-amyloid peptide are of particular relevance to Alzheimer's disease, notably the ability to self-polymerize (reviewed in (19Jarrett J.T. Landsbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar) and (20Landsbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6865-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and to induce neurotoxicity (21; reviewed in (20Landsbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6865-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and (22Cotman C.W. Pike C.J. Copani A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These two properties are also inter-related in that β-amyloid neurotoxicity is directly correlated with the aggregation state of the peptide(23Pike C.J. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 24Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that β-amyloid peptide is generated as part of normal cellular physiology (9Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y.

Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar) and presumably as a result of β-APP catabolism(13Zhong Z. Quon D. Higgins L.S. Higaki J. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As part of this cellular process, the β-amyloid peptide is secreted from the cell as a soluble protein. In addition to the extracellular soluble nature of β-amyloid peptide, the local concentration of this protein in the microenvironment is likely to be an important factor in eliciting neuronal degeneration and plaque formation. Because increases in soluble β-amyloid peptide are likely to enhance its propensity for self-polymerization, it is important to understand the fate of β-amyloid peptide after it is released from the cell. Heretofore, studies have primarily focused on the processes of β-amyloid peptide formation and not on its clearance. Therefore, to begin to understand the overall biology of β-amyloid peptide, we investigated the turnover profile of this protein produced in vitro. Our studies, using cultured mammalian cells as a source of β-amyloid peptide, indicate that this protein is degraded within 12 to 24 h of its release from the cell. Two different methods and immunoreagents were employed to measure β-amyloid peptide, a radioimmunoassay and an immunoprecipitation assay. The data obtained from both assays were in complete agreement. Catabolism of both the 4-kDa β-amyloid peptide and the 3-kDa truncated form of this protein was found to be due to proteolytic activity released by the cultured cells. Chinese hamster ovary fibroblastic and human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cell lines were characterized as having proteolytic activities which degrade the β-amyloid peptides. Serum-free medium which had been conditioned by the cultured mammalian cells was the source of the β-amyloid degrading activity employed in these studies. Therefore, the elimination of β-amyloid was not due to reinternalization by the cell. Cellular uptake of exogenously supplied β-amyloid peptide has been described(25Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The β-amyloid catabolic activity was shown to be of enzymatic nature in that it could be fully inhibited by heat denaturation or by the addition of proteinase inhibitors. Several classes of proteinases were identified as being responsible for the breakdown of the β-amyloid peptide based on the types of inhibitors found to be effective in preventing degradation. Of the active families of proteinases secreted by the cells studied, thiol, aspartyl, and metalloproteinase members appeared responsible for β-amyloid catabolism. Select inhibitors of each class were only partially able to prevent β-amyloid degradation. Only when these multiple types of proteinase inhibitors are used collectively could β-amyloid catabolism be fully blocked within the selected incubation period. In addition to the above mentioned proteinases, it appeared that a serine proteinase(s) also contributed to β-amyloid turnover since the KPI domain of β-APP could partially block this process. However, this KPI-responsive activity appears unique in that other serine proteinase inhibitors such as aprotinin, TLCK, and benzamidine were incapable of blocking β-amyloid peptide degradation. Likewise, one thiol proteinase inhibitor was ineffective in protecting β-amyloid clearance, whereas another inhibitor of this class was effective. As mentioned, the serine proteinase inhibitor domain, KPI, contained in some β-APP isoforms was tested and was found to partially protect (∼50%) the degradation of β-amyloid. That the KPI domain of β-APP can partially inhibit the degradation of β-amyloid peptide in vitro may hold relevance to the increase in KPI containing β-APP isoforms specifically observed in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue(5Johnson S.A. McNeill T. Cordell B. Finch C.E. Science. 1990; 248: 854-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Johnson S.A. Pasinetti G.M. May P.C. Ponte P.A. Cordell B. Finch C.E. Exp.

Furthermore, in one study, the increase in β-APP isoforms containing the KPI domain was directly correlated with the density of plaques(5Johnson S.A. McNeill T. Cordell B. Finch C.E. Science. 1990; 248: 854-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Since β-APP has been shown to be secreted from the cell both in vitro(26Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) and in vivo(27Palmert M.R. Podlisny M.B. Witker D.S. Oltersdorf T. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J. Younkin S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6338-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), such an increase in expression of KPI bearing β-APP isoforms in the disease state might lead to increased levels of secreted KPI β-APPs. Higher levels of soluble KPI-containing β-APP might retard the clearance of β-amyloid peptide and, in turn, contribute to increased local concentrations of β-amyloid and to the development of insoluble aggregates. It may be relevant that secreted β-APP has been reported to harbor a metalloproteinase inhibitor domain (28Miyazaki K. Hasagawa M. Funahashi K. Umeda M. Nature. 1993; 362: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) which might also serve to retard β-amyloid catabolism and promote deposit formation. Many factors might influence the normal clearance rate of β-amyloid protein in addition to the possible contribution of increased expression of β-APP and its resident serine and metalloproteinase inhibitory activities. The binding of β-amyloid to lipoproteins apoE (29Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl.

In addition, it is possible that aberrant expression or bioactivity of any of the β-amyloid degrading proteinases might have a pathological contribution by elevating levels of this protein. Hence, knowledge of the β-amyloid degrading proteinases may be important to our complete understanding of β-amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease.

In parallel with calorimetric studies, the energy-minimized structures and steric energies of the diglyceride moieties of these monoenoic lipids were determined using a molecular mechanics approach. The combined calorimetric and computational studies led to the following results and conclusions. (i) When a single cis-carbon-carbon double bond (Δ) is incorporated into a saturated diacylphosphatidylcholine molecule at any position within the central segment of the long sn-2 acyl chain, the resulting monoenoic lipid molecules will, in excess water, exhibit reduced phase transition temperature (T) and transition enthalpy (ΔH) as they undergo the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition. The T and ΔH-lowering effects of the Δ bond can be attributed to a decrease in the chain length of the sn-2 acyl chain, a change in the chain length difference between the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains, and a local perturbation of the chain-chain van der Waals interaction in the vicinity of the Δ bond. (ii) For a series of positional isomers of 1-stearoyl-2-cis-octadecenoylphosphatidylcholine, C(18):C(18:1Δ)PC, with a Δ bond at different positions along the sn-2 acyl chain, the T value depends critically on the position of the Δ bond. Specifically, the T value is minimal as the Δ bond is located at the geometric center of the linear segment of the sn-2 acyl chain, and the Tvalue is progressively increased as the Δ bond migrates toward either end of the sn-2 acyl chain.

Most biological membranes contain a substantial amount of glycerophospholipids loosely called phospholipids, and a remarkable feature of these membrane phospholipids is their bewildering diversity. This diversity originates largely from the various possible combinations of different fatty acyl chains present in the hydrophobic moiety of the amphipathic phospholipid molecule. Specifically, the structures of the two fatty acids hydrolyzed enzymatically from animal phospholipids display the following general features. (i) With the possible exceptions of mammalian lung and nerve endings, which contain large amounts of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine(1Goerke J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 344: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2O'Brien J.F. Geison R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 44-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), identical fatty acids in both acyl positions occur rarely in a naturally occurring phospholipid molecule. Instead, the two fatty acids have a different even number of carbon atoms ranging from 14 to 22(3Lands W.E.M. Hart P. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1966; 43: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Tattrie N.H. Bennett J.R. Cyr R. Can. J. Biochem. 1968; 46: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). (ii) The fatty acids in natural phospholipids are nonrandomly distributed. The one that is esterified to the hydroxyl group at glycerol backbone carbon 1, the sn-1 acyl chain, is often a saturated fatty acid, whereas the other, the sn-2 acyl chain, is predominantly an unsaturated one(3Lands W.E.M. Hart P. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1966; 43: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). (iii) The unsaturated fatty acids derived from the sn-2 acyl chains of major membrane phospholipids in animal tissues have the structural formula CH3-(CH2) - [CH=CH-CH2] - (CH2) - COOH, where the subscripts α = 1, 4, 5, and 7, β = 1-6, and = 2-7, and the cis-double bonds (β = 1-6) are always separated by one methylene group(5Kunau W.-H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1976; 15: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because of the large number of possible ways that permutations of chain length and unsaturation can occur, a given class of membrane phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine isolated from a given cell type can be expected to give rise to a significant number of specific molecular species. Indeed, 57 molecular species of phosphatidylcholines have been detected in mammalian liver(6Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Probably because of the large number of molecular species of natural phosphatidylcholines, the physical properties of most membrane phosphatidylcholines with mixed sn-1 saturated/sn-2 unsaturated acyl chains have not yet been fully established. The thermotropic phase transitions of phospholipid bilayers and their relevance to biological membranes, for instance, have been investigated extensively for nearly 3 decades(7Chapman D. William R.M. Ladbrook B.D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1967; 1: 445-475Crossref Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 8Chapman D. Shinitzky M. Biomembranes: Physical Aspects. Balaban Publishers, Weinheim, Germany1993: 29-62Google Scholar). Surprisingly, with the notable exception of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (9Curatolo W. Sears B. Neuringer L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Coolbear K.P. Berde C.B. Keough K.M.W.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Litman B.J. Lewis E.N. Levin I.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), only limited information is available regarding the phase transition behavior of most natural phosphatidylcholines. Clearly, a significantly rapid progress in this field is definitely needed. The role played by amphipathic phosphatidylcholines in biological membranes has, until recently, been viewed primarily as that of a structural component of biological membranes in eukaryotic cells. This picture is now changed drastically, since the breakdown components of phosphatidylcholine molecule, or the intermediates of the “phosphatidylcholine cycle,” in the cell membrane have turned out to be involved actively in signal transduction in response to extracellular stimuli(12Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 13Tronchere H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, there is increasing evidence suggesting that skeletal muscle phospholipids with polyunsaturated sn-2 acyl chains may be of great significance in modulating the insulin receptor activity(14Borkman M. Storlien L.H. Pan D.A. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Champbell L.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 15Liu S. Baracos V.E. Quinney H.A. Clandinin M.T. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In view of these recent exciting findings, it is important to study systematically the various natural phosphatidylcholines with well defined composition and to obtain information regarding the specific contributions of the characteristic unsaturated acyl chains to the structure and properties of the lipid bilayer comprised of natural phosphatidylcholines. As a first step to investigate systematically the physical properties of naturally occurring phosphatidylcholines with mixed sn-1 saturated/sn-2 unsaturated acyl chains, we have semisynthesized 26 molecular species of identical chain and mixed chain phosphatidylcholines, each containing a single cis-double bond in the sn-2 acyl chain. In this paper we report the phase transition characteristics of these molecular species as determined by high resolution differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 1The abbreviations used are: DSCdifferential scanning calorimetryMMmolecular mechanicsTphase transition temperatureΔHtransition enthalpyEthe steric energy, in kcal/mol, of an energy-minimized lipid speciesC(X):C(Y)PCsaturated phosphatidylcholine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with X carbons in the sn-1 and Y carbons in the sn-2 acyl chainC(X):C(Y:1Δ)PCmonounsaturated phosphatidylcholine with a saturated sn-1 acyl chain containing X carbons and a monounsaturated sn-2 acyl chain containing Y carbons with a cis-carbon-carbon double bond (Δ) at the nth carbon atom from the carboxyl endΔTtransition peak width at half-heightPEphosphatidylethanolamineΔSphase transition entropy changeΔHweight average transition enthalpyF-Bfront to backU-Dup to down. Moreover, molecular mechanics (MM) calculations are applied to refine the three-dimensional structures and to compute the steric energies of several series of Δ bond-containing phosphatidylcholine molecules which, in turn, are used to account for the thermodynamic data. Finally, the phase transition temperatures (T) associated with the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transitions of bilayers prepared from two groups of a total of 26 monoenoic phosphatidylcholines are analyzed in terms of their structural parameters by a multiple regression approach, leading to the derivation of two general equations. It is of the greatest interest and significance that there is a common T-structure relationship that holds for most different monoenoic phosphatidylcholines within each group of the natural lipids. differential scanning calorimetry molecular mechanics phase transition temperature transition enthalpy the steric energy, in kcal/mol, of an energy-minimized lipid species saturated phosphatidylcholine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with X carbons in the sn-1 and Y carbons in the sn-2 acyl chain monounsaturated phosphatidylcholine with a saturated sn-1 acyl chain containing X carbons and a monounsaturated sn-2 acyl chain containing Y carbons with a cis-carbon-carbon double bond (Δ) at the nth carbon atom from the carboxyl end transition peak width at half-height phosphatidylethanolamine phase transition entropy change weight average transition enthalpy front to back up to down. Monounsaturated fatty acids with various chain lengths, each containing a cis-double bond at different positions, were purchased from Sigma. Lysophosphatidylcholines with various saturated acyl chain lengths were provided by Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Silica Gel 60 (mesh 230-400) was obtained from EM Science (Gibbtown, NJ). All chemicals and organic solvents were of reagent and spectroscopic grades, respectively. Monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines were semisynthesized at room temperature by acylation of CdCl2 adducts of lysophosphatidylcholine, in dry chloroform, with monounsaturated fatty acid anhydride that was prepared in situ from fatty acid and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in the presence of catalyst 4-pyrrolidinopyridine according to the modified procedure of Mena and Djerassi (16Mena P.L. Djerassi C. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 37: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as described previously(17Lin H.-n. Wang Z.-q. Huang C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7063-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The in situ reaction and the reacylation were carried out under an N2 atmosphere to avoid the possible oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acid. The synthesized sn-1 saturated/sn-2 monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines were subsequently purified to about 99% purity by repeated column chromatography on Silica Gel 60(17Lin H.-n. Wang Z.-q. Huang C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7063-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified monoenoic phosphatidylcholines were lyophilized from benzene before weighing. The lyophilized sample was then dispersed in buffered (pH 7.4) aqueous solution containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM phosphate buffer to give a final lipid concentration in the range of 3.0-6.0 mM. The exact lipid concentrations were determined by phosphorus analysis. Prior to DSC experiments, the lipid sample was kept in the cold room (0°C) overnight under an N2 atmosphere. DSC experiments were carried out with a high resolution Microcal calorimeter (model MC-2) equipped with DA-2 digital interface and data acquisition utility for automatic collection (Microcal, Northampton, MA). After loading the lipid sample into the sample cell of the calorimeter, it was preincubated in the calorimeter for a minimum of 60 min at the desired temperature (usually 15°C below the estimated Tm) followed by the DSC heating scan. The scan was terminated at about 15°C above the estimated Tm. The sample was then allowed to equilibrate thermally at the elevated temperature for 60 min prior to the cooling scan. Each sample was scanned at least five times: three heating and two cooling runs. In all of these experiments, a nominal scan rate of 15°C/h was used. The Tm and the transition enthalpy (ΔH) were determined, as described in(17Lin H.-n. Wang Z.-q. Huang C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7063-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), from the second and third heating curves, and the average values were reported for each sample. The MM2 force field (Version 85), written by Allinger (18Allinger N.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 8127-8134Crossref Scopus (4127) Google Scholar) and supplied by Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange (Department of Chemistry, Indiana University), was chosen as the software for the MM calculations. All MM computations were run on an IBM RS/6000 computer workstation. The structural data from the output of the MM2 calculations were transferred and then displayed in the form of various two-dimensional representations of the three-dimensional molecular structure, which was accomplished by the computer-assisted molecular graphics using the software package HyperChem (Autodesk Inc., Sausalito, CA) performed on a 486 platform. Prior to MM calculations, a set of torsion angles for a crude representation of the molecule under study was first constructed. This starting set of atomic coordinates was entered, via the MM2 program, into the computer. An optimized structure corresponding to the minimum steric energy (Es) closest to the starting point was subsequently determined for the molecule by MM calculations using a set of potential energy functions (called force fields). These calculations involved a series of repeated automatic cycles of the second derivative Newton-Raphson method for energy minimizations. These cycles of self-adjusted computations came to a halt as the steric energy difference between two consecutive cycles was less than (0.00008 × molecular weight) kcal/mol. For the MM2 program, the steric energy has the following terms: Es = E+Eb+E+E+E+E, where E = bond stretch energy, Eb = bond angle bend energy, E = torsional energy, E = bond dipole interaction energy, E = van der Waals nonbonding interaction energy, E = coupling energy between bond stretching and bond bending. It should be emphasized that the absolute value of Es is of no great significance, since it depends on the software program used. When the same MM2 program is adopted, however, the Es values for a homologous series of positional isomers are quite useful for making relative comparisons. The initial crude structure of C(16):C(18:1Δ9)PC was constructed based on the energy-minimized structure of C(14):C(14)PC (19Li S. Wang Z.-q. Lin H.-n. Huang C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1415-1428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the torsion angles of oleate chain of cholesteryl oleate were determined by x-ray diffraction(20Gao Q. Craven B.M. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 1214-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously(21Li S. Lin H.-n. Wang Z.-q. Huang C. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 2005-2018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the torsion angles of the sn-2 acyl chain of C(16):C(18:1Δ9)PC starting from C(3) to the chain methyl terminus were taken from the crystal data of the cholesteryl oleate, and all other torsion angles of the lipid molecule were taken from the energy-minimized structure of C(14):C(14)PC except that the sn-1 acyl chain was extended by two methylene units in the trans form. This assembled structure was taken as the crude structure of C(16):C(18:1Δ9)PC. It was subsequently subjected to MM calculations in which the internal coordinates were modified by Allinger's MM2 program until a minimum in the potential energy surface was reached. The resulting structure was taken as the optimized or energy-minimized structure of C(16):C(18:1Δ9)PC. The torsion angles of the various bonds, most importantly those in the vicinity of the Δ bond, obtained with this optimized structure were used subsequently as the starting atomic coordinates to search for minimal energy structures of other monoenoic lipids with the Δ bond at different positions in the sn-2 acyl chain. For instance, the initial crude structure of C(18):C(18:1Δ)PC can be readily created by adding two methylene units in the trans form into the sn-1 acyl chain of C(16):C(18:1Δ9)PC and by moving the Δ bond to the Δ position in the sn-2 acyl chain. The refined three-dimensional energy-minimized structure of C(18):C(18:1Δ)PC can then be obtained by subjecting the crude structure to MM calculations using the MM2 program. Similarly, the same protocol can be used to obtain energy-minimized structures of other monoenoic phosphatidylcholines. However, when a Δ bond was introduced into the sn-2 acyl chain at an even carbon atom such as C(18):C(18:1Δ)PC, the initial values of the two torsion angles immediately preceding the Δ bond (1 and 2) and those (′1 and ′2) immediately succeeding the Δ bond in the sequence 21Δ′1′2 were assigned to be negative, although the absolute magnitudes of these torsion angles were still taken from those of the energy-minimized structure of C(16):C(18:1Δ9)PC. This change in sign was simply to reflect the fact that even and odd carbons in an all trans-acyl chains lie commonly on two opposite and parallel planes. In this paper, attempts have been made to compare the structures of various phosphatidylcholines. Since all of these lipid molecules have the same head group, being different in their diglyceride moieties only, we feel that it is justified to simplify our MM calculations by considering the diglyceride moieties of these lipid molecules only. Consequently, various sn-1 saturated/sn-2 unsaturated phosphatidylcholines without the headgroups are used exclusively for our MM calculations. In this approach, the headgroup-headgroup interactions are assumed to be identical, and the headgroup-diglyceride interactions are assumed to be small; hence, they are ignored when a relative comparison among phosphatidylcholines is made. Furthermore, the water molecules are considered to be excluded from the hydrophobic interior; hence, Allinger's MM2 calculations of the diglyceride moiety of the lipid molecule were performed in vacuo to avoid solvent interactions. For dimers and tetramers, the MM calculations were performed according to the same procedure as that used for the monomer, essentially as described in detail elsewhere(19Li S. Wang Z.-q. Lin H.-n. Huang C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1415-1428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Again, these aggregates are the aggregated diglyceride moieties of the lipid molecules. The DSC heating thermograms for aqueous dispersions of six isomers of C(18):C(18:1Δn)PC are presented in Fig. 1. These positional isomers with the same molecular weight have a common sn-1 acyl chain. In addition, each has only one cis-carbon-carbon double bond (Δ) in the sn-2 octadecenoyl chain. However, the position of the double bond from the carboxyl carbon of the acyl chain (Δn) is different, with n = 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13. Each DSC heating thermogram shown in Fig. 1 is characterized by a sharp, single, nearly symmetrical, endothermic transition that is reproducible upon subsequent reheatings. The observed transition is assigned as the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition or the chain melting transition. The Tm and ΔH associated with the chain melting transition for various isomers of C(18):C(18:1Δn)PC, in excess water, are summarized in Table 1. The Tm values obtained with the cooling exotherms (data not shown) of these lipid samples occur at temperatures that are either identical to or slightly lower (0.2-0.4°C) than the Tm values obtained with the heating endotherms.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab It is interesting to recognize from Fig. 1 that as the cis-double bond migrates from the carboxyl end toward the chain methyl terminus, the phase transition peaks are changed accordingly both in terms of the peak width and the position of the maximal peak height (Tm). Specifically, the transition peak width at half-height (ΔT) is seen to increase from 0.3 to 1.1°C as the position of the Δ bond (Δn) moves from C(6) to C(13); the Tm value decreases steadily from 24.8°C to a minimum value of 3.8°C as the Δ bond moves along the chain from C(6) to C(11) and then increases progressively from 3.8 to 15.9°C as the Δ bond moves further along the chain from C(11) to C(13). Most interestingly, the Tm values in the TmversusΔn plot shown in Fig. 2 can be fitted by the least squares procedure to a smooth parabolic curve with a correlation coefficient of 0.9951. In comparison, the ΔH values are, within experimental errors, relatively insensitive to the position of the Δ bond (Table 1), but a general trend similar to that of the Tm profile is evident. The least squares fitting curve in the TmversusΔn plot yields Δn = 10 and Tm = 3.8°C as the abscissa and ordinate of vertex, respectively, for monoenoic C(18):C(18:1Δn)PC (Fig. 2). The calorimetric Tm value for aqueous dispersion of saturated C(18):C(18)PC is 55.3°C(22Huang C. Wang Z. Lin H. Brumbaugh E.E. Li S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The calculated Tm value for C(18):C(18:1Δ)PC based on the coordinates of vertex of the best fit parabola shown in Fig. 2 is 3.8°C, corresponding to a significant drop in absolute temperature of 15.7%. However, as the Δ bond moves toward either end of the sn-2 acyl chain, the Tm-lowering effect is diminished considerably. The identification of an inverted bell-shaped relationship between the Tm values of monoenoic phosphatidylcholines and the different positions of the cis-double bond along the sn-2 acyl chain should come as no surprise, since a similar but not identical relationship with the lowest Tm value occurring at the Δ bond position of C(10) has also been observed for the lipid bilayers of a different series of chemically distinct C(18):C(18:1Δn)PE (23Wang Z. Lin H. Li S. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For comparison, the statistical least squares line best fit to the calorimetric data obtained with C(18):C(18:1Δn)PE is presented in Fig. 2 as a dotted line. We have semisynthesized five additional series of sn-1 saturated/sn-2 monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines, and the aqueous dispersions prepared from these five series of lipids have been subsequently studied calorimetrically. Within each of the five series, the sn-1 acyl chain length is increased stepwise by two methylene units, but the chemical composition of the sn-2 acyl chain is fixed. Fig. 3 illustrates the second DSC heating scans for aqueous dispersions of four lipid samples, which represent one of the five series of monoenoic lipids under study. In this series of examples, the sn-1 acyl chains of the four lipids are derived from stearic, arachidic, behenic, and lignoceric acids, respectively, whereas the sn-2 acyl chains are derived commonly from gondoic acids or 11-eicosenoic acids (20:1Δ). Fig. 3 shows clearly a distinct gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition exhibited by each sample. In this figure, the Tm and ΔH values associated with the endothermic transition are observed to increase progressively with increasing sn-1 acyl chain length. Among the four lipid species shown in Fig. 3, C(20):C(20:1Δ)PC is the only one that has been studied previously by DSC(24Keough K.M.W. Giffin B. Kariel N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Tm and ΔH values obtained from Fig. 3 for C(20):C(20:1Δ)PC are 19.8°C and 7.5 kcal/mol, respectively, which are comparable to those reported in the literature (24Keough K.M.W. Giffin B. Kariel N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Aqueous lipid dispersions prepared from four other series of sn-1 saturated/sn-2 monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines in which the sn-2 acyl chains are derived from petroselenic, oleic, erucic, and nervonic acids have also been studied calorimetrically. The thermodynamic data (Tm, ΔH, ΔS, and ΔT) associated with the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition exhibited by aqueous dispersions prepared individually from these lipids and lipids of the first series (Fig. 3) are listed in Table 1. In Fig. 4, the Tm value is plotted against the total number of carbon atoms in the saturated sn-1 acyl chain for each of these monoenoic lipids. Clearly, the Tm value is observed to increase with increasing total number of carbon atoms in the sn-1 acyl chain for all five series of monoenoic lipids. This general trend reflects that an increase in the sn-1 acyl chain length is accompanied by an increase in the stability of the lipid bilayer in the gel state. Upon a closer inspection of Fig. 4, the Tm curves for C(X):C(18:1Δ9)PC, C(X):C(20:1Δ)PC, C(X):C(22:1Δ)PC, and C(X):C(24:1Δ)PC show that the larger the number of carbon atoms that can be found in the sn-2 acyl chain, the higher the Tm curve for a given lipid series. However, the correlation between the Tm curve and the total number of carbon atoms in the sn-2 acyl chain, based on the shape of the Tm curve, is not perfect. Furthermore, the Tm curve exhibited by aqueous dispersions prepared from the series of C(X):C(18:1Δ6)PC, shown in Fig. 4, appears to be completely out of place among other Tm curves. Recall the chain melting studies of a homologous series of lipids with different positions of the Δ bond (Fig. 2); the misplaced curve shown in Fig. 4 is thus most likely the result of the influence of the position of the Δ bond. In the case of C(X):C(18:1Δ6)PC, the Δ bond is positioned three C-C bond lengths away from C(10), the geometric center of the linear segment of sn-2 acyl chain. The Δ bond in the series of C(X):C(18:1Δ9)PC, however, lies commonly at the geometric center of their sn-2 acyl chains. In fact, the other two series of lipids also have their Δ bonds located at or near the geometric center of the sn-2 acyl chains. In summary, experimental data shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the Tm value of the lipid bilayer comprised of sn-1 saturated/sn-2 monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines depends on the total number of carbon atoms in both acyl chains as well as the position of the Δ bond along the sn-2 acyl chain. The ΔH values exhibited by various sn-1 saturated/sn-2 monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines can be grouped according to the total number of carbon atoms in the two acyl chains of the lipid structure. The results are given in Table 2. They show that the ΔH value does not, within the large experimental error, vary greatly for each member of the same group with a common molecular weight (or total number of carbon atoms). As a result, the weight"

Permanganate footprinting confirmed that there is a strict nucleotide requirement for forming open promoter complexes that cannot be overcome by the addition of a dinucleotide primer corresponding to the start site sequence. However, higher concentrations of other nucleoside triphosphates can substitute for ATP in catalyzing open complex formation. Opening catalyzed by these nucleotides is inhibited by the ATP analogue adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate), suggesting that they may function through cross-binding to the ATP site. The KM for ATP for opening and the involvement of other nucleotides in opening differs from the characteristics reported for TFIIH helicase and C-terminal domain kinase activities. This raises the possibility that opening does not involve these activities. The results alleviate very significantly the considerable current uncertainty concerning the role of ATP in the mammalian mRNA transcription initiation pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2003746601,"Several recent investigations have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) binds to the cell surface and undergoes zymogen activation via a plasma membrane-associated activity. The purpose of this study was to determine if association of MMP-2 with the plasma membrane also modulates the catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. Using density gradient centrifugation, we isolated the plasma membrane fractions of two ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines, DOV 13 and OVCA 432, previously described either to express MMP-2 or to express no gelatinolytic metalloproteinases, respectively. While DOV 13 cells contained plasma membrane-associated MMP-2 and OVCA 432 did not, both cell types were able to bind exogenous MMP-2. Furthermore, plasma membrane fractions from these cells significantly enhanced the rate of cleavage of [14C]gelatin I substrate by both MMP-2•tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) complex (2.5-8-fold) and TIMP-2-free MMP-2 (5.9-fold). This stimulatory activity was dose-dependent, soluble in Triton X-100, and abolished by trypsin treatment of the membranes, but was stable to heat treatment. Plasma membrane stimulation of MMP-2 resulted in a 3.8-4.6-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of gelatinolysis. These data suggest that, in addition to promoting zymogen activation, cell surface binding of MMP-2 may regulate enzyme activity by increasing the rate of substrate cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2025938539,"The human Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FcγRIII, CD16) is encoded by two nearly identical genes, FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B, resulting in tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.

It is suggested that these nucleotide differences might contribute to cell type-specific transcription of FcγRIII genes. Human leukocyte receptors for the Fc fragment of IgG (FcγR) play an important role in immune responses as they link the humoral immune system with cellular effector functions. Fcγ receptors represent a family of cell surface glycoproteins mediating clearance and phagocytosis of immune complexes, various forms of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)1 and release of inflammatory cytokines (for review, see (1van de Winkel J.G.J. Anderson C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Fcγ receptors have been divided into three classes, namely a high affinity class (FcγRI) and two low affinity classes (FcγRII and FcγRIII). All are members of the Ig gene superfamily. Within each group, multiple subtypes have been identified by molecular cloning. Structurally conserved extracellular domains are linked to divergent transmembrane and intracellular domains. Distinctive Fcγ receptor genes in addition to differently spliced messages from the same Fcγ receptor gene are expressed on different cell types in a tissue-specific manner generating diverse cellular responses upon interaction with IgG immune complexes (for review, see (2Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The low affinity receptor FcγRIII (CD16) is a 50-80-kDa membrane glycoprotein(3Huizinga T.W.J. van der Schoot C.E. Jost C. Klaassen R. Kleijer M. von dem Borne Jr., A.E.G. Roos D. Tetteroo P.A.T. Nature. 1988; 333: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). At least two isoforms encoded by two distinct genes, FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B, have been identified(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). An allotypic polymorphism, NA1 and NA2, has been described to be associated with the FcγRIII-B receptor isoform. FcγRIII-A is a transmembrane protein expressed on activated monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, and a subset of T cells(5Werfel T. Uciechowski P. Tetteroo P.A.T. Kurrle R. Deicher H. Schmidt R.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1102-1106PubMed Google Scholar, 6Phillips J.H. Chang C. Lanier L.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Uciechowski P. Gessner J.E. Schindler R. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1635-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, FcγRIII-B is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that is constitutively expressed by neutrophils and after γ-interferon (IFN-γ) stimulation by eosinophils(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 8Perussia B. Ravetch J.V. Eur. J.

In addition, FcγRIII-A-specific transcripts can be induced in growth-arrested human mesangial cells by IFN-γ(10Radeke H.H. Gessner J.E. Uciechowski P. Mägert H.-J. Schmidt R.E. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1281-1292PubMed Google Scholar). While the GPI FcγRIII-B isoform is expressed on the cell surface without other subunits, efficient expression of the transmembrane FcγRIII-A requires the presence of the FcɛRI γ subunit and is also enhanced by co-expression of CD3 ζ, a subunit of the T cell receptors' complex (11Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1989; 342: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Ra C. Jouvin M.-H.E. Blank U. Kinet J.-P.

A. 1990; 87: 2274-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Through their differential requirements for these associated “trigger” molecules, the FcγRIII isoforms mediate different functions(14Wirthmueller U. Kurosaki T. Murakami M.S. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The FcγRIII-A transmembrane receptor on NK cells mediates ADCC, where it represents the only FcγR(5Werfel T. Uciechowski P. Tetteroo P.A.T. Kurrle R. Deicher H. Schmidt R.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1102-1106PubMed Google Scholar). The GPI-linked FcγRIII-B receptor on polymorphonuclear leukocytes is certainly involved in cell activation, but its detailed role is still controversial(15Hundt M. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Huizinga T.W.J. van Kemenade F. Koenderman L. Dolman K.M. von dem Borne Jr., A.E.G. Tetteroo P.A.T. Roos D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2365-2369PubMed Google Scholar). The FcγRIII receptor appears to be under complex control. First, it is highly tissue-specific and is expressed on granulocytes as well as on activated monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, and some cytolytic T cell subsets. Second, only granulocytes use the GPI-linked FcγRIII-B isoform encoded by a second gene. Third, the FcγRIII-B isoform can be induced during Me2SO-initiated granulocytic differentiation of the HL60 human promyelocytic cell line. Fourth, depending on the cell type, both isoforms can be up-regulated by IFN-γ. In this study we report the cloning of both FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B gene promoters. Sequence analysis of all the cloned transcription initiation sites demonstrates structural heterogeneity through the use of alternative 5′-UT/S1 exons from the FcγRIII-A but not from the FcγRIII-B gene. We have defined the 5′ sequences necessary for promoter activity by transient transfection experiments with different parts of the FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B promoters in different cell lines. Both promoters (positions −198 to −10) displayed different tissue-specific transcriptional activities when coupled to a heterologous enhancer. These different tissue specificities are suggested to be due to nucleotide differences of the FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes identified at 10 positions in the −198/-10 region. Human NK cell lines have been generated from NKH1+ sorted cells of a normal donor as described previously(5Werfel T. Uciechowski P. Tetteroo P.A.T. Kurrle R. Deicher H. Schmidt R.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1102-1106PubMed Google Scholar). PMN were obtained from heparinized peripheral blood fractionated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (density 1.08) (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany). PMN were separated from erythrocytes by sedimentation in hydroxyethyl-starch (Fresenius AG, Bad Homburg, Germany) followed by hypotonic lysis. Several continuously growing cell lines were used for the transfection experiments. Jurkat is a T cell leukemia line(17Wiskocil R. Weiss A. Imboden J. Kamin-Lewis R. Stobo J. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1599-1603PubMed Google Scholar). U937 is a histiocytic cell line, and HL60 is a promyelocytic cell line(18Sundström C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 19Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, HL60 cells were induced to express the GPI-anchored FcγRIII-B receptor isoform upon culturing in the presence of 1.2% Me2SO(20Perussia B. Ravetch J.V. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 425-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YT, a cell line with NK-like characteristics, was originally established by the group of J. Yodoi(21Yodoi J. Teshigawara K. Nikaido T. Fukui K. Noma T. Honjo T. Takigawa M. Sasaki M. Minato N. Tsudo M. Uchiyama T. Maeda M. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line has been described to express FcγRIII. 2J. Yodoi, personal communication. High molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from human leukocytes of 15 healthy donors with known NA1/NA2 phenotype using standard methods(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, SalI, or TaqI; separated through an agarose gel; transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Corp.); and subjected to Southern blot analysis. Blots were hybridized with probes generated from the NA1-FcγRIII-B cDNA pGP5 (generously provided by Dr. K.W. Moore, DNAX, Palo Alto, CA)(23Peltz G.A. Grundy H.O. Lebo R.V. Yssel H. Barsh G.S. Moore K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The structure of these probes is shown (see Fig. 2A). Some blots were also hybridized with S1 and EC1 specific oligonucleotides. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). After overnight hybridization, blots were washed at high stringency in 0.2 × SSC, 1% SDS at 65°C and exposed for 24-72 h to Kodak XAR5 x-ray film. A genomic DNA library was constructed in the EMBL3 phage vector (24Frischauf A.M. Lehrach H. Poustka A. Murray N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 170: 827-842Crossref Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) by using MboI partial digests of human placenta DNA. We screened 106 plaques with the EC2 380-bp SalI-KpnI fragment (nucleotides 258-638, see Fig. 2A) of the pGP5. Seven independent hybridization-positive plaques were purified to homogeneity after two additional rounds of screening; four of them also hybridized with the 5′ end BamHI-BglII fragment (containing 80 bp of 5′-UT and signal sequence, see Fig. 2A). Genomic DNA inserts from these four phage clones were isolated, digested with SalI (in polylinker of EMBL3) and TaqI, and compared with the TaqI restriction mapping data from the 5′ end distinguishing between the two FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes (Fig. 1B). Two genomic clones, λ32 (part of the FcγRIII-A gene) and λ31 (NA2 allele of FcγRIII-B), containing the putative promoter regions were identified and selected for further analysis. The DNA inserts from the selected clones λ32 and λ31 were analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping using BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and SalI followed by Southern blotting analysis(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The restriction maps were compared with the two FcγRIII genes characterized by the group of Ravetch(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analyses of the promoter regions were done on two 3-kb HindIII-XhoI fragments (Fig. 2B) subcloned into the pBluescript KS(+) vector (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) by the chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) using a T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Amersham Corp.). Derivatives of both subclones were generated by use of the unique restriction sites, as outlined in Fig. 2C. Primer extension was performed according to methods described previously(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from PMN and cultured CD3- NK cell lines according to the guanidinium thiocyanate method(26Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar), followed by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose for enrichment of poly(A)+ RNA. A 32P-end labeled synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide was mixed with 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from PMN and NK cells and an 80% formamide-containing buffer (pH 7.4), heated to 85°C for 10 min, and incubated submerged at 42°C overnight. The extension reaction was performed with 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 μl of the recommended buffer and with actinomycin D (50 μg/ml) at 42°C for 2 h. After RNase treatment, the extension products were sized by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. 32P-end labeled pBR322/HaeIII DNA fragments were used as molecular weight markers. The oligonucleotide used for primer extension, 5′-CTAGAAGTAGCAGAGCAGTTGGGAGGAGCA-3′ corresponds to FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B sequences +11 to +40 relative to the translation start codon (ATG). RNase protection was performed according to methods described previously(27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). For this study we inserted the 771- and 767-bp ApaI/EcoNI restriction fragments (positions −711 and −707 to +60 in Fig. 3) from the 5′ end of each gene into the ApaI/XbaI sites of the pBluescript KS(+) vector. Plasmid DNAs were digested with KpnI (in the polylinker of pKS+) or with BamHI and BstYI (position −348 within both genes, see Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:a), and the respective antisense RNA probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (67 units) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), [α-32P]UTP, and recommended buffers. After DNase treatment to remove the template, the probe was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in hybridization buffer, and mixed directly with the test RNA. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to verify that greater than 95% of the synthesized probe was of full-length. Hybridization was performed with 30 μg of total cellular RNA, 1 × 105 cpm of probe, and 30 μl of formamide hybridization buffer as described above for primer extension. The mixture was heated to 85°C for 10 min and incubated submerged overnight at 45°C. Digestion of the RNA:RNA hybrids was performed with a mixture of RNase A (DNase-free, Pharmacia) and RNase T1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, protected fragments were sized and visualized as described above. A dideoxynucleotide sequencing ladder of the ApaI/EcoNI FcγRIII-A or B fragment primed with the T7 oligonucleotide of pKS+ was run in parallel.Figure 5:Mapping the transcription-initiation sites of the human FcγRIII A and B mRNA. a, schematic presentation of the promoter region of the FcγRIII genes A and B, the two 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes, and the oligonucleotide primer used for RNase protection and primer extension assays, respectively. The sequences of genes A and B containing transcription-initiation sites are shown below the schematic diagram. The transcription-initiation sites are indicated by vertical bars; the height of each bar is roughly proportional to the amount of mRNA starting at a particular site, as estimated from the RNase protection experiments or primer extension assay. b, primer extension of the human FcγRIII A and B RNAs: 50 μg of total RNA from PMN and negative control tRNA (not shown) and 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from NK cells were hybridized with a 5′-end labeled synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides +11 to +40 in exon S1 followed by extension using reverse transcriptase. Sizes of reverse transcribed products were determined by comparison with HaeIII digested pBR322 DNA fragments of known molecular weights as shown on the right. The numbering of the primer-extended products indicate their distance to the ATG codon designated as +1. The localization of the major RNA species relative to the ATG codon is indicated on the left for the FcγRIII-Aa1 and FcγRIII-Bb1 transcripts. The 167-, 156-, 153-, and 540-nucleotide bands represent the FcγRIII-Aa2/a3 and the potential FcγRIII-Aa4 transcripts. c, RNase protection assay of the 5′ portion of FcγRIII A and B RNAs: 30 μg of total RNA from negative control tRNA and from PMN and NK cells were hybridized to the riboprobe synthesized from the gene A-derived BamHI-EcoNI fragment or from the gene B-derived BstYI-EcoNI fragment. Sizes of protected fragments were determined by comparison with a sequencing reaction run in parallel. The negative numbering of the multiple transcription-initiation sites indicate their distance to the ATG codon designated as +1. Using the III-B riboprobe, the 380-nucleotide FcγRIII-Aa4 protected fragment observed in NK cells with the III-A riboprobe is converted into four smaller bands, as indicated by the arrows. The protected band at −45 represents the splice site used by the FcγRIII-Aa2 transcript, as highlighted by the asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The strategy to obtain cDNA clones for all the different transcription initiation sites was similar to that originally employed by Frohman and co-workers(28Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). Starting with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from PMN and NK cells, the reverse transcription reaction was performed using 20 pmol of a FcγRIII-A/B gene-specific primer reverse complementary to EC1 sequences (5′-CTTCTAGCTGCACCGGGTCACTG-3′ position 343-321 in (4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The cDNA pools were subsequently tailed with 15 units of TdT (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 0.1 mM dATP for 10 min at 37°C. After purification of the reaction mixture, one-fifth was used for PCR amplification with 10 pmol of oligo(dT)17-adaptor(28Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar), 25 pmol of adaptor(28Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar), and 25 pmol of a second internal EC1 primer (5′-CACTGTCGTTGACTGTGGCAG-3′, reverse complement to nucleotides at positions 286-266) in a total volume of 100 μl. 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) was added, and the mixture was annealed at 56°C for 2 min. The tailed cDNA was extended at 72°C for 30 min. Using a Thermocycler (MHH, Hannover, Germany), we carried out 40 cycles of amplification by using a step program (95°C, 45 s; 56°C, 2 min; 72°C, 3 min), followed by a 15-min final extension at 72°C. Purified RACE/PCR products were digested with SalI (located in the adaptor) and BglII (at position 98 near the S2/EC1 border of FcγRIII-A/B) and cloned into SalI/BamHI-digested pKS+. Plasmids with FcγRIII-A or FcγRIII-B cDNA inserts were identified through restriction analyses with PvuII generating a fragment of about 180 bp (from 79 in the S2 exon of FcγRIII-A/B to position 529 of pKS+). Miniprep plasmid DNA was sequenced using the 32P-labeled primer originally employed for the primer extension experiment. The constructs were generated by cloning FcγRIII-A and B genomic sequences from −10 to −33, from −10 to −198 and from −10 to −1817/-1821 into the BamHI/BglII site of the promoterless luciferase expression vector pLuc, originally designated as pAH1409. The SV40 luciferase (Luc) construct containing the Luc reporter gene downstream of the SV40 promoter and the pAH1409 plasmid were provided by the group of Dr. A. E. Sippel, Freiburg, Germany. The lysozyme enhancer is a 240-bp BglII subfragment from the human lysozyme gene located at −10.2 kb from the transcriptional start site (29Peters C.W.B. Kruse U. Pollwein R. Grzeschik K.H. Sippel A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and was cloned into the KpnI site 3′ to the luciferase gene, generating the (LysE) Luc construct. For expression assays of the FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B promoters in the presence of the heterologous lysozyme enhancer, the −198 fragments were inserted into p(LysE)Luc. The cells, maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum at 2 × 107 cells/ml, were incubated with 50 μg of the promoter constructs for 5 min at room temperature in a Bio-Rad 0.4-cm cuvette. No carrier DNA was used. Plasmid DNA was prepared using equilibrium centrifugation in cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradients. U937, HL60, Jurkat and YT cells were electroporated at 300 V, 960 microfarads, incubated for 15 min on ice, and then transferred to 30 ml of prewarmed RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum. 20 h after transfection, cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were extracted in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer (25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) by two times of freezing and thawing. Luciferase activity was measured in a Berthold biolumat in 22.5 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgSO4, and 0.2 mM luciferin. Analysis of the gene structure had identified two highly conserved genes encoding the transmembrane FcγRIII-A and the GPI-linked FcγRIII-B receptor isoforms, as described recently(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In addition, the FcγRIII-B gene coding for the GPI-linked isoform on PMN exists in two allelic forms representing the NA1/NA2 antigen system. The FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes have different TaqI and BamHI restriction patterns. For example the presence or absence of a TaqI site within the fifth exon is informative for the different membrane anchorages. Using the 601-bp KpnI-EcoRI probe from the transmembrane domain/cytoplasmic region/3′-UT Exon (Fig. 2A) five TaqI restriction fragments of about 6.5 (representing FcγRIIIB NA-2 allele), 3.0-3.7 (triplicate after a long run), and a weak band at about 0.2 kb (representing in addition to the 3.5 band the FcγRIII-A gene, caused by the internal TaqI site at position 733) can be detected with DNA derived from NA1/NA2 heterozygotes. This pattern was originally described by Ravetch and co-workers(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), who have shown that the T to C change at position 733 in the transcripts encoded by the FcγRIII-A gene eliminates the TGA stop codon present in the FcγRIII-B gene. Concerning the 5′ regions of both FcγRIII genes, we have performed single and double digests of genomic DNA from 15 unrelated donors (with different phenotypes according to the PMN specific NA1/NA2 antigen system) using BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and SalI. These Southern blot analyses proved to be consistent with the genomic organization of the two FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes described in (4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). BamHI digests demonstrated in addition to a 4.8-kb band a second restriction fragment of >23 kb after hybridization with the 5′ end BamHI-BglII fragment of pGP5 (containing 80 bp of 5′-UT and signal sequence, Fig. 2A) in NA2/NA2 donors but not in NA1/NA1 homozygotes (Fig. 1A). Therefore the BamHI site generating the 4.8-kb fragment is missing within the NA2 allele of FcγRIII-B. This BamHI site is localized about 0.3 kb within the 5′-flanking region of the NA1-FcγRIII-B and the FcγRIII-A genes, as estimated from the HindIII/BamHI double digests (Fig. 1A). The NA2-FcγRIII-B specific loss of the BamHI site co-segregates with the loss of a SalI site within the third exon EC1, also known to be NA2-FcγRIII-B gene specific (data not shown)(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The restriction pattern of TaqI after hybridization with oligonucleotides specific for the two Exons S1 and EC1 distinguishes between the FcγRIII-A and the NA1 or NA2 FcγRIII-B genes. Irrespective of the phenotype used, TaqI demonstrated two restriction fragments of about 6 kb (FcγRIII-A, from 0.2 kb downstream to 5.8 kb upstream of the ATG) and about 2 kb (NA1/NA2-FcγRIII-B, from 0.2 kb downstream to 1.8 upstream of the ATG) (Fig. 1B). The location of these TaqI sites within the first intron and the 5′-flanking regions of the FcγRIII-A and the two alleles of the FcγRIII-B genes were observed to be different from the corresponding region presented earlier(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Seven different recombinant clones that hybridized to the EC2 380-bp SalI-KpnI fragment (nucleotides 258-638, Fig. 2A) of the human FcγRIII-B cDNA pGP5 were identified. The two selected clones λ32 and λ31 exhibited a pattern of TaqI-hybridizing bands as expected from the determined structure of the FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes, respectively. The recombinant clone λ31 was identified as the NA2-FcγRIII-B gene without the BamHI site present in the NA1-FcγRIII-B gene. Complete restriction maps from λ32 and λ31 were constructed by digestion with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and SalI (Fig. 2B). The two 3-kb HindIII-XhoI fragments (Fig. 2B) containing the 5′ end of the FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes were selected, and parts of these fragments were subcloned and sequenced according to the strategy outlined in Fig. 2C. The nucleotide sequences beginning at the HindIII sites 1817 and 1821 bp upstream and ending at different XhoI sites 1115 and 1216 bp downstream of the first ATG present in the pGP5 cDNA sequence were determined for the FcγRIII-A and FcγRIII-B genes (Fig. 3). The XhoI sites are located at positions within the EC1 exon as expected from cDNA sequence analysis of NA1 or NA2 FcγRIII-B and FcγRIII-A transcripts(4Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 23Peltz G.A. Grundy H.O. Lebo R.V. Yssel H. Barsh G.S. Moore K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Comparison of the sequences indicates only slight differences. A total of 58 substitutions and 16 deletions are detected within the first two introns and the flanking region. From the 38 substitutions of the flanking region, 26 are found within the first 500 bp upstream of the ATG codon. The deletion of an 8-bp sequence TGGAGCCT at position −880 in the FcγRIII-A gene changes the 3-fold repeating sequence GGAGCCCT present at the same position within the FcγRIII-B gene. The genomic sequences upstream from the ATG codon lack the common CAAT and TATA promoter elements at their characteristic positions. In case of the FcγRIII-B gene, a pyrimidine-rich initiator (Inr) sequence is present (32Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar).

Lovastatin blocked an ability of insulin to activate p21ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Lovastatin also significantly (p < 0.01) reduced insulin effects on thymidine incorporation and glucose incorporation into glycogen. Nevertheless, an effect of insulin on glucose uptake remained unaffected. It appears that in contrast to its mitogenic action and to its effect on glycogenesis, an effect of insulin on glucose uptake does not require p21ras activation.

The “Ras pathway” has been identified as a key element of cellular signaling by several growth factors including insulin (1Bogulski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), (2Yamauchi K Holt K Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Insulin activates p21ras by stimulating the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor or Sos that facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras proteins (5Medema R.H. deVries-Smits A.M.M. van der Zon G.C.M.

The cascade of events leading to activation of p21ras by insulin involves insulin binding, activation of the tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor, tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 and She, and an association of the Grb-2-Sos complexes with either insulin receptor substrate-1 or She (3Skolnik E.Y.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An active conformation of p21ras (p21ras-GTP) stimulates Raf-1 kinase with a subsequent propagation of the signal downstream to mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related and MAP1 kinases (7Moodie S.A.

Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The sequential activation of these steps has been implicated in the mitogenic signaling of insulin and other growth factors (1Bogulski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar-4Buday L. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Chuang L.M. Myers M.G.

However, the role of the Ras pathway in mediating metabolic activities of insulin remains incompletely understood. Recently, the role of Ras signaling in cellular glucose transport activity has been studied by a number of groups. Kozma et al. (10Kozma L. Baltensperger K. Klarlund J. Parras A. Santos E. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Lys-61 N-Ras transformation of 3T3-L1 cells led to enhanced basal glucose transport and blocked insulin-mediated transport activity. Fingar and Birnbaum (11Fingar D.C. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10127-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) stably transfected the cellular proto-oncogene c-raf-1 into 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and observed an enhanced expression of GLUT-1, partitioned mainly in the plasma membrane, with normal GLUT-4 distribution and insulin-mediated translocation. Introduction of constitutively activated p21ras (G12V) by microinjections into 3T3-L1 adipocytes demonstrated that p21ras mediates the insulin-induced increase in GLUT-1 expression but is not involved in the regulation of GLUT-4 (12Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Van den Berghe and colleagues (13van den Berghe N. Ouwens D.M.

On a separate arm of the insulin signaling pathway, two groups have now reported that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol kinase 3 pathway with selective inhibitors wortmannin (14Okada T.

In this study, we examined insulin effects on glucose transport and glucose incorporation into glycogen in cells in which the Ras pathway was interrupted using lovastatin, an inhibitor of Ras farnesylation (16Casey P.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11548-11552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ras proteins have been shown to undergo farnesylation, an attachment of the C-l carbon of the farnesyl to a cysteine sulfhydryl of the CAAX motif of Ras (18Volker C. Miller R.A. McCleary W.R. Rao A.

This modification (along with a subsequent methylation) allows Ras proteins to interact with the plasma membrane where they become a target for activation by growth factors (17Cox A.D. Graham S.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22672-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used an inhibitor of farnesylation, lovastatin, to examine the role of p21ras in the mechanism of the metabolic signaling of insulin. We observed a blunting of glucose incorporation into glycogen with no impairment of glucose transport activity. As a primary model, we used Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with human insulin receptors (HIRc cells). Most of the results were then confirmed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, an insulin-sensitive cell line, possessing native insulin receptors. Cell culture media and supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. and Gemini Bioproducts (Calabasas, CA); radioisotopes were from DuPont NEN; lovastatin was from Merck. All standard chemicals were from Sigma. Insulin was a gift from Lilly, and bacterially expressed c-Ha-ras was from Dr. Alan Wolfman (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with wild type human insulin receptors (3 x 105 insulin receptors/cells) were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 plus 10% FCS plus HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 500 nM methotrexate. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to confluence in fibroblast growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) (5.5 ml glucose plus 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mM glutamine). Two days after confluency, cells were fed differentiation media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) (25 mM glucose, 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mmol of glutamine plus differentiation mix (2.5 ml of 10 x PBS, 0.055 g of isobutylmethylxan-thene, 20 ml of deionized water, 250 pi of 49 mM dexamethasone, 2.5 mg of insulin)). On day 4, cells were fed adipocyte growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) (25 mM glucose plus 10% FCS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mM glutamine) plus 1 μg/ml insulin. Cells were refed these media every 2 days and used around day 10-12. Confluent HIRc or 3T3-L1 cells were serum starved and incubated with lovastatin (2 μg/ml) for 24 h. During the final 4 h of the lovastatin incubation, the cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.25 mCi/ml). The increment in percent p2 was determined as previously described (6Draznin B. Chang L. Leitner J.W. Takata Y. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19998-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ras antibody Y13-259 (100 μg/ml), and the nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography. GTP and GDP were visualized using acid molybdate reagent, cut, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Determination of GEF activity was performed as previously described (6Draznin B. Chang L. Leitner J.W. Takata Y. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19998-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, to assay the Ras GEF, purified c-Ha-ras (500 ng, 28 pmol) was incubated with 3 pM [3H]GDP (32 Ci/mmol) in 50 pi of binding buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 400 μg/ml chain A insulin) for 15 min at 30 °C. The complex was stabilized by addition of 5 pi of 127 mM MgCl2 for a final concentration of 10 mM. Unlabeled cultured cells were stimulated with 17-100 nM insulin or 133 nM EGF for 10 min at 37 °C, and lysates were prepared as before. Ras-GDP complex (5 pi, 50 ng) was added to 200 pi of lysate (200 pg of protein) or lysis buffer and incubated at 23 °C. At intervals, 50-pl aliquots were removed and filtered through 0.45 pM Millipore nitrocellulose filters, which were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 100 pM ATP. The radioactivity of [3H]GDP bound to p21ras was quantitated by scintillation counting. A value of 0% release represents 10,325 ° 442 cpm bound. Background cpm were less than 1% of the total bound [3H]GDP. [3H]GDP binding to p21ras was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and integrity of dissociated [3H]GDP by thin layer chromatography. Confluent HIRc and 3T3-L1 cells were serum starved for 24 h and then treated with insulin (0-100 nM) and with or without lovastatin for 15 h. [3H]Thymidine was added for the final 3 h. Cells were washed (3x with PBS) and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Precipitable counts were solubilized and counted using a scintillation counter. Confluent cells were serum starved in low glucose (5 mM) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with lovastatin (2 μg/ml) for 16 h. Insulin (0-100 nM) and 14C-labeled 2-deoxyglucose were added for the final 3 h. Glucose incorporation into glycogen was measured as previously described (22Thies R.S. Ullrich A. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then solubilized with 0.85 ml of 60% KOH at 37 °C for 30 min. The solubilized cells were transferred to glass tubes containing 4 mg of glycogen and incubated 30 min at 100 °C. Ice-cold ethanol was added to precipitate the glycogen. Following centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water, and [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined by scintillation counting. Confluent HIRc and 3T3-L1 cells were refed with serum-free media and treated with lovastatin (2 μg/ml) for 18 h prior to use. Cells were rinsed and incubated in 1% Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer with and without insulin (100 nM) and lovastatin (2 μg/ml). Glucose uptake was assessed by a 3-min pulse with 0.5 pCi/plate of 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose to a final glucose concentration of 0.1 mM. Cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 1 NaOH and 3H counts assessed by scintillation counting. Under these conditions, simple diffusion measured by L-glucose uptake was less than 5% of 2-deoxyglucose uptake. MAP kinase activity was determined as described by Heasley et al. (23Heasley L.E. Senkfor S.T. Winitz S. Strasheim A. Teitelbaum I. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent HIRc and 3T3-L1 cells were challenged with or without 100 nM insulin for 15 min, rinsed, and lysed with MAP kinase lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM /3-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 min, and then cell-free extracts were adsorbed to 0.5 ml of DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) columns, washed with three 1-ml aliquots of 40 mM /3-glycerophosphate P, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2, and then eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mM NaCl. Aliquots (20 pi) of column eluant were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 20 ml of 50 mM /3-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.2), 100 pM [y-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pm), 25 μg/ml cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (PKI-(5-24); (Bachem California, Torrence, CA) and 20 pM EGFR662 68l peptide (RRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR) (donated by Dr. L. Heasley, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) (23Heasley L.E. Senkfor S.T. Winitz S. Strasheim A. Teitelbaum I. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 pi of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and aliquots were spotted on Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose (Fisher) and washed. Phosphorylated EGFR662_6gl peptide retained on filters was quantified by scintillation counting. To assess the impact of lovastatin upon hexokinase activity and the accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate, HIRc and 3T3-L1 cells were processed for glucose transport as described above. The cells were then homogenized in 0.6 M perchloric acid and centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant was neutralized and applied to a Dowex AG 1-X8 200 mesh column (0.5 x 5 cm) followed by 5 ml of H20 and 5 ml of 1 N HC1. 20 0.5-ml fractions were collected in scintillation vials and counted as described by Heidenreich et al. (24Heidenreich K.A. Gilmore P.R. Garvey W.T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with human insulin receptors (HIRc cells with 3 x 105 insulin receptors/cell) and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes possessing native insulin receptors were treated with lovastatin (2 μg/ml), an inhibitor of HMG-CoA-reductase (which is an enzyme that produces mevalonate, the precursor of all isoprenoids (16Casey P.J. Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Higgins J.B. Thissen J.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 215-238PubMed Google Scholar)), for 18-24 h prior to exposure to insulin (100 nM, 15-30 min at 37 °C). Lovastatin inhibited the ability of insulin to activate p21ras in HIRc (Fig. 1) by 90% (p < 0.001). Inhibition of Ras farnesylation with lovastatin also ablated insulin effect on p21ras activation in 3T3-L1 cells. In control cells, insulin increased p21ras-GTP association by 40%, whereas there was no effect (0%) of insulin in the lovastatin-treated cells. Although lovastatin is known to inhibit farnesylation of Ras proteins, it can also affect the signaling cascade upstream of Ras, such as an activation of guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. We tested this possibility by assessing an effect of lovastatin on insulin's ability to activate GEF in HIRc cells. Insulin exhibited normal stimulation of guanine nucleotide releasing factor activity (Table I) in the lovastatin-treated cells, suggesting that the upstream steps of insulin signaling leading to an activation of guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Sos were intact in the lovastatin-treated cells. However, because of the inhibition of farnesylation with lovastatin, normal GEF activity did not result in activation of p21ras.Table 1GEF activity in control, insulin-, and lovastatin-treated cells GEF was assayed as previously described (6Draznin B. Chang L. Leitner J.W. Takata Y. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19998-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as % GDP released. Insulin significantly increased (p < 0.01) GEF activity. Lovastatin had no effect, neither in control nor in insulin-treated cells. Open table in a new tab MAP kinase activity was measured in cell extracts adsorbed to DEAE-Sephacel columns and eluted with 0.5 m NaCl. The eluant was used to phosphorylate 200 pM of EGFR662_681 peptide (RRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR) in an in vitro kinase assay. Consistent with an inadequate stimulation of p21ras, lovastatin-treated cells displayed markedly decreased insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity. In control HIRc cells, insulin increased MAP kinase activity 15-fold, from 18.4 ° 2 cpm/pmol to 270.1 ° 92 cpm/pmol; whereas in the lovastatin-treated cells, insulin's effect was less than 5-fold (from 23.4 ° 0.3 cpm/pmol to 100.1 ° 0.7 cpm/pmol, p > 0.01). As anticipated, insulin stimulation of [3H]thymi-dine incorporation was significantly inhibited (p > 0.01 for both) in the lovastatin-treated HIRc and 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2). [14C]Glucose incorporation into glycogen was also significantly blunted in the lovastatin-treated cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that these aspects of insulin action require activation of p21ras.Fig. 3.Glucose incorporation into glycogen. A [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen dose-response curve in HIRc cells (upper panel) and 3T3-L1 cells (lower panel) revealed a significant impairment in glucose incorporation into glycogen at 10-100 mM insulin in response to insulin in the lovastatin-treated cells (closed circles) versus the control cells (open circles) (p < 0.01 for HIRc cells and p < 0.05 for 3T3-L1 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, insulin stimulation of glucose uptake was unaffected by lovastatin in both cell lines (Fig. 4), indicating that p21ras and MAP kinase lie outside of the insulin signaling of glucose transport. To examine whether an inhibitory effect of lovastatin on glucose incorporation into glycogen was mediated by differences in the amount of glucose 6-phosphate, we measured glucose 6-phosphate in control and lovastatin-treated cells (Fig. 5). The amounts of glucose 6-phosphate were similar in these cells, suggesting the presence of normal glucose uptake and phosphorylation. Recent experiments revealed an important role of the Ras pathway in mediating mitogenic effects of insulin and other growth factors (1Bogulski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 2Yamauchi K Holt K Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Skolnik E.Y.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An involvement of this pathway into metabolic signaling by insulin has not been explored in detail. Since many growth factors activate p21ras proteins (but only insulin stimulates glucose uptake), it is clear that activation of Ras alone is not sufficient to promote glucose transport. This conclusion was recently supported by the observation that stimulation of the Ras pathway in the insulin-sensitive cells by EGF or thrombin was not sufficient to mimic insulin-mediated glucose transport (13van den Berghe N. Ouwens D.M. Maassen J.A. van Mackelenbergh M.G.H. Sips H.C.M. Krans H.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, recent findings indicated that activation of the MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 cells was not sufficient for the activation of glucose transport and glycogen synthase (25Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26422-26427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of the Ras pathway with stably transfected proto-oncogenic mutants of Ras and Raf-1 led to enhanced basal hexose transport in 3T3-L1 cells (10Kozma L. Baltensperger K. Klarlund J.

A. 1993; 90: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) has stably transfected a dominant positive Ras mutant (Lys-61 N-Ras) into 3T3-L1 cells and observed that Ras activation increased basal glucose transport activity and precluded further stimulation of glucose transport with insulin. Expression of the Lys-61 N-Ras did not influence either basal or insulin-stimulated activity of the phosphatidylinositol kinase 3. Furthermore, stable transfection of 3T3-L1 cells with Lys-61 N-Ras resulted in diminution of GLUT-4 protein content and redistribution of GLUT-1 to the plasma membrane (10Kozma L. Baltensperger K. Klarlund J. Parras A. Santos E. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, 3T3-L1 cells stably transfected with the c-raf-1 protooncogene demonstrated an enhanced GLUT-1 content, which was found predominantly on the cell surface (11Fingar D.C. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10127-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, GLUT-4 content and basal cellular localization, as well as translocation in response to insulin, were not affected. At the same time, insulin stimulated glucose uptake only 1.2-fold in the transfected cells, which was significantly less than a 16-fold stimulation seen in control cells. This decrease was due to a greatly enhanced basal glucose uptake. Similar results were obtained in 3T3-L1 cells microinjected with constitutively active or dominant negative p21ras (12Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proto-oncogene, p21ras (12Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). appears to mediate insulin effect on GLUT-1 expression but exerted no influence on translocation of GLUT-4 (10Kozma L. Baltensperger K. Klarlund J. Parras A. Santos E. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Fingar D.C. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that constitutively active Ras or Raf enhances basal glucose uptake primarily as a result of increased expression of GLUT-1. The present experiments demonstrate that an acute inhibition of Ras does not influence glucose transport, suggesting that within this time frame, stimulation of Ras with insulin lies outside the signaling pathway linking insulin receptor with glucose transport. In contrast, recent reports demonstrating ablation of insulin-mediated glucose transport with specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol kinase 3 (13van den Berghe N. Ouwens D.M. Maassen J.A. van Mackelenbergh M.G.H. Sips H.C.M. Krans H.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,15James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Rawson T.E.

Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) indicate a role of phosphatidylinositol kinase 3 in glucose transport activation. Conceivably, metabolic aspects of insulin action receive their signals from more than one linear path of signal transduction. The ultimate magnitude of insulin action may, thus, depend upon normal function and proper integration of these “redundant” pathways. In contrast to its minimal involvement with glucose transport, the Ras pathway appears to be extremely important for insulin effects on thymidine incorporation and glucose incorporation into glycogen. Assuming linear propagation of the insulin signaling from Ras to MAP kinase to glycogen synthase (other intermediates are omitted for clarity), these results are not surprising. Lovastatin inhibits activation of Ras and MAP kinase, with a resultant suboptimal stimulation of glucose incorporation into glycogen. The presence of normal glucose uptake and normal amounts of glucose 6-phosphate suggest that changes in glycogen synthase phosphorylation state are likely responsible for a decrease in its activity. Interestingly, that in the lovastatin-treated cells, insulin was still capable of activating MAP kinase despite almost complete absence of its effect on Ras. Since the MAP kinase activity assay does not differentiate among the members of the MAP kinase family, these results indicate that activation of certain MAP kinases by insulin may occur outside of Ras, supporting an existence of redundant pathways. In summary, it appears that certain aspects of the metabolic insulin signaling, such as glucose transport, may not require p21ras activation. Thus, diversification of insulin signaling into metabolic and mitogenic pathways occurs both upstream and downstream of p21ras. Recognition of divergent mechanisms of insulin signaling with regard to glucose transport versus other metabolic pathways, such as glycogen synthesis, may facilitate better understanding of clinical syndromes associated with resistance to glucose transport and enhanced glycogen synthesis (27Clore J.N. Blackard W.G. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or vice versa. We thank Gloria Smith for excellent secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2093675272,"Stimulation of rat pancreatic acinar cells with cholecystokinin (CCK) is known to result in a significant inhibition of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT), a rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Immunoprecipitation of CT from 32P-labeled acinar cells revealed that CCK treatment also caused a marked reduction in CT phosphate levels. The effects of CCK were maximal over 60 min and dependent on concentration, exhibiting an EC50 of 800 pM. Other calcium mobilizing secretagogues such as carbamylcholine (100 μM) and bombesin (10 nM) also reduced CT phosphate levels to 20 and 39% of control, respectively. Treatment of cells with thapsigargin and/or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate established that a combination of increased intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C activation was necessary to decrease phosphorylated CT content. Conversely, secretin (10 nM) or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (100 μM) added alone had no effects. Use of the compound JMV-180 indicated CCK was acting through the low affinity state of the CCKA receptor to reduce CT phosphate levels. Further, the decrease in phosphorylated CT caused by CCK was blocked by the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (3 μM) and calyculin A (100 nM). Finally, immunoblotting from whole cell lysates revealed CT was partially degraded in response to CCK, providing a novel mechanism by which the inhibition of CT enzyme activity occurs in response to the hormone. Moreover, this degradation was also blocked by a phosphatase inhibitor. These data suggest that the dephosphorylation of either CT itself or some other regulatory molecule(s) which mediates the CCK-induced protease activation may play a central role in reducing CT enzyme levels in acinar cells.

INTRODUCTIONPhosphatidylcholine metabolism in mammalian cells is thought to play a significant role in the production of the cellular messenger diacylglycerol(1Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for this in pancreas arises from studies utilizing acini that were prelabeled with [3H]choline (2Matozaki T. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14729-14734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or [3H]myristic acid (3Rivard N. Rydzewska G. Lods J.-S. Martinez J. Morisset J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G62-G70PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating an activation of phospholipase C and D by secretagogues such as cholecystokinin (CCK), 1The abbreviations used are: CCKcholecystokininCTCTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferaseCHOChinese hamster ovary cells[Ca2+]free ionized intracellular calciumTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateCPT-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. carbamylcholine, and bombesin. Similarly, it has also been shown that carbamylcholine treatment of acini which were prelabeled with [14C]glycerol resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of [14C]phosphatidylcholine(4Rubin R.P. Hundly T.R. Adolf M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1133: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recently, a detailed investigation of the CDP-choline biosynthetic pathway in acinar cells revealed that these agonists actually inhibited phosphatidylcholine synthesis by reducing choline uptake into cells and by inhibiting activity of the rate-limiting enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) (CT)(5Matozaki T Sakamoto C. Nishisaki H. Suzuki T. Wada K. Matsuda K. Nakano O. Konda Y. Nagao M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22246-22253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because CT was inhibited by CCK treatment and this inhibition was blocked by calmodulin antagonists, it was proposed that phosphorylation of CT by a calcium-calmodulin-activated kinase led to its inhibition(5Matozaki T Sakamoto C. Nishisaki H. Suzuki T. Wada K. Matsuda K. Nakano O. Konda Y. Nagao M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22246-22253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).CT activity is regulated by a number of factors in mammalian cells (reviewed in Kent(6Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). While the enzyme is present in both cytosolic and membrane-associated cell fractions, it is the membrane bound form that appears to be most highly active(6Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is also believed to play an essential role in regulating CT. Initial evidence for this came from the finding that, in the presence of phosphatidylcholine vesicles, phosphorylation of CT in vitro by protein kinase A significantly inhibited CT activity(7Sanghera J.S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1215-1223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of CT from Hela cells later established that the enzyme was in fact phosphorylated in vivo(8Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2190-2197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that the addition of exogenous phospholipase C to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells produced a marked dephosphorylation of CT which coincided with its translocation from cytosolic to membrane-associated fractions and its subsequent activation(9Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were also reported in HeLa cells that had been stimulated with oleate(10Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid blocked both translocation and activation of CT in CHO cells suggested that these events were mediated by dephosphorylation of CT(9Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent in vitro study utilizing membranes from oleate- and phospholipase C-treated hepatocytes suggested that dephosphorylation of CT is not a prerequisite for its translocation but rather occurs after insertion into the membrane(11Houweling M. Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7544-7551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although the precise mechanism(s) by which CT is regulated in cells is uncertain, it seems clear that phosphorylation plays a substantial role in modulating the activity of this enzyme.To date, studies investigating the regulation of CT have utilized a number of approaches in cultured cells to modulate the enzyme, such as treatment with exogenous phospholipase C(9Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oleate(10Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol.

Therefore, in the present study, the effects of CCK and other secretory stimuli to regulate CT in pancreatic acinar cells was investigated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAffinity-purified N antibody that was raised against a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal 17 amino acids of rat liver cytidylyltransferase was previously characterized(10Wang Y.

Immobilized protein A-agarose beads were purchased from Pierce; [32P]orthophosphate (9000 Ci/mmol) from DuPont-NEN; thapsigargin from LC Services (Boston MA); soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, paramethylsulfonylfluoride, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)- (CPT-)-cAMP) from Sigma; and leupeptin and pepstatin from Boehringer Mannheim. CCK octapeptide was a gift from the Squibb Institute (Princeton, NJ); the CCK analogue JMV-180 was obtained from Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ).Isolation of Rat Pancreatic AciniPancreatic acinar cells were isolated from adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously(16Wagner A.C.C. Wishart M.J. Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1172-C1180Crossref Google Scholar). Approximately 1 ml or less of packed acini were suspended in 12 ml of HR buffer containing (in mM) 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 1 Na2HPO4, 1.28 CaCl2, 5.5 D-glucose, 2 L-glutamine, and an essential amino acid solution. The buffer was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and gassed with 100% O2. For immunoprecipitation experiments involving 32P-labeling of cells, Na2HPO4 was omitted from the buffer.ImmunoprecipitationAcinar cells were incubated in HR buffer containing 0.3 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 1.5 h at 37°C prior to and throughout treatments. In experiments utilizing thapsigargin, ionomycin, TPA, okadaic acid, calyculin A, and JMV-180, these compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the cells, producing a final vehicle concentration not exceeding 0.1%. In all cases, control cells received an equal concentration of vehicle. Following treatments, cells were quickly pelleted and suspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing (in mM) 40 Na4P2O7 (pH 7.4), 400 NaCl, 100 NaF, 10 EDTA, 1 benzamidine, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4°C. The suspensions were sonicated, allowed to sit for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (whole cell lysate) was then precleared by mixing with 60 μl of protein A-linked agarose beads for 1 h. Samples were quickly centrifuged to remove the protein A beads, and protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad assay. Antiserum to CT (N antibody) was then added (1:400) to 0.4 ml of each sample containing equal concentrations protein (approximately 0.8 mg total) and incubated overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-linked agarose for 2 h. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of buffer containing (in mM) 50 Tris-HCl, 150 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 0.5% (v:v) Nonidet P-40, and then denatured by boiling in 15 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w:v) SDS, 5% (v:v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels and visualized by autoradiography. Phosphorylation intensity of the CT band was quantified using a Bio-Rad model GS-250 imaging system.ImmunoblottingTreatment of cells, as well as the preparation of whole cell lysates, was carried out under conditions identical to those described for immunoprecipitation of CT. Following the 150,000 × g centrifugation, lysates were mixed in SDS sample buffer and boiled. An aliquot of each lysate was analyzed for protein content using a Bio-Rad assay. Approximately 90 μg of protein from each sample was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE using a mini protein II apparatus from Bio-Rad. Immunoblotting was carried out as detailed previously (10Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the N antibody (1:3000).CT AssayAcini were treated under conditions identical to those described for immunoprecipitation of CT. Following treatments, cells were quickly pelleted and suspended in 0.5 ml of digitonin release buffer containing (in mM) 10 Tris (pH 7.4), 250 sucrose, 33 NaF, 0.033 NaVO4, 3.3 EDTA, 3.3 EGTA, 2 dithiothreitol, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 mg/ml digitonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Following a 3-min incubation at 4°C, samples were used for whole cell activity measurements or centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was removed, and the pellet (particulate fraction) was suspended in 0.5 ml of digitonin release buffer. Protein content was determined using a Bio-Rad assay. CT activity was assayed in the presence of 0.2 mM phosphatidylcholine and 0.2 mM oleate as described previously(17Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).ImmunofluorescenceAcini that were incubated in HR buffer for 2.5 h were fixed in suspension with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 4°C. After rinsing with 5% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, acini were cryoprotected by infiltration with graded concentrations of sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen following the procedures of Barthel and Raymond(18Barthel L.K. Raymond P.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Small tissue blocks of intact pancreas were fixed and processed in a similar manner. Procedures for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with 5-μm thick cryostat sections were as described previously(19Ernst S.A. Crawford K.M. Post M.A. Cohn J.A Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 267: C990-C1001Crossref Google Scholar). Affinity-purified N antibody was used over a range of dilutions (1:100 to 1:1200). To determine specificity of immunofluorescence staining, competitions were carried out by preincubating 1:100 dilutions of antibody with 1 μg of the peptide used to generate the antibody.RESULTSCCK Decreases CT Phosphate Levels in Pancreatic AciniImmunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates from 32P-labeled acini using anti-CT N antibody resulted in a prominent phosphoprotein of approximately 42 kDa corresponding to the molecular mass of CT (Fig. 1, arrow). A number of additional minor phosphoproteins were also present. Preabsorbtion of the antibody with the peptide it was raised against completely abolished the appearance of the 42-kDa band while having no effect on any of the other phosphorylations, establishing the specificity of this antibody toward CT. Identical results were also obtained by preabsorbing the antibody with purified CT protein (not shown). Performing the assay in the absence of antibody revealed that the additional phosphoproteins present resulted from nonspecific binding to the protein A-agarose beads. Illustrated in Fig. 1, these nonspecific bands were partially detectable even after preclearing the lysates three times with 60 μl of protein A beads prior to the addition of antibody.Treatment of acini with 10 nM CCK for 1 h resulted in a complete loss of phosphorylated CT (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). A time course for the effects of 10 nM CCK on CT phosphorylation indicated no changes were present after 15 min; however, a large decrease to 13% of control was seen at 30 min, with a complete loss of phosphate occurring by 60 min (Fig. 2A). The effects of CCK were also concentration dependent (Fig. 2B). Following 1-h treatments with CCK, a reduction in phosphorylated CT was detectable at concentrations as low as 10 pM, but became statistically significant at 100 pM (p < 0.05), reducing phosphorylation to 82% of control; the EC50 for CCK was approximately 800 pM.Figure 2:Time course and concentration dependence of a CCK-induced decrease in CT phosphate levels. A, acini were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then treated with or without 10 nM CCK for indicated times before immunoprecipitating CT from whole cell lysates. B, prelabeled acini were treated with the indicated concentrations of CCK for 1 hour before immunoprecipitating CT from whole cell lysates. The data in A and B are the mean and S.E. of three experiments. In B each experiment was performed in duplicate. A representative autoradiograph is shown above each graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ca2+-mobilizing Agonists Decrease Phosphorylated CT LevelsTo evaluate the role of other known pancreatic hormones and neurotransmitters in CT phosphorylation, the calcium mobilizing secretagogues carbamylcholine and bombesin as well as secretin, which acts predominantly through adenylate cyclase, were tested (Fig. 3). Similar to the effects seen for CCK, exposure of cells to 100 μM carbamylcholine or 10 nM bombesin for 1 h resulted in a marked reduction of phosphorylated CT to 20 and 39% of control, respectively. Conversely, treatment with 10 nM secretin had no effects on CT. Thus, the decrease in CT phosphate levels appeared to be mediated by agents whose receptors are coupled to the activation of phospholipase C and mobilization of free ionized intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i).Figure 3:Multiple agonists decrease CT phosphate levels. Acini were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate before treatment with 100 μM carbamylcholine (CCh), 10 nM bombesin (Bmb), 10 nM secretin (Sec), 10 nM cholecystokinin (CCK), and/or 10 μM JMV-180 (JMV) for 1 h. CT was then immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The data are the means and S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CCK Acts via a Low Affinity State of the CCKA Receptor to Decrease Phosphorylated CT LevelsPrevious studies have established that rat pancreatic acinar cells express the A form of the CCK receptor (CCKA) which is known to possess at least two affinity states(20Williams J.A. Blevins G.T. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 701-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). That the IC50 for the CCK-induced reduction in CT phosphorylation was approximately 800 pM suggested this effect was mediated through the low affinity state of the CCKA receptor. Discrimination between the low and high affinity states was achieved using the compound JMV-180 which acts as a high affinity agonist and low affinity antagonist to the CCKA receptor(20Williams J.A. Blevins G.T. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 701-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Matozaki T. Goke B. Tsunoda Y. Rodriguez M. Martinez J. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6247-6254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 10 μM JMV-180 for 1 h to activate the high affinity receptor had no measurable effects on CT phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Conversely, use of the compound as a low affinity receptor antagonist by its simultaneous addition with CCK completely blocked the reduction in CT phosphate levels normally induced by the CCK. Together, these results suggest that CCK was acting through the low affinity state of the CCKA receptor to decrease CT phosphorylation.Both Ca2+ and Protein Kinase C Activation Are Required to Decrease CT Phosphate LevelsPrevious studies have demonstrated that stimulation by CCK leads to intracellular increases in diacylglycerol, [Ca+2]i and, with high concentrations of CCK, cAMP in rat pancreas(22Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1447-1472Google Scholar). To assess the role of these signaling pathways in CT phosphorylation; thapsigargin, which elevates [Ca2+]i by inhibiting the Ca2+ ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum; TPA, a potent activator of protein kinase C; and CPT-cAMP, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of cAMP, were tested (Fig. 4). A 1-h incubation with any of these compounds alone produced no effects on CT phosphorylation. This was also true when 2 μM ionomycin was used to elevate [Ca2+]i (data not shown). Similarly, CPT-cAMP in combination with either thapsigargin or TPA was also without effect on CT. However, treatment with thapsigargin and TPA together evoked a prominent reduction in CT phosphate content to 30% of control. Moreover, a combination of all three agents resulted in reducing CT phosphate levels to 6% of control, an effect similar to that seen using 10 nM CCK. Thus, at a minimum, an increase in [Ca2+]i as well as activation of protein kinase C was required to reduce CT phosphate levels; however, a complete loss of phosphate also required activation of the cAMP pathway.Figure 4:Multiple cellular messengers are required to reduce phosphorylated CT. Acini were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate before treatment with 100 μM CPT-cAMP, 2 μM thapsigargin (TG), 1 μM TPA, or 10 nM CCK for 1 h. CT was then immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates, separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The data are the mean and S.E. of four or five experiments. Treatment with CPT-cAMP in combination with TG or TPA was performed twice with identical results and does not appear in graphical form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A Role for Serine/Threonine Protein Phosphatases in Decreasing CT Phosphate LevelsCT is known to be phosphorylated on multiple serine residues in cultured cells(6Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in mediating the phosphorylation of CT in acinar cells was investigated (Fig. 5). Pretreatment of cells for 20 minutes with the potent serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (3 μM) or calyculin A (100 nM) prior to the addition of CCK completely inhibited the reduction in phosphorylated CT. Both of these compounds are potent inhibitors of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases(24Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the CCK effect on CT by either compound required high concentrations. Indeed, the effects of okadaic acid were only evident when used at concentrations greater than 300 nM (not shown). This is in agreement with concentrations of okadaic acid previously shown to affect amylase secretion and pancreatic phosphoproteins(16Wagner A.C.C. Wishart M.J. Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1172-C1180Crossref Google Scholar). Further, inhibition by calyculin A also occurred over a very narrow range; no effects were seen below 30 nM with full inhibition occurring at 100 nM (not shown). In addition to blocking the decrease in phosphorylated CT, the inhibitors also caused the appearance of a slightly slower migrating form of CT both in control and CCK-stimulated cells (Fig. 5). Formation of this doublet suggested an enhanced level of phosphorylation of CT with phosphatase inhibition, however a significant increase in total phosphorylation intensity was not detected. At micromolar concentrations, okadaic acid is also known to inhibit protein phosphatase 2B(25Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar). To investigate a possible role for this phosphatase, cells were treated with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, a potent and specific inhibitor of 2B phosphatase in acinar cells(26Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At a concentration known to fully inhibit phosphatase 2B in acinar cells (1 μM), cyclosporin A had no effects on CT phosphorylation either in control or CCK stimulated cells.Figure 5:Inhibition of CCK-induced decreases in CT phosphate levels by phosphatase inhibitors. Acini were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 1.5 h before the addition of 100 nM calyculin A (cal-A), 3 μM okadaic acid (OA), or 1 μM cyclosporin A (CsA). Following a 20-min preincubation with phosphatase inhibitors, cells were treated with or without CCK for 1 h in the continued presence of phosphatase inhibitor. CT was then immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates, separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. Results shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunofluorescence Localization of CTThe subcellular distribution of CT was determined with cryostat sections of isolated pancreatic acini (Fig. 6). Immunofluorescence staining was confined predominantly to acinar nuclei at high dilutions (1:300-1:1200) of antibody. Although nuclei for the most part were uniformly stained, immunofluorescence in some nuclei was restricted primarily to the region of the nuclear envelope (arrow). These results are consistent with biochemical and immunocytochemical evidence localizing CT to the nuclei of CHO, HepG2, NIH-3T3, and L-cells(27Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No significant changes in CT distribution were detected in cells that had been treated with 10 nM CCK for 1 h (data not shown). At high concentrations of antibody (1:100), a prominent staining in the basal cytoplasm was also present (data not shown). Similar patterns of fluorescence staining for these dilutions of antibody used on acini were seen with cryostat sections of intact, formaldehyde-fixed pancreas (data not shown). While both the nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were abolished by preincubation with the peptide antigen used to generate the antibody, the specificity of the cytoplasmic staining remains uncertain due to the high concentrations of antibody necessary to detect this signal.Figure 6:Immunofluorescence localization of CT in pancreatic acini.

The heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) 1The abbreviations used are: PKIheat-stable protein kinase inhibitorCcatalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinaseRregulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinaseFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. is a highly specific inhibitor of the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. PKI binds to the active site of C with high affinity specifically in the presence of cAMP when C is dissociated from the holoenzyme complex. The existence of an inhibitor protein was first suggested in 1964(1Posner J.B. Hammermeister K.E. Bratvold G.E. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and PKI was subsequently purified (2Walsh D.A. Ashby C.D. Gonzalez C. Calkins D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1977-1985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and studied extensively by a variety of techniques (for review, see Ref 3). Several different isoforms of PKI have been identified, including PKIα(4Olsen S.R. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11158-11162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKIβ1, and PKIβ2 (5Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J. Walsh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analysis of peptide analogs determined that high affinity binding of PKI to C-subunit could be attributed primarily to 20 residues near the amino terminus.

In spite of extensive biochemical studies, the physiological roles of PKI remain unclear. It was originally proposed that PKI was simply a mechanism to dampen the kinase response by inactivating low levels of enzyme (for review, see Ref 3). However, the association of testicular PKI with microtubules (7Tash J.S. Welsh M.J. Means A.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the isolation of several PKI isoforms (4Olsen S.R. Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

Howard P. Walsh D.A. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated a role for PKI in cell cycle progression. In amphibians (9Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mammals(10Urner F. Herrmann W.L. Baulieu E.E. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1170-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), microinjection of PKI into quiescent oocytes resulted in the induction of mitosis. Similarly, injection of an amino-terminal PKI peptide (PKI) into mammalian cells induced chromatin condensation, microtubule reorganization, and changes in cell shape similar to those that occur just prior to mitosis(11Lamb N.J. Cavadore J.C. Labbe J.C. Maurer R.A. Fernandez A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that PKI entered the nucleus following its injection into the cytoplasm in REF52 cells(12Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a specific role for PKI in the regulation of nuclear stores of C subunit. To better understand the physiological roles of PKI, an antibody was raised to purified recombinant PKIα and used to characterize the expression and distribution of endogenous PKIα. REF52 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum essentially as described previously(13Fantozzi D.A. Taylor S.S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Feramisco J.R. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16824-16828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wistar rat thyrocytes were grown in a six-hormone containing medium (6H) as reported earlier(14Meinkoth J. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A. Feramisco J.R. Burrow G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13239-13245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). REF52 cells were arrested in G0 by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.05% fetal calf serum for 24-36 h and at the G1/S boundary by incubation in isoleucine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h followed by treatment with aphidicolin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) in growth medium for 24 h. Cell synchrony was monitored by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine and its detection in replicated DNA by indirect immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody raised against bromodeoxyuridine (Amersham Corp.)(15LaMorte V.J. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. Meinkoth J.L. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 691-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKIα was expressed in Escherichia coli DE3(BL21) using a T7-7 expression vector and purified by chromatography on DEAE52 as described(16Thomas J. Van Patten S.M. Howard P. Day K.H. Mitchell R.D. Sosnick T. Trewhella J. Walsh D.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse brain specific PKIβ1 cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI site of RSETB expression vector where NdeI site was changed to EcoRI site. PKIβ1 was also expressed in E. coli DE3(BL21) under the same condition as described for PKIα. It was purified by boiling supernatant at 95°C for 5 min and further purified by Superdex 75 gel filtration. The purified recombinant PKIα was subjected to preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The band corresponding to PKI was excised and extracted in 50 mM (NH4)2CO3 at 37°C overnight. Extracted PKI was then emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant, and 0.25-0.50 mg of protein was injected subcutaneously into one rabbit. Incomplete adjuvant was used in all subsequent injections. Serum was assayed by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of purified recombinant PKIα. Recombinant PKIα was coupled to an Affi-Gel 15 column (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions. Serum was applied to the column that was extensively washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.5 M NaCl. The PKI antibody was eluted with 100 mM glycine (pH 2.7). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the affinity purified antibody revealed only two bands that corresponded to IgG heavy and light chains. For PKI staining, cells were cultured on 1 × 12-mm circular glass coverslips (Fisher). Following fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with the PKI antibody (10 μg/ml) followed by staining with a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti rabbit antibody (1:100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in the presence of homologous cell extract. All antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37°C. Following washing in phosphate-buffered saline and finally in H20, the cells were mounted and observed under a Zeiss axiophot fluorescence microscope with a ×40 (1.3 numerical aperture) objective. Chromosomes were stained with Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml) for 5 min at 25°C. A polyclonal antibody was raised to purified recombinant PKIα and purified on a PKIα affinity column. Both serum and the affinity-purified PKIα antibody specifically recognized as little as 10 ng of purified recombinant PKIα on Western blots (Fig. 1, lane1). In contrast, neither reagent reacted detectably with purified recombinant PKIβ1 (lanes2-4). Preimmune serum (not shown) and antibody preincubated with excess PKIα (lane5) failed to react with PKI. We previously reported that PKIα entered the nucleus following its microinjection into the cytoplasm of rat embryonic fibroblasts(12Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess if endogenous PKIα exhibited a similar intracellular distribution, exponentially growing cells were fixed and stained with the PKI antibody. Fig. 2 demonstrates that endogenous PKIα could be detected in the nucleus of Wistar rat thyrocytes and rat embryonic fibroblasts (REF52). Similar results were observed in mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts (not shown). The specificity of the immunostaining for PKIα was demonstrated in several ways. First, preincubation of the antibody with purified PKIα (Fig. 2c) or deletion of the primary antibody (not shown) completely abolished the staining pattern. Second, the distribution of microinjected PKIα or of a C:PKIα complex as detected by immunostaining with the PKIα antibody precisely mirrored that observed following the injection of fluorescently labeled proteins. Thus, similar to the results obtained following injection of FITC-labeled PKIα, microinjected PKIα was detected in the nucleus following immunostaining with the PKIα antibody (Fig. 3, a and c). We previously reported that a microinjected C:PKI complex was restricted to the cytoplasm(13Fantozzi D.A. Taylor S.S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Feramisco J.R. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16824-16828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, the PKIα antibody reacted with an injected C:PKIα complex primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, b and d). Lastly, the PKI antibody failed to detect microinjected PKIβ1 (not shown). Together, these results document the specificity of the antibody staining for PKIα.Figure 3:Immunostaining of microinjected PKIα and C:PKIα complex by PKIα antibody. PKIα (128 μM)(c) and C:PKIα (100 μM)(d) were injected into the cytoplasm. The distributions of the PKI either as a free protein or as a complex were analyzed by staining with affinity-purified PKIα antibody followed by a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. In parallel, the FITC-labeled PKIα (128 μM) (a) and C:FITC-PKIα (100 μM) (b) were also injected into the cytoplasm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In asynchronous cells, both the intensity and intracellular distribution of PKI staining was heterogeneous, suggesting that the expression or intracellular distribution of PKIα might vary as a function of cell cycle progression. To determine if this was the case, REF52 cells were synchronized in G0 by serum deprivation and then stimulated to enter the cell cycle with serum-supplemented growth medium. Similar to other reports(17Brautigan D.L. Sunwoo J. Labbe J.C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Nature. 1990; 344: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), serum-starved REF52 cells synthesized DNA between 12 and 20 h (Fig. 4A) after serum stimulation and maximal numbers of mitotic cells were observed between 24-28 h after serum stimulation (not shown). The relative expression and distribution of PKIα in synchronized cells varied as a function of cell cycle progression. Serum-starved REF52 cells exhibited very low levels of PKIα staining that were uniformly distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 5a). The fluorescence was slightly more intense in the nuclei of a few of the starved cells (not shown). Cells in S phase (16 h after serum stimulation) exhibited a greater overall fluorescence intensity compared with starved cells (Fig. 5c). Increased fluorescence was found both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. As the cells proceeded through S phase, the distribution of PKIα became increasingly nuclear. Nuclear fluorescence was maximal in cells analyzed at 20-24 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 5e), a time that corresponds to late S or G2.Figure 5:PKIα expression in synchronized REF52 cells. Cells were synchronized by serum deprivation (panelsa, c, and e) or by isoleucine/aphidicolin treatment (panelsb, d, and f). Following fixation, the cells were stained with the PKIα antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” PKIα expression was low in serum-starved cells (a) but increased in cells stimulated with serum for 16 h (corresponding to S phase) (c) or 24 h (corresponding to late G2 or M) (e). PKIα expression appeared greater in cells arrested at the G1/S boundary (b) than in serum-starved cells (a). PKIα staining was further increased at 3 h (corresponding to S phase) (d) and 12 h (corresponding to late G2 or M) (f) following removal of aphidicolin and stimulation with fresh medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To discriminate between the effects of cell cycle progression and serum stimulation, the distribution of PKIα was assessed in cells arrested at the G1/S boundary by isoleucine deprivation followed by treatment with aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase α (18Ikegami S. Taguchi T. Ohashi M. Oguro M. Nagano H. Mano Y. Nature. 1978; 275: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Both the isoleucine-deficient and aphidicolin-supplemented medium contained serum. Under these conditions, REF52 cells synthesized DNA between 0 and 8 h (Fig. 4B) and entered mitosis between 12 and 15 h following removal of aphidicolin and the addition of fresh growth medium. Compared with cells in G0 (Fig. 5a), cells arrested at the G1/S boundary exhibited higher levels of PKIα expression (Fig. 5b). PKIα staining was further increased, especially in the cytoplasm, as cells entered S phase (3 h after refeeding growth medium) (Fig. 5d). As the cells proceeded through S phase, nuclear PKIα staining increased and reached maximal levels just before cell division (12 h after refeeding growth medium) (Fig. 5f). PKIα expression was also analyzed as cells proceeded through mitosis. Nuclear PKIα staining (Fig. 6a) was always far greater in cells with condensed chromatin (Fig. 6b) than in interphase cells. This effect was not due to differences in cell volume or architecture as confocal microscopy also revealed a dramatic increase in PKIα staining in cells with condensed chromatin (not shown). As cells proceeded through mitosis, PKIα staining remained distinct and in close proximity to the chromosomes even after nuclear envelope breakdown although PKIα did not appear to be chromosome-associated (Fig. 6, c-f). Similar results were observed using confocal microscopy (not shown). PKIα expression remained high in cells following division and reformation of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 6, g and h) but eventually declined to the levels found in asynchronous cells. The cell cycle-dependent alterations in PKIα expression and intracellular distribution suggested a specific role for PKIα in cell cycle progression. To examine this further, the effects of the PKIα antibody on cell cycle progression were assessed. The antibody was injected into the cytoplasm of serum-starved REF52 cells, which express very low levels of PKIα so that the antibody would bind and sequester newly synthesized PKIα in the cytoplasm, functionally depleting nuclear stores of PKIα. Following injection, the cells were stimulated with growth medium and fixed 36 h later, a time at that most of the cells should have divided. The number of surviving injected cells was compared with the total number of cells injected. Injection of the PKIα antibody, but not of control IgG, significantly reduced the ability of the injected cells to divide (Fig. 7A). To determine if the effect of the PKIα antibody was related to increased levels of free C subunit, C subunit was injected into cells arrested at the G1/S boundary, and the ability of the injected cells to divide following stimulation was assessed. Similar to the results obtained with the PKI antibody, overexpression of C subunit also inhibited cell division (Fig. 7B). We report the isolation of a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to recombinant PKIα. This antibody specifically recognized purified recombinant PKIα on Western blots and both free PKIα and PKIα in the form of a C:PKIα complex following microinjection into REF52 cells. The ability of the antibody to react with a C:PKIα complex suggests that it recognizes determinants on PKI other than those involved in binding to C subunit. The PKIα antibody failed to recognize PKIβ1 either on Western blots or following its injection into REF52 cells. These results are consistent with the recognition by the antibody of determinants in the carboxyl-terminal region of PKIα, which are not well conserved in PKIβ(5Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this regard, the PKIα antibody differs significantly from the antibody raised against the testis-specific form of PKI (PKIβ) isolated by Tash et al.(7Tash J.S. Welsh M.J. Means A.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunostaining experiments revealed that both the apparent level and intracellular distribution of PKIα varied in a cell cycle-dependent manner. PKIα expression appeared much lower in serum-starved cells than in cycling cells. Whether this is a consequence of PKI degradation or changes in conformation or binding to components that render it undetected by the antibody under these conditions remains to be determined. Compared with both cells arrested in G0 and at the G1/S boundary, PKIα expression increased dramatically as cells proceeded through S phase. Quantitative measurements made using confocal microscopy revealed that total cellular fluorescence increased in cells in S phase compared with cells in G0. As cells entered S phase, PKIα appeared first in the cytoplasm consistent with the new synthesis of PKIα. It remains possible, however, that the increased fluorescence is due to the release of PKIα, which was previously sequestered or not detected with the PKIα antibody. This seems unlikely since binding of PKIα to C subunit, its only known physiological binding protein, did not abolish antibody recognition. As cells progressed through S phase and into G2 and M, the distribution of PKIα became increasingly nuclear. Quantitative confocal microscopy revealed that nuclear fluorescence increased without a concomitant change in total cellular fluorescence. As cells progressed through mitosis, PKIα expression remained high and decreased again only after cell division as cells reentered G1. These results differ somewhat from those reported earlier for the testis-specific form of PKI (PKIβ), which was found to be localized to cytoplasmic microtubules in interphase cells and to the spindle apparatus in mitotic cells(7Tash J.S. Welsh M.J. Means A.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether this is a consequence of cell type-specific differences or differences in the species of PKI recognized by the respective antibodies is unclear. In REF52 cells, the fluorescently labeled brain-specific form of PKI (PKIβ1) could also be detected in the nucleus following microinjection in the cytoplasm. 2W. Wen, unpublished results. The up-regulation of PKIα expression in S phase and its subsequent accumulation in the nucleus during G2/M support a specific role for PKI in the nucleus as cells enter mitosis. Numerous studies have suggested a role for PKI in the inhibition of C subunit activity required for mitotic entry. In several species, oocyte maturation is accompanied by decreased cAMP levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity(19Meijer L. Dostmann W. Genieser H.G. Butt E. Jastorff B. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Schultz R.M. Montgomery R.R. Belanoff J.R. Dev. Biol. 1983; 97: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Microinjection of C subunit inhibits oocyte maturation; conversely, microinjection of PKI induces maturation(9Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Doree M. Kishimoto T. Le Peuch C.J. Demaille J.G. Kanatani H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1981; 135: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In somatic cells, microinjection of PKI induced many of the cellular changes that accompany mitosis, including changes in cell shape and chromosome condensation(11Lamb N.J. Cavadore J.C. Labbe J.C. Maurer R.A. Fernandez A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, microinjection of the PKIα antibody abolished the ability of injected cells to divide. As reported previously(11Lamb N.J. Cavadore J.C. Labbe J.C. Maurer R.A. Fernandez A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), similar effects were observed following microinjection of free C subunit. Taken together, these results support a specific role for PKI in the inhibition of C subunit activity required for cell cycle progression, although at present there is no direct evidence that there is sufficient PKIα to inhibit nuclear C-subunit activity. Most of the quantitation studies so far were done with total cell extracts(3Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar). No values for PKI concentrations in synchronized cells or in subcellular compartments is yet available. There is a burst of phosphorylation as cells enter mitosis and a corresponding decrease in phosphorylation as cells exit mitosis. Changes in phosphorylation are likely to mediate, in part, the multiple structural alterations that occur during mitosis including chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, spindle formation, cytoskeletal changes and disassembly of organelles. p34 activity, which is maximal in late G2, is responsible for a number of mitosis-specific phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation of histone H1 by p34 results in chromosome condensation, and p34-mediated phosphorylation of the nuclear lamins results in lamin disassembly. In contrast, cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits p34mediated lamin release(22Molloy S. Little M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1992; 201: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and addition of cAMP to mitotic extracts results in the loss of p34 kinase activity(23Hohmann P. DenHaese G. Greene R.S. Cell Proliferation. 1993; 26: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, PKI and p34 appear to function cooperatively to effect many of the cellular changes that occur at mitosis. Microinjection of either p34(11Lamb N.J. Cavadore J.C. Labbe J.C. Maurer R.A. Fernandez A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Brautigan D.L. Sunwoo J. Labbe J.C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Nature. 1990; 344: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or PKI (11Lamb N.J. Cavadore J.C. Labbe J.C. Maurer R.A. Fernandez A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) alone, induced changes in cell shape, chromatin condensation, and alterations in actin and tubulin architecture. Coinjection of p34 and PKI together induced additional changes including nuclear envelope breakdown, suggesting that p34 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase perform distinct and complementary roles in regulating entry into mitosis. The roles of cAMP-dependent protein kinase may include the maintenance of higher order chromatin structure, nuclear envelope integrity, and microtubule architecture, all of which must be dismantled prior to mitosis. In addition, a number of cellular processes including transcription and endocytosis are specifically repressed during mitosis. The activity of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein is dependent upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (for review, see (24Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It also needs to be turned off prior to mitosis. The nuclear localization of PKI makes it ideally situated to inhibit nuclear C subunit, unlike regulatory subunits that appear to be localized in the cytoplasm in many (25Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 26Nigg E.A. Schäfer G. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M.

Intracellular cAMP levels have been reported to fluctuate as a function of cell cycle progression with a dramatic increase observed in cells in S phase and the lowest levels observed during mitosis(21Doree M. Kishimoto T. Le Peuch C.J. Demaille J.G. Kanatani H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1981; 135: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This would result in holoenzyme dissociation during S phase and the accumulation of active C subunit in the nucleus as cells enter G2. Up-regulation of nuclear PKI expression at this time would provide a mechanism for extinguishing the activity of C in the nucleus without affecting its activity in the cytoplasm. In an earlier report, we found that microinjection of a C:PKI complex enhanced the rate of export of C subunit from the nucleus(12Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that there may be multiple mechanisms through which nuclear stores of C subunit could be inactivated. A number of earlier studies provided evidence for PKI regulation (for review, see (3Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar). For example, PKI activity increased following serum stimulation in starved Chinese hamster ovary cells (31Costa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and follicle-stimulating hormone treatment in cultured Sertoli cells(32Tash J.S. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2901-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and mRNA levels(35Lange-Carter C.A. Fossli T. Jahnsen T. Malkinson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7814-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the expression of the α and β PKI mRNAs is both tissue- and developmental stage-specific(8Van Patten S.M. Howard P. Walsh D.A. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that PKI is subject to both positive and negative regulation in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. It will be interesting to determine if PKI is regulated posttranscriptionally, as is the case for the type I regulatory subunit(35Lange-Carter C.A. Fossli T. Jahnsen T. Malkinson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7814-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or is subject to regulation at the level of transcription. Phosphorylation of the single tyrosine residue in PKI reduced its inhibitory activity on C subunit(36Van Patten S.M. Heisermann G.J. Cheng H.-C. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3398-3403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing a potential mechanism through which PKI activity could be regulated through the activity of other cellular signaling pathways. cAMP-dependent protein kinase functions in a diverse array of cellular processes including metabolism, secretion, differentiation, gene expression, proliferation, and growth inhibition. PKI may be part of a coordinated cellular control network that helps to modulate the activity of this important protein kinase.

To investigate the mechanisms for this lack of enzymatic activity and the processing of the zymogen to the active form, we now have performed molecular modeling of the tertiary structure of murine MC-proCPA based on the x-ray crystallographic structures of porcine pancreatic procarboxypeptidases A and B. Our model predicts that MC-proCPA retains a high degree of structural similarity to its pancreatic homologues. The globular propeptide physically blocks access to the fully formed active site of the catalytic domain and contains a salt bridge to the substrate-binding region that precludes docking of even small substrates.

These proteases are similar to a broader set of immune/inflammatory cell secretory proteases in that they are produced as inactive zymogens but stored within the secretory granules in their fully active forms.

In this study, we have examined the properties of MC-proCPA activation by molecular modeling and biochemical means. mast cell carboxypeptidase A bone marrow-derived mast cells Kirsten sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cells mast cell procarboxypeptidase A rat mast cell protease-I procarboxypeptidase B human immunodeficiency virus Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. Coordinates for the x-ray crystallographic structures of porcine pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B (proCPB) (20Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and proCPA (21Guasch A. Coll M. Avilés F.X. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Robert Huber (Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsreid bei Munchen, Germany). Coordinate files for bovine pancreatic CPA (pdb3cpa.ent) and CPB (pdb1cpb.ent) were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. Modeling was performed using the Biosym (San Diego, CA) Insight II molecular graphics suite running on a Silicon Graphics (Mountain View, CA) IRIS Indigo workstation. The amino acid sequences for murine and human MC-proCPA were aligned with those of porcine proCPA and proCPB as shown in Fig. 1A, and the calculated amino acid sequence identities are shown in Fig. 1B. The spatial coordinates of structurally conserved regions in porcine proCPB and proCPA were applied directly to the corresponding amino acid sequences of murine and human MC-proCPA using the Insight II program Homology. Four short stretches, consisting of residues A90-4, 150-154, 213-216, and 286-287 of both murine and human MC-proCPA, could not be directly assigned and were assigned by searching sets of energetically favored loops. Energy minimization was performed using the Insight II program Discover. The only constraint used during the minimizations was to maintain the four zinc-ligand atoms His161:Nδ1, Glu164:Oɛ1, Glu164:Oɛ2, and His289:Nδ1 in their original coordinates to preserve the structure of the zinc-binding site, although the zinc ion itself was not included during the minimization process. The details of the energy minimization process for murine MC-proCPA are shown in Table 1. A similar minimization scheme was used for human MC-proCPA. As a control, porcine pancreatic proCPB was modeled in the same way starting with its amino acid sequence. The RMS deviation between the backbone coordinates of the modeled proCPB and the original crystallographic coordinates was 0.24 Å; the final energy of the model was −12,867 kcal/mol with a 0.0073 kcal/Å root mean square derivative. This indicates that our procedure for modeling of the MC-proCPAs likely did not introduce any unreasonable conformations or interactions.Tabled 1 Murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) (22Razin E.

Biswas C. Strout H.V. Berger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a separate experiment, existing MC-proCPA was depleted by pretreatment of the cells with cycloheximide (0.5 mM) for 5 h as described above, the cycloheximide was removed from the culture with three successive washes, and the culture was continued in the absence of cycloheximide with or without the addition of brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) (25Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Silbert J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In each experiment, 3 × 105 cells were removed from the culture at timed intervals, and 1.5 × 105 cell equivalents were subjected to immunoblotting as previously described using anti-MC-CPA antiserum(18Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this antiserum, specific immunoreactivity (i.e. competable by recombinant MC-CPA) is found in mast cells but not in U937 human promonocytes(18Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), murine 3T3 fibroblasts, or murine WEHI-3B myelomonocytic cells (not shown). To quantify MC-proCPA, laser densitometric scanning (Ultroscan 2202, LKB, Bromma, Sweden) was performed on the exposed films, and the MC-proCPA was expressed as area units (OD × mm). To ensure accuracy, three scans of each lane were performed, and the average of the three scans was used. KiSV-MC14 were pelleted by centrifugation at 150 × g for 10 min, resuspended at a concentration of 3 × 105/ml in fresh complete medium, and cultured in the absence or presence of protease inhibitor in the medium.

Timed samples containing 1.8 × 106 cells were withdrawn; 0.15 × 106 cell equivalents were subjected to immunoblotting, and the remaining cells were used for the determination of dipeptidyl peptidase-I, chymase, and tryptase activities as previously described (18Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon areas of sequence identity and predicted secondary structural similarities, we aligned the sequences of mast cell and pancreatic procarboxypeptidases (Fig. 1A) and calculated the percent sequence identities for the proenzymes, propeptides, and mature enzymes (Fig. 1B). The proposed alignment lends credibility to the modeling of the MC-proCPAs using porcine pancreatic proCPB for the following four reasons. First, the propeptides of MC-proCPA and pancreatic proCPB share 40% sequence identity and 60% sequence similarity when conservative substitutions are considered; as a whole, MC-proCPA and porcine pancreatic proCPB share 65% sequence similarity when conservative substitutions are considered. Second, no sequence gaps were required for alignment of the propeptides, and only one gap of a single amino acid in porcine pancreatic proCPB was required for alignment of the mature forms. Third, the propeptides of MC-proCPA and porcine pancreatic proCPB share more identity with each other (40%) than do the propeptides of porcine pancreatic proCPB and porcine pancreatic proCPA (29%); yet, the two pancreatic propeptides have been separately determined by x-ray crystallography to have highly similar tertiary structures(20Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Guasch A. Coll M. Avilés F.X. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fourth, the overall amino acid sequence identities between all four procarboxypeptidases are 40-50% (Fig. 1B). Comparisons of homology-based molecular models where crystallographic coordinates were subsequently determined indicate that a sequence identity of 30% or greater is often sufficient for homology-based modeling of functionally similar proteins (32Greer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 153: 1027-1042Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 33Blundell T.L. Sibanda B.L. Sternberg M.J.E. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). For example, modeling of HIV-protease based on the crystal structure of Rous sarcoma virus-protease (34Weber I.T. Miller M. Jaskolski M. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Wlodawer A. Science. 1989; 243: 928-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and subsequent crystallography of HIV-protease (35Navia M.A. Fitzgerald P.M.D. McKeever B.M. Leu C.-T. Heimbach J.C. Herber W.K. Sigal I.S. Darke P.L. Springer J.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that homology-based molecular models can be remarkably accurate, even for proteins that share only 30% sequence identity(36Weber I.T. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 172-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A space-filling model of murine MC-proCPA is shown in Fig. 2. The salient features of the model are the globular propeptide domain that physically blocks access to the substrate-binding pocket and the highly exposed loop connecting the globular propeptide with the mature enzyme. This predicted loop contains the activation site between GluA94 (Glu94 of the activation domain) and Ile1 (the first residue of the mature enzyme). Our models of murine and human MC-proCPAs possess a high degree of structural similarity to each other and to their pancreatic homologues (Fig. 1C and Fig. 2). Similar to the pancreatic procarboxypeptidases, the models predict that the active sites of the murine and human MC-proCPAs are fully formed in the zymogens, but substrate binding is blocked or impaired by the propeptide. Detailed examination of the murine MC-proCPA model revealed that a loop comprised of residues A39-A44 of the propeptide projects into the active site of the mature form, and the side chain carboxyl group of AspA40 within this propeptide loop forms a salt bridge with the guanidyl group of Arg143 in the catalytic domain. Formation of this salt bridge also causes the side chain of Arg143 to assume a more extended conformation relative to its conformation in the active enzyme. The predicted salt bridge between the propeptide and the substrate-binding region of murine MC-proCPA is found in porcine pancreatic proCPB and accounts for its complete lack of enzymatic activity(20Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an alternative salt bridge is possible in murine MC-proCPA between the side chain carboxyl group of AspA44 and Arg143. When this alternative salt bridge was initially forced by rotation of the side chains of AspA44 and Arg143, it was found to be stable during further energy minimization. In contrast, human MC-proCPA contains no analogous acidic residue in the propeptide in proximity to Arg143 of the catalytic domain. The result is that the propeptide loop of residues A39-A44 does not project as far into the active site, and the Arg143 side chain assumes a position closer to that observed in the active enzyme. This lack of a salt bridge between the propeptide and the substrate-binding region of human MC-proCPA is similar to porcine pancreatic proCPA (21Guasch A. Coll M. Avilés F.X. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and suggests that human MC-proCPA may possess some activity toward small peptide substrates. Electrostatic field calculations were performed on the murine and human MC-proCPA and MC-CPA models at the secretory granule pH of 5.5. The results for the murine models are shown in Fig. 3 and were substantially the same for the human models. Positive charge fields nearly surrounded the zymogen (∼270° of the circumference, Fig. 3A). The only substantial area lacking a positive charge field was that of the activation loop. With the propeptide removed, the electrostatic fields were recalculated for the mature enzyme model. A positive charge field again surrounded ∼270° of the circumference of MC-CPA, including a significant positive charge field uncovered by the removal of the propeptide and projecting from the substrate-binding site (Fig. 3B). No projections of negative charge were observed in our MC-proCPA or MC-CPA models at pH 5.5, with the exception of a small negative charge field emanating from the activation loop of MC-proCPA. However, an intense negative charge field was observed projecting from the MC-CPA propeptide, including the activation loop, encompassing the entire side that had faced the catalytic domain (Fig. 3C). To determine whether the low amount of MC-proCPA present in mast cells is actively processed or represents a small percentage of MC-proCPA that has escaped appropriate processing, we treated KiSV-MC14 with cycloheximide and studied the fate of the MC-proCPA in the absence of new protein synthesis. Cycloheximide treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in the MC-proCPA within the cells while the levels of MC-CPA remained constant. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4A. Quantitative analyses revealed exponential decreases in the level of the zymogen, with a half-life of 26 ± 5 min (mean ± S.D., n = 3) in KiSV-MC14 (Fig. 4B). This analysis also suggested that ∼10% of the MC-proCPA in KiSV-MC14 was inaccessible to the processing machinery (note the asymptote in Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when BMMC were treated with cycloheximide, yielding a half-life of 28 ± 4 min (mean ± S.D., n = 2) for MC-proCPA and ∼17% MC-proCPA inaccessible to processing (not shown). BMMC were pretreated with cycloheximide to deplete their stores of MC-proCPA and, after removing the cycloheximide, cultured in the presence or absence of brefeldin A to inhibit transport beyond the endoplasmic reticulum. Continued culture in the absence of brefeldin A resulted in no significant change in the amount of MC-proCPA in the BMMC (Fig. 5). In contrast, culture in the presence of brefeldin A caused a rapid and progressive accumulation of MC-proCPA (Fig. 5) with a 5.2-fold increase at 4 h. When KiSV-MC14 were cultured in the presence of the 200 μM E-64d for 7 h, a progressive increase in the level of MC-proCPA was observed (Fig. 6), but in the absence of inhibitor the levels of MC-proCPA remained constant. In the presence of leupeptin, TLCK, TPCK, or t-Boc-Gly-Phe-CHN2, the levels of MC-proCPA were unaffected (not shown). Protease activities were examined in KiSV-MC14 after 6 h of incubation with E-64d, as well as in untreated KiSV-MC14 cultured in parallel. After incubation of KiSV-MC14 with 200 μM E-64d for 6 h, we found that dipeptidyl peptidase-I activity was inhibited by 96 ± 1% (mean ± S.D., n = 2). In the same samples we found that chymase activity was reduced by 13 ± 1% (mean ± S.D., n = 2), while tryptase activity was unaffected. In contrast, treatment of KiSV-MC14 with the protease inhibitors TLCK and TPCK did not significantly affect the activities of dipeptidyl peptidase-I, chymase, or tryptase in the secretory granules. The principal requirement for pancreatic procarboxypeptidase activation is removal of the propeptide from the active site. Nevertheless, the proCPA and proCPB pancreatic zymogens possess different properties that can be explained by structural differences in their propeptides(21Guasch A. Coll M. Avilés F.X. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In pancreatic proCPA, the propeptide acts as a competitive inhibitor of CPA even after it is disconnected from the catalytic domain(37Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6949-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism of inhibition results in a zymogen that is active against small peptides and even retains significant activity against protein substrates such as casein(38Uren J.R. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The limiting event in pancreatic proCPA activation is degradation of the propeptide, which has a rather stable structure even when free from the enzyme(37Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6949-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike pancreatic CPA, CPB is not inhibited by its propeptide once cleavage occurs at the activation site(39Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Mendez E. Avilés F.X. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4082-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Villegas V. Billeter M. Wider G. Huber R. Wüthrich K. Avilés F.X. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, degradation of the propeptide following cleavage is not a limiting factor. Furthermore, pancreatic proCPB is entirely devoid of carboxypeptidase activity even against small substrates(39Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Mendez E. Avilés F.X. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4082-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This appears to be due to the formation of a salt bridge between AspA41 of the propeptide and Arg142 of the catalytic domain (corresponding to AspA40 and Arg143 in MC-proCPA, see Fig. 1) that prevents binding of the substrate carboxyl terminus(20Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our model of murine MC-proCPA indicates that the propeptide not only serves to generally block the substrate-binding pocket of the mature form (Fig. 2), it also is linked through a salt bridge to the critical substrate-binding residue Arg143. This particular Arg residue is conserved in all mammalian metallocarboxypeptidases, including CPA, CPB, carboxypeptidase H, carboxypeptidase M, and plasma CPB. The basic side chain of this Arg serves to form a salt bridge with the acidic carboxyl terminus of substrates, thereby positioning the peptide bond of the carboxyl-terminal amino acid in the reactive center where it is cleaved. Since the propeptide of murine MC-CPA appears to form a salt bridge with Arg143, the mechanism of inhibition of murine MC-proCPA by its propeptide is likely the same as that for pancreatic proCPB (20Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and, therefore, predicts that MC-proCPA exists as a completely inactive zymogen. This view is consistent with our prior experimental data regarding the lack of activity of MC-proCPA even toward small substrates (18Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our observation that purified murine MC-CPA is not inhibited by purified MC-CPA propeptide expressed in bacteria. ( 2M. M. Dikov and W. E. Serafin, unpublished data.) In contrast to murine MC-proCPA, human MC-proCPA cannot contain an analogous salt bridge between the propeptide and Arg143, suggesting that human MC-proCPA may exhibit significant reactivity to small substrates. In addition to maintaining the zymogen in an inactive state, the propeptide may serve other functions. We previously showed that recombinant MC-CPA (i.e. lacking the propeptide) expressed in mammalian cells (COS and U937) or bacterial cells (Escherichia coli) is completely inactive. This suggests that the propeptide of MC-proCPA assists in the proper folding of the catalytic domain. This type of propeptide function has been described in subtilisin (41Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and α-lytic protease(42Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In these proteases, the propeptides serve to lower the energy barrier between an incompletely folded intermediate and the native conformation, resulting in a substantial increase in the rate of a crucial folding step(43Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Baker D. Sohl J. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We have shown that the steady-state level of MC-proCPA is low relative to that of the active form in KiSV-MC14 and BMMC (Figure 4:, Figure 5:)(18Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating rapid processing of the zymogen. Because both mast cell types have a doubling time of ∼48 h(45Tchekneva E. Serafin W.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5912-5921PubMed Google Scholar), they are making ∼2% of their MC-CPA/h. Since we see ≤1% of the total MC-CPA in the zymogen form, the MC-proCPA must be processed with a half-life of <1 h. Using cycloheximide treatmen"

Recent work has identified additional, alternatively spliced isoforms of MHC-B cDNA with inserted sequences of 30 nucleotides (chicken and human) or 48 nucleotides (Xenopus) at a site corresponding to the ATP binding region in the MHC protein (Takahashi, M., Kawamoto, S., and Adelstein, R. S.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17864-17871) and Bhatia-Dey, N., Adelstein, R. S., and Dawid, I. B. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 2856-2859). The deduced amino acid sequence of these inserts contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cyclin-p34cdc2 (cdc2) kinase. In cultured Xenopus XTC cells, we have identified two inserted MHC-B isoforms and a noninserted MHC-A isoform by immunoblotting of cell extracts. When myosin was immunoprecipitated from XTC cells and phosphorylated in vitro with cdc2 kinase, the kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of both inserted MHC-B isoforms but not MHC-A. Isoelectric focusing of tryptic peptides generated from MHC-B phosphorylated with cdc2 kinase revealed one major phosphopeptide that was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. The phosphorylated residue was Ser-214, the cdc2 kinase consensus site within the insert near the ATP binding region. The same site was phosphorylated in intact XTC cells during log phase of growth and in cell-free lysates of Xenopus eggs stabilized in second meiotic metaphase but not interphase. Moreover, Ser-214 phosphorylation was detected during maturation of Xenopus oocytes when the cdc2 kinase-containing maturation-promoting factor was activated, but not in G2 interphase-arrested oocytes. These results demonstrate that MHC-B phosphorylation is tightly regulated by cdc2 kinase during meiotic cell cycles. Furthermore, MHC-A and MHC-B isoforms are differentially phosphorylated at these stages, suggesting that they may serve different functions in these cells.

The myosin II molecule consists of a dimer of two heavy chains of approximately 200 kDa noncovalently associated with two pairs of light chains of approximately 20 and 17 kDa.

The heads contain an actin-activated ATPase activity, and the tails are involved in filament formation. The myosin heads can be divided by three protease-sensitive regions into peptides of 25, 50, and 20 kDa (Fig. 1).

Both the heavy chain and the light chain subunits of myosin exist as isoforms. Our interest has been in the structure and function of the heavy chain isoforms of smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin. There is one smooth muscle MHC gene and at least two pairs of alternatively spliced products of the smooth muscle MHC mRNA. One pair of isoforms is generated from alternative splicing in the 3′ end of the mRNA, resulting in MHC proteins with carboxyl termini that differ in length and sequence(8Nagai R. Kuro-o M. Babij P.

Intestinal, but not vascular, MHC mRNA contains an insert of 21 nucleotides encoding 7 amino acids. This insert occurs beginning at amino acid 212, which is near the 25-50 kDa junction in the primary sequence of the heavy chain. In the three-dimensional structure of the heavy chain(14Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar), this insert is located near the ATP binding pocket in a region that was not resolved in the crystal structure, suggesting that this region may be flexible. This insert most likely affects the ATP binding pocket because we found that the presence of the insert correlates with a higher velocity of movement of actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay and a higher actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity(10Kelley C.A. Takahashi M. Yu J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to a single gene encoding smooth muscle MHC isoforms, there are at least two genes encoding nonmuscle MHC isoforms. The products of these two nonmuscle MHC genes are referred to as MHC-A and MHC-B(15Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The recent cDNA cloning of chicken brain nonmuscle MHC-B provided evidence for multiple inserted forms of neuronal MHC-B(17Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these brain cDNA isoforms contained a 30-nucleotide insert encoding 10 amino acids in a region corresponding exactly to the region of the insert in the smooth muscle MHC isoform (see Fig. 1, arrowhead). However, in nonmuscle MHC-B the insert is a different size and has an amino acid sequence different from that of the smooth muscle insert. One interesting feature of the nonmuscle insert, which is not true of the smooth muscle insert, is that it contains a putative phosphorylation site for p34cdc2 (cdc2) kinase: a serine followed by a proline and a basic residue(18Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 261-270Google Scholar). A similar insert of 48 nucleotides, encoding 16 amino acids (see Fig. 1), also containing a consensus sequence site for phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase, was found in Xenopus nonmuscle MHC-B(19Bhatia-Dey N.

In addition, entry of cells into meiosis and mitosis is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the level of phosphorylation of many proteins involved in both regulatory and structural aspects of mitosis and meiosis. There is substantial evidence that phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase of certain cytoskeletal structural proteins such as the nuclear lamins(34Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 591-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), vimentins(35Chou Y.-H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R.D.

Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) plays an important role in the induction of mitosis and/or meiosis. Recently it was also shown that the regulatory light chain of Xenopus nonmuscle myosin is phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase during metaphase, but not interphase, in Xenopus egg lysates(38Satterwhite L.L. Lohka M.J. Wilson K.L. Scherson T.Y. Cisek J.L. Corden J.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine if nonmuscle MHC-B is a physiological substrate for cdc2 kinase. We used cultured Xenopus XTC cells as well as egg lysates and intact oocytes to examine the meiotic and mitotic metaphase-specific phosphorylation of MHC-B. We found that the major MHC isoform in Xenopus is MHC-A, which does not contain a cdc2 kinase phosphorylation site near the ATP binding region. Phosphorylation of this isoform was not different in metaphase and interphase cells. In contrast, MHC-B containing an insert with a cdc2 kinase consensus sequence phosphorylation site near the ATP binding region was a minor myosin isoform in Xenopus. We found that cdc2 kinase phosphorylates MHC-B in vitro at a single site, Ser-214, which is within the insert near the ATP binding pocket. This same site was phosphorylated in intact XTC cells during exponential growth as well as in metaphase, but not interphase, Xenopus egg lysates and intact oocytes, suggesting that phosphorylation of MHC-B may play a role in mitosis and meiosis. Xenopus XTC cells were grown at 25°C in Leibovitz L-15 medium diluted to 61% and supplemented with fetal bovine serum to 10% as described previously(39Smith J.C. Tata J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 635-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for nonmuscle MHC-B were generated against a synthetic peptide (SSSRSGRRQLHI) corresponding to a chicken MHC-B carboxyl-terminal sequence unique to this isoform(17Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for the Xenopus inserted region were made against a synthetic peptide (TESPKAIKHQSGSLLY) corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence of the insert(19Bhatia-Dey N. Adelstein R.S. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2856-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The MHC-A carboxyl-terminal antiserum was generated as described previously (17Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) against the peptide GKAEAGDAKATE. Conjugation of the peptides to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, rabbit immunization, and affinity purification of the antisera were performed as described previously(40Kelley C.A. Sellers J.R. Goldsmith P.K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2127-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation by solubilization of whole cells in a nondenaturing, Nonidet P-40 high salt extraction buffer at pH 7.5 containing protease inhibitors as described previously(41Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1099-1102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-5% polyacrylamide gels were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and immunostained with antiserum or affinity-purified antibodies as described(40Kelley C.A. Sellers J.R. Goldsmith P.K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2127-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-MHC-B or anti-MHC-A carboxyl-terminal antibodies. For studies on phosphorylation in intact cells, the myosin-antibody complexes were precipitated with Pansorbin (Calbiochem), washed several times with extraction buffer, and then boiled in SDS sample diluter(42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). For in vitro phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated myosin, the precipitates were washed several times with phosphorylation buffer (described below) before incubating with kinase and ATP. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis in either 4 or 5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS according to the method of Laemmli(42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). The incorporation of 32P was visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA) or by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitated XTC cell myosin was incubated at 30°C for 1 h in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (phosphorylation buffer), 500 nM peptide inhibitor to protein kinase A (Sigma), 500 μM ATP (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 30 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and human HeLa cell cdc2 kinase (kindly provided by Dr. Fumio Matsumura, Rutgers University) in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample dilutor and boiled. Samples were electrophoresed in SDS-5% polyacrylamide gels, and the stoichiometry of MHC-B phosphorylation was determined by extraction of the 32P-phosphorylated MHCs from the gels using Solvable (DuPont NEN) followed by liquid scintillation counting. The total 32P content was then calculated from the radiospecific activity of [γ-32P]ATP. The protein concentration of the two 32P-phosphorylated MHC-B isoforms was determined by densitometric scanning of the gels compared with a standard curve of gizzard smooth muscle MHCs. XTC cells were labeled metabolically with 32Pi (0.2 mCi/ml, DuPont NEN) in phosphate-free L-15 medium for 4 h. The labeling medium was removed, and cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation as described above. The MHC-B subunits phosphorylated in intact cells or in vitro with cdc2 kinase were separated by 4% or 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. The heavy chain isoforms were excised from the gels and digested with trypsin as described previously(6Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides were separated by one-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF) electrophoresis, pH 2.5-8.0, as described(43Nakabayashi H. Sellers J.R. Huang K.-P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The gels were dried, and the phosphopeptides were detected with a PhosphorImager or by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitated XTC cell MHC-B was phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 kinase as described above. The heavy chains were separated on SDS-5% polyacrylamide gels and digested with trypsin as described for the phosphopeptide mapping experiments. The tryptic digests were lyophilized and dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and injected onto a C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (Vydac, The Nest Group, Southborough, MA). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 10-60% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at 1.0 ml/min. A single radioactive peak that eluted in an acetonitrile concentration of approximately 20% was lyophilized, injected onto the same C18 column, but developed with an acetonitrile gradient of 10-30%. A single radioactive peak was obtained and used for amino acid sequencing. The amino acid sequence was kindly determined by Dr. Wilson Burgess, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD. Multiple rounds of Edman degradation were performed using an Applied Biosystems model 477 gas phase protein sequenator. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified with an on-line model 120A HPLC system. The 32P-labeled phosphopeptide from the IEF gel was hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl for 3 h at 106°C. The acid-hydrolyzed peptides were subjected to electrophoresis at 1,000 V for 3 h in acetic acid/formic acid/water, 78:25:897, pH 1.9. Identification of radioactive phosphoamino acids was determined by autoradiography, and their migration was compared with that of standards of phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phosphoserine stained with ninhydrin. Xenopus egg metaphase and interphase lysates were prepared from unfertilized (metaphase II) eggs as described previously(44Newport J. Spann T. Cell. 1987; 48: 219-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 45Wilson K.L. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Extracts were incubated with 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) for 40 min at 25°C. The lysates were then diluted with the cell extraction buffer described above and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of MHC-B and MHC-A also as described above. Xenopus female frogs were anesthetized by immersion in a solution of 0.04% benzocaine, and stage VI oocytes were manually isolated in 1 × modified Barth's saline-Hepes(46Peng H.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Oocytes (approximately 100 oocytes/100 μl) were radioactively labeled overnight at 20°C in 1 × modified Barth's saline-Hepes containing 10 mCi/ml 32Pi (370 mBq, Amersham Corp.) in the presence or absence of 10 μM water-soluble progesterone (Sigma). Oocytes were washed twice with 1 × modified Barth's saline-Hepes to remove unincorporated label, and matured oocytes were identified on the basis of germinal vesicle breakdown. Extracts were prepared by homogenizing oocytes in 200 μl of buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) on ice. The extracts were cleared of yolk and cortical debris by two centrifugations in a microcentrifuge for 15 min each at 4°C, and frozen at −80°C. Before immunoprecipitation (as described above), the extracts were thawed and diluted to 500 μl with extraction buffer (see above). The first goal of our studies was to determine whether the inserted form of MHC-B is a substrate for cdc2 kinase in vitro. We began these studies using the cultured Xenopus cell line, XTC. First, it was necessary to identify the inserted form of MHC-B at the protein level. Fig. 2A shows a Coomassie Blue-stained 5% polyacrylamide gel. The left lane is a total XTC cell extract that shows one major protein band around 200 kDa, which is the molecular mass of the MHC. When this extract is incubated with antibodies specific for the carboxyl terminus of MHC-B, the major band at 200 kDa is immunoprecipitated as well as two slower migrating minor bands at around 200 kDa (Fig. 2A, right lane). We identified these bands as MHCs by immunoblotting of XTC cell extracts as shown in Fig. 2B. The first lane shows the immunoreactivity of the extract with antibodies specific for an amino acid sequence in the carboxyl terminus of chicken MHC-A. The antibodies recognize the major, faster migrating MHC, but not the slower migrating, minor bands. The second lane shows that peptide antibodies generated against an amino acid sequence in the carboxyl terminus of chicken MHC-B recognize the two slower migrating, minor forms of myosin, MHC-B1 and MHC-B2, but not the major MHC isoform, MHC-A. Both of the MHC-B isoforms were also immunoreactive with peptide antibodies generated against the Xenopus insert amino acid sequence as shown in the last lane. Thus, in these Xenopus cells, there are two inserted forms of MHC-B as well as a noninserted, MHC-A isoform (see “Discussion”). The identification of the major MHC isoform as MHC-A has been verified further by cDNA cloning and sequencing. 2M. A. Conti, unpublished result. We believe that MHC-A is nonspecifically immunoprecipitated with the MHC-B-specific antibodies through its interaction with MHC-B because when immunoprecipitations of cell extracts were performed in the presence of ATP, no MHC-A was immunoprecipitated along with MHC-B (data not shown). We next examined whether the inserted MHC-B1 and MHC-B2 isoforms could be phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase in vitro. Because these MHC-B isoforms are relatively minor compared with MHC-A and, therefore, not easily purified, we used immunoprecipitated myosin for our in vitro phosphorylation studies. Myosin was immunoprecipitated from XTC cells using the MHC-B carboxyl-terminal antibodies and phosphorylated in vitro with cdc2 kinase purified from mitotic HeLa cells. Fig. 3A shows a Coomassie Blue-stained 5% polyacrylamide gel of immunoprecipitated myosin incubated without (lane 1), or with (lane 2), cdc2 kinase. The corresponding autoradiogram (Fig. 3B) shows that in the presence of cdc2 kinase, the two inserted MHC-B isoforms, MHC-B1 and MHC-B2, are phosphorylated, but the noninserted MHC-A isoform is not phosphorylated (lane 4). Autoradiography does not resolve the two MHC-B isoforms as well as Coomassie staining; therefore, confirmation that both are phosphorylated was determined by separately cutting the bands from Coomassie-stained gels for peptide mapping (see below). Using these in vitro conditions, the stoichiometry of total MHC-B phosphorylation is estimated to be at least 0.3 mol of phosphate/mol of MHC-B. When [γ-32P]ATP, but no kinase, is added to the immunoprecipitated myosin, there is no phosphorylation of any of the MHCs (lane 3). To determine whether the same sites were phosphorylated in MHC-B1 and MHC-B2 by cdc2 kinase, these MHC bands were cut separately from Coomassie Blue-stained 5% polyacrylamide gels, digested with trypsin, and approximately equal cpm of the tryptic digests were analyzed by IEF. Fig. 3C is an autoradiogram of the focused tryptic phosphopeptides and shows that there is only one major phosphopeptide that is the same in MHC-B1 and MHC-B2. A tryptic phosphopeptide focusing to the same position was seen following tryptic digestion of MHC-B1 and MHC-B2 phosphorylated with Xenopus cdc2 kinase (gift of Dr. James Maller, University of Colorado) and sea star oocyte cdc2 kinase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY; results not shown). To determine the site of phosphorylation, tryptic peptides of MHC-B phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase in vitro were separated by reverse phase HPLC. The arrow in Fig. 4A points to the single peak of radioactivity observed, which was used for amino acid sequencing. The sequence obtained is shown in Fig. 4B (underlined sequence). Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated the presence of serine phosphate, but not threonine phosphate, in the purified tryptic phosphopeptide (Fig. 4A, inset). These data localized the phosphorylation site to Ser-214, shown with the asterisk in Fig. 4B. This serine is within the inserted region of MHC-B, and it is followed by a proline and a basic residue, which is typical of cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites. To determine whether Ser-214 in MHC-B can be phosphorylated in intact cells, XTC cells in log phase of growth were labeled with 32Pi. The MHC-B isoforms were then immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, digested with trypsin, and the tryptic phosphopeptides were analyzed by IEF. The MHC-B tryptic phosphopeptides obtained after in vitro phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase were compared with those obtained following MHC-B phosphorylation in intact log phase XTC cells (Fig. 5A). A common radiolabeled phosphopeptide was observed which contained the site phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase in vitro. These results suggest that Ser-214 of MHC-B is phosphorylated in intact cells by cdc2 kinase or a cdc2-like kinase. Because cdc2 kinase regulates the entry of cells into meiosis and mitosis, we sought to determine whether MHC-B is specifically phosphorylated at these stages of the cell cycle by cdc2 kinase. To study the metaphase-specific phosphorylation of MHC-B by cdc2 kinase, we used lysates of Xenopus eggs. Xenopus cytoplasmic lysates that were stabilized in either metaphase or interphase were labeled with [γ-P32]ATP, and the MHC-A and MHC-B isoforms were immunoprecipitated separately with specific carboxyl-terminal peptide antibodies. Autoradiograms of immunoprecipitates of MHC-B electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels showed a prominent 200-kDa phosphoprotein from both metaphase and interphase lysates (results not sho"

The transient rise in intracellular free Ca concentration ([Ca]) is well characterized, but little is known about alterations of total cell Ca. Therefore we established a technique to determine changes in total cell Ca during hormone stimulation of Ca-loaded cells. Bradykinin and endothelin-1 reduced total cell Ca by up to 56% in HF-15 cells, COS-7 cells, and CHO K1 cells transfected with the rat B2 receptor cDNA. In Rat-1 cells and PC-12 cells, stimulation with endothelin-1 or bradykinin did not result in a net decrease in total cell Ca at physiological extracellular Ca concentration. Decrease in total cell Ca was preceded by an increase in [Ca] and blunting of the transient rise in [Ca] by a Ca chelator prevented the hormone-induced decrease in total cell Ca. Previous reduction of total cell Ca by one hormone suppressed the transient rise in [Ca] induced by another. The data present evidence that the hormones bradykinin and endothelin-1 are capable of switching off the Ca-mobilizing signal transduction pathway in a cell by depleting intracellular Ca stores.

The first early-induced peak was transient and likely corresponds to the well documented typical junB mRNA, stimulated in response to numerous growth factors, including IL-6. At variance, the second peak which has never been reported previously, lasted several hours. As a consequence of its effect on junB mRNA, IL-6 stimulated, in a biphasic fashion, the nuclear accumulation of the JunB protein. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of junB mRNA and JunB protein can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of junB transcription.Furthermore, our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late IL-6-induced junB transcription waves.First, cycloheximide strongly potentiated the transcription of the second wave, whereas it failed to affect the early-induced burst. Second, tyrphostin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, impaired the expression of the first but not the second junB mRNA peak. Conversely, genistein, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, totally abolished the expression of the second peak of junB mRNA whereas it did not affect the expression of the first peak.Altogether these data indicate that, in 7TD1 cells, IL-6 controls junB transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways. We have measured the level of junB mRNA in the B hybridoma cell line 7TD1, under interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation. IL-6 increases junB mRNA in a biphasic fashion. The first early-induced peak was transient and likely corresponds to the well documented typical junB mRNA, stimulated in response to numerous growth factors, including IL-6. At variance, the second peak which has never been reported previously, lasted several hours. As a consequence of its effect on junB mRNA, IL-6 stimulated, in a biphasic fashion, the nuclear accumulation of the JunB protein. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of junB mRNA and JunB protein can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of junB transcription. Furthermore, our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late IL-6-induced junB transcription waves. First, cycloheximide strongly potentiated the transcription of the second wave, whereas it failed to affect the early-induced burst. Second, tyrphostin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, impaired the expression of the first but not the second junB mRNA peak. Conversely, genistein, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, totally abolished the expression of the second peak of junB mRNA whereas it did not affect the expression of the first peak. Altogether these data indicate that, in 7TD1 cells, IL-6 controls junB transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways.

Nature. 1988; 332: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways involved in the mediation of these various effects remain to be elucidated. The IL-6 receptor is composed of an 80-kDa ligand-binding subunit associated with a 130-kDa (gp130) signal-transducing moiety (13Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M.

Upon binding, the ligand mediates the dimerization of gp130 and the activation of one tyrosine kinase belonging to the Janus kinase family (Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2)(15Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N.

Along this line, factors involved in the regulation of acute phase protein genes have been investigated extensively. The transcription factor referred to as nuclear factor NF-IL-6 (C/EBPβ) was initially identified as a factor that binds to the AGATTGCACAATCT consensus sequence encompassed within the IL-6 promoter(26Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). This factor was involved in the induction of several class 1 acute phase protein genes (α1-acid glycoprotein, angiotensinogen …) by IL-6(23Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). NF-IL-6 is ubiquitous, inducible at the transcription level, and the resulting protein is activated by phosphorylation on threonine residues by microtubule associated protein kinase(s)(27Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Besides NF-IL-6, IL-6 also stimulates the activity of two other factors involved in the transcription of the class 2 acute phase protein genes (α2-macroglobulin, α1-antichymotrypsin …). They have been identified as IL-6 response element binding protein (18Hattori M. Abraham L.J. Northemann W. Fey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Hocke G.M. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and acute phase response factor/stat-3(20Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 25Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar, 28Wegenka U.M.

IL-6 response element binding protein is produced in an activated state several hours after the addition of IL-6, by a mechanism involving protein neosynthesis(19Hocke G.M. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of acute phase response factor/stat-3 does not require protein synthesis, since this factor is directly phosphorylated by the Jak family protein tyrosine kinase and translocated in the nucleus within minutes following IL-6 stimulation (16Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar).Several reports have also demonstrated that IL-6 triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 160-kDa protein that controls in turn the early activation of junB mRNA(29Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. De Marco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Nakajima K. Wall R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), one possible component of the transcription factors AP-1 (31Vogt P.K. Bos T.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 55: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) or NFAT(32Boise L.H. Petryniak B. Mao X. June C.H. Wang C.Y. Lindsten T. Bravo R. Kovary K. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Under IL-6 stimulation, the transcription of early junB is controlled by another transcriptional factor, that interacts with an IL-6-specific cis-regulating element (JRE-IL-6) located at position −149 to −124 of junB promoter(33Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This factor is activated by a H7-sensitive pathway that does not involved protein kinase C, protein kinase A, or microtubule associated protein kinases(33Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that this IL-6 signaling pathway is different from those evoked for acute phase response factor/stat-3 or NF-IL-6. In this respect, the study of the regulation of junB provides an interesting approach for investigating novel IL-6-dependent pathways.In the present report we demonstrated that besides its ability to induce early junB, IL-6 can also stimulate a second delayed and sustained wave of expression of junB mRNA. This biphasic increase corresponds to two transcriptional bursts, resulting subsequently in a biphasic increase of the junB-encoded protein (JunB). We also provided evidence that the two waves of junB are regulated by two separated pathways that are controlled by distinct tyrosine kinases.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagentsRecombinant human interleukin-6 (IL-6), purified as described elsewhere(34Proudfoot A.E.I. Brown S.C. Bernard A.R. Bonnefoy J.Y. Kawashima E.H. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was generously provided by Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology (Geneva, Switzerland). Culture medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France). Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, genistein, tyrphostin 25 (RG50875), fetal calf serum, and human thrombin were purchased from Sigma. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting kit reagent and the radioisotopes [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham (Les Ulis, France). Rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal anti-JunB antibodies (JunB 2.2) used in Western blotting experiments were kind gifts from Dr. M. Yaniv (Institut Pasteur, URA 1644, Paris, France). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Dako (Denmark). QuickHyb hybridization solution and pBluescript SK/phagemid were purchased from Stratagene. PGEX-4T/2 vector, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Pharmacia/LKB (St-Quentin Yvelines, France).Cell Culture7TD1 cells (2.5 to 3.5 × 105/ml) were maintained at 37°C, in 8% CO2 atmosphere, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml IL-6. Within kinetics experiments, cells were first synchronized in G1 phase by depriving them of IL-6 for 16-24 h, then restimulated by the cytokine for indicated times. In experiments using tyrosine kinase inhibitors or transcription and protein synthesis blockers, cell viability was determined in parallel by trypan blue staining.RNA Extraction and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was prepared by denaturation in guanidinium thiocyanate followed by pelleting through a cesium chloride cushion(35Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, 15-20 μg of total RNAs were loaded on a 1% agarose gel in MOPS buffer, containing 0.7% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham). Probe hybridizations (106 cpm/ml) were carried out overnight at 65°C in a QuickHyb solution (Stratagene), filters were washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1 SDS at 65°C for 1 h and finally exposed to Amersham Hyperfilms-MP at −80°C. Northern blot experiments were quantified by densitometric scanning using a computerized microscopic image processor Biocom 500 (Biocom, Les Ulis, France) comprising a PC/AT-compatible microcomputer, a real time imaging processor, a control monitor, a color high definition monitor, and a Panasonic WV-CD50 camera.cDNA ProbesThe cDNA probe for junB mRNAs was a 0.7-kilobase EcoRI/AccI fragment excised from Rous sarcoma virus-junB, corresponding to the sequence of the clone 465, published by Ryder(36Ryder K. Lau L.F. Nathan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1487-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The murine c-myc cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Dani (Nice, France).Nuclei Isolation and Run-on Transcription AssayNuclei were isolated from 7TD1 cells (2-4 × 107) and run-on transcription assay performed according to the method described by Doglio et al.(37Doglio A. Dani C. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nylon filters (Hybond N+, Amersham) spotted with 5 μg of pBluescript SK containing junB or c-myc cDNA were hybridized for 48 h at 65°C with 107 cpm of biosynthetically 32P-labeled nuclear RNAs, then washed four times at 65°C for 2 h with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Filters were dried and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilms MP at −80°C.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Immunoblot AnalysisNuclear extracts were prepared using a method derived from Dignam et al.(38Dignam J.D. Lebovits R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei (4-5 107) were isolated as described above and lysed by the addition of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.37 M NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The suspension was gently rocked for 30 min then centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 rpm. The supernatants were collected and precipitated overnight by addition of 300 mg/ml ammonium sulfate. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 25,000 rpm, resuspended in 100 μl of a buffer containing: 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.125 mM EGTA, supplemented with protease inhibitors and dialyzed twice for 3 h at 4°C against the same buffer.Nuclear protein samples (100 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and incubated first with a specific anti-JunB (JunB 2.2) polyclonal antibody (1:750 dilution) and then with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2,000 dilution). The transferred proteins were finally detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's procedures.Expression and Purification of a Bacterially Synthesized Glutathione S-Transferase-JunB Protein and ImmunoblottingThis protein was derived from a pGEX-4T vector (Pharmacia) into which the 1.4-kilobase junB cDNA, encoding for the full-length protein, was cloned into SmaI/XhoI sites. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (1 mM for 6 h) treatment of bacteria harboring this plasmid grown at 28°C, induced the expression of soluble 66-67-kDa protein comprising glutathione S-transferase (26-28 kDa) fused with the 39-kDa JunB, respectively. Following lysis by sonication, solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifugation to remove debris, the protein was absorbed on ice to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were then washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 M NaCl. The 39-kDa JunB protein was finally eluted from the column by cleavage with 1 μg/ml human thrombin for 1 h at 25°C. The protein (50 ng) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as described above with an anti-JunB (JunB 2.2) antibody.RESULTSJunB mRNA Is Stimulated in a Biphasic Fashion in Response to IL-6 on 7TD1 CellsThe jun family members junB and c-jun are usually transiently stimulated in the early response to numerous stimuli including IL-6(29Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. De Marco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Nakajima K. Wall R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Ryder K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8464-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In recent reports, authors have demonstrated that, besides their early effect on c-jun mRNA, effectors like thrombin or fetal calf serum are also able to elicit a second phase of c-jun mRNA induction(40Trejo J. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Brown J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4742-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Carter R. Cosenza S.C. Pena A. Lipson K. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar).In an attempt to verify whether IL-6 was also able to stimulate a late induction of junB mRNA in 7TD1 cells, we measured the level of junB mRNA within the 10 h following the addition of IL-6. Northern blot analysis carried out on total RNAs, as described in Fig. 1, panel B, revealed that IL-6 strongly augmented the cellular level of junB mRNA following a bimodal fashion. The first peak of induction reached a maximal value after 1 h and then rapidly declined after 2 h of stimulation in the presence of IL-6. The second phase which was more sustained occurred between 5 and 9 h after stimulation. The stimulation factors estimated by scanning the bands corresponding to junB mRNA were, respectively, around 13-fold for the first peak and 4- to 5-fold for the second peak (Fig. 1, panel A).This biphasic increase was selective since IL-6 did not stimulate or modify the constitutive level of c-myc in the same interval of time (Fig. 1, panel B)The Biphasic Stimulation of junB mRNA Is Associated with a Biphasic Increase in JunB ProteinTo determine whether the biphasic regulation of junB mRNA resulted in a biphasic accumulation of JunB protein, we have assessed, by Western blotting analysis, the JunB protein level in nuclear extracts from 7TD1 cells stimulated with IL-6 (100 units/ml) for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. Results are shown in Fig. 2, panel A. In IL-6-deprived cells, no immunoreactive JunB protein could be detected. The level of protein increased markedly when IL-6 was added, raised a maximal level after 1 h, before declining to a basal level at 4 h. Then the protein level increased again by 6 h, suggesting that the biphasic stimulation of junB mRNA was accompanied by the increase of the nuclear JunB protein.Figure 2:Kinetics of induction by interleukin-6 of nuclear JunB protein. IL-6-deprived 7TD1 cells were stimulated with IL-6 for the indicated times. Nuclear proteins (100 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane as described under “Materials and Methods.” Immunoblots were then probed either with a specific anti-JunB antibody or a nonrelevant serum (N.I.S.) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) revelation. Panel A shows the biphasic induction by IL-6 of the nuclear JunB protein. Panel B shows the comparative migration pattern of: the nuclear JunB protein of 7TD1 cells, nonstimulated (lane 2) or stimulated (lane 3) for 1 h with IL-6 versus a nonphosphorylated bacterially expressed JunB fusion protein (lane 4). Lane 1 shows nuclear proteins of 7TD1 cells stimulated with IL-6, probed with a nonrelevant serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is currently accepted that the phosphorylation of c-Jun is responsible for its electrophoretic retardation from 39 kDa to 46 kDa (42Pulverer B.J. Hugues K. Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. Leevers S.J. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the phosphorylated status of the nuclear IL-6-translocated JunB protein, we have compared the migration pattern of the protein present in 7TD1 nuclear extracts with that of a nonphosphorylated bacterially expressed fusion protein. Lanes 2 and 3, Panel B represented the stimulation by IL-6 of the nuclear JunB protein. As indicated, JunB migrated as an unique band with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa slightly higher than the bacterially expressed protein (39-40 kDa) (lane 3 versus lane 4) suggesting, by analogy with results observed on c-Jun, that IL-6 might stimulate the nuclear translocation of a phosphorylated form of JunB.IL-6 Stimulates junB Transcription in a Biphasic MannerTo gain information on the way IL-6 elicits the increase of the two junB mRNA peaks, run-on experiments were performed to first determine whether IL-6 controlled the transcriptional rate of this gene. Nascent nuclear RNA chains, biosynthetically labeled with [α-32P]UTP, were isolated from 7TD1 cells stimulated for 0 to 10 h with IL-6 and used to hybridize nitrocellulose filters previously spotted with plasmids containing either c-myc or junB inserts. Results concerning junB transcription are shown in Fig. 3, panel B. In accordance with previous results (30Nakajima K. Wall R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a very low but detectable constitutive level of junB transcription was measurable in 7TD1 cells deprived of IL-6 for 24 h. After the addition of IL-6, junB transcripts increased abruptly to reach a maximal value at 30-60 min, before declining to the basal value by 2-3 h. Interestingly, the transcription resumed after 5 h and peaked at 6 h, before declining again by 8-9 h. The stimulatory factors, as determined by scanning the spots corresponding to the neosynthesized junB transcripts, were, respectively, 8-fold for the early peak (maximum at 30 min) and 4-fold for the second peak (maximum at 6 h) (Fig. 3, panel A). The biphasic time course of the burst in the transcription rate is an original feature that probably accounts for the immediate and delayed increase in junB mRNA levels. In contrast with junB transcription, c-myc gene was constitutively transcribed in noninduced 7TD1 cells and was not further stimulated in the presence of IL-6 (Fig. 3, panel C). Taken together, these results suggest that the biphasic transcription burst, described here, is not a general IL-6-mediated phenomena since it does not concern other genes like c-myc.Figure 3:Transcriptional induction of junB and c-myc genes in isolated nuclei of 7TD1 cells exposed to IL-6. Quiescent 7TD1 cells were exposed to IL-6 (100 units/ml) for the indicated times.

The decay of RNA was followed afterward in the presence of IL-6 or after withdrawal of the cytokine. Northern blot analyses are shown in Fig. 4, panels B, C, D, and E (early peak), and Fig. 5, panels B, C, D, and E (late peak). The corresponding densitometric RNA level quantifications are presented in panel A of Figure 4:, Figure 5:. Regardless of the presence of the cytokine or actinomycin D, the first burst of transcription was shut off after 60-90 min, and junB mRNA decayed with the same half-life (about 40-50 min). These data demonstrate that IL-6 exclusively controlled the transcription step without any modification of junB mRNA stability.Figure 4:Effect of IL-6 on the stability of the early junB mRNA peak. Quiescent 7TD1 cells were stimulated with IL-6 for 1 h, and the level of junB mRNA was measured during the next 3 h, by Northern blot analysis, either in the presence of IL-6 (panel B) or after the transcription was blocked by: IL-6 withdrawal (panel C), actinomycin D addition (panel D), or both IL-6 removal and addition of actinomycin D (panel E).

Pyrene-labeled lipid analogues of diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were used both as acceptors of tryptophan excitation energy of PKC and as membrane probes for intra- and intermolecular lipid chain collisions by measuring the ratio of excimer-to-monomer fluorescence intensity (EM). Both in micelles of polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether and in dioleoyl-PC vesicles, interaction of PKC with monopyrenyl PS (pyr-PS) in the absence of calcium resulted in a relatively slow decrease of the EM value. This effect on the lipid dynamics was accompanied by quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence of PKC. Addition of calcium resulted in a rapid further decrease of the EM ratio of pyr-PS and in additional quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence. When 4 mol % of pyr-PS was replaced by 0.5 mol % of dipyrenyl-labeled diacylglycerol a decrease of the intramolecular excimer formation rate and tryptophan fluorescence could only be detected in the presence of calcium and PS. Strong binding was also observed with dipyrenyl-labeled PIP (dipyr-PIP), but not with the other dipyrenyl-labeled lipids: PI, PS, or PC. In addition, the EM ratios of dipyr-PIP were not affected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and dipyr-PIP can bind simultaneously to PKC.

In addition, cPKC and nPKC families require for maximal activation lipid-like cofactors like sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) or phorbol esters (PMA)(14Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U.

Although the components for PKC activation have been identified now, very little is known about the mutual dependencies of the interaction of PKC with these factors. Especially the role of calcium in the PKC-lipid interaction and/or in the activation of cPKC is unclear. Most initial investigations of the lipid modulation of PKC activity were performed with PKC preparations from rat brain which is mainly composed of the calcium-dependent isozymes(9Sekiguchi K. Tsukuda M. Ase K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 23Huang K.P. Huang F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium has long been considered to be the cofactor that regulates association of this PKC with anionic lipids(24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Bell R.M. Cell. 1986; 45: 631-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Bell and co-workers (25Bell R.M. Cell. 1986; 45: 631-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) have proposed a model for PKC•Ca2+•PS•DG complexation. In this model calcium stabilizes the binding of PKC to PS containing membranes (see also (2Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7589-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3577-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Brockerhoff H.

The interaction of the PKC•Ca2+•PS complex with DG induces a release of a pseudo-substrate domain from the active site, thereby allowing access of substrates(26House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 27Makowske M. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16155-16159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mosior M.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that after initial association, PKC penetrates the membrane which is accompanied by some additional conformational changes which led to partial calcium independence of the binding(24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Lester D. Doll L. Brumfeld V. Miller I. Biochim. Biophys.

Lester D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 227: 318-323Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cofactors like DG and PMA might stabilize this inserted active PKC. According to this concept calcium modulates the lipid binding of PKC by inducing conformational changes in the protein. Alternatively, calcium may bind more aspecifically to PKC or the membrane, thereby affecting the electrostatic potential at the membrane surface (by neutralization of repulsive electrostatic interaction forces between PKC and the membrane (35Trudell J.R. Costa A.K. Csemansky C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and/or the lipid organization in the bilayer(34Brumfeld V. Lester D.S. Arch.

Furthermore, calcium is known to affect hydrophobic interactions (37Seelig J. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1990; 14: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and hydration between phospholipids and membrane-bound protein. These more aspecific effects of calcium can have dramatic effects on binding of PKC to membranes, although they do not appear to be of major importance in the association of PKC with lipids(34Brumfeld V.

In contradiction with earlier observations, Lester and co-workers (31Lester D. Doll L. Brumfeld V. Miller I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both association and subsequent penetration of PKC into membranes is independent of divalent cations, but very sensitive to pH. Using circular dichroism, large and specific conformational changes were observed upon binding to phosphatidylserine vesicles in the absence of calcium(31Lester D. Doll L. Brumfeld V. Miller I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Shah J. Shipley G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it was speculated that the inactive form of PKC may be loosely associated to the membrane. At odds with the concept of calcium modulation of lipid binding, these authors considered phospholipids as modulators for the binding of calcium to PKC(31Lester D. Doll L. Brumfeld V. Miller I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Brumfeld V. Lester D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 227: 318-323Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The enzyme is first associated with the lipids and then binds calcium which is needed for activity. Cofactors like DG shift the calcium dependence of PKC activity to lower concentrations of calcium(39Epand R.M. Stafford A.R. Lester D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). In the present report the binding of PKC to PS and DG is re-evaluated by simultaneous observation of quenching of PKC tryptophan fluorescence by resonance energy transfer and of lipid dynamic properties at various conditions. In these studies pyrene-labeled analogues of DG, PS, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) dispersed in vesicles or mixed micelles served not only as acceptors of tryptophan excitation energy but also as reporters of lipid acyl chain dynamics by measuring the ratio of excimer-to-monomer fluorescence intensity (EM) of the pyrene moiety. Formation of a protein-lipid complex resulted in an increased quenching of tryptophan fluorescence and in a reduced EM ratio of the pyrene lipids. A major advantage of this approach is the simultaneous employment of two independent methods for registration of the same events from both lipid and protein viewpoints. In addition, the approach allowed on-line and specific detection of interaction between PKC and the various lipids, and, combined with the high sensitivity, enabled the use of low concentrations of protein and lipid probes. Bovine brain L-α-phosphatidylserine (PS), dioleoyl-PC, dioleoyl-PS, DG, Thesit (polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether), EGTA, phospholipase D from Streptomyces sp., phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus were supplied by Sigma. Protein kinase C was purified from the cytosolic extract of homogenized Wistar rat brains similar to the procedure described by Huang and Huang (23Huang K.P. Huang F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consecutively by DEAE, phenyl-Sepharose, Sephacryl S200, and polylysine-agarose chromatography. The final PKC preparation (with isozyme composition as described elsewhere (9Sekiguchi K. Tsukuda M. Ase K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 23Huang K.P. Huang F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was essentially pure as demonstrated by silver staining of a polyacrylamide gel, and was stored at −70°C in buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) with 25% glycerol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, fluorescence microscopy grade). Di(pyrenedecanoyl)PC (dipyr-PC) was synthesized by methods described previously(41Patel K.M. Morrisett J.D. Sparrow J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 674-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Di(pyrenedecanoyl)-DG was synthesized by a phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of the diglyceride-phosphate linkage in dipyr-PC essentially as described by Myher and Kuksis(42Myher J.J. Kuksis J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 352-356Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transphosphatidylation of dipyr-PC by phospholipase D yielded di(pyrenedecanoyl)-PS(43Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1719-1721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesized lipids were purified with high performance liquid chromatography on a silicic acid column (240 × 10 mm, LiChroprep Si 60, Merck, Germany). Elution was performed with an increasing methanol gradient in chloroform. Di(pyrenedecanoyl)-PI and di(pyrenedecanoyl)-PIP were a kind gift of Drs. W. F. Nieuwenhuizen (University of Utrecht). Mixed lipid micelles were prepared by drying the required amounts of lipids under a stream of nitrogen in a glass tube followed by solubilization in buffer (1 mM Thesit, 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, and 50 μM EGTA) by vortexing and brief bath sonication. In the binding studies the Thesit concentration was 100 μM and the PS concentration was 10 μM (10 mol %). The fluorescent lipid concentration was 0.5 μM for the dipyrenyl-labeled lipids and 4 μM for the monopyrenyl lipids. The pyrene concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 342 nm in ethanol/Me2SO (75:25 v/v) (ɛ = 39,700 M-1 cm-1). In the fluorescence experiments the PKC concentration was 400 nM. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by injecting 5 μl of lipid dissolved in ethanol/Me2SO through a Hamilton syringe into 0.5 ml of a magnetically stirred buffer solution (20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, and 50 μM EGTA) at room temperature(44Kremer J.M.H. van de Esker M.W.J. Pathmamanoharan C. Wiersema P.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3932-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). For further details, see the previous section describing the preparation of micelles. The tryptophan fluorescence of PKC is quenched by pyrene lipids according to the resonance energy transfer mechanism. This process involves transfer of excitation energy from the tryptophan residues to the pyrene moieties by a weak coupling of the transition moments involved(45Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4984) Google Scholar, 46Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). The rate of this nonradiative process is highly dependent on the separation of the donor and acceptor molecules(45Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4984) Google Scholar). Since the critical Förster distance for a pyrene-tryptophan couple is approximately 2.7 nm, we assume that the majority of the tryptophan quenching originates from pyrene lipids that directly interact with PKC(45Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4984) Google Scholar). Next to their resonance energy acceptor ability, the pyrene-labeled lipids are excellent probes to study the organization and dynamics of lipid components in membranes through their ability to form excimers (a complex between a pyrene molecule in the excited state with a pyrene molecule in the ground state(47Förster T. Kasper K. Z. für Elektrochem. 1955; 59: 976-980Google Scholar). The excimer fluorescence is at higher wavelengths than the monomer. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission of pyrenyl probes is a measure for the collision frequency of the pyrene moieties and can be related to parameters describing membrane dynamics and organization (48Galla H.J. Sackman E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 339: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 49Sassaroli M. Vaukonen M. Perry D. Eisinger J. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 50Vanderkooi J.M. Gallis J.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4000-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this study two kinds of pyrene lipids are employed to investigate PKC-lipid interaction: lipids with one pyrene decanoyl moiety (monopyrene) at the sn-2 position of the lipid and lipids with two pyrene decanoyl moieties (dipyrene) at the terminal of both acyl chains. The collision of monopyrene lipids is an intermolecular event and reports on the lateral lipid organization and dynamics, while intramolecular excimer formation of dipyrenyl lipids is directly related to the local motional freedom and dynamics of lipid acyl chains in the membrane. Pyrene and tryptophan fluorescence intensities were monitored successively on a DMX-1000 steady state spectrofluorometer (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL) with computer-driven excitation and emission monochromators. One measurement cycle consisted of registration of tryptophan fluorescence and of pyrene monomer and excimer fluorescence intensities. The tryptophan residues were excited at 285 nm and their fluorescence was detected at 340 nm. Subsequently, the excitation wavelength was advanced to 347 nm to monitor the pyrene monomer and excimer emission by setting the emission monochromator at 377 and 487 nm, respectively. The experiments were performed at 40 cycles/min. The measurements were corrected for background emission and spectral instrument characteristics. Excitation and emission band widths were set at 4 nm. The measurements were performed at room temperature (20°C). In order to evaluate the role of calcium in the interaction of PKC to PS, the excimer formation of pyr-PS or pyr-PC and their ability to quench tryptophanyl fluorescence of PKC was examined in Thesit/PS micelles and DOPC/PS vesicles. Both lipid systems yielded comparable calcium-independent and calcium-dependent effects on the tryptophan fluorescence and pyrene excimer formation. Fig. 1 shows the dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1A) and of the EM ratio (Fig. 1B) of 4 mol % of pyr-PS (solid line) or pyr-PC (dashed line) in Thesit micelles. In an earlier study it was found that one Thesit mixed micelle consists of approximately 330 surfactant molecules(51Bastiaens P.I.H. Pap E.H.W. Borst J.W. van Hoek A. Kulinski T. Rigler R. Visser A.J.W.G. Biophys. Chem. 1993; 48: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Thus each mixed micelle contains on the average 13 pyrene lipids. In the absence of PKC the EM values of pyr-PS and pyr-PC scatter around a value of 0.6 as a consequence of collisions between different pyrene lipids. Addition of PKC (at t = 50 s) to a final concentration of 400 nM yields a tryptophan fluorescence signal which is for convenience normalized to unity (the background fluorescence at the tryptophan emission wavelength in the absence of PKC is less than 2%). At this PKC concentration approximately equal molar ratios of PKC and micellar aggregates are present. In the absence of calcium (50 μM EGTA) the tryptophan fluorescence decays slowly to a level of 80% of the original intensity when pyr-PS is present in the micelles (Fig. 1A). This effect is not observed if unlabeled micelles are present (dashed line in Fig. 1A). Addition of extra EGTA to a final concentration of 200 μM (or even higher) does not affect the tryptophan emission. Upon PKC addition the EM ratio of pyr-PS decays from 0.61 to an almost steady level of 0.51 (Fig. 1B). This effect is not observed if buffer is added (dashed line in Fig. 1B) instead of PKC. It can thus be concluded that the decrease in intermolecular collision frequency of the pyr-PS molecules is a consequence of the interaction of PKC with the micelles. When pyr-PC is used instead of pyr-PS in the Thesit/PS micelles, a similar but less strong reduction of the EM ratio of pyr-PC is observed (dotted line in Fig. 1B). The calcium independent interaction with PKC apparently reduces the motional freedom of pyr-PS by direct interaction with these lipids. The fact that binding of PKC to unlabeled PS in micelles containing pyr-PC does not leave the intermolecular collisions of this pyrene lipid unaffected, indicates that noninteracting PC molecules in the micelle also trace the binding of PKC. Furthermore, the binding of PKC to pyr-PS containing micelles results in quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. Since the average distance between tryptophan donors of PKC in solution and pyr-PS in micelles is too large for effective energy transfer, the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence independently confirms a calcium-independent interaction of PKC with pyr-PS, as was concluded from the EM experiments. Pyr-PC is also able to quench the tryptophan fluorescence of PKC, but weaker than pyr-PS, indicating that pyr-PC is not interacting with PKC but is rather randomly distributed in the micelle. A rapid, further reduction of both tryptophan fluorescence and of the EM ratio is observed when calcium (0.4 mM) is added (see Fig. 1B). This observation suggests a calcium-dependent reduction of the lipid dynamics and a more efficient quenching of tryptophan residues in PKC. Upon addition of an excess of EGTA (5 mM), the calcium-induced reduction of both the EM ratio and tryptophan fluorescence is largely recovered to their values observed before addition of calcium. The calcium-dependent reduction and EGTA-induced recovery of both tryptophan fluorescence and EM ratios can be repeated several times per experiment, indicating that the action of EGTA is based primarily on the removal of calcium and that detergent-like effects of EGTA (52Wallach D.F.H. Zingler R.J. Evolving Strategies and Tactics in Membrane Research. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1974: 74-78Google Scholar) play a minor role. The calcium dependence of the quenching and excimer characteristics can be explained by a calcium-dependent shift of the equilibrium of free and bound PKC to the bound form. Alternatively, it can be envisaged that addition of calcium does not affect the relative amount of PKC bound to micelles, but induces a (partial) insertion of PKC into the hydrophobic core of the micelle. This insertion leads to a closer average distance between the tryptophan donors in PKC and the pyrene acceptors in the micelle and thus to more efficient quenching and to simultaneous changes in the lipid dynamics. Measurement of the calcium and phospholipid-dependent PKC activity essentially as described by Snoek et al.(53Snoek G.T. Feijen A. Halem W.J. Rotterdam W.V. De Laat S.W. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 629-637PubMed Google Scholar), showed that in the absence of calcium, the enzyme is slightly stimulated by DOPC membranes that contain 10 mol % of dioleoylphosphatidylserine and 0.5 mol % of DG (data not shown). Apparently, the calcium-independent interaction of PKC with these membranes leads to partial activation of the enzyme. Subsequent addition of calcium induced a strong additional activation of the enzyme. In general several interaction forces are involved in protein-lipid association depending on the membrane or protein system. The range of these forces varies largely. Electrostatic forces dominate the interactions at relatively long distances and, generally, play a major role in peripheral binding of proteins to membranes. In this case both the protein and lipid surfaces carry oppositely charged groups. Hydrophobic peptide domains interacting with the phospholipid acyl chains may contribute to the interaction as well. Since low ionic strength enhances the electrostatic interactions between charged molecules and reduces the hydrophobic ones, evaluation of the tryptophan fluorescence of PKC and excimer formation of pyr-PS in calcium-free buffer at various concentrations of NaCl will yield information about the forces involved in the interaction between PKC and PS. As is shown in Fig. 2, the absence of NaCl leads to a stronger decrease of the EM ratio of pyr-PS and tryptophan fluorescence than in the presence of 120 mM NaCl (see also Fig. 1). The overall effect of a low ionic strength leads apparently to an enhancement of the total interaction between PKC and the micellar surface. This observation indicates that in the absence of NaCl, electrostatic interaction forces play a dominant role in the calcium-independent association. Stepwise titration of NaCl up to a concentration of 120 mM gradually changes both the EM ratio and tryptophan fluorescence to their values obtained initially in the presence of 120 mM NaCl. The lowest bar in the left panel represents the EM ratio of pyr-PS in absence of PKC. This ratio was essentially the same at the various NaCl concentrations, indicating that the increase of the EM ratio and of tryptophan fluorescence originates from reduction of the overall interaction forces between PKC and the micelles by NaCl. Further increase in the NaCl concentration (>120 mM) does not lead, however, to a further increase of both signals. Apparently, hydrophobic interaction forces are able to keep at least a part of the PKC population associated to the micellar surface at an ionic strength that approaches the physiological one, co"
