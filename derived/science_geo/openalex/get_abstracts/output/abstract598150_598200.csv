To understand the complexities of the charge and discharge cycles, you need to be able to watch the processes in situ or to freeze the battery rapidly for ex situ analysis. Li et al. applied cryo–electron microscopy techniques commonly used for studying biological samples to examine batteries. They identified the solid electrolyte interphase that forms, observed the interactions of Li with the interphase, and captured the formation of dendrites that can be detrimental to the lifetime of a battery.

Mussels have long been an inspiration for developing adhesives that work when wet. Filippidi et al. produced an extensible polymeric material containing catechol groups whose mechanical properties were augmented when dry through the addition of iron ions (see the Perspective by Winey). The iron ions lead to sacrificial metal coordination bonds, creating a reversible load-bearing network that does not trade extensibility for stiffness. Science , this issue p. 502 ; see also p. 449"

Abu-Remaileh et al. engineered cultured human cells to produce a protein tag on lysosomal membranes that could be used to rapidly precipitate purified lysosomes on magnetic beads. Analysis of their contents under various conditions showed that efflux from the lysosome of most essential amino acids (but not that of most other amino acids) is a regulated process. Amino acid transport was inhibited under conditions of nutrient depletion as a result of inhibition of the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) protein kinase complex. Science , this issue p. 807"
https://openalex.org/W2755639092,"It has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal of nanofluidics to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimensions approaching the size of small ions and water molecules. We report ion transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidation of the role of steric effects. We find that ions with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between anions and cations of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for development of nanofluidics, molecular separation and other nanoscale technologies."

The molecules that are responsive to viral infection and regulate such metabolic changes are hardly known, but are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by multiple viruses, but not by type I interferon (IFN-I), and facilitates viral replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by its nearest coding gene Acod1, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection through IFN-I-IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3)-independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-ACOD1 directly binds the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its metabolites could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality. This work reveals a feedback mechanism of virus-induced lncRNA-mediated metabolic promotion of viral infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2765332150,"Computer or human? Proving that we are human is now part of many tasks that we do on the internet, such as creating an email account, voting in an online poll, or even downloading a scientific paper. One of the most popular tests is text-based CAPTCHA, where would-be users are asked to decipher letters that may be distorted, partially obscured, or shown against a busy background. This test is used because computers find it tricky, but (most) humans do not. George et al. developed a hierarchical model for computer vision that was able to solve CAPTCHAs with a high accuracy rate using comparatively little training data. The results suggest that moving away from text-based CAPTCHAs, as some online services have done, may be a good idea. Science , this issue p. eaag2612"

Proton translocation across the F O region that spans the mitochondrial inner membrane drives ATP synthesis in the F 1 region through a rotational mechanism. Guo et al. present a high-resolution structure of the dimeric F O complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , determined by electron microscopy. The structure gives insights into how proton translocation powers rotation and suggests how F O dimers bend the membrane to give mitochondria their characteristic cristae.

https://openalex.org/W2767108732,"Plasmodium parasite entrance and exit Sweats and fever are the hallmarks of malaria. Red blood cells are the replication factories for malaria parasites. Fever occurs when the parasites' merozoite stages burst en masse from red blood cells into the circulation. Nasamu et al. and Pino et al. discovered that two parasite proteases, plasmepsin IX and X, are essential for mass cell exit (see the Perspective by Boddey). Plasmepsin X is also used by the merozoites to enter a fresh red blood cell to continue the replicative cycle. These two plasmepsins act by regulating the maturation of enzymes required to disrupt host cell membranes. Because these functions are essential for the parasite, the authors used protease inhibitors to show that plasmepsins provide potential drug targets.

https://openalex.org/W2766001310,"Newly transcribed eukaryotic precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) are processed at their 3' ends by the ~1-megadalton multiprotein cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF). CPF cleaves pre-mRNAs, adds a polyadenylate tail, and triggers transcription termination, but it is unclear how its various enzymes are coordinated and assembled. Here, we show that the nuclease, polymerase, and phosphatase activities of yeast CPF are organized into three modules. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the ~200-kilodalton polymerase module. This revealed four β propellers, in an assembly markedly similar to those of other protein complexes that bind nucleic acid. Combined with in vitro reconstitution experiments, our data show that the polymerase module brings together factors required for specific and efficient polyadenylation, to help coordinate mRNA 3'-end processing."

If binary lattices could be made and one component removed, then a more open array could form, as long as the remaining nanoparticles could be stabilized. Udayabhaskararao et al. formed binary superlattices of gold and magnetite nanoparticles at an air-liquid interface that could then be transferred to carbon-coated surfaces (see the Perspective by Kotov). Selective etching of either of the nanoparticles created non–close-packed arrays with vacancies stabilized by the carbon surface. Science , this issue p. 514 ; see also p. 448"
https://openalex.org/W2767071503,"Regulated exocytosis by secretory organelles is important for malaria parasite invasion and egress. Many parasite effector proteins, including perforins, adhesins, and proteases, are extensively proteolytically processed both pre- and postexocytosis. Here we report the multistage antiplasmodial activity of the aspartic protease inhibitor hydroxyl-ethyl-amine-based scaffold compound 49c. This scaffold inhibits the preexocytosis processing of several secreted rhoptry and microneme proteins by targeting the corresponding maturases plasmepsins IX (PMIX) and X (PMX), respectively. Conditional excision of PMIX revealed its crucial role in invasion, and recombinantly active PMIX and PMX cleave egress and invasion factors in a 49c-sensitive manner."
https://openalex.org/W2766708596,"Precision medicine is a rapidly growing area of modern medical science and open source machine-learning codes promise to be a critical component for the successful development of standardized and automated analysis of patient data. One important goal of precision cancer medicine is the accurate prediction of optimal drug therapies from the genomic profiles of individual patient tumors. We introduce here an open source software platform that employs a highly versatile support vector machine (SVM) algorithm combined with a standard recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach to predict personalized drug responses from gene expression profiles. Drug specific models were built using gene expression and drug response data from the National Cancer Institute panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (NCI-60). The models are highly accurate in predicting the drug responsiveness of a variety of cancer cell lines including those comprising the recent NCI-DREAM Challenge. We demonstrate that predictive accuracy is optimized when the learning dataset utilizes all probe-set expression values from a diversity of cancer cell types without pre-filtering for genes generally considered to be “drivers” of cancer onset/progression. Application of our models to publically available ovarian cancer (OC) patient gene expression datasets generated predictions consistent with observed responses previously reported in the literature. By making our algorithm “open source”, we hope to facilitate its testing in a variety of cancer types and contexts leading to community-driven improvements and refinements in subsequent applications."
https://openalex.org/W2765276050,"Background Increasing climate variability as a result of climate change will be one of the public health challenges to control infectious diseases in the future, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Objective To investigate the effect of climate variability on childhood diarrhea (CDD) and identify high risk periods of diarrheal diseases. Methods The study was conducted in all districts located in three Zones (Awi, West and East Gojjam) of Amhara Region in northwestern parts of Ethiopia. Monthly CDD cases for 24 months (from July 2013 to June 2015) reported to each district health office from the routine surveillance system were used for the study. Temperature, rainfall and humidity data for each district were extracted from satellite precipitation estimates and global atmospheric reanalysis. The space-time permutation scan statistic was used to identify high risk periods of CDD. A negative binomial regression was used to investigate the relationship between cases of CDD and climate variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using SaTScan program and StataSE v. 12. Results The monthly average incidence rate of CDD was 11.4 per 1000 (95%CI 10.8–12.0) with significant variation between males [12.5 per 1000 (95%CI 11.9 to 13.2)] and females [10.2 per 1000 (95%CI 9.6 to 10.8)]. The space-time permutation scan statistic identified the most likely high risk period of CDD between March and June 2014 located in Huletej Enese district of East Gojjam Zone. Monthly average temperature and monthly average rainfall were positively associated with the rate of CDD, whereas the relative humidity was negatively associated with the rate of CDD. Conclusions This study found that the most likely high risk period is in the beginning of the dry season. Climatic factors have an association with the occurrence of CDD. Therefore, CDD prevention and control strategy should consider local weather variations to improve programs on CDD."
https://openalex.org/W2766483629,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) commonly is used for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) after patients have failed to benefit from trials of multiple antidepressant medications. No analysis to date has examined the cost-effectiveness of rTMS used earlier in the course of treatment and over a patients' lifetime.We used lifetime Markov simulation modeling to compare the direct costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of rTMS and medication therapy in patients with newly diagnosed MDD (ages 20-59) who had failed to benefit from one pharmacotherapy trial. Patients' life expectancies, rates of response and remission, and quality of life outcomes were derived from the literature, and treatment costs were based upon published Medicare reimbursement data. Baseline costs, aggregate per year quality of life assessments (QALYs), Monte Carlo simulation, tornado analysis, assessment of dominance, and one way sensitivity analysis were also performed. The discount rate applied was 3%.Lifetime direct treatment costs, and QALYs identified rTMS as the dominant therapy compared to antidepressant medications (i.e., lower costs with better outcomes) in all age ranges, with costs/improved QALYs ranging from $2,952/0.32 (older patients) to $11,140/0.43 (younger patients). One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to the input variables of cost per rTMS session, monthly prescription drug cost, and the number of rTMS sessions per year.rTMS was identified as the dominant therapy compared to antidepressant medication trials over the life of the patient across the lifespan of adults with MDD, given current costs of treatment. These models support the use of rTMS after a single failed antidepressant medication trial versus further attempts at medication treatment in adults with MDD."
https://openalex.org/W2766743589,"Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in various plant sources, has gained attention as a possible agent responsible for the purported health benefits of certain foods, such as red wine. Despite annual multi-million dollar market sales as a nutriceutical, there is little consensus about the physiological roles of resveratrol. One suggested molecular target of resveratrol is eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II), an enzyme essential for chromosome segregation and DNA supercoiling homeostasis. Interestingly, resveratrol is chemically similar to ICRF-187, a clinically approved chemotherapeutic that stabilizes an ATP-dependent dimerization interface in topo II to block enzyme activity. Based on this similarity, we hypothesized that resveratrol may antagonize topo II by a similar mechanism. Using a variety of biochemical assays, we find that resveratrol indeed acts through the ICRF-187 binding locus, but that it inhibits topo II by preventing ATPase domain dimerization rather than stabilizing it. This work presents the first comprehensive analysis of the biochemical effects of both ICRF-187 and resveratrol on the human isoforms of topo II, and reveals a new mode for the allosteric regulation of topo II through modulation of ATPase status. Natural polyphenols related to resveratrol that have been shown to impact topo II function may operate in a similar manner.

Natural polyphenols related to resveratrol that have been shown to impact topo II function may operate in a similar manner. The rigorous study of natural products has been tremendously successful in providing leads for drug discovery, with 34% of small-molecule therapies approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1981 and 2010 consisting of natural products or natural-product derivatives (1Newman D.J.

However, the use of natural products in the form of dietary supplements, which are less stringently regulated by the FDA, can pose a public health risk (2Starr R.R. Too little, too late: ineffective regulation of dietary supplements in the United States.Am. J. Public Health. 2015; 105: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Despite a lack of scientific consensus on the safety and efficacy of many available dietary supplements, the multi-billion dollar supplement industry continues to expand at a significant rate (3Gahche J.

Dietary supplement use among U.S. adults has increased since NHANES III (1988–1994).NCHS Data Brief. 2011; 61: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in berries, nuts, traditional Asian medicines, and red wine, is one example of a popular natural supplement that is widely consumed in the face of ongoing debate around its reported health benefits and possible adverse side effects (4Novelle M.G.

Interest in resveratrol first arose after it was hypothesized to be the causative agent of the apparent health benefits of red wine (5Siemann E.H. Creasy L.L.

Topoisomerase inhibitors are broadly categorized into two classes: poisons and general catalytic inhibitors.

Topo II poisons such as epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide) and anthracyclines (doxorubicin) work by intercalating between DNA bases at the site of strand cleavage, stabilizing the cleaved complex, and preventing religation of the double strand break (31Bodley A.

In particular, both compounds are composed of two 6-membered rings separated by a 2-carbon linker, and one of the rings on resveratrol has two, meta-positioned exocyclic hydroxyls that resemble the orientation of the oxygens on ICRF-187. Biochemical, structural, and mutational analyses of ICRF-187 inhibition of topo II have shown that ICRF-187 binds to the dimerization interface formed between the enzyme’s ATPase domains and, following nucleotide binding, stabilizes their interaction to prevent subunit re-opening (39Roca J.

The action of ICRF-187 does not directly promote the formation of topo II-dependent cleaved DNA complexes; however, studies in yeast and mammalian cells have shown that ICRF-187, like resveratrol, can increase indicators of DNA damage (44Jensen L.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44488-44494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), possibly as a result of topo II inhibition and the build-up of problematic DNA topologies. ICRF-187, a synthetic molecule, is currently the only known ligand of a large, solvent-filled pocket that forms between nucleotide-dimerized ATPase domains of topo II (Fig. 1B) (43Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Structure of the topoisomerase II ATPase region and its mechanism of inhibition by the chemotherapeutic agent ICRF-187.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ICRF-187-binding site is highly conserved in eukaryotic topo IIs (Fig. 1C), but absent in other related GHKL-family ATPases (including prokaryotic type II topoisomerase homologs), suggesting that this locus may constitute a binding site for cellular effector molecules. To define the mechanism by which resveratrol inhibits eukaryotic topo II, we carried out a comprehensive series of assays comparing Saccharomyces cerevisiae topo II (ScTop2) and both isoforms of human topo II (HsTop2α and HsTop2β). We confirm that resveratrol is indeed a topo II inhibitor but demonstrate that it is not a poison as originally suggested. Interestingly, we find that both ICRF-187 and resveratrol show preferred selectivity for the human enzymes as compared with budding yeast topo II. A single resistance mutation in the ICRF-187-binding locus is shown to impart cross-resistance to resveratrol, indicating that both agents act at this site; however, using a FRET-based assay to monitor enzyme conformational dynamics, we find that unlike ICRF-187, which stabilizes topo II ATPase domain dimerization, resveratrol impedes this interaction. Together, these results describe a novel mechanism of topo II inhibition and implicate resveratrol as the first example of a natural molecule that can associate with the highly conserved ICRF-187-binding site. To begin to understand how resveratrol acts on topo II, we first performed a series of assays comparing the biochemical effects of the agent to that of ICRF-187. We conducted DNA supercoil relaxation assays with both S. cerevisiae topo II (ScTop2) and the two isoforms of Homo sapiens topo II (HsTop2α and HsTop2β). Purified enzymes were incubated with negatively supercoiled plasmid substrate and ATP to catalyze relaxation. Reactions were then quenched at various time points (supplemental Fig. S1), and the topoisomer distributions were resolved by native agarose gel electrophoresis. Resveratrol and ICRF-187 were able to inhibit the relaxation activity of both human isoforms at similar compound concentrations, as indicated by increased supercoiled substrate retention at higher inhibitor concentrations after a 20-min reaction incubation (Fig. 2). Parallel studies assessing the ability of HsTop2α to decatenate kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) yielded similar results (supplemental Fig. S2). Notably, both compounds were less efficient at inhibiting ScTop2 as compared with the human enzymes (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). ICRF-187 is most often described as a topo II catalytic inhibitor, but it has been likened to a weak poison based on the observation that bis-dioxopiperazine cytotoxicity requires enzyme activity (44Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. A novel mechanism of cell killing by anti-topoisomerase II bisdioxopiperazines.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and that topo II–DNA covalent complexes have been seen in budding yeast cells following drug treatment (45Huang K.C. Gao H. Yamasaki E.F. Grabowski D.R. Liu S. Shen L.L. Chan K.K. Ganapathi R. Snapka R.M. Topoisomerase II poisoning by ICRF-193.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44488-44494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, the accumulation of DNA damage markers in human cells upon resveratrol exposure has led to the suggestion that resveratrol is also a topo II poison (22Leone S. Cornetta T. Basso E. Cozzi R. Resveratrol induces DNA double-strand breaks through human topoisomerase II interaction.Cancer Lett. 2010; 295: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Demoulin B. Hermant M.

In Vitro. 2015; 29: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further investigate the capacity of ICRF-187 and resveratrol to act as poisons, we monitored the ability of both agents to induce the linearization of plasmid DNA in the presence of topo II. Etoposide was included as a positive control for topo II poisoning. To observe the formation of single- or double-stranded DNA breaks on a supercoiled plasmid substrate, we incubated negatively supercoiled plasmid with purified enzyme, ATP, and inhibitor for 20 min. The products were then resolved on an ethidium bromide-containing agarose gel to optimally separate the cleavage products from closed plasmid topoisomers. As expected, etoposide strongly induced DNA cleavage in a dose-dependent manner, especially with the yeast enzyme (Fig. 3). By contrast, neither resveratrol nor ICRF-187 strongly induced DNA cleavage by any of the topo II isoforms beyond levels seen with the drug-free enzymes (some DNA cleavage products did occasionally appear when HsTop2α was incubated with ICRF-187; however, the amount of cleavage was considerably less than what was formed upon etoposide treatment and, importantly, did not increase in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that it was not drug dependent) (Fig. 3). Overall, these results demonstrate that resveratrol and ICRF-187 have little to no capacity to poison topo II, and that their ability to inhibit supercoil relaxation derives from a different mode of action. The topo II reaction relies on the hydrolysis of two molecules of ATP to drive strand passage (27Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C.

Having eliminated cleavage–complex stabilization as a possible mechanism of resveratrol inhibition, we assessed the compound’s effect on the ATPase activity of topo II. ICRF-187, an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis (41Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E.

The relative rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured in a NADH-coupled ATPase assay (48Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21342-21349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at different ATP and inhibitor concentrations and plotted as Michaelis-Menten curves (Fig. 4). In contrast to the supercoil relaxation assays (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1), resveratrol’s effect on ATPase activity was not as robust as seen with ICRF-187 (Fig. 4). Moreover, resveratrol and ICRF-187 displayed different modes of inhibition (supplemental Table S1). For example, ICRF-187 treatment led to an apparent decrease in both Vmax and Km, as expected for its previously reported, uncompetitive mode of inhibition (41Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E. Steady-state and rapid kinetic analysis of topoisomerase II trapped as the closed-clamp intermediate by ICRF-193.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2613-2618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By comparison, the addition of resveratrol led to an increase in Km and a less than 2-fold decrease in Vmax, a behavior consistent for a mixed-type inhibitor with more competitive character (supplemental Table S1). Despite the notable differences in modes of inhibition, both ICRF-187 and resveratrol proved to be more potent against both human topo IIs. In the case of resveratrol inhibition, HsTop2α experienced a stronger Vmax effect and HsTop2β experienced a stronger Km effect as compared with ScTop2. During type II topoisomerase activity, nucleotide binding induces dimerization of the ATPase domains to allow ATP hydrolysis to occur (50Roca J. Wang J.C. The capture of a DNA double helix by an ATP-dependent protein clamp: a key step in DNA transport by type II DNA topoisomerases.Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Because of its chemical dissimilarity to ATP, we reasoned that rather than directly competing for nucleotide binding per se, resveratrol might act as a “pseudo-competitive” (51Alvarado F. Hypothesis for the interaction of phlorizin and phloretin with membrane carriers for sugars.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 135: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) inhibitor that interferes with ATPase domain dimerization, which is necessary for the productive binding of nucleotide. To test this idea, we developed a FRET-based assay that monitors the oligomeric status of the topo II ATPase elements. We first generated a C-terminally truncated construct of budding yeast topo II (ScTop2ΔCTD, residues 1–1177) that removes an unstructured region not required for activity (47Schmidt B.H. Osheroff N.

We then mutated several surface-exposed cysteines (C48A, C381A, C471V, and C731A) to eliminate all reactive sites other than Cys180 (which already resides on the topo II ATPase domain) for labeling with a fluorophore.

Although NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at primary afferent terminals are known to be critically involved in chemotherapy-induced chronic pain, the upstream signaling mechanism that leads to presynaptic NMDAR activation is unclear. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play a role in synaptic plasticity and NMDAR regulation. Here we report that the Group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) significantly increased the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root. DHPG also reduced the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs in spinal dorsal horn neurons. These effects were blocked by the selective mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), but not by an mGluR1 antagonist. MPEP normalized the frequency of miniature EPSCs and the amplitude of evoked EPSCs in paclitaxel-treated rats but had no effect in vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, mGluR5 protein levels in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord synaptosomes were significantly higher in paclitaxel- than in vehicle-treated rats. Inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) or blocking NMDARs abolished DHPG-induced increases in the miniature EPSC frequency of spinal dorsal horn neurons in vehicle- and paclitaxel-treated rats. Moreover, intrathecal administration of MPEP reversed pain hypersensitivity caused by paclitaxel treatment. Our findings suggest that paclitaxel-induced painful neuropathy is associated with increased presynaptic mGluR5 activity at the spinal cord level, which serves as upstream signaling for PKC-mediated tonic activation of NMDARs. mGluR5 is therefore a promising target for reducing chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain."

Since the pea genome has not been sequenced yet, identification of genes responsible for mutant phenotypes or desirable agricultural traits is usually performed via genetic mapping followed by candidate gene search. Such mapping is best carried out using gene-based molecular markers, as it opens the possibility for exploiting genome synteny between pea and its close relative Medicago truncatula Gaertn., possessing sequenced and annotated genome. In the last 5 years, a large number of pea gene-based molecular markers have been designed and mapped owing to the rapid evolution of ""next-generation sequencing"" technologies. However, the access to the complete set of markers designed worldwide is limited because the data are not uniformed and therefore hard to use. The Pea Marker Database was designed to combine the information about pea markers in a form of user-friendly and practical online tool. Version 1 (PMD1) comprises information about 2484 genic markers, including their locations in linkage groups, the sequences of corresponding pea transcripts and the names of related genes in M. truncatula. Version 2 (PMD2) is an updated version comprising 15944 pea markers in the same format with several advanced features. To test the performance of the PMD, fine mapping of pea symbiotic genes Sym13 and Sym27 in linkage groups VII and V, respectively, was carried out. The results of mapping allowed us to propose the Sen1 gene (a homologue of SEN1 gene of Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen) as the best candidate gene for Sym13, and to narrow the list of possible candidate genes for Sym27 to ten, thus proving PMD to be useful for pea gene mapping and cloning.

However, there is little understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the IMF deposition after castration of beef cattle. We hypothesize that genetic regulators function differently in IMF from bulls and steers. Therefore, after detecting serum testosterone and lipid parameter, as well as the contents of IMF at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, we have investigated differentially expressed (DE) microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs in IMF of bulls and steers at 24 months of age in Qinchuan cattle using next-generation sequencing, and then explored the possible biopathways regulating IMF deposition. Serum testosterone levels were significantly decreased in steers, whereas IMF content, serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) were markedly increased in steers. Comparing the results of steers and bulls, 580 upregulated genes and 1,120 downregulated genes in IMF tissues were identified as DE genes correlated with IMF deposition. The upregulated genes were mainly associated with lipid metabolism, lipogenesis and fatty acid transportation signalling pathways, and the downregulated genes were correlated with immune response and intracellular signal transduction. Concurrently, the DE miRNAs-important players in adipose tissue accumulation induced by castration-were also examined in IMF tissues; 52 DE miRNAs were identified. The expression profiles of selected genes and miRNAs were also confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Using integrated analysis, we constructed the microRNA-target regulatory network which was supported by target validation using the dual luciferase reporter system. Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to construct a molecular interaction network that could be involved in regulating IMF after castration. The detected molecular network is closely associated with lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation, which is supported by functional identification results of bta-let-7i on bovine preadipocytes. These results provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of the IMF phenotype differences between steers and bulls."

However, the underlying mechanism was not elucidated. In this study, we further characterized how GTPs influence AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the regulation of hepatic fat metabolism. Thirty-six male chickens were fed GTPs at a daily dose of 0, 80 or 160 mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks. The results demonstrated that oral administration of GTPs significantly reduced hepatic lipid content and abdominal fat mass, enhanced the phosphorylation levels of AMPKα and ACACA, and altered the mRNA levels and enzymatic activities of lipid-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. These results suggested that the activation of AMPK is a potential mechanism by which GTPs regulate hepatic lipid metabolism in such a way that lipid synthesis is reduced and fat oxidation is stimulated."

These sites are selected by origin licensing, during which the core enzyme of the eukaryotic DNA replicative helicase, the Mcm2-7 (minichromosome maintenance) complex, is loaded at each origin. This origin licensing requires loading two Mcm2-7 helicases around origin DNA in a head-to-head orientation. Current models suggest that the origin–recognition complex (ORC) and cell-division cycle 6 (Cdc6) proteins recognize and encircle origin DNA and assemble an Mcm2-7 double-hexamer around adjacent double-stranded DNA. To test this model and assess the location of Mcm2-7 initial loading, we placed DNA–protein roadblocks at defined positions adjacent to the essential ORC-binding site within Saccharomyces cerevisiae origin DNA. Roadblocks were made either by covalent cross-linking of the HpaII methyltransferase to DNA or through binding of a transcription activator-like effector (TALE) protein. Contrary to the sites of Mcm2-7 recruitment being precisely defined, only single roadblocks that inhibited ORC–DNA binding showed helicase loading defects. We observed inhibition of helicase loading without inhibition of ORC–DNA binding only when roadblocks were placed on both sides of the origin to restrict sliding of a helicase-loading intermediate. Consistent with a sliding helicase-loading intermediate, when either one of the flanking roadblocks was eliminated, the remaining roadblock had no effect on helicase loading. Interestingly, either origin-flanking nucleosomes or roadblocks resulted in helicase loading being dependent on an additional origin sequence known to be a weaker ORC–DNA-binding site. Together, our findings support a model in which sliding helicase-loading intermediates increase the flexibility of the DNA sequence requirements for origin licensing.

https://openalex.org/W2766017700,"Purpose To compare the patterns of retinal ganglion cell damage between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Methods In total, 35 eyes with unilateral NAION, and 70 age- and average peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness-matched eyes with POAG, were enrolled as disease groups; 35 unaffected fellow eyes of the NAION, and 70 age- and refractive error-matched normal subjects for the POAG, were enrolled as their control groups, respectively. The peripapillary RNFL thickness and macular ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness were compared between the disease groups and their controls, and between the two disease groups. Results Mean RNFL thicknesses at the 1 and 2 o’clock (superonasal) positions were thinner in NAION than in POAG (both p < 0.05). Mean RNFL thickness at 7 o’clock (inferotemporal) was thinner in POAG than in NAION (p = 0.001). Although there was no significant difference between NAION and POAG in average GCIPL thickness, all of the sectoral GCIPL thicknesses were thinner in NAION (all p < 0.05), except in the inferior and inferotemporal sectors. The ranges of the clock-hour RNFL with damage greater than the average RNFL thickness reduction, versus fellow eyes and control eyes, were 7 hours in NAION and 4 hours in POAG. Conclusions The more damaged clock-hour RNFL regions differed between NAION (1 and 2 o’clock) and POAG (7 o’clock). Most sectoral GCIPL thicknesses were thinner in NAION than in POAG."
https://openalex.org/W2766270040,Background Methylation of a CpG island (CGI; a dense cluster of CpGs) located in the 5' region of a gene suppresses that gene's transcription. The expression of G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is potentially associated with tumorigenesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the methylation status of the CGI located in the 5' region of G0S2 (hereinafter called 5' G0S2 CGI) in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods Quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR (RT-MSP) and bisulfite sequencing were performed to evaluate the methylation statuses of cutaneous SCC and normal epithelial cell samples. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed to evaluate RNA expression levels. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect protein expression. Results G0S2 was suppressed in the five SCC cell lines with 5' G0S2 CGI methylation levels of nearly 100.0% and was expressed in the two normal cultured keratinocytes with methylation levels of almost 0.0%. G0S2 was re-expressed in SCC cell lines treated with a demethylating agent. The in vivo methylation levels of 5' G0S2 CGI as determined by RT-MSP varied widely (0.0% to 77.7%) in 17 cutaneous SCC samples and narrowly (0.1% to 7.3%) in 6 normal epidermis samples. Nine cutaneous SCC samples exhibited higher methylation levels than the highest methylation level (7.3%) of the 6 normal epidermis samples. Bisulfite sequencing showed dense methylated CpG sites within 5' G0S2 CGI in these highly methylated cutaneous SCC samples. The methylation levels of the cutaneous SCC samples did not correlate with any clinical parameters investigated or with histopathological grading. Conclusions G0S2 is silenced by aberrant DNA methylation in a subset of cutaneous SCCs.

Maternal vaccination reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus ( 1 ). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal vaccine programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new vaccines, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal vaccine programs ( 2 ). We see the proposals thus far as being overly paternalistic, founded on a too-limited conception of risk-benefit analyses that has potential to derail the development and use of lifesaving vaccines. By contrast, an ethical approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the ethical framework that guides vaccine policies."

Nasal swabs were collected and processed for identification, serogrouping and testing susceptibilities for three antibiotics using standard microbiological techniques. Data on epidemiologic risk factors were collected using a structured questionnaire and the magnitude of their association with carriage was assessed using bivariate and multivariate analysis.A total of 240 samples were collected (115 from males and 125 from females). The mean age of study participants was 11.1 years. The prevalence of nasal carriage for Neisseria meningitidis was 20.4% (49/240). Carriage was significantly higher among children living under crowded conditions (OR 1.268; 95% CI: 1.186-1.355; p = 0.006). The predominant serogroups were W135-20/49 isolates (40.8%) and C-12/49 isolates (24.5%) and 83.7% of meningococci were sensitive for Ciprofloxacin. In contrast, isolates showed high resistance to Ceftriaxone (69.4%) while only 4.2% were sensitive for Penicillin. Multi-drug resistance was documented for 14.3% of the isolates.Meningococcal carriage rate was found to be high with higher rates associated with children and adolescents living in crowded living conditions.

We also studied the binding of the isolated SH2 domain of Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and the isolated PTB domain of Shc (SHC adaptor protein) to the EGF receptor. Although these adapter proteins bound readily to wild-type EGF receptor, they bound poorly to the single-Tyr EGF receptors, even those that bound full-length Grb2 and Shc well.

However, the stand density influence on ecosystem P cycling is unclear in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations of subtropical China. We collected rhizosphere and bulk soils, leaves and twigs with different ages and roots with different orders to measure P and nitrogen (N) variables in Chinese fir plantations with low density (LDCF) and high density (HDCF) at Fujian and Hunan provinces of subtropical China. Rhizosphere soil labile P, slow P, occluded P and extractable P were higher in LDCF than HDCF at two sites. Meanwhile, P and N concentrations of 1-year-old leaves and twigs were higher in LDCF than HDCF and leaf N/P ratio generally increased with increasing leaf age at two sites. Rhizosphere vs. bulk soil labile P and occluded P were greater in LDCF than HDCF at Fujian. Nitrogen resorption efficiencies (NRE) of leaves and twigs were higher in LDCF than HDCF at Fujian, while their P resorption efficiencies (PRE) were not different between two densities at two sites. The average NRE of leaves (41.7%) and twigs (65.6%) were lower than the corresponding PRE (67.8% and 78.0%, respectively).

From consciousness to how we apprehend space and time, the mysteries of the brain—and the best ways to probe them—continue to challenge neuroscientists.

ILLUSTRATION: CRISTIANA COUCEIRO

Every year, tens of thousands of researchers gather for the Society for Neuroscience meeting. The lecture theaters and poster halls are full of smart and hardworking individuals. Every year, we return home from the conference excited about all the facts learned and insights gained. However, despite the collective efforts of so many bright people, there is still much progress to be made in tackling the big questions in our field. Could it be that we are interpreting our data with outdated concepts? Most of the dominant concepts in present-day neuroscience, after all, were developed 50 to more than 100 years ago.

This special issue questions some of our approaches. Do the many diverse lines of inquiry in neuroscience need a broader set of animal models? How are resources best balanced between big data projects and smaller-scale focused projects?

On the conceptual side, how do we define a brain region—such as, for example, the prefrontal cortex? What is consciousness, and what makes it different from the many unconscious processes in our brain? Why do computers presently lack consciousness, and when might they acquire it?

The concepts of space and time are essential to how we see the world. Neuroscientists should take a fresh look at the emergence of these concepts in the brain and think about how to investigate them.

These are exciting times for neuroscience, but conceptual challenges still remain, as outlined in the Reviews in this issue. With many questions still open, it is time for our community to embrace and address these challenges.

https://openalex.org/W2766486366,"Measles virus (MV) infects a variety of lymphoid and non-lymphoid peripheral organs. However, in rare cases, the virus can persistently infect cells within the central nervous system. Although some of the factors that allow MV to persist are known, the contribution of host cell-encoded microRNAs (miRNA) have not been described. MiRNAs are a class of noncoding RNAs transcribed from genomes of all multicellular organisms and some viruses, which regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. We have studied the contribution of host cell-encoded miRNAs to the establishment of MV persistent infection in human neuroblastoma cells. Persistent MV infection was accompanied by differences in the expression profile and levels of several host cell-encoded microRNAs as compared to uninfected cells. MV persistence infection of a human neuroblastoma cell line (UKF-NB-MV), exhibit high miRNA-124 expression, and reduced expression of cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), a known target of miRNA-124, resulting in slower cell division but not cell death. By contrast, acute MV infection of UKF-NB cells did not result in increased miRNA-124 levels or CDK6 reduction. Ectopic overexpression of miRNA-124 affected cell viability only in UKF-NB-MV cells, causing cell death; implying that miRNA-124 over expression can sensitize cells to death only in the presence of MV persistent infection. To determine if miRNA-124 directly contributes to the establishment of MV persistence, UKF-NB cells overexpressing miRNA-124 were acutely infected, resulting in establishment of persistently infected colonies. We propose that miRNA-124 triggers a CDK6-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, which facilitates the establishment of MV persistence in neuroblastoma cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the role of a specific miRNA in MV persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2765301424,"The influence of thrombosis on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) and the role of the commonest inherited thrombophilia abnormalities factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A in the development of thrombosis are unknown. We investigated a cohort of patients who underwent LT for HCC with the aim to estimate the incidence rate (IR) of thrombosis, its influence on mortality and re-transplantation rates and, in the frame of a nested case-control study, the role of thrombophilia in donors and recipients for the development of thrombosis. Four-hundred and thirty patients underwent LT and were followed for a median of 7.2 years. Twenty-six recipients (6%) developed thrombosis (IR 1.06 [95%CI: 0.71–1.53] per 100 pts-yr). Mortality rate after LT was 3.95 (95%CI: 3.22–4.79) per 100 pts-yr and was not influenced by thrombosis. Re-transplantation was planned for 33 patients and was more common in patients with thrombosis than in those without (HR 2.50 [95%CI: 0.87–7.17]). The risk of thrombosis was 4 times higher in recipients with thrombophilia than in those without (OR 4.23 [95%CI: 0.99–18.04]) and 6 times higher when the analysis was restricted to venous thrombosis (OR 6.26 [95%CI: 1.19–32.85]). The presence of inherited thrombophilia in the donors did not increase the risk of thrombosis of the recipient. In conclusion, thrombosis is a complication of 6% of patients transplanted for HCC and increases the risk of re-transplantation but not of mortality. The risk of thrombosis, particularly venous, is increased in the presence of thrombophilia abnormalities in the recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2766187875,"During the erythrocytic cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, egress and invasion are essential steps finely controlled by reversible phosphorylation. In contrast to the growing number of kinases identified as key regulators, phosphatases have been poorly studied, and calcineurin is the only one identified so far to play a role in invasion. PfShelph2, a bacterial-like phosphatase, is a promising candidate to participate in the invasion process, as it was reported to be expressed late during the asexual blood stage and to reside within an apical compartment, yet distinct from rhoptry bulb, micronemes, or dense granules. It was also proposed to play a role in the control of the red blood cell membrane deformability at the end of the invasion process. However, genetic studies are still lacking to support this hypothesis. Here, we take advantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to tag shelph2 genomic locus while retaining its endogenous regulatory regions. This new strain allows us to follow the endogenous PfShelph2 protein expression and location during asexual blood stages. We show that PfShelph2 apical location is also distinct from the rhoptry neck or exonemes. We further demonstrate PfShelph2 dispensability during the asexual blood stage by generating PfShelph2-KO parasites using CRISPR-Cas9 machinery. Analyses of the mutant during the course of the erythrocytic development indicate that there are no detectable phenotypic consequences of Pfshelph2 genomic deletion. As this lack of phenotype might be due to functional redundancy, we also explore the likelihood of PfShelph1 (PfShelph2 paralog) being a compensatory phosphatase. We conclude that despite its cyclic expression profile, PfShelph2 is a dispensable phosphatase during the Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stage, whose function is unlikely substituted by PfShelph1."

Immediately after this section, a further two-minute training with participants aware of the data monitor was offered. Finally, a third 1-minute FMV round (t3) was performed by each participant. Ventilatory parameters were recorded using a computerized system. Primary outcome was the percentage of breaths with relevant mask leak (>25%). Secondary outcomes were percentages of breaths with a low peak inspiratory pressure (PIP<20 cm H2O), within the recommended PIP (20-35 cm H2O) and with a high PIP (>35 cm H2O).Twenty-six subjects participated in the study. The percentage of relevant mask leak significantly decreased (p<0.0001; β = -0.76, SE = 0.10) from 89.7% (SD 21.5%) at t1 to 45.4% (SD 27.2%) at t2 and to 18.3% (SD 20.1%) at t3. The percentage of breaths within the recommended PIP significantly increased (p<0.0001; β = +0.54, SE = 0.12). The percentage of breaths with PIP>35 cm H2O was 19.5% (SD 32.8%) at t1 and 39.2% (SD 37.7%) at t2 (padj = 0.27; β = +0.61, SE = 0.36) and significantly decreased (padj = 0.01; β = -1.61, SE = 0.55) to 6.0% (SD 15.4%) at t3.A 2-minute training on FMV, effective in a high resource country, had a positive effect also in a low resource setting. FMV performance further improved after an extra 2-minute verbal recall plus real time feedback. Although the training was extended, it still does not cost much time and effort.

https://openalex.org/W2765161902,"Renovascular hypertension (RVH) has deleterious effects on both the kidney and the heart. TGF-β signaling through Smad3 directs tissue fibrosis in chronic injury models. In the 2-kidney 1-clip (2K1C) model of RVH, employing mice on the 129 genetic background, Smad3 deficiency (KO) protects the stenotic kidney (STK) from development of interstitial fibrosis. However, these mice have an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death following 2K1C surgery. The purpose of this study was to characterize the cardiovascular phenotype of these mice. Renal artery stenosis (RAS) was established in Wild-type (WT) and Smad3 KO mice (129 genetic background) by placement of a polytetrafluoroethylene cuff on the right renal artery. Mortality was 25.5% for KO mice with RAS, 4.1% for KO sham mice, 1.2% for WT with RAS, and 1.8% for WT sham mice. Myocardial tissue of mice studied at 3 days following surgery showed extensive myocyte necrosis in KO but not WT mice. Myocyte necrosis was associated with a rapid induction of Ccl2 expression, macrophage influx, and increased MMP-9 activity. At later time points, both KO and WT mice developed myocardial fibrosis. No aortic aneurysms or dissections were observed at any time point. Smad3 KO mice were backcrossed to the C57BL/6J strain and subjected to RAS. Sudden death was observed at 10-14 days following surgery in 62.5% of mice; necropsy revealed aortic dissections as the cause of death. As observed in the 129 mice, the STK of Smad3 KO mice on the C57BL/6J background did not develop significant chronic renal damage. We conclude that the cardiovascular manifestations of Smad3 deficient mice are strain-specific, with myocyte necrosis in 129 mice and aortic rupture in C57BL/6J mice. Future studies will define mechanisms underlying this strain-specific effect on the cardiovascular system."

MLL or AT1 tumor cells were injected into the ventral prostate of immunocompetent rats. Tumor and lymph node morphology, and lymph node mRNA expression of macrophage associated markers, T-cell associated markers, and cytokines were examined over time until the first microscopic signs of metastases (at day 14 for MLL- and at day 28 for AT1-tumors). Already at day 3 after tumor cell injection, when the tumors were extremely small and occupied less than 1% of the prostate volume, MLL- and AT1-tumors provoked different immune responses in both the prostate and the regional lymph nodes. MLL-tumors induced expression of immunosuppressive cytokines, suppressed T-cell accumulation, and directed T-cells towards an immunosuppressive phenotype. AT1-tumors caused a response more similar to that in vehicle-injected animals, with accumulation of T-cells in tumors and regional lymph nodes. Prostate tumors with high metastatic potential were able to precondition regional lymph nodes to subsequent metastatic growth in ways different from tumors with less metastatic potential. This may indicate the existence of a time-window when pre-metastatic changes in regional lymph nodes can aid in the prognostication of locally aggressive and potentially metastatic prostate cancer."

During the exposure phase, the task was the same as that in the pre-exposure phase; however, it was inserted 9 trials of perturbations when the task goal changed to 60% of the maximum force. We measured the %RMSE, RMS from the biceps and triceps brachii and co-contraction. In the pre-exposure phase, both groups showed similar performance and muscle activity. When exposed to the perturbations, SSG performance more quickly returned to the previous level of accuracy, showed lower muscle activation and demonstrated a greater muscle co-contraction than did SG. The results give support to the adaptive process model on motor learning."

Bioinformatics programs PANTHER classification and WoLF-PSORT were used to further classify the identified host proteins in each case based on their functionality and subcellular distribution. Finally, we observed that the host protein network interacting with plus and minus-strand transcripts of sat-RNA, in the presence or absence of HV is distinct, and the global interactome of host proteins interacting with satRNA in either of the orientations is very different."

https://openalex.org/W2765467276,"In a series of ever-more-sensitive experiments, researchers have established that if the shape of the electron has any distortion at all, the bulge must be smaller than 1 thousand trillion trillionths of a millimeter (10 -27 mm). Now, a group at the JILA research institute in Boulder, Colorado, has a new approach that could help reduce the uncertainty still further—and perhaps reveal an actual distortion, known as an electric dipole moment (EDM). Scientists usually think of the electron as an exceedingly, if not infinitely, small and uniform sphere of negative charge, but a nonzero EDM would mean that charge is distributed unevenly. This tiny spatial asymmetry would have far-reaching implications, challenging physicists9 simplest model of particles and forces and helping explain why the universe today contains far more matter than antimatter."
https://openalex.org/W2765586525,"NASA will have to scale back its next big orbiting observatory to avoid busting its budget and affecting other missions, an independent panel says. The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is due for launch in the mid-2020s, but is already about 12% overbudget just a year after NASA gave the project the green light. The panel faulted NASA managers for setting the WFIRST team a number of challenges that made the project more complicated than originally anticipated. Now, the team will be directed to retain the basic elements of the mission but to seek cost-saving reductions without jeopardizing its science goals."
