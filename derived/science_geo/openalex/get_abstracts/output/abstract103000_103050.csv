https://openalex.org/W1970130379,"Within the mammalian hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) contains a circadian clock for timing of diverse neuronal, endocrine, and behavioral rhythms. By culturing cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode arrays, we have been able to record spontaneous action potentials from individual SCN neurons for days or weeks, revealing prominent circadian rhythms in firing rate. Despite abundant functional synapses, circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture are not synchronized. After reversible blockade of neuronal firing lasting 2.5 days, circadian firing rhythms re-emerge with unaltered phases. These data suggest that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators, and that synapses formed in vitro are neither necessary for operation of these oscillators nor sufficient for synchronizing them."

These drugs interact with the sulfonylurea receptor of pancreatic beta cells and inhibit the conductance of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent potassium (KATP) channels. Cloning of complementary DNAs for the high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor indicates that it is a member of the ATP-binding cassette or traffic ATPase superfamily with multiple membrane-spanning domains and two nucleotide binding folds. The results suggest that the sulfonylurea receptor may sense changes in ATP and ADP concentration, affect KATP channel activity, and thereby modulate insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W2024993897,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are a group of inherited diseases whose genetic etiology has yet to be elucidated. The autosomal recessive forms (LGMD2) constitute a genetically heterogeneous group with LGMD2A mapping to chromosome 15q15.1-q21.1. The gene encoding the muscle-specific calcium-activated neutral protease 3 (CANP3) large subunit is located in this region. This cysteine protease belongs to the family of intracellular calpains. Fifteen nonsense, splice site, frameshift, or missense calpain mutations cosegregate with the disease in LGMD2A families, six of which were found within La Réunion island patients. A digenic inheritance model is proposed to account for the unexpected presence of multiple independent mutations in this small inbred population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enzymatic rather than a structural protein defect causing a muscular dystrophy, a defect that may have regulatory consequences, perhaps in signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2055568369,"The temporal and spatial profile of activity-evoked changes in membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was examined with simultaneous somatic and dendritic patch-pipette recording and calcium imaging experiments. Action potentials are initiated close to the soma of these neurons and backpropagate into the dendrites in an activity-dependent manner; those occurring early in a train propagate actively, whereas those occurring later fail to actively invade the distal dendrites. Consistent with this finding, dendritic calcium transients evoked by single action potentials do not significantly attenuate with distance from the soma, whereas those evoked by trains attenuate substantially. Failure of action potential propagation into the distal dendrites often occurs at branch points. Consequently, neighboring regions of the dendritic tree can experience different voltage and calcium signals during repetitive action potential firing. The influence of backpropagating action potentials on synaptic integration and plasticity will therefore depend on both the extent of dendritic branching and the pattern of neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1986381180,"Familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin secretion, is linked to chromosome 11p14-15.1. The newly cloned high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) gene, a regulator of insulin secretion, was mapped to 11p15.1 by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two separate SUR gene splice site mutations, which segregated with disease phenotype, were identified in affected individuals from nine different families. Both mutations resulted in aberrant processing of the RNA sequence and disruption of the putative second nucleotide binding domain of the SUR protein. Abnormal insulin secretion in PHHI appears to be caused by mutations in the SUR gene."
https://openalex.org/W2079786360,"Cytotoxicity by natural killer (NK) cells is inhibited by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on target cells. This inhibition may be mediated by NK receptors with different MHC specificities. A family of four NK-specific complementary DNAs (cDNAs), designated NKATs (NK-associated transcripts), was identified that encoded related transmembrane proteins, characterized by an extracellular region with two or three immunoglobulin-superfamily domains and by a cytoplasmic domain with an unusual antigen receptor activation motif (ARAM). The distribution of these cDNAs was clonotypic and correlated with NK cell inhibition by particular class I alleles. Thus, NKAT cDNAs may encode receptors for class I molecules on NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973707586,"Genetic studies of memory formation in Drosophila have revealed that the formation of a protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory (LTM) requires multiple training sessions. LTM is blocked specifically by induced expression of a repressor isoform of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Here, we report an enhancement of LTM formation after induced expression of an activator isoform of dCREB2. Maximum LTM is achieved after one training session, and its formation depends on phosphorylation of the activator transgene. A model of LTM formation based on differential regulation of CREB isoforms is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2027260046,"Homozygous Igf1-/- mice at 2 months of age had reduced brain weights, with reductions evenly affecting all major brain areas. The gross morphology of the CNS was normal, but the size of white matter structures in brain and spinal cord was strongly reduced, owing to decreased numbers of axons and oligodendrocytes. Myelinated axons were more strongly reduced in number than unmyelinated axons. The volume of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer was reduced in excess of the decrease in brain weight. Among populations of calcium-binding protein-containing neurons, there was a selective reduction in the number of striatal parvalbumin-containing cells. Numbers of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, striatal and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, and spinal cord motoneurons were unaffected. Cerebellar morphology was unaltered. Our findings suggest cell type- and region-specific functions for IGF-I and emphasize prominent roles in axon growth and maturation in CNS myelination."
https://openalex.org/W2074192294,Infection by human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) is typified by the progressive depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes and deterioration of immune function in most patients. A central unresolved issue in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pathogenesis is the mechanism underlying this T cell depletion. HIV-1 Tat protein was shown to induce cell death by apoptosis in a T cell line and in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from uninfected donors. This Tat-induced apoptosis was inhibitable by growth factors and was associated with enhanced activation of cyclin-dependent kinases.
https://openalex.org/W1996917933,"A central issue in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the relationship between amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation. To determine whether amyloid fibril formation affects the phosphorylation state of tau, primary cultures of fetal rat hippocampal and human cortical neurons were treated with beta-amyloid (beta A) in a soluble, amorphous-aggregated, or fibrillar form. Fibrillar beta A, but not soluble or amorphous-aggregated beta A, markedly induces the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-202 and Ser-396/Ser-404, resulting in a shift in the tau M(r) in human cortical neurons. Hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment of fibrillar beta A-treated neurons in a soluble form that is not associated with microtubules and is incapable of binding to microtubules in vitro. Dephosphorylation of beta A-induced tau restores its capacity to bind to microtubules. Thus, amyloid fibril formation alters the phosphorylation state of tau, resulting in the loss of microtubule binding capacity and somatodendritic accumulation, properties also exhibited by tau in the AD brain. Amyloid fibril formation may therefore be a cause of abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD."

https://openalex.org/W2023654689,"Using whole-cell recording from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons and minimal stimulation of Schaffer collaterals, we have studied what seem to be single synapses. Although the transmission at a putative single synapses is quite unreliable, the synapse can be made to release transmitter reliably in response to the second stimulus in a pair of stimuli that re presented in rapid succession (e.g., 50 ms separation). Statistical analysis of transsmision failures seen with such paired pulse stimulation reveals that the majority of stimulus-evoked synaptic currents (> 90%) are produced by a single synapse under the conditions of minimal stimulation, even if multiple synapses are actually present. Individual synapses appear to release either zero or one quantum; that is, a single synapse seems to have only one functional release sit at any time. After the release site has been used, approximately 20 ms is required to refill the site so that it can be used again."
https://openalex.org/W1989736892,"Thermodynamic mutant cycles provide a formalism for studying energetic coupling between amino acids on the interaction surface in a protein-protein complex. This approach was applied to the Shaker potassium channel and to a high-affinity peptide inhibitor (scorpion toxin) that binds to its pore entryway. The assignment of pairwise interactions defined the spatial arrangement of channel amino acids with respect to the known inhibitor structure. A strong constraint was placed on the Shaker channel pore-forming region by requiring its amino-terminal border to be 12 to 15 angstroms from the central axis. This method is directly applicable to sodium, calcium, and other ion channels where inhibitor or modulatory proteins bind with high affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2025994996,"Gelsolin, an 82 kDa actin-binding protein, has potent actin filament-severing activity in vitro. To investigate the in vivo function of gelsolin, transgenic gelsolin-null (Gsn-) mice were generated and found to have normal embryonic development and longevity. However, platelet shape changes are decreased in Gsn- mice, causing prolonged bleeding times. Neutrophil migration in vivo into peritoneal exudates and in vitro is delayed. Gsn- dermal fibroblasts have excessive actin stress fibers and migrate more slowly than wild-type fibroblasts, but have increased contractility in vitro. These observations establish the requirement of gelsolin for rapid motile responses in cell types involved in stress responses such as hemostasis, inflammation, and wound healing. Neither gelsolin nor other proteins with similar actin filament-severing activity are expressed in early embryonic cells, indicating that this mechanism of actin filament dynamics is not essential for motility during early embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2079671310,"Activation of dendritic voltage-gated ion channels by local synaptic input was tested by simultaneous dendrite-attached patch-clamp recordings and whole-cell somatic voltage recordings made from CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Schaffer collateral stimulation elicited subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that opened voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels in the apical dendrites. The EPSP-activated sodium channels opened near the peak of the EPSP, whereas low voltage-activated calcium channels opened near the EPSP peak and during the decay phase. Dendritic high voltage-activated channels required somatic action potential generation or suprathreshold synaptic trains for activation. Dendritic voltage-gated channels are, therefore, likely to participate in dendritic integration of synaptic events."

https://openalex.org/W1965435203,"Induction of prodynorphin gene expression by psychostimulant drugs may represent a compensatory adaptation to excessive dopamine stimulation and may contribute to the aversive aspects of withdrawal. We therefore investigated the molecular mechanisms by which dopamine psychostimulant drugs induce prodynorphin gene expression in vivo and in rat primary striatal cultures. We demonstrate that three recently described cAMP response elements (CREs), rather than a previously reported noncanonical AP-1 site, are critical for dopamine induction of the prodynorphin gene in striatal neurons. CRE-binding protein (CREB) binds to these CREs in striatal cell extracts and is phosphorylated on Ser-133 after dopamine stimulation in a D1 dopamine receptor-dependent manner. Surprisingly, following chronic administration of amphetamine, levels of phosphorylated CREB are increased above basal in rat striatum in vivo, whereas c-fos mRNA is suppressed below basal levels. D1 receptor-mediated CREB phosphorylation appears to mediate adaptations to psychostimulant drugs in the striatum."

https://openalex.org/W2122336578,"Leydig cell hypoplasia is a rare autosomal recessive condition that interferes with normal development of male external genitalia in 46,XY individuals. We have studied two Leydig cell hypoplasia patients (siblings born to consanguineous parents), and found them to be homozygous for a missense mutation (Ala593Pro) in the sixth transmembrane domain of the luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor gene. In vitro expression studies showed that this mutated receptor binds human choriogonadotropin with a normal KD, but the ligand binding does not result in increased production of cAMP. We conclude that a homozygous LH receptor gene mutation underlies the syndrome of autosomal recessive congenital Leydig cell hypoplasia in this family. These results have implications for the understanding of the development of the male genitalia."
https://openalex.org/W1978666079,"Following prolonged exposure to an odorant, C. elegans exhibits a diminished response to the odorant for several hours. This olfactory adaptation is odorant selective; animals can adapt independently to different odorants sensed by a single pair of olfactory neurons, the AWC neurons. The mechanism of olfactory adaptation is genetically complex, with different genes required for adaptation to different odorants. Animals mutant for the gene adp-1 fail to adapt to a subset of AWC-sensed odorants; adp-1 affects a calcium-dependent process required for adaptation. Mutations in another gene, osm-9, affect adaptation to a different but overlapping subset of AWC-sensed odorants. Mutations in adp-1 and osm-9 do not diminish the ability of unadapted animals to respond to odorants, indicating that odorant sensation and odorant adaptation are distinct processes."
https://openalex.org/W2037133606,"Bacterial superantigens bind with high affinity to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens on antigen-presenting cells and with T cell antigen receptor (TCR) beta chains on T lymphocytes, which results in the T cell activation responsible for toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning. Many cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones were shown to have receptors for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules that inhibited superantigen-induced cytotoxicity against appropriate class I-bearing target cells. One type of inhibitory receptor, NKB1, was present on CD4+ and CD8+TCR alpha beta+ CTL clones and blocked the killing of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-coated targets bearing certain polymorphic HLA-B molecules. Expression of HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules on the SEB-coated targets also protected against cytolysis mediated by many NKB1-negative T cell clones, suggesting the presence of additional inhibitory MHC class I receptors. These HLA class I receptors may limit tissue destruction and possibly autoimmunity caused by activated T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1992386239,"X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX) is a congenital defect of bone and cartilage development characterized by aberrant bone mineralization, severe underdevelopment of nasal cartilage, and distal phalangeal hypoplasia. A virtually identical phenotype is observed in the warfarin embryopathy, which is due to the teratogenic effects of coumarin derivatives during pregnancy. We have cloned the genomic region within Xp22.3 where the CDPX gene has been assigned and isolated three adjacent genes showing highly significant homology to the sulfatase gene family. Point mutations in one of these genes were identified in five patients with CDPX. Expression of this gene in COS cells resulted in a heat-labile arylsulfatase activity that is inhibited by warfarin. A deficiency of a heat-labile arylsulfatase activity was demonstrated in patients with deletions spanning the CDPX region. These data indicate that CDPX is caused by an inherited deficiency of a novel sulfatase and suggest that warfarin embryopathy might involve drug-induced inhibition of the same enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2153494230,"Xklp1 is a novel Xenopus kinesin-like protein with a motor domain at the amino terminus, nuclear localization sequences in the stalk, and a putative zinc finger-like sequence in the tail. It is nuclear during interphase and chromosomal during mitosis. During late anaphase, a fraction of the protein relocalizes to the spindle interzone and accumulates in the midbody during telophase. Depletion of Xklp1 protein by antisense oligo knockout in oocytes leads to defective mitosis during the first cell cycles following fertilization. The bipolarity of spindles assembled in vitro in the presence of anti-Xklp1 antibodies is unstable, and the chromosomes fail to congress on the metaphase plate."

Functional receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes when tyrosine and phenylalanine derivatives were incorporated at positions 93, 190, and 198 in the binding site of the alpha subunit. Subtle changes in the structure of an individual side chain produced readily detectable changes in the function of this large channel protein. At each position, distinct features of side chain structure dominated the dose-response relation, probably by governing the agonist-receptor binding."

https://openalex.org/W1982043728,"Two rabbits immunized with a portion of glutamate receptor (GluR) subunit GluR3 (amino acids 245-457) exhibited seizure-like behaviors, suggesting that antibodies to GluR3 may modulate neuronal excitability. Using whole-cell recording, rabbit GluR3 antisera were tested on cultured fetal mouse cortical neurons. In a subset of kainate-responsive neurons, miniperfusion of antisera and IgG evoked currents that were blocked by CNQX. Immunoreactivity to synthetic peptides prepared to subregions GluR3A (amino acids 245-274) and GluR3B (amino acids 372-395) was present in both rabbit sera. Peptide GluR3B, but not GluR3A, specifically blocked antisera- and IgG-evoked currents. Similar receptor activation and anti-GluR3 reactivity was present in sera from patients with active Rasmussen's encephalitis, an intractable pediatric epilepsy. Thus, antibodies to GluR3 define a region involved in agonist binding and specific receptor activation. These data suggest that antibodies to neuronal receptors can function as agonists and that autoantibodies to GluRs may be highly specific neurotoxicants in some neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2016671192,"Neurotoxicity through abnormal activation of membrane channels is a potential cause of neurodegenerative disease. Here we show that a gain-of-function mutation, deg.3(u662), leads to the degeneration of a small set of neurons in the nematode C. elegans. The deg.3 gene encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit, which in the region of transmembrane domain II is most similar to the neuronal alpha 7 subunits from rat and chicken. The u662 mutation changes a residue in the second transmembrane domain, the domain thought to form the channel pore. A similar change in the equivalent amino acid in the chick protein produces channels that desensitize slowly. Channel hyperactivity may underlie the degenerations seen in the C. elegans deg.3(u662) mutants, since antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors suppress the deg-3(u662) mutant phenotypes."

We have developed a method to map systematically all the residues forming the surface of this binding-site crevice, and we have applied this method to the third membrane-spanning segment (M3). We mutated, one at a time, 23 residues in and flanking M3 to cysteine and expressed the mutant receptors heterologously. Ten of these mutants reacted with charged, hydrophilic, lipophobic, sulfhydryl-specific reagents, added extracellularly, and were protected from reaction by a reversible dopamine antagonist. Thus, the side chains of these residues are exposed in the binding-site crevice, which like M3 extends from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the membrane. The pattern of exposure is consistent with a short loop followed by six turns of an alpha helix."

The sensitivity for attenuation of desensitization by cyclothiazide for homomeric GluR-A was solely dependent upon exchange of Ser-750 (flip) and Asn-750 (flop), and was unaffected by mutagenesis of other divergent residues. In contrast, substantial alteration of the relative efficacy of glutamate versus kainate required mutation of multiple residues in the flip/flop region. Modulation by cyclothiazide was abolished by mutation of Ser-750 to Gin, the residue found at the homologous site in kainate-preferring subunits, whereas introduction of Ser at this site in GluR6 imparted sensitivity to cyclothiazide."
https://openalex.org/W2033463399,"The dimerization specificity of the bZIP transcription factors resides in the leucine zipper region. It is commonly assumed that electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged amino acid residues on different helices of the leucine zipper contribute favorably to dimerization specificity. Crystal structures of the GCN4 leucine zipper contain interhelical salt bridges between Glu20 and Lys15′ and between Glu22 and Lys27′. 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the glutamic acid pKa values at physiological ionic strength indicate that the salt bridge involving Glu22 does not contribute to stability and that the salt bridge involving Glu20 is unfavorable, relative to the corresponding situation with a neutral (protonated) Glu residue. Moreover, the substitution of Glu20 by glutamine is stabilizing. Thus, salt bridges will not necessarily contribute favorably to bZIP dimerization specificity and may indeed be unfavorable, relative to alternative neutral-charge interactions."

Using an antiserum prepared against bacterially expressed nod protein, we show that during prometaphase nod protein is localized on oocyte chromosomes and is not restricted to either specific chromosomal regions or to the kinetochore. Thus, motor-based chromosome-microtubule interactions are not limited to the centromere, but extend along the chromosome arms, providing a molecular explanation for the polar ejection force."

These adaptive mutations are a subset of spontaneous types and their formation depends on the RecABC functions. Data presented here suggest that this phenomenon depends on transfer functions of the F factor. Fertility inhibition eliminates RecA-dependent adaptive reversion.

This heterogeneity in response of presynaptic boutons was not seen with isradipine (5 microM) or omega-agatoxin IVA (80 nM), which inhibited exocytosis by 23% and 17%, respectively.

Reversion associated with transfer was shown, and when the same lac allele was chromosomal, reversion to Lac+ was 25 to 50 times less frequent. Postplating reversion was 25 times less when mating was inhibited by the presence of detergent.

https://openalex.org/W1982999999,"The ability of immature neurons from chick lumbosacral sympathetic ganglia to proliferate in vitro was used to identify factors that affect neurogenesis. Under serum-free culture conditions, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, or insulin caused an increase in the proportion of cells that incorporated [3H]thymidine. In addition, IGFs also stimulated neurite outgrowth from these immature sympathetic neurons. IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA was found to be expressed in E7 sympathetic ganglia during the period of neurogenesis. IGF-I was detectable in fibroblasts, whereas IGF-II mRNA was expressed by neurons, glia, and fibroblasts. Elimination of endogenous IGFs by neutralizing antibodies resulted in a reduction of neuron proliferation and neuron number, whereas elevation of IGF levels by treatment with IGF-I increased sympathetic neuron proliferation in vivo. These findings suggest an important role of IGFs for the development of sympathetic neurons and imply a general role of IGFs in the control of neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth."

In seeking roles for this carbohydrate, we asked whether VVA-B4 affected the distribution of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on cultured muscle cells. We found that incubation of myotubes with VVA-B4 induced formation of AChR clusters and potentiated the effect of a nerve-derived clustering factor, agrin. Additional experiments implicated GalNAc-terminated glycoconjugates as modulators of agrin-induced AChR clustering. Enzymatic removal of GalNAc residues or treatment with a multivalent protein-GalNAc conjugate blocked agrin-induced clustering, whereas enzymatic unmasking of additional GalNAc residues induced clustering in the absence of added agrin. Moreover, incubation with agrin led to redistribution of VVA-B4-binding material on myotubes. Together, these results suggest that agrin-induced clustering of AChRs involves a GalNAc-dependent step."

Contrary to most potassium channel modulations, serotonin induced a reversible positive shift in the voltage operating range, of +30 mV for the Shaker channels and +10-14 mV for the delayed rectifier. The maximal current amplitudes were unaffected. Modulation was not affected by the subunit-specific Shaker mutations ShE62 and T(1;Y)W32 or a null mutation of the putative modulatory subunit eag.

We used this method to show that, in the absence of the aCC axon, which pioneers the intersegmental nerve in the PNS, the three U follower axons are delayed and make frequent errors. However, the pathway ultimately forms in most segments. We also ablated the axons that pioneer the first longitudinal pathways within the CNS and observed similar results; the formation of longitudinal pathways is delayed and disorganized in 70% of segments, but these tracts ultimately form in 80% of segments. Thus, pioneers facilitate the development of PNS and CNS axon pathways; in their absence, followers are delayed and make numerous errors. However, pioneers are not absolutely required, as these embryos display a remarkable ability to correct for the loss of the pioneering neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2002694127,"In this study, we demonstrate a role for extracentromeric sequences in chromosome inheritance. Genetic analyses indicate that transmission of the Drosophila minichromosome Dp1187 is sensitive to the dosage of nod+, a kinesin-like gene required for the meiotic transmission of achiasmate chromosomes. Minichromosome deletions displayed increased loss rates in females heterozygous for a loss-of-function allele of nod (nod/+). We have analyzed the structures of nod-sensitive deletions and conclude that multiple regions of Dp1187 interact genetically with nod+ to promote normal chromosome transmission. Most nod+ interactions are observed with regions that are not essential for centromere function. We propose that normal chromosome transmission requires forces generated outside the kinetochore, perhaps to maintain tension on kinetochore microtubules and stabilize the attachment of achiasmate chromosomes to the metaphase spindle."

Infections with high titer of virus injected into the ventricle resulted in the majority of cells in the brain expressing foreign protein, while cells in the retina and optic nerve showed no expression. Infection with lower viral titers resulted in fewer infected cells that were distributed throughout the otherwise normal tissue. Intense expression of foreign protein in the brain was observed 36 hr after injection and remained high for at least 4 days. Infected animals developed normally and had the same number of cells in the optic tectum as control animals.
