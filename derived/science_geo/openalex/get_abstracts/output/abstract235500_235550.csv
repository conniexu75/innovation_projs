https://openalex.org/W2041672341,"Current approaches to reaction discovery focus on one particular transformation. Typically, researchers choose substrates based on their predicted ability to serve as precursors for the target structure, then evaluate reaction conditions1,2,3,4,5,6 for their ability to effect product formation. This approach is ideal for addressing specific reactivity problems, but its focused nature might leave many areas of chemical reactivity unexplored. Here we report a reaction discovery approach that uses DNA-templated organic synthesis7,8,9,10 and in vitro selection to simultaneously evaluate many combinations of different substrates for bond-forming reactions in a single solution. Watson–Crick base pairing controls the effective molarities of substrates tethered to DNA strands; bond-forming substrate combinations are then revealed using in vitro selection for bond formation, PCR amplification and DNA microarray analysis. Using this approach, we discovered an efficient and mild carbon–carbon bond-forming reaction that generates an enone from an alkyne and alkene using an inorganic palladium catalyst. Although this approach is restricted to conditions and catalysts that are at least partially compatible with DNA, we expect that its versatility and efficiency will enable the discovery of additional reactions between a wide range of substrates."

However, the regulation of survivin and p53 on the quercetin-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in cancer cells remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of survivin and p53 in the quercetin-treated human lung carcinoma cells. Quercetin (20-80 μm for 24 h) induced the cytotoxicity and apoptosis in both A549 and H1299 lung carcinoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, quercetin inhibited the cell growth, increased the fractions of G2/M phase, and raised the levels of cyclin B1 and phospho-cdc2 (threonine 161) proteins. Moreover, quercetin induced abnormal chromosome segregation in H1299 cells. The survivin proteins were highly expressed in mitotic phase and were located on the midbody of cytokinesis; however, the survivin proteins were increased and concentrated on the nuclei following quercetin treatment in the lung carcinoma cells. Transfection of a survivin antisense oligodeoxynucleotide enhanced the quercetin-induced cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity. Subsequently, quercetin increased the levels of total p53 (DO-1), phospho-p53 (serine 15), and p21 proteins, which were translocated to the nuclei in A549 cells. Treatment with a specific p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α, or transfection of a p53 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide enhanced the cytotoxicity of the quercetin-treated cells. Furthermore, transfection of a small interfering RNA of p21 enhanced the quercetin-induced cell death in A549 cells. Together, our results suggest that survivin can reduce the cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, and p53 elevates the p21 level, which may attenuate the cell death in the quercetin-treated human lung carcinoma cells."

Mutations in the Vangl2 gene cause a neural tube defect (craniorachischisis) characteristic of the looptail (Lp) mouse. Studies in model organisms indicate that Vangl proteins play a key developmental role in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) and in regulating convergent extension (CE) movements during embryogenesis. The role of Vangl1 in these processes is virtually unknown, and the molecular function of Vangl1 and Vangl2 in PCP and CE is poorly understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that both mouse Vangl1 and Vangl2 physically interact with the three members of the cytoplasmic Dishevelled (Dvl) protein family. This interaction is shown to require both the predicted cytoplasmic C-terminal half of Vangl1/2 and a portion of the Dvl protein containing PDZ and DIX domains. In addition, we show that the two known Vangl2 loss-of-function mutations identified in two independent Lp alleles associated with neural tube defects impair binding to Dvl1, Dvl2, and Dvl3. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the neural tube defect seen in Lp mice. Our observations indicate that Vangl1 biochemical properties parallel those of Vangl2 and that Vangl1 might, therefore, participate in PCP and CE either in concert with Vangl2 or independently of Vangl2 in discrete cell types.

Neural tube closure is a complex developmental process that takes place early during embryogenesis and is a key step in formation of the central nervous system, including spinal cord (1Copp A.J. Greene N.D.E. Murdoch J.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In humans, failure of the neural tube to close properly results in a group of syndromes collectively known as neural tube defects (NTDs), 1The abbreviations used are: NTD, neural tube defect; TM, transmembrane; PCP, planar cell polarity; RT, reverse transcription; aa, amino acid(s); CE, convergent extension; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA binding domain; AD, activation domain; SD, synthetic medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase. which constitute the second most frequent cause of congenital abnormalities (1 in 1000 live births) (2Frey L. Hauser W.A. Epilepsia. 2003; 44: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NTDs are very complex, poorly understood, and difficult to study in humans. Recent genetic studies of NTDs in model organisms have identified a number of genes and proteins that play critical roles in neural tube closure (1Copp A.J. Greene N.D.E. Murdoch J.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, we have identified Vangl2 (Van Gogh-like, formerly “loop-tail associated protein,” Ltap) as the gene mutated in the mouse model of severe NTD known as looptail (Lp) (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J. Gros P. Genomics. 2001; 72: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Heterozygous Lp animals (Lp/+) are normal except for the presence of a characteristic “kinked” (looped) tail, whereas Lp homozygotes (Lp/Lp) die at mid-gestation due to craniorachischisis, a very severe NTD that is characterized by a completely open neural tube from the midbrain/hindbrain boundary to the caudal (tail) region (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Two alleles have been described for the Lp mice: naturally occurring Lp (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and a chemically induced Lpm1Jus (4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J. Gros P. Genomics. 2001; 72: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Vangl2 is a 521-amino acid transmembrane (TM) protein composed of four putative TM domains in the N-terminal half. The C-terminal half is predicted to be cytoplasmic and is possibly involved in intracellular signaling and/or interaction with other proteins (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J. Gros P.

Vangl2 mRNA is embryonically expressed in a number of tissues, including the neural tube immediately prior to, during, and after closure (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J. Gros P.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The NTD phenotype of both Lp mutants (Lp, Lpm1Jus) is associated with independent missense mutations within the Vangl2 cytoplasmic domain affecting amino acid residues otherwise conserved in the protein family: S464N (Lp) and D255E (Lpm1Jus) (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J. Gros P. Genomics. 2001; 72: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The similar phenotypic consequences of heterozygosity (-/+) and homozygosity (-/-) at independent Lp alleles (4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J. Gros P. Genomics. 2001; 72: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the strict recessive mode of inheritance of Lp-associated NTD strongly suggest that Lp mutations behave as loss-of-function mutations in a gene dosage-sensitive pathway, signifying a role for Vangl2 as a critical regulator of neural tube formation. Vangl2 orthologs have been found in flies (Drosophila), worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and mammals, thus defining a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins (7Katoh M. Intl. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 10: 11-15PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of fish, mouse, and human genomes has identified two Vangl homologous genes in each species designated Vangl1 and Vangl2. Originally cloned in Drosophila by two groups, the primordial gene was given the dual appellation Strabismus (Stbm) or Van Gogh (Vang), based on the phenotypic appearance of certain structures in fly mutants (8Taylor J. Abramova N. Charlton J. Adler P.N. Genetics. 1998; 150: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1998; 125: 1149-1159PubMed Google Scholar). The gene was shown to play a role in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP), or the orientation of epithelial cells in a planar layer (10Gubb D. Garcia-Bellido A. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 68: 37-57PubMed Google Scholar, 11Strutt D. Development. 2003; 130: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In flies, disruption of the PCP pathway through inactivation of one of several so-called “core PCP genes” results in mis-orientation of normally highly organized specific epithelial structures such as ommatidia of eye, hairs on the wing cells, bristles on the legs, and others (11Strutt D. Development. 2003; 130: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12Mlodzik M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 564-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition to Stbm/Vang, other core PCP proteins include the seven TM domain receptor Frizzled (Fz), an atypical cadherin Starry night/Flamingo (Stan/Fml), and two cytoplasmic proteins, Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) and Prickle (Pk) (13Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 14Theisen H. Purcell J. Bennett M. Kansagara D. Syed A. Marsh J.L.

Cell. 1999; 98: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Extensive studies in flies have shown that the establishment of proper planar polarity relies on the formation of a multiprotein membrane complex consisting of core PCP proteins Stbm/Vang, Pk, Dvl, and Fz. In individual cells of the fly wing, PCP proteins are initially arranged symmetrically at the apical membrane, but become asymmetrically redistributed during the establishment of PCP. A complex formed by Stbm/Vang and Pk assumes an apical-proximal localization, whereas a Fz-Dvl complex is redirected to the apical-distal portion of the cell (18Axelrod J.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tree D.R.P. Shulman J.M. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Gubb D. Axelrod J.D.

Development. 2003; 130: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This asymmetry is believed to be key in establishing planar polarity (11Strutt D. Development. 2003; 130: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, fly Stbm and its vertebrate orthologVangl2 have been shown to interact directly with cytoplasmic Dvl and Pk proteins leading to their recruitment to the membrane (6Park M. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20Bastock R. Strutt H. Strutt D.

Although the function of Pk in PCP is not well understood, the role of Dvl has been better characterized. Dvl proteins have a modular organization typical of adaptor proteins with three structurally conserved domains, the N-terminal DIX domain, the central PDZ domain, and the C-terminal DEP domain (24Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 25Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30957-30962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Dvl has been demonstrated to play key roles in both canonical Wnt and PCP pathways (reviewed in Ref. 27Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). The DIX domain is indispensable for canonical Wnt signaling, whereas the DEP domain is dedicated to the PCP pathway and the PDZ functions in both (25Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29Penton A. Wodarz A. Nusse R. Genetics. 2002; 161: 747-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2R. Nusse (2001). The Wnt gene homepage, www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html. Mutations in the DEP domain interfere with Dvl translocation to the membrane (18Axelrod J.D.

Recent studies in vertebrates have revealed that Vangl2 regulates the process of convergent extension (CE, controlled by the non-canonical Wnt pathway) during gastrulation and neurulation in frogs and zebrafish (6Park M. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 31Goto T. Keller R. Dev. Biol. 2002; 247: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Darken R.S.

Chandrasekhar A. Somica-Krezel L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). During CE, dorsal mesenchymal and neuroepithelial cells become polarized in a medio-lateral direction, migrate, and intercalate. These directional cellular activities result in concomitant lengthening of the anterior-posterior axis and narrowing of the epithelial mass in a perpendicular direction (34Keller R. Science. 2002; 298: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Failure of CE in mesenchyme produces animals with shorter, wider trunks (34Keller R. Science. 2002; 298: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 35Wallingford J.B. Rowning B.A. Vogeli K.M. Rothbacher U. Fraser S.E. Harland R.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), whereas CE distortion during neural tube formation leads to significant widening of the neural plate in the midline and, as a result, the neural tube folds are spaced too far apart to permit closure (1Copp A.J. Greene N.D.E. Murdoch J.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 36Wallingford J.B. Harland R.M. Development. 2002; 129: 5815-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the Lp mouse is compatible with manifestations of CE failure, because the body axis is shortened, the neural plate is broadened, and the neural tube does not close (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Kibar Z. Underhill D.A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Justice M.J.

Tsipouri V. Arkell R.M. Cattanach B. Copp A.J. Henderson D.J. Steel N. Brown S.D.M. Gray I.C. Murdoch J.N. Curr.

Mei L. Chien K.R. Sussman D.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Development. 2002; 129: 5827-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) cause phenotypes indistinguishable from that of the Lp mouse. These observations have prompted the hypothesis that the regulation of CE in vertebrates is related to the PCP pathway in flies, including a critical role for vertebrate relatives of PCP proteins such as Stbm/Vang, Dvl, Fz, and Pk (reviewed in Ref. 39Fanto M. McNeill H. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The physiological role and biochemical properties of Vangl2 are now being unraveled, yet Vangl1 function remains a mystery. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the mammalian Vangl1 protein. To determine whether structural similarities in the Vangl family translate into conservation of function we investigated possible interactions of Vangl1 and Vangl2 with three known members of the Dvl family. We also examined the effect of Lp mutations of Vangl2 on Vangl2 interactions with Dvl proteins and demonstrated that the S464N and D255E mutations dramatically decrease Vangl2 binding to Dvl proteins. These findings suggest a molecular explanation for the loss-of-function of Vangl2 protein in Lp mouse and establish a critical role for Vangl2:Dvl interaction in proper signaling during neural tube closure. Plasmids—Total RNA from mouse embryos (E14.5) was used as a template for reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) of cDNAs corresponding to mouse Vangl1 and Vangl2 with Taq-HiFi Polymerase (Invitrogen), as previously described (3Kibar Z. Vogan K.J. Groulx N. Justice M.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). cDNA products corresponding to the proposed cytoplasmic domains of mouse Vangl1 (251–526 aa) and Vangl2 (238–521 aa) were subcloned into plasmid vector pBDT7 (Clontech) to yield pBD-mVangl1 and pBD-mVangl2 and into plasmid pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences) to produce pGST-mVangl1 and pGST-mVangl2. Restriction enzyme sites (in brackets and underlined in sequences) were incorporated within oligonucleotide primers for in-frame insertion of Vangl1/2 cDNAs in corresponding fusion proteins. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: pBD-mVangl1: 5′-CAAAGAGAATTCATGTTCACCCTGCAGGTGGTC-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-TTCTCTGGATCCCTTAGACTGATGTCTCAGACTG-3′ (BamHI); pBD-mVangl2: 5′-CAAGAGCATATGGAGCTCCGTCAGCTCCAGCCC-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-GTTCTCGAATTCCTGCTGCAAAAGTCACACAGA-3′ (EcoRI); pGST-mVangl1: 5′-CAAGAGGGATCCATGTTCACCCTGCAGGTGGTC-3′ (BamHI) and 5′-TTCTCTGAATTCTTAGACTGATGTCTCAGACTG-3′ (EcoRI); pGST-mVangl2: 5′-CAAGAGGAATTCGAGCTCCGTCAGCTCCAGCCC-3′ (EcoRI); and 5′-TTCCTCGTCGACCCTGCAAAAGTCACACAGA-3′ (SalI). Full-length cDNAs for mouse Vangl1 and Vangl2 were generated and cloned into pCB6 mammalian expression vector. A short antigenic epitope (EQKLISEEDL) derived from the human c-Myc protein (c-Myc tag) was inserted in-frame at the N terminus of Vangl1 and in the predicted extracytoplasmic domain of Vangl2 (following amino acid position 136). The c-Myc epitope sequence is indicated in bold. The following oligonucleotide primer pairs were used: pCMV-Vangl1: 5′-CAAGAAGGTACCATTGCTATGGAGCAGAAGCTAATCTCTGAGGAGGATCTGGATACCGAATCCACG-3′ (KpnI) and 5′-CTCTTGAAGCTTTTAGACTGATGTCTCAGACTG-3′ (HindIII); pCMV-Vangl2: fragment A 5′-CATAGCGGTACCATGGACACCGAGTCCCAGTAC-3′ (KpnI); 5′-CAGATCCTCCTCAGAGATTAGCTTCTGCTCGGCCGTCCCACACGGCTCCTGCTC-3; and fragment B 5′-GAGCAGAAGCTAATCTCTGAGGAGGATCTGGAGCTGGAGCCGT GTGGGACG-3′ and 5′-CTCTTGAAGCTTAAGTCACACAGAGGTCTC-3′ (HindIII). Two separate Vangl2 fragments A and B were initially generated by RT-PCR. The obtained PCR products were gel-purified, mixed in 1:1 proportion, incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, and slowly cooled down to 30 °C. Final amplification was done with the forward primer of segment A and the reverse primer of segment B. Fragments of the three mouse Dishevelled genes, mDvl1, mDvl2, and mDvl3, were generated by RT-PCR and subcloned into plasmid vector pGADT7 (Stratagene). These included portions corresponding to (a) the N-terminal halves (1–404 aa, 1–418 aa, and 1–395 aa) of the Dvl1/2/3 proteins, respectively, (b) the C-terminal portion of Dvl3 (389–717 aa), and (c) the predicted DIX domain (1–87 aa) of Dvl1. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: pAD-mDvl1–5′: 5′-GAAAGAGAATTCARGGCGGAGACCAAAATCATCTACCACATGGACGAG-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-CTCTTGATCGATGCTACGGCGCCTCCTCAAGCTGTGG-3′ (ClaI); pAD-mDvl2–5′: 5′-CATAGCATCGATGGATGGCGGGCAGCAGCGCGGGG-3′ (ClaI) and 5′-GATACGGGATCCCAGAGAGACCCCGGCCTTCGCA-3′ (BamHI); pAD-mDvl3–5′: 5′-CATAGCGAATTCATGGGCGAGACCAAGATCATCTAC-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-ATCAGTATCGATCGATGGAGCTGGTGATGGAGGA-3′ (ClaI); pAD-mDvl3–3′: 5′-CATAGCGAATTCATCACCAGCTCCATC-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-ATCAGTATCGATCGGGCCCTGATCACATCACATC-3′ (ClaI); pAD-mDvl1-DIX: 5′-GAAAGAGAATTCARGGCGGAGACCAAAATCATCTACCACATGGAC GAG-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-CATCAAATCGATAGCGCCCTCAGCCAGGACCAGCCA-3′ (ClaI). Amplification products were digested with indicated enzymes, gel-purified using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and subcloned into yeast expression plasmid (see “Results”). The sequence integrity of all PCR-amplified inserts was verified by sequencing. Full-length cDNA clones for mouse Dvl1 (tagged with a c-Myc epitope), Dvl2 and Dvl3 (tagged with an HA epitope) engineered into CMV-driven mammalian expression vector were kindly provided by Dr. X. Li (Department of Genetics and Developmental Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center). Yeast Two-hybrid System—The commercially available yeast two-hybrid system MatchMaker system 3 (#K1612–1, Clontech) was used to study possible interactions between Vangl1/Vangl2 proteins and different domains of Dishevelled. The procedures used for these studies were exactly as described by the manufacturer (Clontech). The system is based on the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109, which is engineered to have three different reporters, namely ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ (cytoplasmic β-galactosidase and secreted α-galactosidase) under the control of distinct GAL4 upstream regulatory sequences derived from the GAL2, GAL1, and MEL1 gene promoters, respectively. These three reporters yield strong and specific response to GAL4, and the simultaneous use of ADE2 and HIS3 as selectable markers eliminates false positives. The system also includes two plasmid vectors: pGBKT7 (Kanr, TRP1, and GAL4DBD c-Myc-tagged) and pGADT7 (Ampr, LEU2, and GAL4AD HA-tagged) that direct the production of recombinant proteins consisting of independent fusions to the DNA binding domain (DBD) or activation domain (AD) of GAL4. The two test plasmids are introduced by transformation into either AH109 (MATa) or Y187 (MATα), both strains auxotrophs for leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Individual pGBKT7 and pGADT7 constructs were transformed into yeast cells using a lithium acetate transformation procedure, and expression of the corresponding recombinant GAL4 proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with either anti-c-Myc (9E10, BAbCO) or anti-HA (16B12, BAbCO) mouse monoclonal antibodies. Possible reconstituted GAL4 activity was tested in diploids obtained by mating AH109 and Y187 transformants positive for expression of the test GAL4 fusions followed by plating on synthetic medium (SD) of various stringencies: low stringency lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD-Trp/-Leu), medium stringency lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (SD-His/-Trp/-Leu), and high stringency lacking adenine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (SD-Ade/-His/-Trp/-Leu). Substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) was used to visualize LacZ-producing clones directly on the plates. Protein-protein interactions were evaluated by assessing growth of diploid cells in solid medium after 72 h at 30 °C. Cell Lines and Transfections—To study possible interactions of Vangl1/2 proteins with Dvls in mammalian cells, pCB6-Vangl1, pCB6-Vangl2, and pCMV-Dvl1/2/3 (human cytomegalovirus promotor/enhancer) were introduced by transient transfection into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells using the commercial reagent LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Control pCB6 plasmid DNA was used to adjust the total amount of transfected DNA to 4 μg/plate. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed in PLC buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgC2, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin and aprotinin (each at 10 μg/ml), and sodium vanadate (200 μm). These lysates were prepared on ice and stored frozen or used immediately for co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assays—For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, lysates from transiently transfected HEK293 cells (500 μl) were incubated with either 1 μg of appropriate mouse monoclonal antibodies Dvl1 (3F12), Dvl2 (10B5), Dvl3 (4D3) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with 1:250 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-Vangl1 and anti-Vangl2 antisera (see below) together with 25 μl of a slurry of Protein A/G coupled to agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 16 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Protein A/G beads were washed twice by centrifugation at 4 °C in a cold buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin, followed by two additional washes in the same buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Immune complexes were eluted by incubation of the protein A/G beads in 2× sample buffer (2% SDS, 2 m β2-mercaptoethanol) at 100 °C, 10 min. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-containing acrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-Vangl1 and anti-Vangl2 antibodies. A portion of each cell lysate (1/20) was resolved on PAGE-SDS and immunoblotted with anti-Dvl or anti-Vangl1/2 antibodies to control for input loading. For GST pull-down assays, GST-Vangl1, GST-Vangl2, and GST (from empty pGEX4T) fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli Bl21cells. Cell growth, induction conditions, cell lysis, and isolation of GST fusions by affinity chromatography were exactly as described by the manufacturer of the pGEX4T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). GST-fused proteins were stored on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at -80 °C. Equal amounts of GST-Vangl1, GST-Vangl2, and control GST proteins on beads (with respect to protein concentration) were mixed with either recombinant Dvl proteins produced by transient transfection in HEK293 cells (see above) or with Dvl proteins present in cell lysates from E13.5 mouse embryos prepared with PLC buffer. Mixtures were rotated at 4 °C for 4–16 h, washed five times with cold 50 mm Tris, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of each leupeptin and aprotinin, and eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies Dvl1 (3F12), Dvl2 (10B5), Dvl3 (4D3), and GST (B-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody Production—Vangl1 (14–70 aa) and Vangl2 (12–64 aa) polypeptides fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were used as immunogens to raise polyclonal rabbit sera in male New Zealand White rabbits, as described previously (40Vidal S.M. Pinner E. Lepage P. Gauthier S. Gros P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3559-3568PubMed Google Scholar). The Vangl1 and Vangl2 polypeptides were cloned into the pQE-40 (Qiagen) expression vector for production of Vangl1/2 fusion proteins containing six consecutive histidines and a portion of dihydrofolate reductase (6-His-DFHR) to be used for purification of anti-Vangl1 and anti-Vangl2 antibodies by affinity chromatography, as we described (41Gruenheid S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Vangl1 and Vangl2 polypeptides were amplified by RT-PCR using the following primers: pGST-Vangl1ab: 5′-CAAGAAGGATCCTACTCAAGCCATTCCAAAAAATC-3′ (BamH1) and 5′-CAAGAGGAATTCCTGAACTTCCTCTGCGCCTGT-3′ (EcoR1); pGST-Vangl2ab: 5′-CAAGAAGGATCCTATTCCTACAAGTCGG (BamH1) and 5′-CAAGAGGAATTCCCTCGTGGACTCATTG-3′ (EcoR1); pDFHR-Vangl1: 5′-CAAGAAGGTACCTACTCAAGCCATTCCAAAAAATC-3′ (KpnI) and 5′-CAAGAGCTGCAGCTGAACTTCCTCTGCGCCTGT-3′ (PstI); pDFHR-Vangl2: 5′-CAAGAAGGTACCTATTCCT"
https://openalex.org/W2044163971,"Clustering neurotransmitter receptors at the synapse is crucial for efficient neurotransmission. Here we identify a Caenorhabditis elegans locus, lev-10, required for postsynaptic aggregation of ionotropic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). lev-10 mutants were identified on the basis of weak resistance to the anthelminthic drug levamisole, a nematode-specific cholinergic agonist that activates AChRs present at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) resulting in muscle hypercontraction and death at high concentrations1,2,3. In lev-10 mutants, the density of levamisole-sensitive AChRs at NMJs is markedly reduced, yet the number of functional AChRs present at the muscle cell surface remains unchanged. LEV-10 is a transmembrane protein localized to cholinergic NMJs and required in body-wall muscles for AChR clustering. We also show that the LEV-10 extracellular region, containing five predicted CUB domains and one LDLa domain, is sufficient to rescue AChR aggregation in lev-10 mutants. This suggests a mechanism for AChR clustering that relies on extracellular protein–protein interactions. Such a mechanism is likely to be evolutionarily conserved because CUB/LDL transmembrane proteins similar to LEV-10, but lacking any assigned function, are expressed in the mammalian nervous system and might be used to cluster ionotropic receptors in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2154907719,"Genes encoding proteins with PYRIN/PAAD/DAPIN domains, a nucleotide binding fold (NACHT), and leucine rich repeats have recently been recognized as important mediators in autoimmune inflammatory disorders. Here we characterize the expression and function of a member of the PYRIN and NACHT domain (PAN) family, PAN1 (also known as NALP2 and PYPAF2). PAN1 protein expression is regulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferons (IFNβ and IFNγ) in THP-1 macrophage cells. In gene transfection studies PAN1 manifests an inhibitory influence on NF-κB activation induced by various pro-inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor TNFα and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Gene transfer-mediated elevations in PAN1 protein also suppressed activation of IκB kinases induced by inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, reducing endogenous levels of PAN1 using small interfering RNA enhanced LPS-induced production of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), an NF-κB-dependent gene. We also show here that PAN1 binds via its PYRIN domain to ASC, an adapter protein involved in caspase-1 activation. This binding is disrupted by mutation of the α1 helix of ASC. In gene transfer experiments PAN1 enhances caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in collaboration with ASC. Conversely, reducing endogenous levels of PAN1 using small interfering RNA significantly reduced LPS-induced secretion of IL-1β in monocytes.

PYRIN domains serve as homotypic protein interaction modules, creating a network of protein associations mediated by PYRIN-PYRIN interactions. The human genome contains at least 19 genes encoding PYRIN domain proteins (8Reed J.C. Doctor K. Rojas A. Zapata J.M. Stehlik C. Fiorentino L. Damiano J. Roth W. Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Marusawa H.

NF-κB family transcription factors play critical roles in regulating expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, including certain cytokines, lymphokines, immunoglobulins, and leukocyte adhesion proteins in mammals. NF-κBs exist in the cytoplasm in inactive form sequestered by inhibitory proteins called inhibitor of NF-κB(IκB). Proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBs is linked to their phosphorylation by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of two related kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, and a scaffold subunit IKKγ (NEMO). Phosphorylation of IκBs triggers their polyubiquitination and degradation, thus freeing NF-κB-family transcription factors to enter the nucleus and transactivate promoters of various target genes. Some PYRIN-family proteins have been shown to associate with the IKK complex, affecting activation of NF-κB (12Stehlik C. Krajewska M. Welsh K. Krajewski S. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Biochem.

Alternatively, ASC or NAC (NALP1) conceivably could connect to IKKγ via Cardinal/TUCAN/CARD8/NDPP/Dakar, which can bind ASC and NAC (NALP1) 2J. M. Bruey and J. C. Reed, unpublished observations.2J. M. Bruey and J. C. Reed, unpublished observations. and also reportedly binds IKKγ. However, other routes to IKK complex proteins must also exist since some PYRIN proteins, such as PAN2/NALP4/PYPAF4, associate with IKK proteins but apparently do not interact with ASC or NAC (NALP1) (14Fiorentino L.

It has been shown recently that Cryopyrin/PYPAF1/NALP3/CIAS1 can suppress TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of endogenous p65 and that transcriptional activity of exogenous NF-κB p65 was also blocked by Cryopyrin (11O'Connor Jr., W.

Excessive production of IL-1β is implicated in various diseases, including septic shock, inflammatory bowl disease, autoimmune diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. PYRIN domain proteins have also been reported to induce activation of caspase-1, a cysteine protease responsible for proteolytic activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-interleukin-1β (Pro-IL-1β) is the best known substrate of caspase-1 (15Dinarello C.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Processing of pro-IL-1β is tightly controlled by various molecules that either inhibit or enhance activation of the zymogen (inactive) form of caspase-1. Cardiak (CARD-containing IL-1β-converting enzyme-associated kinase) also known as Rip2 (Rick) and Ipaf (caspase-1-activating protein related to Apaf-1) (also known as CLAN), for example, are known activators of pro-caspase-1, which bind pro-caspase-1 via CARD-CARD interactions, activating this protease by an induced proximity mechanism involving protein oligomerization (16Damiano J.S.

The bipartite adapter protein ASC uses its CARD to interact with the CARD of pro-caspase-1 and certain caspase-1 activators, whereas its PYRIN domain binds the PYRIN domains of various other proteins including Pyrin, Cryopyrin, and NAC (NALP1) (13Stehlik C.

Furthermore, PAN1 binds ASC, collaborating with this adapter protein in the regulation of IL-1β production, consistent with a recent report (6Agostini L. Martinon F. Burns K. McDermott M.F.

The siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. and prepared by annealing complementary sequences corresponding to region, (5′-AGUUGAGCAAGUUCAAGUAdTdT-3′, 5′-UCAACUCGUUCAAGUUCAUdTdT-3′) or GFP used as control (5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCGdTdT-3′, 5′-CGCGCGAAACAUCCUAAGCdTdT-3′). Antibodies—A polyclonal anti-PAN1 antiserum was generated by repeated immunization of rabbits with an 18-mer synthetic peptide NH2-CLKSFNKRKPLSLGITRKER-(amide) conjugated to maleimide-activated carrier proteins keyhole limpet hemocyanin and ovalbumin (Pierce). Epitope-specific antibodies for FLAG, HA, or Myc tag were obtained from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Polyclonal anti-ASC (AL177) was obtained from Apotech. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells (5 × 105–1 × 106) were lysed in isotonic lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaF, 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing 1× protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science)). Clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using agarose-conjugated anti-c-Myc, anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and anti-HA antibodies. After incubation at 4 °C for 4–12 h, immune complexes were washed four times in lysis buffer, separated by SDS/PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, anti-HA, or anti-PAN1 antibodies as indicated in conjunction with ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, cell lysates (10% volume) were run alongside immune complexes. Alternatively, lysates were directly analyzed by immunoblotting after normalization for total protein content. NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—Typically, 105 HEK293 cells, cultured in 24-well plates in 5% serum, were transiently transfected with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA (normalized for total DNA) including 144 ng of pNF-κB -LUC (Clontech) and 6 ng of a Renilla luciferase gene driven by a constitutive thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (pRL-TK; Promega). Lysates were analyzed using the dual luciferase kit (Promega). Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 8 h before analysis. IL-1β Secretion Assay—IL-1β secreted into culture supernatants of HEK293N cells transiently transfected in 24-well plates was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercial kit (R&D Systems); data were normalized for cell numbers, and assays were performed in triplicate. Caspase Activity Assay—HEK293N cells were transiently transfected in 6-well dishes, and at 24 h post-transfection cells were suspended in caspase lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and normalized for protein content. Typically, 15–25 μg of lysates were analyzed for protease activity by continuously measuring the release of fluorigenic substrate Ac-YVAD-aminofluoromethylcoumarin product from (Bachem) at 37 °C as described (24Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using the PRISM Statistics software package; employing an unpaired t test method. Characterization of PAN1 mRNA and Protein Expression— The predicted PAN1 protein contains a PYRIN, NACHT, and eight LRR domains (Fig. 1A). Using reverse transcription-PCR, we surveyed adult and fetal human tissues for the presence of PAN1 transcripts (Fig. 1B). First-strand cDNAs generated from equivalent amounts of RNA from a variety of normal human tissues were used as templates to amplify a region of the PAN1 cDNA corresponding to the NACHT domain. This analysis revealed that PAN1 is expressed at highest levels in lungs, placenta, and thymus, with detectable expression also observed in ovary, intestine, and brain. To assess expression at the protein level, an antiserum was raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide of the human PAN1 as an immunogen. This antibody detected the 110-kDa PAN1 protein, which was expressed in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1C). This antibody did not cross-react with other PAN-family proteins tested, PAN2 or NAC (data not shown). Using the anti-PAN1 antiserum, we assessed expression of the endogenous PAN1 protein in various cancer cell lines by immunoblotting. Lysates were normalized for total protein content before analysis. The relative levels of PAN1 protein varied widely among the tumor lines tested, with highest levels found in MCF7 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer, Caco2 colon cancer, and UACC62 melanoma cells (Fig. 1D). Regulation of PAN1 Protein Expression by Inflammatory Mediators—We examined the effect of pro-inflammatory stimuli on PAN1 protein expression in THP-1 macrophages by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Culturing THP-1 macrophages with either type I or type II interferons resulted in transient elevations in PAN1 protein expression, which peaked at 4–8 h after treatment. Comparisons with IFI16, another PYRIN domain-containing protein known to be induced by interferons (25Johnstone R.W. Kershaw M.H. Trapani J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11924-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), served as a positive control (Fig. 2, A and B). Although culturing THP-1 macrophages with TLR4 ligand LPS induced increases in PAN1 protein levels, a TLR9 ligand consisting of a CpG oligonucleotide did not (26Hertzog P.J. O'Neill L.A.

Thus, some but not all TLR-family receptors also induce PAN1 protein expression in these cells. Probing blots with anti-β-actin antibody confirmed loading of equivalent amounts of protein for each sample. By confocal microscopy, the PAN1 was localized predominantly to the cytosol, although occasional cells also contained nuclear immunostaining (data not shown). PAN1 Inhibits NF-κB Activation by Diverse Stimuli—The rapid induction of PAN1 by immunostimulatory molecules led us to hypothesize that PAN1/NALP2 may play a role in mediating inflammatory responses. Because NF-κB is intimately linked to inflammation (for review, see Ref. 32Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar), we analyzed NF-κB activity in the presence of transfected PAN1. Transfection of various amounts of PAN1-encoding plasmid DNA into HEK293 cells caused dose-dependent suppression of TNFα and CD40-induced NF-κB activity, as measured by reporter gene assays (Fig. 3, A and B). This suppression of NF-κB activity was specific in as much as PAN1 did not suppress activity of other transcription factors, such as β-catenin/T cell factor and p53 (Fig. 3, C and D; and data not shown). To map where the PAN1 affects the NF-κB activation pathway, NF-κB activity was induced by transient transfection of plasmids encoding various intracellular signal transducers that operate within cytokine receptor pathways, leading to phosphorylation of IκB, a key event required for NF-κB release. We performed similar reporter gene assays, stimulating cells with the cytokine IL-1β or transfecting cells with NF-κB-inducing proteins such as RIP, TRAF6, TRAF2, Bcl-10, TLR4, IKKα, IKKβ (Fig. 3, C and D), and NIK, IKKepsilon (IKKi), and TBK1 panel (Fig. 3E). In every case examined transient overexpression of PAN1 suppressed NF-κB activity. In contrast, co-expression of PAN1 did not suppress reporter gene activation induced by NF-κB-p65. Thus, PAN1 blocks upstream of NF-κB, apparently at the level of the IKK complex. To preliminarily explore the physiological significance of these findings, we compared the levels of endogenous PAN1 protein produced in differentiated THP-1 monocytes before and after LPS treatment, with the levels of PAN1 produced by transfection in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3F). Plasmid-derived expression of PAN1 was also compared with endogenous levels of PAN1 found in tumor cell lines such as MCF7, which was determined to express high levels of endogenous PAN1. All samples were normalized for total protein content before analysis by immunoblotting. These studies showed that the levels of PAN1 produced by transfection of 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA were comparable with the levels of endogenous PAN1 found in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytic cells. Probing the blots with anti-actin confirmed loading of comparable amounts of protein for all samples (Fig. 3F). Thus, the levels of PAN1 proteins produced by gene transfection are within the physiologically relevant range. PAN1 Associates with the IKK Complex—Because the functional analysis of PAN1 suggested that it suppresses NF-κB activity induced by overexpression of IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 3), we explored whether PAN1 might associate with components of the IKK complex. Using lysates from HEK293 cells in which PAN1 was co-expressed with HA epitope-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed, revealing association of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ with PAN1 (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot analysis of the lysates confirmed production of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ at comparable levels. In contrast to IKK components, PAN1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with other proteins kinases such as AKT or JNK1, demonstrating specificity. To extend these co-immunoprecipitation studies to analysis of the endogenous proteins, we used lysates from hematopoietic cell lines in which elevations of PAN1 protein were induced by pro-inflammatory agents, such as LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytic cells and INFγ-stimulated Jurkat T-cells. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-IKKγ monoclonal antibody or control IgG, and the resulting immunecomplexes were immunoblotted using anti-PAN1 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 4B, PAN1 was readily detected in association with IKKγ but not control immune-complexes. As expected, IKKγ immune-complexes also contained associated endogenous IKKα and IKKβ, as revealed by immunoblotting. Similar results were obtained using anti-IKKα instead of anti-IKKγ to pull down PAN1 (not shown). We conclude, therefore, that endogenous PAN1 associates with the endogenous components of the IKK complex, at least in hematopoietic cells stimulated with pro-inflammatory agents. Overexpression of PAN1 Inhibits IκBα Degradation Induced by TNFα—Active IKK induces phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB-family proteins (33Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). We, therefore, evaluated the effects of PAN1 on levels of endogenous IκBα in cells after treatment with IKK activator, TNFα. For these experiments breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1 was stably transfected with PAN1-encoding (ZR-PAN1) or control (ZR-NEO) plasmids, then stimulated for various times with TNFα followed by analysis of lysates by immunoblot using anti-IκBα antibody (Fig. 5A). In ZR-NEO cells TNFα stimulation caused the disappearance of IκBα protein after 15 min. In contrast, IκBα protein levels were sustained at detectable levels in ZR-PAN1 cells even after TNFα treatment. Clones of ZR-75-1 cells stably expressing PAN1 demonstrated ∼70% reduced activation of a transfected NF-κB reporter gene in response to TNFα, consistent with reduced degradation of IκBα (data not shown). SiRNA-mediated Knock-down of Endogenous PAN1 Expression Increases LPS-mediated Induction of NF-κB Target Gene—Several target genes of NF-κB-family transcription factors have been identified, including the cell adhesion protein ICAM-1. We used the technique of siRNA to reduce PAN1 expression in THP-1 cells, assessing the impact on LPS-medi-ated induction of endogenous ICAM-1 by immunoblotting. For these experiments, a 19-bp double-strand RNA corresponding to PAN1 nucleotides 5′-AGUUGAGCAAGUUCAAGUAdTdT-3′ was introduced into 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophages using a GFP siRNA as a negative control. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that siRNA directed against PAN1 mRNA substantially reduced the levels of PAN1 protein in THP-1 cells before and after treatment with LPS, whereas GFP control siRNA did not (Fig. 5B). When normalized for β-actin levels, the reductions in PAN1 protein levels were determined to be ∼60–70%. LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression was also reduced in PAN1 siRNA-treated THP-1 macrophages by approximately half compared with GFP siRNA-treated THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that endogenous PAN1 is capable of suppressing LPS-induced expression of endogenous NF-κB target genes. PAN1 Inhibits NF-κB Induction via Its PYRIN Domain—To map the domain in PAN1 required for suppression of NF-κB, a series of Myc-tagged deletion constructs of PAN1 were generated (Fig. 6A) and tested for their ability to suppress TNFα-mediated induction of NF-κB activity using reporter gene assays. Specifically, we compared the effects of full-length PAN1 with truncation mutants containing only the PYRIN, NACHT, or LRR domains and with mutants lacking the PYRIN or LRR domains. The plasmids encoding these PAN1 mutants were then transiently expressed in HEK293 cel"
https://openalex.org/W2003371798,"Plant mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) is activated by superoxide suggesting that it may function to minimize mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. However, the precise mechanism of superoxide activation and the exact function of UCP in plants are not known. We demonstrate that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a product of lipid peroxidation, and a structurally related compound, trans-retinal, stimulate a proton conductance in potato mitochondria that is inhibitable by GTP (a characteristic of UCP). Proof that the effects of HNE and trans-retinal are mediated by UCP is provided by examination of proton conductance in transgenic plants overexpressing UCP. These experiments demonstrate that the mechanism of activation of UCP is conserved between animals and plants and imply a conservation of function. Mitochondria from transgenic plants overexpressing UCP were further studied to provide insight into function. Experimental conditions were designed to mimic a bioenergetic state that might be found in vivo (mitochondria were supplied with pyruvate as well as tricarboxylic cycle acids at in vivo cytosolic concentrations and an exogenous ATP sink was established). Under such conditions, an increase in UCP protein content resulted in a modest but significant decrease in the rate of superoxide production. In addition, 13C-labeling experiments revealed an increase in the conversion of pyruvate to citrate as a result of increased UCP protein content. These results demonstrate that under simulated in vivo conditions, UCP is active and suggest that UCP may influence not only mitochondrial ROS production but also tricarboxylic acid cycle flux.

Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins are integral membrane proteins that reside in the inner mitochondrial membrane and belong to a large family of mitochondrial anion carriers (1Picault N. Hodges M. Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They catalyze a proton conductance that results in the dissipation of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. As such, they partially uncouple electron transport from ATP synthesis. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; HNE, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal; TPMP+, methyltriphenylphosphonium; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; AOX, alternative oxidase; CAT, carboxyatractyloside; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; TES, N-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethane sulfonic acid; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate. was first identified in mammalian brown adipose tissue, where it mediates an uncoupled respiration of fatty acids to generate heat for thermogenesis (2Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It makes sense, therefore, that UCP1 is activated by fatty acids, and indeed a proton conductance that is stimulated by fatty acids and inhibited by nucleotides (which act as inhibitors of UCPs) has long been seen as diagnostic of UCP activity (3Klingenberg M. Echtay K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A number of homologues of UCP1 exist in animals (2Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) as well as higher plants (4Hourton-Cabassa C. Rita Matos A. Zachowski A. Moreau F. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), fungi and more primitive organisms (5Sluse F.E. Jarmuszkiewicz W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The function of these homologues is much debated, but their expression in non-thermogenic tissues means that it is unlikely to be related to heat production. A major advance in our understanding of uncoupling protein function was the discovery that fatty acids do not directly activate UCP. Instead, it was shown that exogenously generated superoxide (in the presence of fatty acids) activates UCPs in both animals (6Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) and plants (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To activate UCP, superoxide must be present in the matrix of the mitochondrion, and thus exogenous superoxide must somehow cross the mitochondrial inner membrane (8Echtay K.S. Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Talbot D.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Superoxide is an upstream component of the activation pathway of UCP. The end point of this pathway appears to be products of lipid peroxidation such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) that contain reactive alkenal groups (9Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Such compounds are potent activators of animal UCPs. A mechanism has been proposed in which superoxide in the matrix reacts with free Fe2+ (which is possibly formed as a result of superoxide attack of iron sulfur-containing proteins such as aconitase) to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. This radical initiates carbon-centered lipid radical formation leading to lipid peroxidation that ultimately results in aldehyde degradation products such as HNE that activate UCP (10Murphy M.P. Echtay K.S. Blaikie F.H. Asin-Cayuela J. Cocheme H.M. Green K. Buckingham J. Taylor E.R. Hurrell F. Hughes G. Miwa S. Cooper C.E. Svistunenko D.A. Smith R.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48534-48545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Given that mild uncoupling of mitochondria dramatically reduces superoxide formation by the electron transport chain (11Miwa S. Brand M.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1300-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this pathway provides an elegant feedback mechanism by which UCP may act to limit the extent of ROS production in mitochondria. Although plant UCPs have been shown to be activated by superoxide (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is not known whether this superoxide activation proceeds via the HNE pathway that occurs in animals. It is important to establish whether HNE activation of UCP is a feature that is conserved during evolution from plants to animals or whether it evolved since the divergence of the two kingdoms. The former would imply a conservation of function between plant and animal UCP, and thus investigations into the role of UCP in plants may have implications for animal UCP1 homologue function. The latter case (i.e. superoxide, but not HNE activation of UCP is conserved between plants and animals) may imply that UCP function in animals is more specifically related to lipid peroxidation rather than ROS per se. A relevant suggestion in this regard is that UCP might function as a transporter of oxidized fatty acid molecules (12Goglia F. Skulachev V.P. Faseb J. 2003; 17: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) although there is not, as yet, any experimental evidence to support this idea. Here, we investigate whether alkenal products of lipid peroxidation activate UCP in isolated potato tuber mitochondria. By using GTP-inhibitable proton conductance as a measure of UCP activity, or by quantifying proton conductance in mitochondria from transgenic potato plants with increased UCP protein content (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we conclusively demonstrate that alkenal-containing molecules, such as HNE, activate potato UCP. This result suggests a conservation of the basic mechanism of UCP activation between plants and animals. Further experiments on mitochondria from transgenic plants with increased UCP suggest that under simulated in vivo bioenergetic conditions, sufficient activating molecules are generated for UCP to be active. The presence of increased UCP protein content resulted in a modest decrease in the rate of ROS production by isolated mitochondria, and also stimulated the conversion of pyruvate to citrate by the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We suggest that mild uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain from ATP synthesis as a consequence of UCP activity may not only reduce the rate of mitochondrial ROS production but also may affect tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Chemicals—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals, biochemicals and isotopes were from Sigma-Aldrich. Carboxyatractyloside (CAT) was from Merck Biosciences Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). Plant Material—Potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L c.v. Desirée) were either purchased from the local supermarket or transgenic tubers were harvested from plants growing in controlled environment glass-houses. Transgenic potato plants overexpressing StUCP, lines 18 and 63, (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were grown by planting sprouted tubers in 150-mm diameter pots containing general purpose compost and sand (2:1). The plants were maintained in a glasshouse at 16–25 °C with a 16-h photoperiod of natural daylight supplemented to give a minimum irradiance of 150 μE m–2 s–1. Tubers were harvested after 10 weeks and stored at 22 °C for at least 1 week prior to use. All experiments were done on both transgenic plant lines (lines 18 and 63) but for clarity, only data from line 18 are shown. Isolation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from potato tubers using differential centrifugation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Measurement of Proton Conductance—Proton conductance was determined by simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential using electrodes sensitive to oxygen and the potential-dependent probe, TPMP+ as described previously (13Brand M.D. Brown G. Cooper C. Bioenergetics—A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). A reaction chamber of capacity 2 ml was constructed such that the mitochondrial suspension was in contact with both electrodes. Mitochondria (400 μg) were resuspended in 2 ml of assay medium (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 1 μm oligomycin, and 0.1 μm nigericin. The electrode was calibrated with sequential additions of TPMP+ to a final concentration of 5 μm. Then NADH was added to a concentration of 1 mm to start the reaction. Membrane potential was progressively inhibited by the addition of KCN to a final concentration of between 0.6–20 μm. At the end of each run, 2 μm FCCP was added to dissipate the membrane potential completely, releasing all the TPMP+ into the medium and allowing correction for any small electrode drift. GTP (final concentration, 2 mm), HNE (final concentration 30 μm) (Merck Biosciences Ltd., Nottingham, UK) and trans-retinal (final concentration, 5 μm) were added as indicated. Assay of H2O2 Production by Isolated Mitochondria—Hydrogen peroxide was measured using the peroxidase-dependent conversion of Amplex Red (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) to the fluorescent compound, resorufin. The assay consisted of the following in a final volume of 200 μl: 50 μm Amplex Red, 10 units superoxide dismutase (VWR International, Lutterworth, UK), 1.2 units of horseradish peroxidase, 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm Tes-KOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgSO4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 20 mm glucose, 0.3 mm NAD+, 0.1 mm ADP, 0.1 mm TPP, 0.15 units/ml of hexokinase (Roche Applied Science, Lewes, East Sussex, UK), and mitochondria (30 μg of protein). The background rate of H2O2 production was determined by measuring the rate of accumulation of resorufin by fluorescence spectrophotometry (excitation at 563 nm, emission at 587 nm) at a temperature of 25 °C. Respiratory substrates were then added (10 mm pyruvate, 2.1 mm citrate, 1.3 mm succinate, 0.6 mm malate, 0.02 mm fumarate, and 0.02 mm isocitrate) and the rate of hydrogen peroxide production measured. The rate was measured over a time period of 15–30 min after addition of substrates (such that the small amount of ADP added to the incubation medium to initiate ATP synthesis was used up and ADP was produced by the hexokinase-regenerating system). 13C NMR Spectroscopy—Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra of low density mitochondrial suspensions were recorded at either 75.46 MHz on a Bruker CXP 300 spectrometer or 150.9 MHz on a Varian Unity Inova 600 spectrometer, in both cases using a 10-mm diameter broadband probe head. The suspension was oxygenated with an air-lift (14Fox G.G. Ratcliffe R.G. Southon T.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 82: 360-366Google Scholar), and NMR spectra were recorded in 15-min blocks over a period of 4 h using acquisition conditions similar to those described elsewhere (15Aubert S. Bligny R.

Mitochondria were suspended at a density of 70–100 μg of mitochondrial protein per ml in a buffer containing 0.2 m mannitol, 0.1 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm KH2PO4 in 10% D2O, corrected to pH 7.2 with KOH.

Measurement of Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Enzymes—the maximal catalytic activities of aconitase, citrate synthase, fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase in isolated mitochondria were determined using NAD(P)H-linked spectrophotometric assays (17Jenner H.L.

Potato UCP Is Activated by Products of Lipid Peroxidation— The lipid peroxidation product, HNE, is a potent activator of mammalian UCP (9Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that HNE is the end point of an activation pathway that begins with the production of mitochondrial superoxide (10Murphy M.P. Echtay K.S. Blaikie F.H. Asin-Cayuela J. Cocheme H.M. Green K. Buckingham J. Taylor E.R. Hurrell F. Hughes G. Miwa S. Cooper C.E. Svistunenko D.A. Smith R.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48534-48545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Superoxide has also been demonstrated to activate UCP activity in plants (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is of interest, therefore, to establish whether the mechanism of superoxide activation of UCP is conserved between plants and animals. To this end, we investigated the effect of HNE on UCP-mediated proton conductance in isolated potato mitochondria (Fig. 1A). Proton conductance kinetics were determined as membrane potential was titrated with KCN. Oligomycin was added to inhibit ATP synthase activity such that the rate of oxygen consumption was proportional to the rate of proton leak (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus respiration rate gives an indirect measure of proton conductance that is dependent upon the exact H+/O stoichiometry. To avoid systematic errors as a result of erroneous assumptions about H+/O stoichiometry, we have not calculated an actual proton conductance rate, but instead present all data as respiration rate. Thus, when proton conductance rate is referred to, it is important to be aware that we are actually presenting the proportional parameter of respiration rate. The kinetic plot of proton conductance as the membrane potential was varied showed that the addition of micromolar concentrations of HNE resulted in a substantial increase in proton conductance rate in comparison to the basal proton leak (Fig. 1A). The results are not complicated by the presence of the alternative oxidase (AOX) since AOX is present only at extremely low levels in potato tubers (7Considine M.J. Goodman M. Echtay K.S. Laloi M. Whelan J. Brand M.D. Sweetlove L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22298-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). At a membrane potential of 130 mV, respiration rate in the presence of HNE was 268 ± 37 nmol of O min–1 (mg of protein)–1 and in the absence of HNE, 128 ± 24 (p < 0.05, Student's t test). This effect was maximal at a concentration of 30 μm HNE. Preincubation of mitochondria with 2 mm GTP decreased the stimulatory effect of HNE on proton conductance. This suggests that the stimulation of proton conductance by HNE is primarily mediated by activation of UCP. This activation does not require the presence of free fatty acids, either exogenous or endogenous (the results were not altered by the addition of BSA to the incubation medium; data not shown). All these assays were done in the presence of 100 μm carboxyatractyloside (CAT), a specific inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). This inhibitor was added because the adenine nucleotide translocase can also catalyze a proton conductance and has been shown to be activated by HNE (9Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In the absence of carboxyatractyloside, the HNE-stimulated proton conductance of potato mitochondria was not inhibitable by GTP (data not shown). Under these conditions, therefore, it appears that ANT is the dominant protein that contributes to proton conductance, and the effect of UCP is masked. For this reason, carboxyatractyloside was included in all subsequent experiments unless otherwise stated. In mammalian mitochondria, the structural requirement of the UCP activator molecule is the presence of a reactive 2-alkenal group (9Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). If this is also the case for plant UCP, then one would expect that other 2-alkenal-containing molecules would also activate plant UCP. trans-Retinal is structurally distinct from HNE but also contains a reactive 2-alkenal group (see Fig. 1) and has been shown to activate mammalian UCP (9Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The addition of trans-retinal to potato mitochondria caused an increase in the proton conductance rate (Fig. 1B) although the extent of the increase was less than observed with HNE. At a membrane potential of 130 mV, respiration rate (proton conductance) in the presence of trans-retinal was 193 ± 22 nmol of atomic oxygen min–1 (mg of protein)–1 and in the absence of trans-retinal, 135 ± 21 (p < 0.05, Student's t test). The stimulation of respiration by trans-retinal was abolished by preincubation of mitochondria with GTP. The fact that GTP inhibits the effects of both HNE and trans-retinal on proton conductance strongly suggests the involvement of UCP (as GTP inhibits UCP activity). To formally prove that 2-alkenal-containing compounds activate plant UCP, the effect of these compounds on proton conductance of mitochondria from transgenic potato plants overexpressing the potato UCP gene StUCP was investigated. In confirmation of the observations presented in Fig. 1, both HNE and trans-retinal increased the rate of proton conductance above the basal rate in wild-type potato mitochondria (Fig. 2, A and B) although the increase was smaller than in previous experiments (see Fig. 1). One explanation for this discrepancy may be the source of material. In the experiments shown in Fig. 1, mitochondria were isolated from potatoes purchased from a local supermarket, whereas the wild-type mitochondria used in the experiments shown in Fig. 2 were isolated from tubers harvested from plants grown in a controlled environment glasshouse. In the latter case, tubers were used within 2 weeks of harvesting. In the former, the storage history of the tubers is unknown, but it is likely that they had undergone a considerable period of cold storage. Since cold storage is known to induce UCP protein content in potato tubers (18Calegario F.F. Cosso R.G. Fagian M.M. Almeida F.V. Jardim W.F. Jezek P. Arruda P. Vercesi A.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it may be that there is an increased UCP content in the supermarket potatoes in comparison to the greenhouse potatoes, and this could be responsible for the greater effect of HNE and trans-retinal in mitochondria from the former. This hypothesis was confirmed when the UCP content of mitochondria from the respective potatoes was examined by Western blot (Fig. 3). The intensity of the signal is greater in mitochondria from supermarket potatoes than from glasshouse-grown wild type (quantification of the signal on the Western blot gave the following band intensities: supermarket potatoes, 1390; glasshouse-grown wild type, 995 (arbitrary units)). In contrast to the single band visible in the latter, there appears to be a doublet in the mitochondria from the supermarket tubers. It is not known what the origin of the second band is, but its presence emphasizes the difference between the two sources of tuber.Fig. 3Western blot showing UCP protein content of mitochondria used for proton conductance measurements (see legends to Figs.1and2). Lane 1, pooled sample of wild-type mitochondria from which the proton conductance data shown in Fig. 1 were derived. Lane 2, pooled sample of wild-type mitochondria from which the proton conductance data shown in Fig. 2, A and B were derived. Lane 3, pooled sample of mitochondria from transgenic potatoes overexpressing StUCP (relative to the comparable wild type shown in lane 2) from which the proton conductance data shown in Fig. 2, C and D were derived.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The level of UCP protein in mitochondria from transgenic tubers overexpressing StUCP is much higher than the comparable wild type (band intensities: wild type, 995; transgenic line, 2407(arbitrary units)), confirming previous observations of this transgenic line (7Considine M.J.

The stimulatory effect of HNE and trans-retinal in mitochondria from these transgenic tubers was markedly increased in comparison to wild type confirming that 2-alkenal-containing compounds activate UCP (compare Fig. 2, C and D with A and B). At a membrane potential of 180 mV, respiration rate (proton conductance) in the presence of HNE was 50 ± 7 nmol of atomic oxygen min–1 (mg of protein)–1 in wild-type mitochondria and 238 ± 36 nmol of atomic oxygen min–1 (mg of protein)–1 in mitochondria from tubers overexpressing StUCP (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Similarly, in the presence of trans-retinal, respiration rate (proton conductance) was 50 ± 14 nmol of atomic oxygen min–1 (mg of protein)–1 in wild-type mitochondria and 163 ± 39 nmol of atomic oxygen min–1 (mg of protein)–1 in mitochondria from tubers overexpressing StUCP (p < 0.05, Student's t test). The stimulatory effect of both HNE and retinal in the transgenic background was inhibited by GTP but for the sake of clarity, the data is not shown. The effect of HNE and trans-retinal on proton conductance was similar in a second independent transgenic line overexpressing StUCP (data not shown). Increased UCP Protein Content Affects Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Flux in Isolated Mitochondria under Simulated in Vivo Bioenergetic Conditions—It is evident that reactive oxygen species and alkenal products of lipid peroxidation activate both animal and plant UCP when applied exogenously to mitochondria held in an artificial resting bioenergetic state (where ATP synthesis is prevented by absence of ADP and by use of the ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin). However, it is not clear whether UCP is activated in mitochondria that are actively synthesizing ATP. To investigate this and to assess the function of UCP in relation to mitochondrial metabolism, we established a system in which the metabolic activity of isolated mitochondria could be monitored in real time by 13C NMR. Isolated mitochondria were incubated in the sample chamber of the NMR spectrometer in a continuously oxygenated buffered solution. [3-13C]Pyruvate was introduced and 13C NMR spectra acquired every 15 min to monitor the metabolism of the labeled pyruvate. To spark the tricarboxylic acid cycle, unlabeled tricarboxylic acid cycle acids were added to the incubation medium at concentrations that are observed in the cytosol of potato tubers (16Farre E.M. Tiessen A. Roessner U. Geigenberger P. Trethewey R.N. Willmitzer L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). An ADP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm glucose and 0.1 units/ml hexokinase was also included. Nigericin, oligomycin, and carboxyatractyloside were not added. The amount of hexokinase required for maximal regeneration of ADP was established by titrating hexokinase amount and measuring respiration rate (data not shown). This system simulates in vivo conditions in which mitochondria are respiring pyruvate and in which there is a demand for ATP. The oxygen consumption rate was constant during the period of the experiment (Fig. 4A). 13C-Label from pyruvate accumulated in several tricarboxylic acid cycle acids (Fig. 4B). It is important to realize that because of the low volume of the mitochondrial matrix in the sample and its highly proteinaceous nature, it is not possible to detect 13C NMR si"

Erythrocytes are, together with kidney and liver, the main targets for copper toxicity. Here we report that both water and glycerol permeability of human AQP3 is inhibited by copper. Inhibition is fast, dose-dependent, and reversible. If copper is dissolved in carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer, the natural buffer system in our body, doses in the range of those observed in Wilson disease and in copper poisoning caused significant inhibition. AQP7, another aquaglyceroporin, was insensitive to copper. Three extracellular amino acid residues, Trp128, Ser152, and His241, were identified as responsible for the effect of copper on AQP3. We have previously shown that Ser152 is involved in regulation of AQP3 by pH. The fact that Ser152 mediates regulation of AQP3 by copper may explain the phenomenon of exquisite sensitivity of human erythrocytes to copper at acidic pH. When AQP3 was co-expressed with another AQP, only glycerol but not water permeability was inhibited by copper.

Copper is an essential trace element in the human body. It is present in the blood and is incorporated in several vital proteins, such as Cu,Zn-SOD, dopamine β-hydroxylase, ceruloplasmin, cytochrome c oxidase, etc. (recently reviewed in Ref. 1Shim H.

It is well established that erythrocytes are permeable for glycerol, but the molecular mechanism for this effect is still obscure. It is also well established that glycerol permeability of erythrocytes is extremely sensitive to copper. We have recently shown that AQP3 water permeability is sensitive to nickel (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we report that copper is a potent inhibitor of AQP3 permeability for glycerol and water. We expressed AQP3 in a human cell line and tested the effect of copper on glycerol and water permeability of the transfected cells. Three extracellular amino acid residues were found to be responsible for the copper sensitivity. We modeled the situation when AQP3 is co-expressed with another AQP, not permeable for glycerol, and found that only glycerol but not water permeability will be inhibited by copper in such cells. The results of this study provide a better understanding of processes that occur in severe copper metabolism defects and copper poisoning. cDNA Constructs—The constructs for expression of human AQP3 (wild type and mutants) and the long form of AQP4 have been described previously (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding full-length AQP3 and AQP4 were obtained by amplification from the human lung QUICK-Clone cDNA library (Clontech). cDNA encoding mouse AQP7 was a kind gift from J. M. Carbrey and P. Agre (Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The cDNA fragments were subcloned in-frame into the pEGFP-N2 vector for AQP3 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the COOH terminus into pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) for AQP3 and GFP expressed in the same cell as separate proteins and into the pEGFP-C2 vector for AQP4 and AQP7 tagged with GFP at NH2 termini. The point mutations in extracellular loops of human AQP3 were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using wild-type cDNA as a template and confirmed by sequence analysis of the whole insert. The transmembrane structure of human AQP3 was predicted using TMHMM Version 2.0 (14Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2b (subpassages 10–36, European Collection of Cell Cultures, Center for Applied Microbiology and Research, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) was cultured on coverslips (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) coated with collagen type I and fibronectin (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1; Invitrogen) containing 0.5 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. On the second day of culture the cells were transiently transfected with cDNA constructs (see above) using CLONfectin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Experiments were performed on the fourth day of culture. Pf Measurements—The water permeability (Pf) was measured using a method that we recently described in detail (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Zelenina M. Zelenin S. Bondar A.A. Brismar H. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F309-F318Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The method allows to determine the Pf in individual cells within the cell monolayer and to compare the Pf of cells that do and do not express GFP-tagged proteins. Briefly, the coverslips with the cells were mounted in a closed perfusion chamber (Focht Live Cell Chamber System, Bioptechs) on the stage of a Zeiss 410 invert laser scanning microscope, and the transfected cells were identified by the presence of GFP signal in the plasma membrane. Then the cells were loaded with calcein (Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands) by incubation for 5 min in solution containing 20 μm calcein-AM (acetoxymethyl ester of calcein) while the specimen remained on the stage of the microscope. The cells were superfused with isotonic solution (300 mosm) and scanned every 2 s to monitor changes in calcein fluorescence after the solution was switched to hypoosmotic (200 mosm). Isotonic solutions contained in: 137 mm NaCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm KCl, 10 mm buffering compound, pH 7.4. To obtain hypoosmotic solutions, concentration of NaCl was reduced to 87 mm. In experiments with CuSO4 and Pb(CH3COO)2 the pH of the solutions was buffered with Tricine; in experiments with NiCl2 and ZnCl2 the pH of the solutions was buffered with HEPES. The Pf value was calculated as we described previously (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Zelenina M. Zelenin S. Bondar A.A. Brismar H. Aperia A. Am. J.

The initial slope of the fluorescence curve (about 10 s after the switch of osmolarity) was used in the Pf calculations. Glycerol Permeability Measurements—To assess the glycerol permeability of the cells (P′gly), we used the same experimental setup as for the water permeability measurements described above. Calcein fluorescence was monitored before and after the switch of superfusion from isotonic solution containing 100 mm mannitol (100 mm mannitol, 87 mm NaCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm KCl, buffering compound 10, pH 7.4) to the same solution where mannitol was replaced by 100 mm glycerol. The initial slope of the fluorescence curve (about 10 s after the switch of osmolarity) was used as a measure of the glycerol permeability. Data Presentation and Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. A difference of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Water Permeability of AQP3 Is Down-regulated by Copper— Experiments were performed in a human epithelial cell line BEAS-2b that was transiently transfected with human AQP3 tagged with GFP at the COOH terminus to identify the cells that expressed AQP3. In control conditions, the water permeability in these cells was significantly higher compared with the surrounding untransfected cells (Fig. 1, a and b). When the measurements were repeated in the presence of 1 mm CuSO4, the water permeability of AQP3-positive cells decreased almost to the level of untransfected cells. After copper washout, the water permeability of AQP3-positive cells increased to the level observed in control conditions. In the same type of experiment, the water permeability of AQP3-positive cells was insensitive to lead acetate. Glycerol Permeability of AQP3 Is Down-regulated by Copper—Glycerol permeability of BEAS-2b cells that expressed AQP3 was significantly higher than permeability of untransfected cells (Fig. 2). The rate of swelling in glycerol-containing solution was significantly decreased in AQP3-positive cells in the presence of 1 mm CuSO4. The same effect was observed in the presence of NiCl2. However, the glycerol permeability of AQP3-positive cells was not influenced by divalent zinc and lead. Neither of the metals influenced the glycerol permeability of untransfected cells. Both water permeability and glycerol permeability of AQP3-positive cells were down-regulated by copper dose-dependently (Fig. 3a). Even after the measurements in the presence of 5 mm CuSO4, the effect of copper was to a large extent reversible. Water and Glycerol Permeability of Cells Transfected with AQP3 Alone or Co-transfected with Another AQP—In the cells transfected with AQP3 alone, the permeability for water and glycerol was down-regulated to the same extent at each concentration of copper (Fig. 3a). However, in cells that co-expressed AQP3 and AQP4 only glycerol permeability was affected by copper (Fig. 3, b and c). In these experiments, we used an AQP3 construct that expressed AQP3 and GFP in the same cell as separate proteins. As we have shown previously (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the cells successfully transfected with this construct can be identified by GFP signal distributed homogenously throughout the cytoplasm. In these cells, permeability to both water and glycerol was dramatically decreased by copper (Fig. 3, b and c, AQP3). Another construct used in these experiments encoded AQP4 tagged with GFP. The cells successfully transfected with this construct were identified by a distinct GFP signal in the plasma membrane of the cells. The cells expressing AQP4 only were not permeable for glycerol, and their water permeability was not influenced by copper (Fig. 3, b and c, AQP4). Cells co-transfected with a mixture of AQP3 and AQP4 constructs were recognized by the presence of GFP signal both in cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane. In these cells, the water permeability was virtually insensitive to copper, but glycerol permeability was dramatically decreased when the cells were exposed to copper (Fig. 3, b and c, AQP3+AQP4). Effect of the Heavy Metals on the Water Permeability of AQP3 Measured in Carbonic Acid-Bicarbonate Buffer—Because buffering compounds may to a large extent chelate divalent ions, the effective concentration of the metals in buffers such as Tris, Tricine, and HEPES is substantially lower than the level at which it was added. We examined the effect of copper, nickel, lead, and zinc dissolved in carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer and found that the water permeability of AQP3-positive cells was down-regulated at very low concentrations of copper and nickel but still was not influenced by zinc and lead (Fig. 4). Copper had a significant inhibitory effect at concentrations at least 5-fold lower than nickel. Unfortunately, running the measurements in bicarbonate buffer is extremely difficult because of abundant gas bubble formation in the chamber. The rest of the experiments were therefore performed in Tricine and HEPES buffer. Amino Acid Residues Involved in Regulation of AQP3 by Copper—We have previously identified amino acid residues involved in the regulation of AQP3 by nickel (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We examined these mutants in experiments with copper and found that the same residues are involved in the effect of this metal on the water permeability of AQP3 (Fig. 5). Water and Glycerol Permeability of AQP7—BEAS-2b cells were transiently transfected with mouse AQP7 tagged with GFP at the NH2 terminus. Permeability to water and glycerol were measured in the absence and in the presence of copper and nickel. Neither of the ions influenced the permeability of AQP7-positive cells (data not shown). Copper is a trace element essential to life. Its role in enzyme catalysis and gene expression is well established. More recently it has been demonstrated that copper can regulate brain ligand-gated ion channels (17Trombley P.Q. Shepherd G.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Coddou C. Villalobos C. Gonzalez J. Acuna-Castillo C. Loeb B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we show that copper is also a potent reversible inhibitor of both water and glycerol transport of the aquaglyceroporin AQP3. We show that in carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer, the natural buffer system in our body, low concentrations of copper are sufficient to dramatically decrease AQP3 permeability. These concentrations of copper are lower than copper levels observed in human blood in Wilson disease (19Kawahara S. Morimoto K. Nakazawa H. Kumagai T. Saito T. Aikawa S. Tsuboi I. Sawada U. Horie T. Rinsho Ketsueki. 1998; 39: 665-669PubMed Google Scholar) and more than an order of magnitude lower than those that can be observed in copper poisoning (20Liu J. Kashimura S. Hara K. Zhang G. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 2001; 39: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We show that the effect of copper on AQP3 is rapid and reversible. Copper does not need to enter the cells to exert its effect on AQP3. Three amino acid residues in the second and the third extracellular loops, Trp128, Ser152, and His241, were shown to be involved in the copper-mediated AQP3 inhibition. The same amino acids were previously shown to mediate nickel effect on AQP3 (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One of these, Ser152, is also involved in regulation of AQP3 by extracellular pH. The fact that Ser152 is the molecular target both for protons and copper may explain the phenomenon of exquisite sensitivity of human erythrocytes to copper at acidic pH (21Lin E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 765-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and emphasizes the importance of immediate treatment of metabolic acidosis that occurs in copper poisoning (22Bhowmik D. Mathur R. Bhargava Y. Dinda A.K. Agarwal S.K. Tiwari S.C. Dash S.C. Ren. Fail. 2001; 23: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AQP3 inhibition by copper is principally different from inhibition by mercury, which is also a divalent heavy metal. Mercury affects AQPs by acting on cysteine residues of the water channels. The mercury-sensitive cysteine in AQP3, Cys11, is located in the NH2-terminal part of the protein (23Kuwahara M. Gu Y. Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, mercury has to penetrate the cell membrane to reach its target, which makes the mercury effect relatively slow. As discussed above, copper acts on AQP3 extracellularly. Another difference between mercury and copper is in the nature of the bonds formed by the metals with AQP3. Mercury binds to proteins covalently. As a consequence, the effect of mercury is only reversible upon treatment of the cells with a reducing agent, such as β-mercaptoethanol. In contrast, copper forms coordination bonds with proteins. As a result, the effect of copper is to a large extent reversible by simple washout of the metal ions. The speed and reversibility of copper and nickel effects make these metals very convenient as test tools in functional studies in cells where AQP3 is co-expressed with other water transporters. Effects of copper and nickel are highly specific; neither of the AQPs tested in our previous study (13Zelenina M. Bondar A.A. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30037-30043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the present study proved to be sensitive to these metals, and several other heavy metals were ineffective with regard to the permeability of AQP3. Copper down-regulated the water and glycerol permeability of AQP3 to the same extent. This is in apparent contrast to the differential regulation of water and glycerol permeability of AQP3 by pH (24Zeuthen T. Klaerke D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21631-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The parallel effects of copper on water and glycerol permeability of AQP3 suggest that copper blocks the pore of AQP3 rather than changes the conditions in the pore. Identification of amino acid residues that are involved in the copper and nickel effect should provide valuable information for future studies of the secondary structure of AQP3. It is well documented that glycerol permeability of human red blood cells is decreased in the presence of copper (11Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Lin E.C. Annu. Rev.

Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of the copper action have been unknown. In red blood cells AQP3 is co-expressed with AQP1, which is not glycerol permeable. Our co-expression study shows that the consequences of AQP3 down-regulation by copper will depend on whether AQP3 is the only water channel in a particular cell or whether it is co-expressed with other water channels. In red blood cells, kidney collecting duct, bronchial epithelium, and colon AQP3 are co-localized with other AQPs (6Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T.

Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). We found that when AQP3 is expressed alone, both water and glycerol permeability of the cells is down-regulated by copper. However if AQP3 is co-expressed with another AQP, only permeability for glycerol is affected. Copper is still widely used in agriculture, mostly to control bacterial and fungal diseases of fruits and vegetables. It is also used as a herbicide in irrigation and municipal water treatment systems. Accidental and suicidal copper poisoning is not rare, and manifestations of acute copper poisoning are observed in kidney and red blood cells, the tissues where AQP3 is expressed. Copper is also widely used in water distribution systems. Considerable amounts of copper can be present in the tap water, especially in pipes that undergo an internal corrosion (27Alam I.A. Sadiq M. Environ Pollut. 1989; 57: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Hoveyda N. Yates B. Bond C.R. Hunter P.R. J. Environ. Health. 2003; 66: 29-32PubMed Google Scholar). Copper present in drinking water can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (29Araya M. Chen B. Klevay L.M. Strain J.J. Johnson L. Robson P. Shi W. Nielsen F. Zhu H. Olivares M. Pizarro F. Haber L.T. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2003; 38: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Chronic dietary copper intake may lead to liver damage (30Tanner M.S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1074S-1081SCrossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Children are especially susceptible to the poisoning, probably because of an imbalance between absorption and excretion of copper in the early postnatal period (31Bremner I. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1069S-1073SCrossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Severe impairment of the hepatic copper excretory function, observed in Wilson disease, may lead to acute hemolytic crisis (32Lee J.J. Kim H.J. Chung I.J. Kook H. Byun J.R. Kwon S.Y. Park M.R. Choi K.S. Hwang T.J. Ryang D.W. J. Korean Med. Sci. 1998; 13: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) similar to that in acute copper poisoning. The copper sensitivity of AQP3 will likely contribute to some of the clinical manifestations of acute and chronic copper intoxication. It is known that glycerol has a protective effect on red blood cells (33Bhattacharyya J. Datta A.G. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 52: 145-152PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which glycerol, taken up by red blood cells, can have a protective effect is still incompletely understood, but it has been suggested that the effect of glycerol as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals may be of importance. We speculate that glycerol may also play a role in the volume control of red blood cells. Intravascular hemolysis is one of the chief manifestations in copper poisoning. We suggest that inhibition of glycerol permeability of erythrocytes caused by inhibition of AQP3 by copper is one of the causes of the impaired erythrocyte structural integrity. We thank Dr. M. Yasui for fruitful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2009911844,"Plasmodium berghei invasion of Anopheles stephensi midgut cells causes severe damage, induces expression of nitric-oxide synthase, and leads to apoptosis. The present study indicates that invasion results in tyrosine nitration, catalyzed as a two-step reaction in which nitric-oxide synthase induction is followed by increased peroxidase activity. Ookinete invasion induced localized expression of peroxidase enzymes, which catalyzed protein nitration in vitro in the presence of nitrite and H2O2. Histochemical stainings revealed that when a parasite migrates laterally and invades more than one cell, the pattern of induced peroxidase activity is similar to that observed for tyrosine nitration. In Anopheles gambiae, ookinete invasion elicited similar responses; it induced expression of 5 of the 16 peroxidase genes predicted by the genome sequence and decreased mRNA levels of one of them. One of these inducible peroxidases has a C-terminal oxidase domain homologous to the catalytic moiety of phagocyte NADPH oxidase and could provide high local levels of superoxide anion (O2), that when dismutated would generate the local increase in H2O2 required for nitration. Chemically induced apoptosis of midgut cells also activated expression of four ookinete-induced peroxidase genes, suggesting their involvement in general apoptotic responses. The two-step nitration reaction provides a mechanism to precisely localize and circumscribe the toxic products generated by defense reactions involving nitration. The present study furthers our understanding of the biochemistry of midgut defense reactions to parasite invasion and how these may influence the efficiency of malaria transmission by anopheline mosquitoes.

The present study furthers our understanding of the biochemistry of midgut defense reactions to parasite invasion and how these may influence the efficiency of malaria transmission by anopheline mosquitoes. Anopheline mosquitoes are the natural vectors of human malaria worldwide. When a female mosquito takes a blood meal from a malaria-infected host, the ingested Plasmodium gametocytes complete their differentiation into mature gametes in the midgut lumen. Following fertilization, zygotes mature into motile ookinetes, which traverse the midgut epithelium and form oocysts in the space between the epithelial cells and the basal lamina. Oocysts grow, mature, and eventually rupture, releasing a large number of sporozoites into the hemolymph. The sporozoites invade the salivary glands and are injected into a new vertebrate host when an infected female takes a second blood meal. In Anopheles stephensi, midgut invasion of Plasmodium berghei ookinetes takes place around 24 h after blood feeding and induces the expression of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; TMB, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AgSRPN10, AgSerpin10; JNK, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase.1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; TMB, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AgSRPN10, AgSerpin10; JNK, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase. as revealed by immunofluorescence (1Han Y.S.

Vodovotz Y. Cui L. Rosenberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). NOS catalyzes the formation of nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive and toxic molecule (3Gorren A.C. Mayer B. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1998; 63: 734-743PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brüne B. von Knethen A.

Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1421-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). NO is unstable and reacts readily with other molecules, generating multiple reactive nitrogen intermediates. Peroxynitrite is formed by a rapid reaction between NO and a superoxide anion and readily nitrates proteins in vitro (6Daiber A. Herold S. Schöneich C. Namgaladze D. Peterson J.A. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6729-6739PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jiao K. Mandapati S. Skipper P.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Wishnok J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). peroxynitrite has also been proposed to be the major mediator of protein nitration in vivo (8Liu D. Ling X. Wen J. Liu J. J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3521-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). NO production plays an important role limiting ookinete infection in the mosquito midgut, as the administration of Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a NOS inhibitor, results in a 2-fold increase in the number of developing oocysts (2Luckhart S. Vodovotz Y. Cui L. Rosenberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that in anophelines P. berghei invasion causes irreversible damage leading to cell death (1Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Vlachou D. Zimmermann T. Cantera R. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Kafatos F.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Some of the observed changes include loss of microvilli, genome fragmentation, nuclear picnosis (1Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and activation of caspases (10Vlachou D. Zimmermann T. Cantera R. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Kafatos F.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The damage inflicted by parasite invasion is repaired by “budding off” the damaged cells into the midgut lumen through an actin ring-mediated restitution mechanism (1Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Invasion of Plasmodium gallinaceum ookinetes also damages Aedes aegypti midgut cells and results in activation of caspases and cell death (11Zieler H. Dvorak J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11516-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on these studies using the A. stephensi-P. berghei model system we proposed the “time bomb model” of ookinete midgut invasion, which states that cell invasion triggers a series of toxic reactions (a “bomb”) that leads to cell death and is also potentially toxic to the parasite (1Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Han Y.S. Barillas-Mury C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The model predicts that ookinete survival would depend on the parasite migrating out of the cell before the bomb detonates. In the present study we investigate the biochemistry of the reactions generating the toxic products mediating these defense responses. Our data indicate that in A. stephensi and A. gambiae, P. berghei ookinetes trigger tyrosine nitration as a two-step reaction in which NO generation by NOS is followed by local induction of peroxidase and probably also oxidase enzymes. Peroxidase induction appears to be the rate-limiting step to generate highly reactive nitrogen dioxide, which is predicted to mediate tyrosine nitration and to play a critical role in determining parasite survival and thus the vectorial capacity of the mosquito. Mosquitoes and Malaria Parasites—A. stephensi (NIH strain) and A. gambiae (G3 strain) were reared at 28 °C and 80% humidity on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Larvae were grown in tap water and fed on Whiskas™ cat food, whereas adults were fed ad libitum on 10% sucrose. P. berghei parasites were maintained by serial passage in 3–4-week-old female Balb/C mice and as frozen stocks. P. berghei Infections in Mosquitoes—Mosquito females were infected with P. berghei by feeding on anesthetized infected Balb/C mice 5 days postemergence. The infectivity of the mice was established by determining the parasitemia and by performing an exflagellation assay as described previously (13Billker O. Shaw M.K. Margos G. Sinden R.E. Parasitology. 1997; 115: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In all the studies, mice having 3–4 exflagellations/field under ×40 objective were used to infect mosquitoes. Bloodfed infected and control mosquitoes were kept at 21 °C in a humidified environment, unless otherwise stated. Midgut Immunofluorescence Stainings—Mosquito midgut immunostainings were performed as described previously (1Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, midguts from mosquitoes fed on healthy or P. berghei-infected mice were dissected, fixed for 1 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and opened longitudinally in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove the bolus contents. Clean, opened tissues were fixed for 1 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and permeabilized with PBT solution (1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Midguts were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies (1:300 dilution in PBT) at 4 °C and 4 h at room temperature with Cy5-, Cy3- (Amersham Biosciences), or Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution in PBT). ToPro3 (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize DNA by confocal microscopy. The tissues were washed and mounted in Vectashield™ (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to counter stain the nuclei. Immunostainings were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The final images were obtained and analyzed using confocal microscopy with a Fluoview system and software (Olympus) or regular light and fluorescence microscopy (Olympus) with a color digital camera. The following commercially available antibodies were used: Universal anti-NOS rabbit polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., catalog no. PA1-039) and mouse anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem, catalog no. 487923). Anti-Pbs21 monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Sinden, and anti-AgSRPN10 rabbit antiserum was provided by Dr. Alberto Danielli. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) Activity of the Midgut Tissue—Control or infected blood-fed midguts were dissected 24 h postfeeding, fixed for 1 min in paraformaldehyde, and opened longitudinally to remove the blood meal. For direct DAB stainings, midguts were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed, and developed for DAB activity. Samples were incubated at room temperature with 2.5 mm DAB (Sigma) and 1 mm H2O2 (Sigma) in PBS (pH 6.5) and continuously observed under the microscope. For experiments involving dual DAB and immunofluorescence staining, midguts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature after removal of the blood meal and stained with anti-Pbs21 antibody as described above under “Midgut Immunofluorescence Staining.” The DAB reaction was performed as the last step before mounting the sample. In some experiments, midguts were pre-incubated for 10 min with 10 mg/ml sodium azide (NaN3) or 10 mg/ml 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) in PBS (pH 6.5) before measuring DAB activity. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Peroxidase Assay—Peroxidase assays using TMB as a substrate were performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.). Briefly, five uninfected or infected blood-fed midguts were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde, washed, transferred to 100 μl of a TMB/H2O2 solution, and triturated. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C in the dark, the midgut tissue was removed by centrifugation and the reaction stopped by adding 100 μlof3 n HCl. The relative concentration of the end products was determined based on the absorbance at 450 nm in an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). To evaluate the effect of specific inhibitors, triturated midguts were pre-incubated for 5 min at room temperature with different concentrations (1, 2, 5, and 10 mg/ml) of NaN3 or AT before adding the TMB solution. Effect of Catalase on Peroxidase Activity—The activity of horseradish peroxidase (0.3 units/ml) (Invitrogen) after the addition of increasing amounts (10, 20, and 40 units/ml) of bovine liver catalase (EC 1.11.1.6, Sigma, catalog no. C3155) was determined using the TMB assay as described above, incubating the reactions for 5 min at 37 °C in the dark. To assess the effect of AT on the inhibitory effect of catalase, 0.3 units/ml peroxidase and 10 units/ml catalase were pre-incubated for 5 min at room temperature with increasing amounts (1, 2, and 5 mg/ml) of AT before performing the TMB assay. In Vitro Protein Nitration Assay—The ability of midgut homogenates to mediate protein nitration in vitro was evaluated by incubating blood-fed control or infected triturated midguts 24 h postfeeding (after removal of the blood bolus and fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h at room temperature) with 100 μg of BSA in the presence of 1 mm H2O2 and1mm sodium nitrite (NaNO2) for 30 min at 37 °C. Midgut tissue was removed by centrifugation, and 3 μg of BSA was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with 1 mm levamisole solution to inhibit any internal phosphatase activity and blocked with 5% milk protein in Tris-buffered saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). The presence of nitrotyrosine in BSA was established by Western blot analysis, using an anti-nitrotyrosine mouse primary antibody (Calbiochem, catalog no. 487923) at a 1:3,000 dilution and a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Calbiochem, catalog no. 401212) at a 1:10,000 dilution. The membrane was developed for the enzymatic reaction following the manufacturer's instructions. In parallel, 0.3 unit/ml commercial horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen) was used as a positive control. The participation of peroxidase activity from midgut homogenates or commercial sources in the catalysis of tyrosine nitration was tested by pre-incubating the sample with 5 mg/ml sodium azide (peroxidase inhibitor) before the reaction was carried out. Induction of Cell Death by Actimomycin D—Female mosquitoes were fed on 10% BSA with 5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml actimomycin D, using a Hemotek artificial feeder (Discovery Workshop). Midguts were dissected 8 h postfeeding, opened longitudinally to remove the bolus content, and fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde solution at room temperature for 10 min. DAB staining to detect peroxidase activity was carried out in the presence of 10 mg/ml AT (catalase inhibitor) as described above. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from a group of 20 A. gambiae mosquito midguts 28 h after feeding using Oligotex-dT beads (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized by using random hexamers and Superscript II (Invitrogen). For the expression studies, PCRs were performed by using 20 pmol of each primer in 50-μl reactions and AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with standard buffer conditions (1.5 mm MgCl2). DNA was denatured initially for 3 min at 94 °C followed by 24 cycles of amplification (1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min at the annealing temperature of the specific primer pair, 1 min extension at 72 °C) and a final 10-min extension at 72 °C.

Ookinete-invaded Cells Undergo Protein Nitration—To investigate the mechanism of protein nitration in ookinete-invaded cells, control and infected A. stephensi midguts were double stained for NOS and nitrotyrosine 24 h postfeeding. In non-infected midguts, a low level of NOS expression was observed in the cytoplasm of healthy epithelial cells, but neither cells protruding into the lumen nor nitrotyrosine staining could be detected (data not shown). In contrast, cells invaded by P. berghei ookinetes protruded into the lumen and exhibited high levels of NOS protein expression (Fig. 1, A–D) as described previously (1Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These two parameters were used as markers of parasite invasion. To our surprise, only some of the invaded cells protruding and expressing high NOS levels had also undergone extensive tyrosine nitration (Fig. 1, A and B). One possible explanation is a time delay in the activation of other components critical for nitration. To begin to address a temporal difference we took advantage of the fact that single ookinetes often migrate laterally, invading two or more adjacent epithelial cells, as revealed by Pbs21 trails left behind during migration (Pbs21 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored surface protein continuously released by migrating P. berghei ookinetes), cell protrusion, loss of microvilli, and NOS induction (1Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Sequential lateral invasions of P. gallinaceum ookinetes in A. aegypti, and of P. berghei in A. gambiae and A. stephensi midgut cells, have been observed directly in vivo by video microscopy (11Zieler H. Dvorak J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11516-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and real-time confocal microscopy (10Vlachou D. Zimmermann T. Cantera R. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Kafatos F.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), respectively. Cells invaded sequentially provide information regarding the relative timing of the cellular responses to the parasite, as more time has elapsed since the invasion of the first than the second, the second than the third cell, and so forth. The location of the ookinete was determined by light microscopy; it is shown in the Fig. 1 as an asterisk and indicates the last (and thus the most recently) invaded cell (Fig. 1, B and C and F and G). We consistently found that, at the time when all cells invaded by the same parasite have already protruded to the lumen and increased NOS expression, tyrosine nitration appeared with a time lag and was often confined to the first cell invaded by the parasite (Fig. 1, B and C). Cells in advanced stages of degeneration, in the process of “budding off” from the midgut epithelium, are heavily nitrated (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that induction of NOS expression is necessary but not sufficient to mediate tyrosine nitration. Occasionally, highly nitrated degenerate cells are negative for NOS staining (Fig. 1C). This could be due to either a decrease in NOS expression or to chemical damage of the epitopes recognized by the anti-NOS antibody. AgSerpin10 (AgSRPN10), a serine protease inhibitor, is highly induced in A. gambiae midguts in response to parasite invasion (15Danielli A. Kafatos F.C. Loukeris T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4184-4193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). AgSRPN10 undergoes dramatic changes in subcellular localization and protein expression in a sequential manner (16Danielli A. Barillas-Mury A. Kumar S. Kafatos F.C. Loukeris T.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; (doi:10.1111/j. 1462-5822.2004.00445.x)Google Scholar), and thus, it also provides some information regarding the timing of tyrosine nitration. Healthy uninfected cells express low levels of AgSRPN10 predominantly in the nucleus and are always negative for tyrosine nitration (16Danielli A. Barillas-Mury A. Kumar S. Kafatos F.C. Loukeris T.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; (doi:10.1111/j. 1462-5822.2004.00445.x)Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Parasite invasion immediately triggers translocation of the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is followed by the induction of high expression levels (16Danielli A. Barillas-Mury A. Kumar S. Kafatos F.C. Loukeris T.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; (doi:10.1111/j. 1462-5822.2004.00445.x)Google Scholar). Tyrosine nitration is first detected when the cytoplasmic levels of AgSRPN10 begin to increase (Fig. 1E) and becomes stronger as AgSRPN10 expression further increases (Fig. 1, F and G). All cells positive for nitrotyrosine staining express high AgSRPN10 levels; however, cells with high AgSRPN10 expression are not always nitrated (Fig. 1, F and G). These data indicate that protein nitration takes place during the later stages of the cell death process triggered by parasite invasion. Ookinete Invasion Induces a Glutaraldehyde-resistant Peroxidase Activity—The classic model of peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration in vertebrates has been challenged based on kinetic studies in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (17Pfeiffer S. Lass A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34051-34058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both NO and superoxide anion levels were found to increase following immune stimulation with interferon-γ/lipopolysaccharide or interferon-γ/zymosan A, but they rapidly decreased to base-line levels several hours before tyrosine nitration could be detected. NO formation resulted in nitrite accumulation, which was proposed to serve as a substrate for a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated tyrosine nitration reaction (17Pfeiffer S. Lass A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34051-34058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Experiments using multiple distinct models of acute inflammation with eosinophil peroxidase (EPO)- and MPO knock-out mice indicate that leukocyte peroxidases participate in nitrotyrosine formation in vivo (18Brennan M.L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Borchers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Ischiropoulos H. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17415-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In some models, MPO and EPO played a dominant role, accounting for the majority of nitrotyrosine formed. However, in other leukocyte-rich acute inflammatory models, neither MPO nor EPO contributed to nitrotyrosine formation, implying the existence of alternative nitration pathways (18Brennan M.L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Borchers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Ischiropoulos H. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17415-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Based on the vertebrate data we decided to test the hypothesis that protein nitration of invaded midgut cells was mediated by ookinete-induced peroxidase(s). Midguts of females fed on healthy (Ctl) or malaria-infected (Inf) mice were fixed briefly with glutaraldehyde and assayed for peroxidase activity using DAB and hydrogen peroxide as substrates (Fig. 2A). Within a few minutes of incubation some of the malaria-infected cells protruding into the lumen stained very strongly with DAB (Fig. 2A, right panel), whereas no staining was detected in control samples incubated for the same amount of time (Fig. 2A, left panel). The cells positive for DAB staining are in close association with invading ookinetes. Furthermore, when two adjacent cells are invaded by the same parasite, the peroxidase activity is usually much higher in the cell that was invaded first (Fig. 2, B and C), in a pattern very similar to that described above for tyrosine nitration (Fig. 1, B and C). When P. berghei-infected females were kept at 28 °C, a non-permissive temperature for ookinete development, neither cells protruding into the midgut lumen nor DAB staining was observed (data not shown), implying that these two events are triggered by ookinete invasion. As both catalase and peroxidase activities can give rise to a positive DAB reaction (19Angermuller S. Fahimi H.D. Histochemistry. 1981; 71: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the relative contribution of these two enzymes was evaluated by performing stainings in the presence of specific inhibitors. The addition of AT, a catalase inhibitor, had no effect, whereas sodium azide, a peroxidase inhibitor, completely abolished DAB staining (Fig. 2C), indicating that the DAB reaction was due to an inducible peroxidase. To confirm the induction of peroxidase activity in response to malaria infection, the activity was also determined in midgut homogenates by performing a colorimetric assay using TMB, a peroxidase-specific chromophore, and H2O2 as substrates. Parasite infection resulted in a marked increase in peroxidase activity when homogenates from midguts that had been fixed with a mixture of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde were used in the assay (Fig. 2D). However, no difference in total peroxidase activity could be observed between control and infected samples when unfixed tissues or tissues fixed only with paraformaldehyde were used (data not shown). This observation suggests that parasite-induced peroxidase(s) is more resistant to fixation than other peroxidases constitutively expressed in control samples. For this reason, all activity assays presented here were performed in midgut tissues fixed previously with a mixture of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). As expected, sodium azide had a strong inhibitory effect on this inducible peroxidase activity in contrast to the catalase inhibitor AT, which had the opposite effect, slightly increasing peroxidase activity (Fig. 2E). This activity enhancement is probably because of a competition between catalase and peroxidases present in the midgut homogenate for hydrogen peroxide, a common substrate. We confirmed that the addition of commercial catalase to a commercial peroxidase did have an inhibitory effect (Fig. 2F) that could be alleviated by inhibiting catalase activity with AT (Fig. 2G). The Ookinete-induced Peroxidase Activity Can Mediate Protein Nitration—An in vitro nitration assay was performed to determine whether the ookinete-induced peroxidase activity could mediate protein nitration. Midgut homogenates from infected or non-infected mosquitoes were incubated with BSA in the presence of H2O2 and sodium nitrite (NaNO2). Following incubation, BSA was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted, and nitrotyrosine was detected by Western blot analysis using the same anti-nitrotyrosine antibody used for immunofluorescence staining. The BSA sample incubated with infected midgut homogenate had a higher level of nitrotyrosine staining relative to the control uninfected samples (Fig. 3). Tyrosine nitration required all components to be present, a source of peroxidase activity, sodium nitrite, and hydrogen peroxide; the removal of any of them completely inhibited the reaction. As expected, the addition of sodium azide inhibited nitration mediated either by midgut homogenates or by a commercial peroxidase used as a positive control for the reaction (Fig. 3). Ookinete-induced Peroxidase Activity in A. gambiae Midguts Correlates with Transcriptional Activation of Several Peroxidase Genes—The invasion of A. gambiae midgut cells by P. berghei also induced cell protrusion, localized peroxidase activity (Fig. 4A), and"
https://openalex.org/W1983287532,"If a common ancestor of all living humans is defined as an individual who is a genealogical ancestor of all present-day people, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for a randomly mating population would have lived in the very recent past. However, the random mating model ignores essential aspects of population substructure, such as the tendency of individuals to choose mates from the same social group, and the relative isolation of geographically separated groups. Here we show that recent common ancestors also emerge from two models incorporating substantial population substructure. One model, designed for simplicity and theoretical insight, yields explicit mathematical results through a probabilistic analysis. A more elaborate second model, designed to capture historical population dynamics in a more realistic way, is analysed computationally through Monte Carlo simulations. These analyses suggest that the genealogies of all living humans overlap in remarkable ways in the recent past. In particular, the MRCA of all present-day humans lived just a few thousand years ago in these models. Moreover, among all individuals living more than just a few thousand years earlier than the MRCA, each present-day human has exactly the same set of genealogical ancestors."

To determine the role of MGP in EC, we cultured bovine aortic EC with increasing concentrations of human MGP (hMGP) for 24 h. The results showed increased proliferation, migration, tube formation, and increased release of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). HMGP, added endogenously or transiently expressed, increased VEGF gene expression dose-dependently as determined by real-time PCR. To determine the mechanism by which hMGP increased VEGF expression, we studied the effect of MGP on the activity of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 compared with that of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 using transfection assays with TGF-β- and BMP-response element reporter genes. Our results showed a strong enhancement of TGF-β1 activity by hMGP, which was paralleled by increased VEGF expression. BMP-2 activity, on the other hand, was inhibited by hMGP. Neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β blocked the effect of MGP on VEGF expression. The enhanced TGF-β1 activity specifically activated the Smad1/5 pathway indicating that the TGF-β receptor activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1) had been stimulated.

Two distinct TGF-β signaling cascades have been identified within EC, the activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1)-Smad1/5 pathway, and the ALK5-Smad2/3 pathway.

Our results indicate that MGP promotes release of VEGF-A and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), both involved in angiogenesis. Furthermore, MPG increased VEGF gene expression through enhanced TGF-β1 activity without significant effect on expression of TGF-β1, ALK1, or ALK5. A concurrent inhibition of BMP-2 activity was detected. The enhanced TGF-β1 activity specifically activated the Smad1/5 pathway indicating that ALK1 had been stimulated by the presence of MGP. The effect on VEGF expression was blocked by neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β and mimicked by transfection of constitutively active ALK1, which also increased VEGF expression. Expression of VEGF and MGP were induced by TGF-β1, however, the induction of MGP preceded that of VEGF, consistent with a role for MGP in promoting VEGF expression. Together, the results suggest that MGP plays a role in EC function by altering the response to TGF-β growth factors, which in part may explain the vascular abnormalities seen in MGP deficiency.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection Assays—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from VEC Technologies, Inc. (Rens-selaer, NY). They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and l-glutamine (2 mm). Supplemented medium was discarded if not used within 5 days of its preparation. The BAECs were used between passages 2 and 15, except for transfection experiments when they were used between passages 2 and 6.Transient transfections of BAECs were performed in quadruplicates in 24-well plates. BAECs were plated onto 24-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/well 20–24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transiently transfected using 1.5 μl of FuGene6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 500 ng of DNA per well (usually 200 ng of luciferase reporter constructs, 200 ng of various expression constructs, and 100 ng of β-galactosidase encoding construct as a control for transfection efficiency). The total amount of expression construct was kept constant with parental expression vector. Recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), bovine bFGF (R&D Systems), recombinant human VEGF (R&D Systems), human MGP or human BMP-2 were added at the time of transfection. Human MGP and BMP-2 were added in the form of conditioned medium, and the methods to prepare the media and determine the levels of MGP and BMP-2, respectively, have been described previously (21Zebboudj A.F.

In experiments where conditioned medium was used, the level of conditioned medium was kept constant at 80% using sham-conditioned medium.Cells were taken for analysis 24 h after transfection. For luciferase assays, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) per well. The cells were freeze-thawed twice and agitated for 15 min. Two 20-μl and two 10-μl aliquots from each well were used for luciferase assays (Promega) and β-galactosidase assays, respectively. Luciferase activity was determined using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and expressed as mean ± S.D. from quadruplicate transfections after normalization to β-galactosidase activity. Cell lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by adding 190 μlof β-galactosidase reagent to 10 μl of cell lysate, incubating at 37 °C, and reading the absorbance at 420 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The β-galactosidase reagent was prepared by mixing 350 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, 21 ml of 4 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 100 ml of β-galactosidase buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2) just prior to the assay.RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit as per the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen).Real-time PCR assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using an MMLV Reverse Transcription Reagents kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each amplification mixture (20 μl) contained 25 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA, 8 μm forward primer, 8 μm reverse primer, 2 μm dual-labeled fluorogenic probe (Applied Biosystems), and 10 μl of Universal PCR mix (Quantitect probe RT-PCR kit, Qiagen). PCR thermocycling parameters were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. All samples were analyzed for bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression in parallel in the same run. Results of the real-time PCR data were represented as Ct values, where Ct is defined as the threshold cycle of PCR at which amplified product was first detected. To compare the different RNA samples in an experiment, we used the comparative Ct method (32Relative quantitation of gene expression.

The primers and probes were constructed so that the dynamic range of both the targets and the GAPDH reference were similar over a wide range of dilutions (1:1–10,000). PCR was performed as quadruplicates for each sample. The results were expressed as mean ± S.D. for the relative expression levels compared with the control, and minimum values of four independent experiments were performed. Primers and probes were designed by using Primer Express version 1.5 software (Applied Biosystems) as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol to ensure suitability for the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system and the reaction parameters. The following bovine primers and probes were used: bovine VEGF (bVEGF) forward (F) (5′-CCCACGAAGTGGTGAAGTTCA-3′), bVEGF reverse (R) (5′-CCACCAGGGTCTCGATGG-3′), bVEGF TaqMan probe (FAM-TCTACCAGCGCAGCTTCTGCCGT-TAMRA), bovine MGP (bMGP) F (5′-GGGAAGCTTGTGATGACTTCAAA-3′), bMGP R (5′-CGCTGCCGGTCGTAGGCAGCATTGTATCCA-3′), bMGP TaqMan probe (FAM-TTGCGAACGCTATGCCATGGTGT-TAMRA), bovine TGF-β1 (bTGF-β1) F (5′-TGAAGTCTAGCTCGCACAGCAT-3′), bTGF-β1R(5′-GGTTCGGGCACCGCTT-3′), bTGF-β1 TaqMan probe (FAM-TCTTCAACACGTCCGAGCTCCGG-TAMRA), bovine GAPDH (bGAPDH) F (5′-GGCGCCAAGAGGGTCAT-3′), bGAPDH R (5′-GTGGTTCACGCCCATCACA-3′), bGAPDH TaqMan probe (FAM-TCTCTGCACCTTCTGCCGATGCC-TAMRA), human ALK1 (hALK1) F (5′-AGGGCAAACCAGCCATTG-3′), hALK1 R (5′-GGTTGCTCTTGACCAGCACAT-3′), hALK1 TaqMan probe (FAM-CACCGCGACTTCAAGAGCCGC-TAMRA), human MGP (hMGP) F (5′-GGGAAGCCTGTGATGACTACAGA-3′), hMGP R (5′-CGATTATAGGCAGCATTGTATCCA-3′), and hMGP TaqMan probe (FAM-TTGCGAACGCTACGCCATGGTTT-TAMRA).Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for ALK1, ALK5, and GAPDH was carried out using previously described methods (19Boström K. Kao S-C. Tsao D. Shen S. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The ALK1- and ALK5-primers were based on the human sequences: ALK1 F (5′-ATTACCTGGACATCGGCAAC-3′), ALK1 R (5′-TTGGGCACCACATCATAGAA-3′), ALK5 F (5′-GATGGGCTCTGCTTTGTCTC-3′), and ALK5 R (5′-CAAGGCCAGGTGATGACTTT-3′). The GAPDH primers have been described previously (19Boström K. Kao S-C. Tsao D. Shen S. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The annealing temperatures were 55 °C for ALK1 and ALK5, and 58 °C for GAPDH. Densitometry using NIH Image J, version 1.62 (public domain program, available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image) was performed to compare the relative DNA levels after normalization to GAPDH.Immunoprecipitation of VEGF—Equal volumes (500 μl) of medium from treated BAECs were used for immunoprecipitation of VEGF to improve VEGF detection in subsequent immunoblotting. After pre-clearance with agarose-conjugated nonspecific rabbit antibodies, 40 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-VEGF antibody (A-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the agarose was spun down, and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Immunoprecipitated VEGF was recovered by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer and detected by immunoblotting.Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (19Boström K.

Biochem. 2003; 90: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cellular protein or culture medium were used. For analysis of VEGF in the culture medium, the VEGF was first immunoprecipitated from 500 μl as described above. Blots were incubated with specific antibodies to either VEGF (2 μg/ml; A-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), bFGF (2 μg/ml; H-125, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TGF-β1 latency-associated peptide (LAP) (0.2 μg/ml; R&D Systems), P-Smad1 (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), P-Smad2/3 (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Smad (0.4 μg/ml; H-465, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For P-Smad immunoblotting, 1 mm sodium fluoride and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate were added to the lysis buffer. Densitometry using NIH Image J, version 1.62 was performed to compare protein levels.Quantification of MGP—Quantification of MGP in tissue culture medium was performed as previously described (21Zebboudj A.F. Shin V. Boström K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Cell Proliferation Assay—BAECs were treated with hMGP-containing medium or control medium for 24 h. After treatment, the media were replaced by 300 μl of fresh EC medium, which was left on the treated BAEC for 24 h. This medium was subsequently removed, supplemented with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences), and used in proliferation assays.Cell proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. BAECs were seeded in 6-well tissue culture dishes at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells per well. Cells were made quiescent by incubation with serum-free media for 4 h at 37 °C. The quiescent BAECs were treated with the medium previously conditioned by BAECs exposed to no hMGP or to increasing concentrations of hMGP. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized in 10 m NaOH. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by scintillation counting. Cell viability was assessed with Trypan Blue staining, which demonstrated >97% cell viability in all cells.Migration Assay—BAECs were plated at 85% confluency in 6-well tissue culture dishes and treated with hMGP for 24 h, until 100% confluency. Confluent monolayers were “wounded” with a standard 20-μl pipette tip, after which the experiment was continued for the indicated number of hours. Wound width was measured at 2, 5, and 24 h through the use of the Scion Image Analysis System (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).Tube Formation Assay—Matrigel™ Matrix (BD Biosciences) was diluted 1:3 in EC medium containing MGP-conditioned medium (final concentration of MGP 60 ng/ml) or the same amount of sham-conditioned medium, and 300 μl was added to each well of a 12-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow polymerization. BAECs were suspended in the same EC medium containing MGP-conditioned medium (final concentration of MGP 60 ng/ml) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well, and 400 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well of the plate and incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of MGP.Vector Constructions—The construct containing full-length hMGP cDNA has previously been described (19Boström K. Kao S-C. Tsao D. Shen S. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-responsive p3TP-lux luciferase reporter gene has previously been described (34Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massagué J. Wrana J.L.

The BMP-responsive luciferase reporter gene was obtained from Dr. Peter ten Dijke, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and has previously been described (35Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P.

The construct for constitutively active ALK1 was obtained from Dr. Karen Lyons, University of California, Los Angeles, CA.Statistics—Data were analyzed for statistical significance by analysis of variance with post-hoc Scheffe's analysis, unless otherwise stated. The analyses were performed using StatView, version 4.51 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times.RESULTSMGP Increases Release of Biologically Active VEGF and bFGF in BAEC—Increased MGP expression has previously been reported in tube-forming endothelial cells as determined by subtractive hybridization (13Glienke J. Schmitt A.O. Pilarsky C. Hinzmann B. Weiss B. Rosenthal A. Thierauch K-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2820-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and VEGF has been reported to increase MGP expression in myometrial EC (14Weston G.C. Havis I. Rogers P.A.W. Mol. Human Reprod. 2002; 8: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether MGP affects endothelial cell function, assays for cell proliferation, cell migration, and tube formation were performed.Cell proliferation was determined using [3H]thymidine incorporation in quiescent BAECs exposed to medium from BAECs treated with hMGP (0–50 ng/ml) for 24 h. Results showed that BAEC proliferation increased significantly after exposure to medium from hMGP-treated cells compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that MGP treatment stimulates release of angiogenic factors. Cell migration was determined using the endothelial wounding assay in confluent monolayers of BAECs that had been treated for 24 h with MGP (0–100 ng/ml) prior to wounding. Results showed a significant increase in migration after hMGP treatment (Fig. 1B). Tube formation was assessed in Matrigel where cells were exposed to hMGP (60 ng/ml) or control medium for 24 h. Results showed an increase in tube formation in the presence of hMGP compared with control (Fig. 1C).To determine the effect of MGP on levels of VEGF and bFGF, BAECs were treated with hMGP, at concentrations between 0 and 100 ng/ml. HMGP was added at the time of plating, and after 24 h VEGF and bFGF were determined in the medium and cellular extract using immunoblotting. To better visualize VEGF from the medium, VEGF was immunoprecipitated prior to immunoblotting. Results showed that hMGP stimulated the release of both VEGF-A (21 kDa) and bFGF into the medium, whereas the levels in the cell extracts remained constant or decreased (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Release of VEGF-A and bFGF increases after hMGP treatment. A, immunoblotting for VEGF and bFGF on culture medium and cell lysate was performed after 24 h of hMGP treatment (0–100 ng/ml). VEGF was immunoprecipitated prior to immunoblotting for improved detection. HMGP stimulated the release of both VEGF-A and bFGF into the medium, whereas the levels in the cell extracts remained constant or decreased.

HMGP was added at the time of plating, and after 24 h VEGF expression was determined using real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression. Results showed a dose-dependent increase in VEGF expression (Fig. 3A), which increased ∼4-fold after treatment with high levels of hMGP.Fig. 3A, VEGF expression in BAEC increases after hMGP treatment. BAECs were treated for 24 h with hMGP (0–100 ng/ml), after which VEGF expression was determined using real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression. B, VEGF expression in BAECs increases after transfection of hMGP. BAECs were transiently transfected with an expression construct containing hMGP (0–400 ng/well) (transfection efficiency of 10–20%). Twenty-four hours after transfection, VEGF expression was determined using real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression. C, MGP expression increases after transfection of hMGP.

In the present study, the role of Cdc42 in the regulation of actin polymerization and tension development in smooth muscle was evaluated. Acetylcholine stimulation of tracheal smooth muscle tissues increased the activation of Cdc42. Plasmids encoding wild type Cdc42 or a dominant negative Cdc42 mutant, Asn-17 Cdc42, were introduced into tracheal smooth muscle strips by reversible permeabilization, and tissues were incubated for 2 days to allow for protein expression. Expression of recombinant proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The expression of the dominant negative Cdc42 mutant inhibited contractile force and the increase in actin polymerization in response to acetylcholine stimulation but did not inhibit the increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation. The expression of wild type Cdc42 had no significant effect on force, actin polymerization, or myosin light chain phosphorylation. Contractile stimulation increased the association of neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein with Cdc42 and the Arp2/3 (actin-related protein) complex in smooth muscle tissues expressing wild type Cdc42. The agonist-induced increase in these protein interactions was inhibited in tissues expressing the inactive Cdc42 mutant. We conclude that Cdc42 activation regulates active tension development and actin polymerization during contractile stimulation. Cdc42 may regulate the activation of neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and the actin related protein complex, which in turn regulate actin filament polymerization initiated by the contractile stimulation of smooth muscle.

Although actin polymerization plays an important role in regulating smooth muscle contraction, the mechanisms that regulate actin dynamics in smooth muscle tissues remain to be elucidated. The small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac have been shown to regulate the formation and organization of actin filaments associated with membrane ruffles, filapodium and lamellipodium, in cultured non-muscle cells such as fibroblasts and macrophages (11Allen W.E.

The role of Cdc42 in the regulation of actin polymerization in smooth muscle has not been investigated. In vitro biochemical studies have shown that a seven-component protein complex, the Arp2/3 1The abbreviations used are: Arp, actin-related protein; N-WASp, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; G, globular; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PBD, p21-activated kinase binding domain; MLC, myosin light chain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; ACh, acetylcholine; PKC, protein kinase C. complex, promotes the nucleation of new actin filaments (15Mullins R.D.

In response to external stimulation, the Arp2/3 complex can be activated by N-WASp, which is a multidomain member of the WASp family of proteins that interacts with the Arp2/3 complex and globular (G) actin through its carboxyl-terminal domain to stimulate actin polymerization (15Mullins R.D.

Once in GTP-bound form, Cdc42 interacts with N-WASp and initiates actin filament formation mediated by the Arp2/3 complex (16Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

There is evidence that N-WASp-mediated Arp2/3 complex activation regulates actin polymerization in tracheal smooth muscle (19Zhang W.W. Tang D.D. Wu Y.D. Gunst S.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: A1086Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of Cdc42 in the regulation of actin polymerization and force generation in smooth muscle tissues. Our results demonstrate that the activation of Cdc42 is necessary for actin polymerization and tension development in tracheal smooth muscle tissues in response to stimulation with acetylcholine and that it does not affect myosin light chain phosphorylation. Preparation of Smooth Muscle Tissues—Mongrel dogs (20–25 kg) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg, intravenously) and quickly exsanguinated. A 12–15-cm segment of extrathoracic trachea was immediately removed and immersed in physiological saline solution (PSS) at 22 °C (composition: 110 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm KCl, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 25.8 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 5.6 mm glucose). The solution was aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.4. Rectangular strips of tracheal muscle 0.6–0.8 mm in diameter and 8–10 mm in length were dissected from the trachea after removal of the epithelium and connective tissue layer. The use of an appropriately sized strip was critical for maintaining muscle contractility during the incubation period and for the successful introduction of plasmids throughout the muscle strip. Each muscle strip was placed in PSS at 37 °C in a 25-ml organ bath and attached to a Grass force transducer. At the beginning of each experiment, maximal force development was determined by increasing muscle length progressively during successive contractions until the force of active contraction in response to a contractile stimulus reached a maximum and remained stable. Plasmids encoding recombinant Cdc42 proteins were introduced into muscle strips according to experimental procedures described below. Muscle strips were then incubated for 2 days with plasmids in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The strips were then returned to PSS at 37 °C in 25-ml organ baths and attached to Grass force transducers for the measurement of isometric force. For biochemical analysis, muscle strips were frozen using liquid N2-cooled tongs and then pulverized under liquid N2 using a mortar and pestle. Introduction of Plasmids Encoding Recombinant Cdc42 into Tracheal Smooth Muscle Tissues—The constructs of human wild type Cdc42 and the Asn-17 Cdc42 dominant negative mutants have been previously described (11Allen W.E.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding wild type Cdc42 and Asn-17 mutant were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli (Bluescript) transformed with these plasmids were grown in LB medium, and plasmids were purified by alkaline lysis with SDS (maxipreparation) or by a kit from Invitrogen (S.N.A.P., number K1910–01). Plasmids carrying wild type or mutant Cdc42 were introduced into the smooth muscle strips by reversible permeabilization (also referred to as chemical loading) using methods we have described previously (4Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 21-35Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Opazo S.A. Zhang W. Wu Y. Turner C.E. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C433-C447Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After determination of the maximal isometric force, muscle strips were attached to metal mounts at the appropriate length. The strips were placed in 0.5-ml tubes and incubated successively in four solutions. Solution 1 (at 4 °C for 120 min) contained 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm TES, and Solution 2 (at 4 °C overnight) contained 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm TES, and 10 μg/ml plasmids. Solution 3 (at 4 °C for 30 min) contained 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm TES, and Solution 4 (at 22 °C for 60 min) contained 110 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 25.8 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 5.6 mm dextrose. Solutions 1–3 were maintained at pH 7.1 and aerated with 100% O2. Solution 4 was maintained at pH 7.4 and was aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. After 30 min in Solution 4, CaCl2 was added gradually to reach a final concentration of 2.4 mm. The strips were then incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm Na2ATP, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml plasmids (4Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 21-35Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Opazo S.A. Zhang W. Wu Y. Turner C.E. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C433-C447Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that transfection efficiencies of ∼90% are achieved in smooth muscle tissues using this reversible permeabilization procedure (4Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 21-35Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Opazo S.A. Zhang W. Wu Y. Turner C.E. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C433-C447Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Analysis of Protein Expression—Pulverized muscle strips were mixed with extraction buffer containing: 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm molybdate, and 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate), and protease inhibitors (2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Each sample was centrifuged for the collection of supernatant, and the supernatant was then boiled in sample buffer (1.5% dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, after which the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 2% gelatin for 1 h and probed with monoclonal antibody to Cdc42 (clone 21, BD Biosciences) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (GE Healthcare). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with metavinculin/vinculin polyclonal antibody (custom prepared by BABCO, Richmond, CA). Assessment of Cdc42 Activation—The activation of Cdc42 was determined by using an assay kit (BK034) from Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO. Four small muscle strips (0.6–0.8 × 0.8–1 mm) that were pooled after identical treatment by reversible permeabilization or a large fresh muscle strip (2–3 × 20 mm) were used for each determination of Cdc42 activation. Pulverized muscle tissues were mixed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% sucrose, and 50% glutathione beads for 15 min at 4 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were reacted with GST-tagged p21-activated kinase (PAK)-p21-activated kinase binding domain (PBD) in a binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, and 2% Nonidet P-40) followed by the addition of 50% glutathione beads. Active and GTP-bound Cdc42 selectively binds to PAK-PBD tagged with GST, which can be affinity-precipitated by glutathione beads. The pelleted beads were collected after centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. The pellet was boiled in sample buffer (1.5% dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Blots of the samples were incubated with Cdc42 antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by ECL. Analysis of Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—Muscle strips were rapidly frozen at desired time points after contractile stimulation and then immersed in acetone containing 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm dithiothreitol (acetone-trichloroacetic acid-dithiothreitol) that was precooled with dry ice. Strips were thawed in acetone-trichloroacetic acid-dithiothreitol at room temperature and then washed 4 times with acetone-dithiothreitol. Proteins were extracted for 60 min in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris base, 22 mm glycine, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Myosin light chains (MLCs) were separated by glycerol-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk and incubated with polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit myosin light chain 20 antibody. The primary antibody was reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (ICN). Unphosphorylated and phosphorylated bands of MLCs were visualized by ECL and quantified by scanning densitometry. MLC phosphorylation was calculated as the ratio of phosphorylated MLCs to total MLCs. Analysis of F-actin/G-actin Ratio—The concentration of F-actin and G-actin in smooth muscle tissues was measured using an assay kit from Cytoskeleton as described previously (4Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 21-35Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, each of the smooth muscle strips was homogenized in 200 μl of F-actin stabilization buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0011% antifoam, 1 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 500 μg/ml tosyl arginine methyl ester). The supernatants of protein extracts were collected after centrifugation at 151,000 × g for 60 min at 37 °C. The pellets were resuspended in ice-cold distilled H2O plus 1 μm cytochalasin D and then incubated on ice for 1 h to dissociate F-actin. The resuspended pellets were gently mixed every 15 min. The supernatant of the resuspended pellets was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Equal volumes of the first supernatant (G-actin) or second supernatant (F-actin) were subjected to analysis by immunoblot using anti-actin antibody. The amount of F-actin and G-actin was determined by scanning densitometry. Assessment of Protein Interactions by Co-immunoprecipitation—Ten small muscle strips that were pooled after identical treatment by reversible permeabilization or a large muscle strip that had not been treated by reversible permeabilization was used for each measurement of co-immunoprecipitation. Muscle extracts containing equal amounts of protein were precleared for 30 min with 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The precleared extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. The extracts were incubated 2–3 h with goat polyclonal antibody against N-WASp (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated for 2 h with 125 μl of a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads conjugated to rabbit anti-goat Ig. Immunocomplexes were washed four times in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. All procedures of immunoprecipitation were performed at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were divided into two parts; the lower part was probed with monoclonal antibody for Cdc42 (BD Biosciences), stripped and reprobed with polyclonal Arp2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The upper part was probed with N-WASp antibody. Proteins were quantitated by scanning densitometry of immunoblots. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analysis was performed using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Comparison among multiple groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences between pairs of groups were analyzed by Student-Newman-Keuls test or Dunn's method. Values of n refer to the number of experiments used to obtain each value. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Effect of ACh Stimulation on Cdc42 Activation in Smooth Muscle Strips—We assessed the effect of contractile stimulation on the activation of Cdc42 in smooth muscle tissues. Tracheal smooth muscle strips were stimulated with 10–5m ACh for 1, 5, or 10 min, or they were unstimulated. Extracts of these muscle tissues were mixed with GST-PBD that selectively binds to active Cdc42. The active Cdc42/GST-PBD complex was separated using glutathione affinity beads. The amount of active Cdc42 was determined by immunoblot analysis using Cdc42 antibody. The amount of Cdc42 in the GST complex precipitates obtained from unstimulated tissues was lower than that in stimulated tissues (Fig. 1A). The levels of Cdc42 in the precipitates were approximately three times higher after 1, 5, or 10 min of stimulation of muscle tissues with ACh (Fig. 1, B and C, n = 5–10, p < 0.05). The results suggest that contractile stimulation induces the activation of Cdc42 in smooth muscle. Expression of Recombinant Cdc42 Proteins in Smooth Muscle Tissues—To determine whether Cdc42 plays a role in regulating smooth muscle contraction, we introduced plasmids encoding wild type Cdc42 or the dominant negative Cdc42 mutant Asn-17 into smooth muscle strips by reversible permeabilization. These strips were then maintained in an incubator for 2 days. Expression of these untagged wild type and mutant Cdc42 in smooth muscle strips was assessed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, the protein levels of Cdc42 were higher in muscle strips transfected with plasmids for recombinant proteins than in strips not treated with plasmids. To ensure the accuracy of protein loading, we also assessed the protein levels of the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and metavinculin, a muscle isoform of vinculin present in smooth muscle. The levels of metavinculin/vinculin were similar in untransfected strips, strips expressing wild type Cdc42, and tissues expressing Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant (Fig. 2A). The ratios of Cdc42 to metavinculin/vinculin were approximately twice as high in muscle strips expressing wild type or Asn-17 Cdc42 than in muscle tissues not treated with plasmids (Fig. 2B, n = 4, p < 0.05). Inhibition of Tension Development by Expression of the Cdc42 Mutant Asn-17—We assessed the effect of the expression of wild type or mutant Cdc42 on contractile force by evaluating ACh-induced contraction in muscle strips transfected with plasmids encoding wild type Cdc42 or the Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant. Force in response to 10–5m ACh was compared before and after the 2-day incubation period. In muscle strips not transfected with plasmids and strips transfected with wild type recombinant Cdc42, contractile force in response to stimulation with ACh was similar before and after the 2-day incubation period (Fig. 3A). In muscle strips transfected with Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant, isometric force in response to stimulation with ACh was 10–20% of the preincubation force (Fig. 3B, n = 8–10, p < 0.05). Effects of Asn-17 Cdc42 Mutant on the F-actin/G-actin Ratio in Smooth Muscle Tissues—We determined whether the Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant affects actin polymerization by assessing the effects of Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant on the F-actin/G-actin ratio in smooth muscle. Smooth muscle strips treated with plasmids encoding wild type Cdc42 and the Cdc42 mutant Asn-17 were stimulated with 10–5m ACh for 5 min for the analysis of F-actin and G-actin. The ratio of F-actin/G-actin was analyzed by fractionation followed by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the extracts of muscle tissues not treated with plasmids, the ratio of F-actin to G-actin was 3.98 ± 0.76 in unstimulated strips and 8.79 ± 2.30 in stimulated strips 5 min after stimulation with ACh (Fig. 4, p < 0.05, n = 4). Contractile stimulation led to a significant increase in the ratio of F-actin/G-actin in smooth muscle tissues expressing wild type Cdc42; however, contractile stimulation did not significantly increase the ratio of F-actin/G-actin in strips expressing Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant (Fig. 4, p > 0.05, n = 4). Effect of Cdc42 Mutant on Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation in Response to Contractile Stimulation—Smooth muscle strips treated with plasmids encoding wild type Cdc42, Asn-17 Cdc42 mutants, or not treated with plasmids were frozen for the analysis of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Myosin light chain phosphorylation was determined 5 min after contractile activation with 10–5m ACh. Force and myosin light chain phosphorylation in response to ACh stimulation are at a steady state by this time (23Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C874-C883Crossref Google Scholar, 24Mehta D. Wu M.F. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C243-C252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although force production was dramatically depressed (Fig. 3), the increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation in strips expressing Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant was similar to that of the muscle strips not treated with plasmids (Fig. 5). The mean increases in myosin light chain phosphorylation 5 min after ACh stimulation in the tissues not treated with plasmids and in the muscle tissues expressing wild type Cdc42 and Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant were not significantly different (Fig. 5, n = 4–5, p > 0.05). The Interaction of Cdc42 with N-WASp in Smooth Muscle in Response to ACh Stimulation—In vitro studies have shown that the activity of N-WASp may be regulated by binding to the small GTPase Cdc42 (17Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 25Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F117-F120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we evaluated the effect of contractile stimulation on the association of Cdc42 with N-WASp in smooth muscle tissues. Extracts of smooth muscle strips that had been treated with 10–5m ACh for 5 min were immunoprecipitated with N-WASp antibody. Blots of N-WASp immunoprecipitates were probed using Cdc42 antibody, stripped, and reprobed with N-WASp antibody. As a control for nonspecific protein associations with the immunoprecipitates, membranes were also blotted for Rho GTPase and PKCα (n = 3). Although Rho and PKCα were found in tissue homogenates of smooth muscle, neither of them were detected in the N-WASp immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6, A and B) indicating that these two proteins do not associate with N-WASp in smooth muscle tissues. Stimulation with ACh resulted in an increase in the association of Cdc42 with N-WASp immunocomplexes from smooth muscle tissues. As shown in Fig. 6C, the amount of Cdc42 that co-immunoprecipitated with N-WASp was significantly greater in the ACh-stimulated tissues than in unstimulated strips. The mean ratio of Cdc42/N-WASp was significantly higher in immunoprecipitates obtained from stimulated muscles as compared with unstimulated muscle strips (Fig. 6D, n = 4, p < 0.05). The Association of N-WASp with Arp2 in ACh-stimulated Smooth Muscle Strips—We evaluated the effects of contractile stimulation with ACh on the association of N-WASp with Arp2, a major component of the Arp2/3 complex. Tracheal smooth muscle strips were stimulated with 10–5m ACh for 5 min or they were not stimulated. Extracts of these muscle strips were immunoprecipitated with N-WASp antibody, and N-WASp immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed using Arp2 antibody, stripped, and reprobed with N-WASp antibody. Contractile stimulation led to an increase in the association of N-WASp with Arp2 in smooth muscle strips. More Arp2 was detected in N-WASp immunoprecipitates from tracheal muscle strips that had been stimulated with ACh (Fig. 7A). The ratio of Arp2/N-WASp in extracts from stimulated tissues was significantly higher than in extracts from unstimulated strips (Fig. 7B, n = 5, p < 0.05). Effects of the Dominant Negative Asn-17 Cdc42 Mutant on the Association of N-WASp with Cdc42 and Arp2 in Smooth Muscle Tissues—We evaluated whether expression of the dominant negative Cdc42 mutant affects the increase in the association of Cdc42 with N-WASp and the activation of N-WASp as indicated by the association of N-WASp with the protein constituents of the Arp2/3 complex. Tracheal smooth muscle strips that were incubated for 2 days with plasmids encoding wild type Cdc42 or plasmids for Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant were stimulated with ACh for 5 min, or they were not stimulated. Untransfected muscle strips were also subjected to the same treatments. The association of N-WASp with Cdc42 and Arp2 was then determined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. In untransfected tissues and in tissues expressing wild type cdc42, the amount of Cdc42 and Arp2 that associated with N-WASp immunoprecipitates was increased in response to ACh stimulation (Fig. 8). However, in muscle strips expressing the Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant, ACh stimulation of smooth muscle did not significantly increase the amount of Cdc42 and Arp2 that co-immunoprecipitated with N-WASp. The ratios of Cdc42 to N-WASp and Arp2 to N-WASp were significantly lower in ACh-stimulated muscle tissues expressing the Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant than in untransfected tissues or muscle strips expressing wild type Cdc42 (Fig. 8, B and C, n = 4, p < 0.05). This indicates that the dominant negative Cdc42 inhibits the association of endogenous Cdc42 with N-WASp and impairs the activation of N-WASp. The essential role of actin polymerization in the regulation of active tension development in response to stimulation with contractile agonists has been documented in a number of smooth muscle tissues (2Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 1994; 255: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Youn T. Kim S.A. Hai C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1601-C1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Adler K.B. Krill J. Alberghini T.V. Evans J.N. Cell Motil. 1983; 3: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Tang D.D. Wu M.F. Opazo Saez A.M. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 542: 501-513Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, the signaling pathways by which contractile stimuli activate the polymerization of actin in smooth muscle remain to be determined. The results of the present study demonstrate that Cdc42 plays a critical role in the regulation of actin polymerization and active tension development in tracheal smooth muscle. Furthermore, we find that Cdc42 regulates actin polymerization without affecting myosin light chain phosphorylation. Our data suggest that Cdc42 may trigger actin polymerization in smooth muscle by activating N-WASp and the Arp2/3 complex. These results suggest a novel role for Cdc42 in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. To evaluate the function of Cdc42 in smooth muscle, we introduced plasmids encoding wild type Cdc42 and the dominant negative mutant Asn-17 Cdc42 into canine tracheal smooth muscle tissues by a method of reversible permeabilization (4Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 21-35Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Opazo S.A. Zhang W. Wu Y. Turner C.E. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C433-C447Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The expression of the recombinant proteins in the smooth muscle tissues was verified by immunoblot analysis. Whereas expression of wild type Cdc42 in smooth muscle did not inhibit contractile force, expression of the dominant negative Cdc42 mutant inhibited active tension development in response to ACh stimulation. In muscle strips expressing wild type Cdc42, ACh stimulation caused significant increases in the ratio of F-actin to G-actin during contractile stimulation. However, the expression of the inactive Cdc42 mutant inhibited actin polymerization stimulated by the contractile agonist. These results suggest that Cdc42 activation is important in the regulation of actin polymerization and tension development in smooth muscle tissues in response to contractile stimulation. We considered possible mechanisms by which Cdc42 might regulate actin polymerization in smooth muscle. In non-muscle cells, Cdc42 has been shown to regulate the formation and organization of actin structures such as lamellipodia and filapodia (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These structures form at the leading edge of crawling cells and function to propel the edge of the membrane forward. The formation of these actin structures is also important for other cell functions including phagocytosis and cell adhesion. Biochemical studies in vitro and studies in fibroblasts have implicated Cdc42 in the activation of N-WASp, a ubiquitously expressed WASp-family protein that can activate the Arp2/3 complex-mediated formation of new actin filaments when activated by an external stimulus (17Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 18Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In recent studies we have observed that the introduction of an inhibitory N-WASp carboxyl-terminal peptide into tracheal muscle strips or expression of plasmids encoding this inhibitory peptide in tracheal muscle strips inhibits tension development and actin polymerization in response to stimulation with ACh (19Zhang W.W. Tang D.D. Wu Y.D. Gunst S.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: A1086Google Scholar). In the present study, we assessed the effect of contractile stimulation on the association of Cdc42 with N-WASp in extracts from tracheal smooth muscle tissues. The association of N-WASp with both Cdc42 and Arp2 (a major component of the Arp2/3 complex) was greater in extracts from smooth muscle tissues that had been stimulated with ACh. The expression of the dominant negative Cdc42 Asn-17 mutant inhibited the increase in association of N-WASp with Cdc42 and the Arp2/3 complex in response to agonist stimulation. These results suggest that Cdc42 may regulate actin polymerization in smooth muscle by regulating the activation of N-WASp, which in turn activates the Arp2/3 complex. We found that the F-actin/G-actin ratio in unstimulated smooth muscle tissues was ∼4, and that contractile stimulation increased the ratio of F-actin/G-actin to ∼8. This result suggests that the F-actin pool constitutes ∼80% of the total actin in unstimulated tracheal smooth muscle tissues and that contractile stimulation increases F-actin to nearly 90% of the total actin. These results are similar to our previous findings in this tissue (2Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 21-35Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Tang D.D. Wu M.F. Opazo Saez A.M. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 542: 501-513Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which a relatively small change in the amount of actin might regulate tension development remains speculative. We have previously reported that the treatment of freshly dissociated tracheal smooth cells with inhibitors that cause substantial inhibition of actin polymerization does not result alterations in the organization of actin filaments or cellular structure that are evident on electron micrographs (2Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, detailed quantitative morphometric analysis of electron micrographs of tracheal muscle tissues has provided evidence for an increase in the number of actin filaments in tracheal muscle after contractile stimulation (27Herrera A.M. Martinez E.C. Seow C.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1161-L1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In motile cells, WASp family proteins bind to the membrane upon activation where they activate the Arp2/3 complex to catalyze the nucleation of actin filaments that branch from existing actin filaments at a 70° angle (15Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 17Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 18Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the actin polymerization mediated by Cdc42 during the contractile stimulation of smooth muscle tissues occurs in local pools of submembranous actin. This actin might serve to regulate the connections of actin filaments to proteins at sites of cell adhesion and thereby regulate tension development and cytoskeletal organization. We also considered the possibility that the inhibition of tension development in smooth muscle by dominant negative Cdc42 was caused by an inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation because myosin light chain phosphorylation is recognized as the primary mechanism for the activation of cross-bridge cycling and tension development during contractile stimulation (28Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 29Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, we found that the expression of Asn-17 Cdc42 mutant protein had no effect on myosin light chain phosphorylation in response to ACh stimulation, indicating that this was unlikely to be the mechanism for its inhibition of active tension development in these tissues. Several previous studies of permeabilized smooth muscle tissues and cultured cells have provided evidence that Cdc42 activation enhances the activity of PAK, which can phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase and inhibit its activity (30Wirth A.

These observations suggest that the activation of Cdc42 might depress myosin light chain phosphorylation because of the inhibition of myosin light chain kinase activity. Based on these observations the dominant negative Asn-17 Cdc42 would be expected to prevent PAK activation and myosin light chain kinase inhibition and thereby prevent the inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation. However, we found no effect of the overexpression of wild type Cdc42 on myosin light chain phosphorylation or active tension, suggesting that Cdc42 does not significantly affect the activity of myosin light chain kinase in intact tracheal smooth muscle tissues during muscarinic stimulation. This difference may reflect the dominance of Ca2+-mediated regulation of myosin light chain kinase in the tracheal tissues in which Ca2+-signaling is intact, or it could reflect differences in the experimental preparations used for these studies. In additional studies, the introduction of a constitutively active Cdc42 mutant into β-escin-permeabilized rabbit portal vein smooth muscle tissues has been reported to inhibit the Ca2+-sensitization of tension development induced by the administration of a constitutively active RhoA mutant (34Gong M.C. Gorenne I. Read P. Jia T. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C257-C269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may also reflect an effect of Cdc42 on signaling processes present in permeabilized tissues stimulated by the introduction of an activated protein that are not as prominent in intact tissues subjected to pharmacological stimulation. In summary, contractile stimulation with acetylcholine increases the activation of Cdc42 in tracheal smooth muscle tissues. The expression of a dominant negative Cdc42 mutant in smooth muscle tissues dramatically inhibits tension generation and prevents actin polymerization in response to contractile stimulation without significantly inhibiting myosin light chain phosphorylation. These results suggest that Cdc42 activation plays a critical role in the regulation of actin polymerization and active tension generation in tracheal smooth muscle. Cdc42 may regulate actin polymerization and tension in smooth muscle by regulating the activation of N-WASp and the Arp2/3 complex. These results suggest a novel signaling pathway for the regulation of agonist-induced contraction in smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2091829876,"Late Cenozoic terrestrial fossil records of North America are biased by a predominance of mid-latitude deposits, mostly in the western half of the continent. Consequently, the biological history of eastern North America, including the eastern deciduous forest, remains largely hidden. Unfortunately, vertebrate fossil sites from this vast region are rare, and few pertain to the critically important late Tertiary period, during which intensified global climatic changes took place. Moreover, strong phylogenetic affinities between the flora of eastern North America and eastern Asia clearly demonstrate formerly contiguous connections, but disparity among shared genera (eastern Asia-eastern North America disjunction) implies significant periods of separation since at least the Miocene epoch. Lacustrine sediments deposited within a former sinkhole in the southern Appalachian Mountains provide a rare example of a late Miocene to early Pliocene terrestrial biota from a forested ecosystem. Here we show that the vertebrate remains contained within this deposit represent a unique combination of North American and Eurasian taxa. A new genus and species of the red (lesser) panda (Pristinailurus bristoli), the earliest and most primitive so far known, was recovered. Also among the fauna are a new species of Eurasian badger (Arctomeles dimolodontus) and the largest concentration of fossil tapirs ever recorded. Cladistical analyses of the two new carnivores strongly suggest immigration events that were earlier than and distinct from previous records, and that the close faunal affinities between eastern North America and eastern Asia in the late Tertiary period are consistent with the contemporaneous botanical record."
https://openalex.org/W2091598878,"Calbindin (CaBP)-D28k and CaBP-D9k are cytosolic vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding proteins long thought to play an important role in transepithelial calcium transport. However, recent genetic studies suggest that CaBP-D28k is not essential for calcium metabolism. Genetic ablation of this gene in mice leads to no calcemic abnormalities. Genetic inactivation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene leads to hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, rickets, and osteomalacia, accompanied by 90% reduction in renal CaBP-D9k expression but little change in CaBP-D28k. To address whether the role of CaBP-D28k in calcium homeostasis is compensated by CaBP-D9k, we generated VDR/CaBP-D28k double knockout (KO) mice, which expressed no CaBP-D28k and only 10% of CaBP-D9k in the kidney. On a regular diet, the double KO mice were more growth-retarded and 42% smaller in body weight than VDRKO mice and died prematurely at 2.5–3 months of age. Compared with VDRKO mice, the double KO mice had higher urinary calcium excretion and developed more severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and rachitic skeletal phenotype, which were manifested by larger parathyroid glands, higher serum parathyroid hormone levels, much lower bone mineral density, and more distorted growth plate with more osteoid formation in the trabecular region. On high calcium, high lactose diet, blood-ionized calcium levels were normalized in both VDRKO and the double KO mice; however, in contrast to VDRKO mice, the skeletal abnormalities were not completely corrected in the double KO mice. These results directly demonstrate that CaBP-D28k plays a critical role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and skeletal mineralization and suggest that its calcemic role can be mostly compensated by CaBP-D9k.

These results directly demonstrate that CaBP-D28k plays a critical role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and skeletal mineralization and suggest that its calcemic role can be mostly compensated by CaBP-D9k. It is well established that calcium homeostasis is primarily maintained by the vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone; CaBP, calbindin; VDR, vitamin D receptor; KO, knockout; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; pQCT, peripheral quantitative computed tomography; BMD, bone mineral density; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone; CaBP, calbindin; VDR, vitamin D receptor; KO, knockout; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; pQCT, peripheral quantitative computed tomography; BMD, bone mineral density; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; WT, wild type. endocrine systems. In this regard, the principal role of vitamin D is to regulate calcium transport in the intestine and kidney. Intestinal and renal distal tubular calcium transfer consists of a passive, concentration gradient-dependent paracellular transport and an active, ATP-dependent transcellular transport (1Bronner F. Pansu D. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The latter is largely regulated by vitamin D and is crucial when calcium supply is low. It is believed that the vitamin D-mediated transcellular calcium transport in the duodenum and renal distal tubules involves three sequential steps: entry, intracellular movement, and extrusion. Influx of luminal calcium into the epithelial cells is propelled by a steep electrochemical gradient across the apical membrane, saturable at high levels of luminal calcium, and mediated by apical calcium channels (2Fullmer C.S. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Hoenderop J.G. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. Am. J.

Once in the cytosol, calcium binds to the vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding proteins, calbindins (CaBPs), which ferry calcium from the apical to the basolateral portion of the cell, where the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and Ca2+-dependent ATPase on the basolateral membrane extrude calcium into extracellular fluids (5Hoenderop J.G.

It is believed that the apical to basolateral intracellular movement of calcium ions is the rate-limiting step and is highly dependent upon the cellular concentration of CaBPs, which are regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the hormonal form of vitamin D.CaBPs belong to a family of high affinity calcium-binding proteins that contain the EF-hand structural motif required for calcium binding. Two kinds of CaBPs have been identified: CaBP-D9k, which is mainly expressed in the intestine and kidney, and CaBP-D28k, which is mainly expressed in the kidney and neurons (8Christakos S. Gabrielides C. Rhoten W.B. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Studies from many laboratories have shown that the expression of both CaBP-D9k and CaBP-D28k is induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (9Cao L.P. Bolt M.J. Wei M. Sitrin M.D. Li Y.C. Arch. Biochem.

Thus, CaBPs are important vitamin D target genes in the regulation of calcium metabolism.The co-expression of CaBP-D9k and CaBP-D28k in renal distal tubular cells has long suggested that both are involved in calcium reabsorption. In support of this belief, it has been shown that the development of sustained hypocalcemia in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) knockout (KO) mice is associated with a drastic reduction in renal CaBP-D9k expression (10Li Y.C. Bolt M.J.G. Cao L.-P. Sitrin M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E558-E564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of CaBP-D28k in calcium homeostasis remains controversial. In particular, genetic ablation of the CaBP-D28k gene in mice results in no calcemic abnormalities, with normal serum calcium and phosphate levels (17Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and in VDR KO mice, despite their severe hypocalcemia, renal expression of CaBP-D28k is relatively normal (10Li Y.C. Bolt M.J.G. Cao L.-P. Sitrin M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E558-E564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations may be explained by at least two possibilities. One is that CaBP-D28k is not required for maintaining calcium homeostasis; the other is that the role of CaBP-D28k in calcium metabolism is important but dispensable, and its function can be compensated by CaBP-D9k. To investigate these possibilities, we generated and analyzed mice that lack both VDR and CaBP-D28k. Our data obtained from these mice provide direct in vivo evidence that CaBP-D28k plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis and skeletal mineralization.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and Breeding Strategy—Generation and characterization of VDR(-/-) mice have been described elsewhere (18Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice were generated by Airaksinen et al. (17Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) double KO mice were produced by two breeding steps. First VDR(+/-) mice were bred with CaBP-D28k(-/-) to obtain VDR(+/-)/CaBP-D28k(+/-) mice. Then VDR(+/-)/CaBP-D28k(+/-) × VDR(+/-)/CaBP-D28k(+/-) breeding gave rise to VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice, among other genotypes. Mouse offspring genotyping was carried out by PCR as described previously (17Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 18Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The animals were housed in a barrier facility on 12-h dark/12-h light cycles. One part of the mouse colonies was fed the regular rodent chow (containing 1% calcium), and another part of the colonies was raised on a high calcium, high lactose diet (HCa-Lac) containing 2% calcium, 1.5% phosphate, and 20% lactose (TD96348, Teklad, Madison, WI) that has been shown to normalize blood-ionized calcium levels in VDR(-/-) mice (19Li Y.C. Amling M. Pirro A.E. Priemel M. Meuse J. Baron R. Delling G. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The body weight and food intake of these mice were determined at 21, 30, 45, and 60 days after birth. To collect urine samples, mice were housed individually in metabolic cages, and urine was collected for 24 h. In all experiments, VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice were analyzed in parallel with age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT), CaBP-D28k(-/-), and VDR(-/-) mice. The use of mice in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Chicago.Blood, Serum, and Urinary Parameters—Blood ionized calcium levels were determined using a Model 634 Ca2+/pH analyzer as described before (20Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Concentrations of serum phosphorus and urinary calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine were determined by using a Beckman CX5 Autoanalyzer as described previously (20Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Serum-intact PTH levels were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Immutopics, San Clements, CA) (20Li Y.C. Kong J. Wei M. Chen Z.F. Liu S.Q. Cao L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.Histological Analysis of Parathyroid Glands and Kidney—The thyroid and parathyroid glands were dissected en bloc with the trachea and fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde made in PBS (pH 7.2). Kidneys were dissected and immediately fixed with similar procedures. The samples were processed and embedded in paraffin, and serial sections (6 μm) were cut with a Leica 2030 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.Analysis of Bones—The long bones and vertebrae were dissected after mice were sacrificed and fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde made in PBS (pH 7.2) after muscles were removed. A high resolution digital x-ray radiographic analysis was conducted using a MX-20 Specimen Radiograph System (Faxitron X-Ray Corp., Wheeling, IL) set at 18 kVp and 5 min. The length of the tibia (from midpoint of tibial plateau to the midpoint of distal tibia) and femur (from the midpoint of the femoral condyles to the tip of the greater trochanter) was measured. The bones (from three to five mice in each genotype) were analyzed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) as well as by histological sectioning described below.pQCT Analysis—pQCT was carried out using a Stratec XCT 960 M (Norland Medical Systems, Fort Atkinson, WI) as described previously (21Beamer W.G. Donahue L.R. Rosen C.J. Baylink D.J. Bone. 1996; 18: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Briefly, femurs and tibiae were analyzed using the manufacturer-supplied software program “XMICE version 1.3” for total bone mineral density, cortical density, and trabecular percentage. A threshold of 1,300 attenuation units was used to differentiate bone from soft tissues, and a threshold of 2,000 was used to differentiate high density cortical bone from low density trabecular bone. Calibration of the pQCT was routinely performed with a set of hydroxyapatite standards. Two femurs or tibiae were placed in the holder each time, and measurements were taken at the diaphyseal midpoint identified in the XCT 960 M scout view.Bone Histology—For histological analyses, knee joints of distal femur and proximal tibia were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS (pH 7.2), decalcified, and embedded in paraffin by standard histological procedures as described previously (22Feng J.Q. Zhang J. Dallas S.L. Lu Y. Chen S. Tan X. Owen M. Harris S.E. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sections were cut and stained with Safranin O (Sigma), followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin, to visualize proteoglycans (23An Y.H. Martin K.L. Handbook of Histology Methods for Bone and Cartilage. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 295-352Google Scholar). Bone samples from the other side of the same animals were undecalcified and embedded in methylmethacrylate (Sigma). Five-micron sections were cut and stained with Goldner's trichrome by standard procedures (23An Y.H. Martin K.L. Handbook of Histology Methods for Bone and Cartilage. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 295-352Google Scholar), followed by histomorphometric analyses.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Total RNAs were extracted from freshly dissected tissues using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). VDR, CaBP-D9k, and CaBP-D28k mRNA transcripts were analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (10Li Y.C. Bolt M.J.G. Cao L.-P. Sitrin M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E558-E564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNAs were separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. After hybridization the mRNAs were detected by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then stripped and rehybridized with 32P-labeled 36B4 cDNA probe for internal loading control.Western Blot—The protein level of VDR, CaBP-D9k, and CaBP-D28k was determined by Western blot as described previously (10Li Y.C. Bolt M.J.G. Cao L.-P. Sitrin M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E558-E564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Real Time RT-PCR—Renal expression of TRPV 5 and TRPV6 mRNAs was assessed by real time RT-PCR. Briefly, first strand cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total kidney RNAs in a 50-μl reaction using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12–18 as the primer. The cDNAs were then used as the template (5 μl per reaction) for real time PCR amplification. Real time PCR was carried out using a Cepheid Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and a SYBR Green PCR Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR primers for mouse TRPV5 are 5′-CCAGGATAAGATCCGGCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGTAGCGAGAGGCACCAA-3′ (reverse) and for mouse TRPV6 are 5′-GAGGATCCCGATGAGCTGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGCAGATCCACGTCATAGT-3′ (reverse). These primers were designed according to the cDNA sequences of mouse TRPV5 and TRPV6 as deposited in the GenBank™ data base. GAPDH was used as the internal control for each reaction. GAPDH primers are 5′-CAACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC-3′ (reverse). All primers were tested for their specificity by conventional PCR before being used for the real time PCR quantitative studies. The Ct value for each gene was obtained from the real time PCRs, and the starting amount of each target mRNA was calculated based on a calibration curve and the Ct value. The amount of mRNA for each gene was normalized to GAPDH mRNA and presented as relative values.Statistical Analysis—Data were presented as the mean ± S.D. and analyzed with Student's t test to assess significance. p values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant.RESULTSA multistep breeding strategy was designed to obtain VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice. Because both VDR(-/-) and CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice were already backcrossed into the C57BL/6 background for at least eight generations, there was little background interference in data interpretation. As shown in Fig. 1, CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice expressed a normal level of VDR and CaBP-D9k, whereas VDR(-/-) mice showed a drastic reduction in CaBP-D9k expression in the kidney at both mRNA and protein levels while maintaining a relatively normal level of CaBP-D28k expression. Exactly as expected, VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice expressed no VDR, no CaBP-D28k, and a very low level of CaBP-D9k as seen in VDR(-/-) mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with the previous estimation (10Li Y.C. Bolt M.J.G. Cao L.-P. Sitrin M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E558-E564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both VDR(-/-) and double KO mice expressed ∼10% of CaBP-D9k in the kidney, relative to the WT levels. Thus, a nearly complete elimination of CaBP proteins was achieved in the kidney of the double KO mice. Both VDR(-/-) and double KO mice maintained about 30% CaBP-D9k in the duodenum, relative to the WT levels (Fig. 1C). Therefore, there was no compensatory increase of CaBP-D9k expression in either the kidney or the intestine in CaBP-D28k(-/-) and VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice.The gross appearance of 2-month old WT, CaBP-D28k(-/-), VDR(-/-), and VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice is shown in Fig. 2. Most double KO mice died at 2.5–3 months of age on regular diet. The premature death was usually accompanied with difficulties in breathing in the last few days of life, but the cause of death was unclear. The body weight of CaBP-D28K(-/-) mice was about the same as WT mice, and VDR(-/-) mice were about 25–30% smaller than WT mice. The double KO mice were the smallest, with a body mass 58% smaller than WT mice and 42% smaller than VDR(-/-) mice at 2 months of age (Fig. 2 and 3A and Table I).Fig. 2The gross appearance of WT, CaBP-D28(-/-), VDR(-/-), and VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice at 2 months of age. Although VDR(-/-) mice are known to develop alopecia, alopecia usually is not obviously seen until after 3 months of age.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Growth curve and food intake of WT, CaBP-D28(-/-), VDR(-/-), and VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice.

The body weight and growth rate of CaBP-D28(-/-) mice were the same as WT mice. Although there was no obvious difference in body size at birth, VDR(-/-) and double KO mice were markedly smaller at weaning (21 days after birth). Even though they were ∼25% smaller than WT mice, VDR(-/-) mice were able to maintain a growth rate similar to that of WT mice. In contrast, the double KO mice were more growth-retarded and had a lower growth rate, so the body mass difference between the double KO mice and the WT or VDR(-/-) mice was greater at 2 months than at weaning (Fig. 3A). Food intake of WT and CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice was about the same, and food intake of VDR(-/-) and the double KO mice was about 20 and 50% less than that of WT mice, respectively. However, after the food intake was normalized to body weight, there was no significant difference among these four types of mice during this 2-month period (Fig. 3B). Food intake decreased with age in all mice.As shown previously (17Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 18Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice maintained normal levels of blood-ionized calcium and serum phosphorus and PTH, and VDR(-/-) mice developed hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, with a 30% drop in blood-ionized calcium levels, a 40-fold increase in serum PTH levels, and a modest decrease in serum phosphorus levels at 2 months of age in comparison with WT mice (Table I). These changes were accompanied by a dramatic increase in parathyroid glandular size (Fig. 4C), driven by cell proliferation (19Li Y.C. Amling M. Pirro A.E. Priemel M. Meuse J. Baron R. Delling G. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two-month-old double KO mice had approximately the same low levels of blood-ionized calcium and serum phosphorus, but a much higher serum PTH level (a 68-fold increase over the WT level), as compared with VDR(-/-) mice (Table I). Consistently, the parathyroid gland of the double KO mice showed the largest increase in absolute size (Fig. 4D). In fact, the parathyroid hyperplasia was even more dramatic when normalized to body weight, considering that the double KO mice were much smaller than VDR(-/-) mice (Table I and Figs. 2 and 3A). Despite the severe hypocalcemia, urinary calcium excretion in VDR(-/-) mice remained approximately the same as seen in WT and CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice (Table I), suggesting renal calcium wasting. Renal calcium wasting was even more severe in the double KO mice, as their urinary calcium concentration was significantly higher than that of VDR(-/-) and WT mice (Table I). There was no significant difference in urinary phosphorus excretion among WT, CaBP-D28k(-/-), and VDR(-/-) mice, but the phosphorus levels in the urine of the double KO mice were significantly higher (Table I). This observation is consistent with our previous studies showing that urinary phosphorus excretion in VDR(-/-) and WT mice is similar (10Li Y.C. Bolt M.J.G. Cao L.-P. Sitrin M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E558-E564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphaturia seen in the double KO mice may reflect the more severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in these mice.Fig. 4Histology of the parathyroid glands. Sections of the trachea-thyroid-parathyroid region were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Shown are representative slides of the parathyroid gland from WT (A), CaBP-D28(-/-) (B), VDR(-/-) (C), and VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-)(D) mice at 2 months of age.

As shown in Fig. 5, the long bones (tibia and femur) of VDR(-/-) mice were 10–15% shorter than those of WT mice, whereas the long bones of the double KO mice were 10–14% shorter than those of VDR(-/-) mice (Fig. 5B). Bone mineralization, as revealed by contact x-ray radiography, was more reduced in the double KO mice than in VDR(-/-) mice, especially in the cortical and trabecular bones (Fig. 5A). Consistent with these observations, pQCT analysis demonstrated a remarkable reduction in total, trabecular, and cortical BMD in the long bones of the double KO mice compared with all other groups (Fig. 5C). Compared with WT mice, total BMD of VDR(-/-) mice was reduced by 23%, whereas that of double KO mice was reduced by 57% (Fig. 5C). The BMD in trabecular and cortical bones was reduced by 14 and 17% in VDR(-/-) mice and by 42 and 53% in the double KO mice, respectively (Fig. 5C). Most interestingly, although the bones of CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice appeared normal, a moderate but significant reduction was detected in total and cortical BMD (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Bone data from WT, CaBP-D28(-/-), VDR(-/-), and VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) mice at 2 months of age.

These were characterized by a highly irregular and disorganized growth plate, a marked expansion of the hypertropic chondrocyte zone, and a dramatic increase in osteoid content in trabecular and cortical bones (Fig. 6). Large clusters of immature, poorly mineralized woven bones were present in VDR(-/-) and the double KO mice, indicating impaired mineralization of the newly formed bones (Fig. 6, G and H). Compared with VDR(-/-) mice, however, the double KO mice displayed much more severe skeletal abnormalities. The growth plate was more deformed, and the chondrocyte columns appeared more discontinuous and disoriented (compared Fig. 6, C and D); Goldner trichrome staining showed much more unmineralized osteoid accumulation (pink staining) throughout the trabecular and metaphysis regions in the double KO mice (compare Fig. 6, G and H).Fig. 6Histological analysis of the bones from 2-month-old WT (A and E), CaBP-D28(-/-) (B and F), VDR(-/-) (C and G), and VDR(-/-)/CaBP-D28k(-/-) (D and H) mice on a regular di"

We report here that co-activation of P2X2 and various GABAA receptors, co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, leads to a functional cross-inhibition dependent on GABAA subunit composition. Sequential applications of GABA and ATP revealed that αβ- or αβγ-containing GABAA receptors inhibited P2X2 channels, whereas P2X2 channels failed to inhibit γ-containing GABAA receptors. This functional cross-talk is independent of membrane potential, changes in current direction, and calcium. Non-additive responses observed between cation-selective GABAA and P2X2 receptors further indicate the chloride independence of this process. Overexpression of minigenes encoding either the C-terminal fragment of P2X2 or the intracellular loop of the β3 subunit disrupted the functional cross-inhibition. We previously demonstrated functional and physical cross-talk between ρ1 and P2X2 receptors, which induced a retargeting of ρ1 channels to surface clusters when co-expressed in hippocampal neurons (Boué-Grabot, E., Emerit, M. B., Toulme, E., Seguela, P., and Garret, M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 6967–6975). Co-expression of P2X2 and chimeric ρ1 receptors with the C-terminal sequences of α2, β3, or γ2 subunits indicated that only ρ1-β3 and P2X2 channels exhibit both functional cross-inhibition in Xenopus oocytes and co-clustering/retargeting in hippocampal neurons. Therefore, the C-terminal domain of P2X2 and the intracellular loop of β GABAA subunits are required for the functional interaction between ATP- and GABA-gated channels. This γ subunit-dependent cross-talk may contribute to the regulation of synaptic activity.

This γ subunit-dependent cross-talk may contribute to the regulation of synaptic activity. Synaptic transmission is achieved through the release of one or more neurotransmitters from the same presynaptic terminal, resulting in the activation of different classes of receptors co-localized at the same post-synaptic site. Recent reports have demonstrated that co-activation of distinct postsynaptic receptors by their respective transmitters induced cross-modulation of their functional properties (1Salter M.W.

Cross-talk between ligand-gated channels is characterized by current occlusion during simultaneous agonist application, although the mechanisms remain unclear. Intracellular phosphorylation pathways underlie asymmetric cross-inhibition between GABAA and glycine receptors (11Li Y. Wu L.J. Legendre P. Xu T.L. J. Biol.

Barajas-Lopez C. Chakfe Y. Blais D. Belanger D. Emerit M.B. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as between P2X2 and ρ1/GABAC (12Boue-Grabot E.

Because GABA and ATP are synaptically co-released in spinal cord and hypothalamic neurons (13Jo Y.H. Schlichter R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 14Jo Y.H. Role L.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where they activate co-localized ATP- and GABA-gated channels, cross-talk between inhibitory GABAA and excitatory P2X receptors may represent an important, fast process for controlling the signal transmission phenomenon. Therefore, our aim was to investigate a putative cross-modulation between GABAA and P2X receptors and the mechanisms underlying this process. GABA and P2X receptors have distinct structures. GABAA receptors are pentameric structures formed by differential assembly of multiple subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, θ, and ϵ), and GABAC receptors are composed of ρ1–3 subunits (15Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Mohler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G. Braestrup C. Bateson A.N. Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the subunits contains four hydrophobic transmembrane domains and extracellular termini. GABA-gated chloride channels mediate fast inhibition and thus, play a fundamental role in the physiology and physiopathology of the nervous system (16Fritschy J.M. Brunig I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 299-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The diversity of their functional properties, pharmacology, and subcellular targeting depends to a large extent on subunit composition (16Fritschy J.M. Brunig I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 299-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are ATP-gated cation channels consisting of a family of seven subunits with two transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop, and intracellular termini (17Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar). P2X receptors are implicated in fast excitatory synaptic transmission (18North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). However, little is known about purinergic transmission in the brain, despite the wide distribution of P2X receptor subunits throughout the central nervous system (19Illes P. Ribeiro J.A. Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Molecular Biology—Wild-type and YFP-tagged rat P2X2, P2X2TR, and ρ1 clones were available from previous work (9Boue-Grabot E. Barajas-Lopez C. Chakfe Y. Blais D. Belanger D. Emerit M.B. Seguela P. J.

Ahring (Neurosearch, Copenhagen) (20Jensen M.L. Timmermann D.B. Johansen T.H. Schousboe A. Varming T. Ahring P.K. J. Biol.

The cDNAs coding for rat GABAA α1, α2, α3, β3, γ2, and γ3 subunits were generated with RNA extracted from brain by reverse transcription-PCR using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) to minimize artifactual mutations. Minigenes coding for the large intracellular loop (IL2) of β3 subunits were amplified by PCR using 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides incorporating initiation methionine and stop codons, respectively, as previously described (9Boue-Grabot E. Barajas-Lopez C. Chakfe Y. Blais D. Belanger D. Emerit M.B. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the intracellular domains of P2X2 (P2X2-CT, P2X2-NT). Chimeric ρ1-α2, ρ1-β3, and ρ1-γ2 subunits were generated by replacing the ρ1 cDNA sequence from amino acid Lys379 to the stop codon by a homologous sequence of α2, β3, and γ2 subunits, respectively. The ρ1 cDNA fragment located between the natural HindIII restriction site and the 3′-end cloning site, XbaI, was replaced by a homologous α2, β3, or γ2 GABAA subunit fragment generated by PCR to create compatible HindIII and XbaI restriction enzyme sites. All constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and verified by automatic dideoxy DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech). Xenopus Oocyte Preparation and Injection—Oocytes were prepared as previously described (21Boue-Grabot E. Archambault V. Seguela P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Stage V and VI oocytes were manually defolliculated before cytoplasmic or nuclear injection (Nanoject II, Drummond) of cRNA or cDNA, respectively. 0.2 ng of cRNA coding for P2X2 or P2X2YFP, or 15 ng of RNA coding for P2X2TR, together with 10–20 ng of each of the GABA subunits, were injected to reach similar expression levels for both channels. Then the oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 and gentamycin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) at 19 °C for 1–4 days prior to electrophysiological recordings. For competition experiments, RNAs coding for minigenes were injected (50–60 ng each to reach a 2:1 minigene:receptor ratio) immediately after injection of receptor RNAs. Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were carried out at room temperature using glass pipettes (1–2 MΩ) filled with 3 m KCl solution to ensure a reliable holding potential. Oocytes were voltage clamped at -60 mV, and the membrane currents were recorded through an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments) and digitized at 500 Hz. Oocytes were perfused at a flow rate of 10–12 ml/min with Ringer's solution (Na+-R), pH 7.4, containing 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaOH, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2 or BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. Cation permeability was addressed using an extracellular solution (NMDG-R) with a low sodium concentration containing 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaOH, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 110 mm NMDG, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. All drugs (purchased from Sigma) were dissolved in the perfusion solution and applied using a computer-driven valve system (BPS8, Ala Scientific). To allow for the differences in GABA current and ATP current kinetics, we compared the peak of actual responses to the peak of predicted additive responses obtained using Axograph software (Axon Instruments) and not with the sum of the peaks of individual responses. Numerical values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were assessed using Student's t test. The differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. For I/V experiments, currents were measured at the peak of the response obtained at several membrane potentials (-60 to +30 mV). Reversal potentials (Vrev) were estimated from the I-V relationship, determined by linear regression test analysis. All data were analyzed using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Neurons were cultured as previously described (12Boue-Grabot E. Emerit M.B. Toulme E. Seguela P. Garret M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6967-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi of rat embryos were dissected on day 18. Dissociation was achieved after trypsinization, with a Pasteur pipette. Cells were counted and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated (50 μg/ml), 15-mm diameter coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences), at a density of 50,000–70,000 cells per 16-mm dish (250–350 per mm2), in complete Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), containing 1 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin G (10 units/ml)/streptomycin (10 mg/ml). Four hours after plating, the coverslips were transferred to a 90-mm dish containing conditioned medium obtained by incubating the complete medium described above on a glial culture (70–80% confluency) for 24 h. The medium was partially changed every 3–4 days. Hippocampal neurons were transfected at 7–8 days in vitro as follows: for each coverslip, a total of 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 50 μl of Neurobasal medium without B27 supplement. For co-transfection experiments, the proportions of each plasmid were first adjusted to reach similar expression levels and the plasmids were thoroughly mixed prior to the addition of 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 50 μl of Neurobasal medium. 150 μl of complete Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement was applied to the neuronal culture and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Expression was then conducted for 48 h in the original medium that was added back to the neurons. Under these conditions, the transfection rate reached 10–25%, and 60–70% of transfected neurons were co-transfected with two plasmids. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Imaging—Immunofluorescence was performed 48 h after transfection (9–10 days after plating). Coverslips were washed twice with PBS+ (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C, and fixed for 15 min with paraformaldehyde (4%) containing 4% sucrose, at 37 °C in PBS+. After three 10-min washes in PBS, they were incubated for 30 min in antibody buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 3% normal goat serum, 3% normal donkey serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). ρ1 chimeras were labeled with affinity purified anti-ρ1 antibodies (1:200) directed against the extracellular N-terminal sequence (22Boue-Grabot E. Roudbaraki M. Bascles L. Tramu G. Bloch B. Garret M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature, and revealed with AlexaFluor568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Groove, PA) at 1:1000 dilution, for 1 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence images were generated using a Leica TCS-400 laser scanning confocal microscope. Contrast and brightness were adjusted to ensure that all relevant pixels were within linear range. Images are the product of a 16-fold line average. For double labeling experiments, pictures were generated using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Quantitative Measurements of Fluorescence Profiles—Fluorescence profiles along labeled neurites were measured using Lucia 4.71 imaging software (Nikon). For each neuron, the contrast and brightness of confocal images were adjusted using identical parameters. The longest labeled neurite was then fitted with a polyline along which the fluorescence profile was plotted against the distance from the cell body. In all experiments, neurons overexpressing either receptor were excluded from the study. In co-transfection experiments, only neurons expressing similar levels of both receptors were included in the study. Variability between individual neurons was overcome by using the cumulated fluorescence profiles obtained with 50 neurons of each group as a relevant parameter for quantifying the radial distribution of ρ1 chimeras 48 h after transfection. Reciprocal Cross-inhibition between αβ-containing GABA Receptors and P2X2 Receptors—To assess whether GABAA and P2X receptors cross-modulated, we first co-expressed different combinations of GABAA subunits with P2X2 channels in Xenopus oocytes and recorded responses to separate or combined application of ATP and GABA. In oocytes co-expressing α2β3 and P2X2 channels, the application of saturating concentrations of either GABA (100 μm) or ATP (100 μm) evoked inward currents characteristic of the activation of GABAA and P2X2 receptors, respectively (Fig. 1A and Table I summarizes data in Figs. 1 and 2). However, co-application of 100 μm GABA plus 100 μm ATP evoked inward responses (Fig. 1A, Actual) significantly smaller (p < 0.0005, n = 15) than the sum of individual responses. The amplitude of IATP+GABA represented 69.40 ± 3.70% of the predicted current, i.e. the arithmetic sum of IGABA and IATP. A significant inhibition (p < 0.0005, n = 8) was also recorded when GABA was applied during ATP application, or when ATP was applied during GABA application. IATP then GABA and IGABA then ATP represented 76.90 ± 3.94% and 71.69 ± 2.6% of the predicted current, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table I). In oocytes co-expressing P2X2 and GABAA receptors formed either by α1β3, α3β3, or α2hβ1 subunits, co-activation by both agonists elicited responses significantly smaller than the sum of the individual application of ATP and GABA (Fig. 1B). IATP+GABA represented 68.58 ± 6.7% (n = 5), 60.3 ± 2.25% (n = 5), and 78.04 ± 5.95% (n = 5) of the predicted current for α1β3, α3β3, and α2hβ1, respectively. Moreover, identical inhibition was observed during sequential application (ATP then GABA or GABA then ATP). As depicted in Fig. 1B and Table I, the inhibition level (20–40%) was unaffected by receptor density (ATP plus GABA current ranged from 0.5 to 6 μA) or ATP versus GABA current ratio. In oocytes expressing P2X2 or GABAA receptors alone, ATP did not gate or modulate GABA-gated channels, and, conversely, GABA did not activate or modulate P2X2 channels (data not shown). These results showed that co-activation of P2X2 and αβ-containing GABAA receptors induced an instantaneous, bidirectional current occlusion, demonstrating that GABAA and P2X2 receptors are functionally non-independent.Table ICross-inhibition between P2X2 and various combinations of GABAA subunits Amplitude of currents recorded by applying a saturating concentration of ATP (100 μm), GABA (100 μm or 1 mm with α 3β 3), or a mixture of both agonists at a holding potential of -60 mV. The average inhibition (%) indicates that similar current occlusion occurred between P2X2 and various α β GABAA receptors during either simultaneous (ATP+GABA) or sequential applications: ATP during application of GABA (GABA/ATP) and reciprocally (ATP/GABA). On the contrary, the γ -subunit containing GABAA receptors inhibited P2X2, but P2X2 receptors did not inhibit GABAA.P2X2+GABAAIATPIGABAIATP+GABAnInhibitionATP+GABAATP/GABAGABA/ATPμA%α1β30.23 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.881.48 ± 0.685303025α2β31.17 ± 0.211.11 ± 0.271.58 ± 0.2515302530α3β31.9 ± 0.651.3 ± 0.61.93 ± 0.55404030α2hβ10.66 ± 0.290.55 ± 0.320.82 ± 0.375202025α2β3γ20.92 ± 0.61.2 ± 0.461.41 ± 0.7635035α2β3γ34.3 ± 1.042.9 ± 0.55.6 ± 0.892230030 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Asymmetric current occlusion between P2X and γ subunit containing GABA-gated channels.

In both cases, co-application of ATP plus GABA induced currents significantly smaller (p < 0.0005) than the sum of individual IGABA and IATP (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table I). IATP+GABA represented 69.39 ± 3.05% (n = 22) and 66.62 ± 3.3% (n = 6) of the predicted current for P2X2 plus α2β3γ3 (Fig. 2, A–C) and for P2X2 plus α2β3γ2 (Fig. 2, B and C), respectively. When ATP was applied during GABA application, the amplitude of IGABA then ATP was also significantly smaller (p < 0.0005, n = 15) than the predicted current. IGABA then ATP represented 71.36 ± 3.08% (n = 15) and 66.62 ± 3.3% (n = 6) of the predicted current for P2X2 plus α2β3γ3 and P2X2 plus α2β3γ2, respectively (Fig. 2, A and C). Thus, the same degree of occlusion (∼30%) was observed between P2X2 and GABAA receptors formed by α, β, and γ subunits (Fig. 2) and between P2X2 and GABA αβ receptors (Fig. 1 and Table I). Interestingly, when GABA was applied during ATP application, the current amplitude was not significantly different (p > 0.5, n = 15) from the sum of IGABA and IATP in oocytes co-expressing P2X2 and α2β3γ3 (IATP then GABA = 106 ± 4.1% of the predicted current). P2X2 and α2β3γ2 currents were equally additive when GABA application started during continuous application of ATP (IATP then GABA = 97.5 ± 2.5% of the predicted current, n = 6, Fig. 2, B and C) showing that GABA decreased the ATP response of P2X2 receptors, whereas ATP had no effect on the GABA current of γ subunit-containing receptors. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, the enhancement by flunitrazepam (1 μm) of the current evoked by 10 μm GABA (IGABA+flunitrazepam = 152 ± 15% of the control, n = 6) indicated that γ subunits were associated with α and β subunit complexes. Taken together, these results show that ATP-gated channels interact functionally with GABAA receptors irrespective of their subunit composition and, more importantly, that the direction of current occlusion depends on the molecular composition of the GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors closed substantial proportions of P2X2 receptors during co-activation (and vice versa), whereas ATP-gated channels failed to close GABA-gated channels associated with a γ subunit. Voltage-, Calcium-, and Chloride-independent Current Occlusion—Sokolova and coworkers (10Sokolova E. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4958-4968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described a current occlusion between GABA- and ATP-induced currents in dorsal root ganglia neurons and postulated that chloride ions were the main coupling agent. We therefore investigated a potential chloride or voltage dependence of the cross-talk by recording currents evoked by the activation of P2X2 and GABAA receptors at different holding potentials. Currents induced by co-application of ATP plus GABA were significantly smaller (p < 0.0005, n = 7) than the sum of the individual IATP and IGABA, at holding potentials ranging from -60 to +30 mV (IATP+GABA was between 64 and 76% of the predicted current, Fig. 3A). We also recorded cross-inhibition in the absence of CaCl2 in the extracellular solution (Fig. 3A). Cross-inhibition was observed with outward GABA currents, i.e. chloride entry, suggesting that chloride was not essential to the occlusion process. However, ATP-induced outward currents are difficult to record due to a marked inward rectification of P2X2 channels (23Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). We therefore used cationic GABA receptors to determine whether chloride was implicated in the cross-talk. Mutation of amino acids in the M1–M2 loop of the β3 subunit to the corresponding amino acids of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine subunit rendered the GABAA cation-selective, with no significant permeability to anions, on co-expression with wild type α and γ subunits (20Jensen M.L.

We co-injected oocytes with cDNAs coding for P2X2, α2, and human mutated β3 subunits (hβ3SGE) and recorded responses to individual and combined application of agonists at a holding potential of -60 mV. Application of GABA (100 μm) induced a slowly desensitizing inward current (IGABA = -0.71 ± 0.4 μA, n = 7), and ATP evoked non-desensitizing responses (IATP = -2.8 ± 1.1 μA, n = 7). Co-activation of both receptors by simultaneous or sequential application evoked inward responses significantly smaller (p < 0.0005, n = 7) than the predicted sum of IATP and IGABA (Fig. 3C). IATP+GABA, IATP then GABA, and IGABA then ATP represented 73.26 ± 4.7%, 73 ± 4.0%, and 65 ± 5.0% of the predicted current, respectively. Current-voltage relationships for α2hβ3SGE receptors and wild-type α2hβ3 receptors were determined in normal Ringer solution Na+-R and in low Na+ Ringer (NMDG-R). As depicted in Fig. 3D, the I-V curve for α2hβ3SGE revealed a shift in reversal potential of ∼26 mV for NMDG-R (Erev = -5.17 ± 0.7 mV, n = 5) compared with Na+-R (Erev =-31.33 ± 2.0 mV, n = 5). In contrast, the I-V curve for wild type α2hβ3 receptors exhibited a minor shift of ∼4 mV for NMDG-R (Erev = - 34.22 ± 2 mV, n = 4) compared with Na+-R (Erev = - 30.28 ± 2 mV, n = 4). These data are in agreement with the cation-selective permeability of the α2hβ3SGE receptor (20Jensen M.L. Timmermann D.B. Johansen T.H. Schousboe A. Varming T. Ahring P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41438-41447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that reciprocal cross-inhibition between GABAA and P2X2 was a receptor-mediated, voltage-, chloride-, and calcium-independent phenomenon. Interaction of Intracellular Domains of P2X2 and GABAA Receptors Are Crucial for Cross-inhibition—Previous studies showed that intracellular domains of receptor channels were involved in cross-inhibition between P2X and 5-HT3 or ρ1/GABAC receptors (9Boue-Grabot E.

We investigated whether the C-terminal domain of P2X2 and the intracellular domains of GABAA subunits participated in the current occlusion (Fig. 4A). We first co-expressed a C-terminal truncated form of P2X2 (P2X2TR) with α2β3 GABAA receptors. Co-activation of both receptors by co-application of ATP and GABA evoked inward currents (-2.06 ± 0.92 μA) not significantly different (p > 0.5, n = 5) from the sum of the individual IATP (-0.54 ± 0.19 μA) and IGABA (-1.5 ± 0.73 μA). IATP+GABA represented 100 ± 1.4% of the predicted value (Fig. 4, B and F) showing that P2X2TR and GABAA are functionally independent. To fu"

Dorfin is located in ubiquitylated inclusions (UBIs) in various neurodegenerative disorders, such as ALS and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we report that Valosin-containing protein (VCP) directly binds to Dorfin and that VCP ATPase activity profoundly contributes to the E3 activity of Dorfin. High through-put analysis using mass spectrometry identified VCP as a candidate of Dorfin-associated protein. Glycerol gradient centrifugation analysis showed that endogenous Dorfin consisted of a 400â€“600-kDa complex and was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous VCP. <i>In vitro</i> experiments showed that Dorfin interacted directly with VCP through its C-terminal region. These two proteins were colocalized in aggresomes in HEK293 cells and UBIs in the affected neurons of ALS and PD. VCP<sup>K524A</sup>, a dominant negative form of VCP, reduced the E3 activity of Dorfin against mutant superoxide dismutase 1, whereas it had no effect on the autoubiquitylation of Parkin. Our results indicate that VCPs functionally regulate Dorfin through direct interaction and that their functional interplay may be related to the process of UBI formation in neurodegenerative disorders, such as ALS or PD."

https://openalex.org/W2021700522,"Previous work suggests that normal GLUT4 content is sufficient for increases in muscle glucose uptake (MGU) during exercise because GLUT4 overexpression does not increase exercise-stimulated MGU. Instead of glucose transport, glucose phosphorylation is a primary limitation of exercise-stimulated MGU. It was hypothesized that a partial ablation of GLUT4 would not impair exercise-stimulated MGU when glucose phosphorylation capacity is normal but would do so when glucose phosphorylation capacity was increased. Thus, C57BL/6J mice with hexokinase II (HKII) overexpression (HKTg), a GLUT4 partial knock-out (G4+/–), or both (HKTg + G4+/–) and wild-type (WT) littermates were implanted with carotid artery and jugular vein catheters for sampling and infusions at 4 months of age. After a 7-day recovery, 5-h fasted mice remained sedentary or ran on a treadmill at 0.6 mph for 30 min (n = 9–12 per group) and received a bolus of 2-deoxy[3H]glucose to provide an index of MGU (Rg). Arterial blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were similar in WT, G4+/–, HKTg, and HKTg + G4+/– mice. Sedentary Rg values were the same in all genotypes in all muscles studied, confirming that glucose transport is a significant barrier to basal glucose uptake. Gastrocnemius and soleus Rg were greater in exercising compared with sedentary mice in all genotypes. During exercise, G4+/– mice had a marked increase in blood glucose that was corrected by the addition of HK II overexpression. Exercise Rg (μmol/100g/min) was not different between WT and G4+/– mice in the gastrocnemius (24 ± 5 versus 21 ± 2) or the soleus (54 ± 6 versus 70 ± 7). In contrast, the enhanced exercise Rg observed in HKTg mice compared with that in WT mice was absent in HKTg + G4+/– mice in both the gastrocnemius (39 ± 7 versus 22 ± 6) and the soleus (98 ± 13 versus 65 ± 13). Thus, glucose transport is not a significant barrier to exercise-stimulated MGU despite a 50% reduction in GLUT4 content when glucose phosphorylation capacity is normal.

Each of these steps can serve as a barrier to MGU and, thus, are important in regulating glucose influx.

Mice from this mating were bred to create offspring with one of four genotypes, i.e. wild-type (WT), GLUT4+/–,HKTg, and HKTg + GLUT4+/–. Litter mates were separated by gender following a 3-week weaning period and maintained in microisolator cages. Genotyping was performed with the polymerase chain reaction on genomic DNA obtained from a tail biopsy and isolated by a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All mice were fed standard chow ad libitum, handled at least twice per week, and studied at ∼4 months of age. Immunoblotting—Total GLUT4 and HKII protein content was determined on representative gastrocnemius and SVL muscles. Muscles were homogenized in a solution containing 10% glycerol, 20 mm sodiumpyrophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmol/liter EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na2VO3, and 3 mm benzamide. After centrifugation (1 h at 4500 × g) pellets were discarded, and supernatants were retained for protein determination using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit. Proteins (30 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked, blotted with rabbit α-GLUT4 (1:1000; Alpha Diagnostic International; San Antonio, TX) and α-HKII (1:1000; Chemicon International; Temecula, CA), and then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:20000; Pierce). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software (NIH). Surgical Procedures—The surgical procedures utilized are similar to those described previously (9Halseth A.E. Bracy D.P. Wasserman D.H. Am. J.

Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (70 mg/kg body weight). The left common carotid artery was catheterized for sampling of arterial blood with a two part catheter consisting of PE-10 (inserted into the artery) and Silastic (0.025-inch outer diameter) tubing. The right jugular vein was catheterized for infusions with a Silastic catheter (0.025-inch outer diameter). The free ends of catheters were tunneled under the skin to the back of the neck where they were attached via stainless steel connectors to lines made of MicroRenathane (0.033-inch outer diameter), which were exteriorized and sealed with stainless steel plugs. Lines were flushed daily with 10–50 μl of saline containing 200 units/ml heparin and 5 mg/ml ampicillin. Animals were individually housed after surgery, and body weight was recorded daily. Following an ∼5 day period in which body weight was restored (within 10% of pre-surgery body weight), mice were acclimated to treadmill running with a single 10-min bout of exercise (0.5–0.6 mph, 0% grade). Experiments were performed 2 days following the treadmill acclimation trial (i.e. ∼7 days following surgery). Experiments—At 8:00 a.m. on the day of the experiment, conscious mice were placed in a 1-liter plastic container lined with bedding and fasted for 5 h. Approximately 1 h prior to an experiment, MicroRenathane (0.033-mm outer diameter) tubing (22-cm long) was connected to the catheter leads, and mice were placed on an enclosed treadmill. At t = 0 min, a base-line arterial blood sample (150 μl) was drawn for the measurement of arterial blood glucose (HemoCue, Mission Viejo, CA), hematocrit, and plasma insulin and NEFAs. The remaining red blood cells were washed once with 0.9% saline containing 10 units/ml heparin and reinfused. The mice either remained sedentary (n = 9 WT, 9 GLUT4+/–,12HKTg,and9HKTg + GLUT4+/–) or ran (n = 9 WT, 9 GLUT4+/–,10HKTg,and9HKTg + GLUT4+/–) on the treadmill (0.6 mph, 0% grade) for 30 min. The selected work intensity is designed to increase oxygen consumption to ∼80% of maximal oxygen consumption (15Fernando P. Bonen A. Hoffman-Goetz L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1993; 71: 854-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Exercise was standardized so that the same amount of absolute work was performed rather than matching relative work intensities in order to create similar energy requirements. At t = 5 min, a 12-μCi bolus of [2-3H]DG (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was administered to provide an index of tissue-specific glucose uptake. At t = 10, 15, and 20 min, ∼50 μl of arterial blood was sampled to determine blood glucose and plasma [2-3H]DG. At t = 30 min, a 150-μl arterial blood sample was withdrawn, and mice were anesthetized with an arterial infusion of sodium pentobarbital. The soleus (∼44% type I, ∼51% type IIA, and ∼5% type IID fibers), gastrocnemius (∼6% type IIA, ∼11% type IID, and ∼83% type IIB fibers), and SVL (∼3% type IIA, ∼10 type IID, and ∼87% type IIB fibers) muscles (16Allen D.L. Harrison B.C. Sartorius C. Byrnes W.C. Leinwand L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C637-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were excised, freeze-clamped immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C until future tissue analysis. Processing of Plasma and Muscle Samples—Immunoreactive insulin was assayed with a double antibody method (17Morgan C.R. Lazarow A. Diabetes. 1965; 14: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NEFAs were measured spectrophotometrically by an enzymatic colorimetric assay (Wako NEFA C kit, Wako Chemicals Inc., Richmond, VA). Following deproteinization with Ba(OH)2 (0.3 n) and ZnSO4 (0.3 n), [2-3H]DG radioactivity of the plasma was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Packard TRI-CARB 2900TR) with Ultima Gold (Packard) as the scintillant. Muscle samples were weighed and homogenized in 0.5% perchloric acid. Homogenates were centrifuged and neutralized with KOH. One aliquot was counted directly to determine [2-3H]DG and [2-3H]DGP radioactivity. A second aliquot was treated with Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 to remove [2-3H]DGP and any tracer incorporated into the glycogen and then counted to determine [2-3H]DG radioactivity. [2-3H]DGP is the difference between the two aliquots. The accumulation of [2-3H]DGP was normalized to tissue weight. The tissue-specific clearance of [2-3H]DG, or Kg, and the metabolic index, or Rg, were calculated as described previously (18Kraegen E.W. James D.E. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E353-E362PubMed Google Scholar) and shown in Equations 1 and 2, Kg=[2−3H]DGPmuscleAUC[2−3H]DGplasma (Eq. 1) Rg=Kg·Glucoseplasma (Eq. 2) where [2-3H]DGP is the [2-3H]DGPmuscle radioactivity in the muscle in dpm/g, AUC[2-3H]DGplasma is the area under the plasma [2-3H]DG disappearance curve calculated using the trapezoid method in dpm/ml·min, and Glucoseplasma is the average blood glucose in mm during the experimental period. Kg and Rg are used as concentration-independent and -dependent indices of MGU, respectively. Muscle glycogen was determined by the method of Chan and Exton (19Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) on the contralateral gastrocnemius and SVL muscles. Soleus glycogen could not be determined, because both of the small muscles were used to assay for [2-3H]DG and [2-3H]DGP. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Descriptive Characteristics of Genetic Models—A partial GLUT4 knock-out decreased total GLUT4 content to ∼50% in gastrocnemius and SVL muscles as compared with WT levels (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, when combined with HK II overexpression, a disruption of a single allele of the GLUT4 gene did not markedly reduce total GLUT4 protein content in the SVL relative to HK II overexpressing mice. However, GLUT4 content in the SVL was not different between the two groups of animals with a partial GLUT4 knock-out (i.e. GLUT4+/– and HKTg + GLUT4+/–). HKII overexpression, whether alone or combined with a partial GLUT4 knock-out, increased total HKII content ∼3- and ∼4-fold in gastrocnemius and SVL muscles, respectively (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Total HK II content from skeletal muscles.

Open table in a new tab Arterial glucose concentration tended to rise over the course of the treadmill exercise in both WT and GLUT4+/– mice (Fig. 3B). Exercise increased Kg and Rg significantly and decreased glycogen content in all of the muscles studied of WT and GLUT4+/– mice. A partial GLUT4 ablation did not impair Kg and Rg during exercise (Table II and Fig. 4, respectively). In fact, SVL Kg and Rg were paradoxically increased in GLUT4+/– compared with WT mice during exercise perhaps due to compensatory mechanisms. GLUT4+/– mice had lower glycogen concentrations following exercise compared with their WT littermates (Table III). However, glycogen breakdown (the difference between sedentary and exercise glycogen) was similar between WT and GLUT4+/– mice. Effect of Partial GLUT4 Knock-out on the Background of HK II Overexpression during Rest and Exercise—HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice had similar arterial glucose concentrations as compared with those of WT and HKTg mice throughout the 30-min sedentary period (Fig. 3A). HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice had similar sedentary Kg (Table II) and Rg values (Fig. 4) as compared with those of WT, GLUT4+/–, and HKTg mice in all of the muscles studied. Muscle glycogen was lower in HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice as compared with that in WT, GLUT4+/–, HKTg mice in the sedentary condition (Table III). In contrast to GLUT4+/– mice in which arterial glucose rose, HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice demonstrated a remarkably stable arterial glucose concentration during exercise (Fig. 3B). By 10 min of exercise, their glucose concentration was lower than that of GLUT4+/– mice and remained so throughout the remainder of exercise. No differences were detected compared with WT and HKTg mice. Exercise significantly increased Kg and Rg compared with the sedentary condition in all of the muscles studied of HKTg and HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice. HK II overexpression augmented exercise-stimulated Kg and Rg compared with WT mice in the gastrocnemius and soleus and compared with WT mice in the SVL. This enhancement of exercise-stimulated Kg and Rg was abolished by partial GLUT4 knock-out in the gastrocnemius (Table II and Fig. 4A) and soleus (Table II and Fig. 4B) but not in the SVL (Table II and Fig. 4C). Muscle glycogen was substantially lower in sedentary HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice compared with other genotypes. Exercise, however, did not lead to a significant breakdown of glycogen. By the end of exercise, HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice still had lower muscle glycogen compared with WT and HKTg mice (Table III). Each step of the glucose uptake pathway (i.e. glucose delivery, transport, and phosphorylation) can be viewed as a barrier to muscle glucose influx in vivo. Mice overexpressing GLUT1 (1Hansen P.A.

The logic used in these earlier studies was that if a step is a primary site of resistance to MGU, then overexpression of the protein(s) that catalyzes that step will increase MGU. An alternative approach is to increase the resistance to a step by genetically lowering the concentration or functional activity of those same proteins and determine whether such a manipulation reduces MGU. This was done for glucose phosphorylation by partially knocking out HK II (25Heikkinen S. Pietila M. Halmekyto M. Suppola S. Pirinen E. Deeb S.S. Janne J. Laakso M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 285: E958-E963Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it was demonstrated that glucose phosphorylation is a primary site of resistance to MGU during exercise, because partial HK II knock-out mice had impaired glucose influx in oxidative muscles (26Fueger P.T. Heikkinen S. Bracy D.P. Malabanan C.M. Pencek R.R. Laakso M. Wasserman D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E958-E963Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we show that a partial GLUT4 ablation in C57BL/6J mice impaired neither sedentary nor exercise-stimulated MGU in any of the muscles studied at 4 months of age. Only when the barrier to glucose phosphorylation was functionally reduced by HK II overexpression could glucose transport become limiting to MGU during exercise. The model depicted in Fig. 5 demonstrates the impact of such transgenic manipulations on site-specific resistances to MGU and their outcome upon MGU. Under basal sedentary conditions, muscle glucose transport has been viewed as the primary barrier to glucose influx due to the low concentration of glucose transporters in the sarcolemma, creating a membrane with low permeability to glucose (see Fig. 5A). This conjecture gains support from experiments in humans (27Kelley D.E. Williams K.V. Price J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E361-E369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kelley D.E.

The partial ablation of GLUT4, the overexpression of HK II, and the combination of the two genetic manipulations in the present study had no effect on sedentary indices of MGU (i.e. Kg and Rg), which is consistent with a previous report (10Stenbit A.E. Tsao T.S. Li J. Burcelin R. Geenen D.L. Factor S.M. Houseknecht K. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because only a small concentration of GLUT4 resides in the plasma membrane under basal conditions and basal glucose transport may also be mediated through GLUT1 or some other as yet uncharacterized glucose transporter, a 50% reduction in GLUT4 content was not expected to have a functional impact on sedentary MGU. These studies are consistent with the notion that the low glucose influx during sedentary conditions can be achieved with the reduced number of GLUT4 and any GLUT1 or other unknown glucose transporters. Interestingly, either a full GLUT4 ablation (12Katz E.B. Stenbit A.E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) or a selective inhibition of GLUT4 by indinavir (31Rudich A. Konrad D. Torok D. Ben-Romano R. Huang C. Niu W. Garg R.R. Wijesekara N. Germinario R.J. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reduces basal MGU; thus, some amount of GLUT4 >0 and <50% of WT levels is necessary for normal rates of basal glucose influx. Nevertheless, the results in the present study are consistent with the concept that glucose transport and not glucose phosphorylation is a key site of resistance to basal MGU. During exercise, the massive hyperemia increases glucose delivery (32Honig C.R. Odoroff C.L. Frierson J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 238: H31-H42PubMed Google Scholar, 33Palm T. Nielsen S.L. Lassen N.A. Clin. Physiol. 1983; 3: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and GLUT4 translocation to the sarcolemma (34Goodyear L.J. Hirshman M.F. King P.A. Horton E.D. Thompson C.M. Horton E.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Cartee G.D. Klip A.

Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) increases glucose permeability. The net result of these two physiological events is that MGU markedly increases and the primary barrier to glucose influx in the working muscle shifts to glucose phosphorylation. Therefore, when HK II is overexpressed the functional resistance to glucose phosphorylation is reduced and, consequently, MGU is enhanced during exercise (see Fig. 5B). Interestingly, when total GLUT4 content is reduced by 50%, MGU is not reduced during exercise (in fact, MGU is increased in SVL). However, the enhanced exercise-stimulated Kg or Rg resulting from HK II overexpression is not present when combined with partial GLUT4 ablation. Thus, glucose transport becomes a key site of resistance to MGU only when glucose phosphorylation capacity is markedly increased. Although partial ablation of GLUT4 did not alter MGU during sedentary or exercising conditions, it may reduce insulin-stimulated MGU. This has been demonstrated in isolated muscle (10Stenbit A.E. Tsao T.S. Li J. Burcelin R. Geenen D.L. Factor S.M. Houseknecht K. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 37Tsao T.S. Stenbit A.E. Factor S.M. Chen W. Rossetti L. Charron M.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and may account for the decreased muscle glycogen observed in GLUT4+/– and HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice. The elevation in blood glucose during exercise observed in GLUT4+/– mice may compensate for any functional reductions in glucose transport. This increase in circulating glucose mass will increase the concentration gradient from the plasma to the inside of the cell and thereby increase glucose delivery and perhaps glucose transport and total glucose influx. The mechanism for this hyperglycemia is unknown but may include a yet to be discovered myokine, in this case a substance released from the muscle that signals to the liver to increase glucose production. Precedence for such interorgan communication has already been established in mice with a selective reduction of GLUT4 in adipose tissue (38Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Despite reductions in glycogen content, GLUT4+/– mice had a glycogen breakdown during exercise similar to that of WT mice. HKTg + GLUT4+/– mice, however, did not or perhaps could not mobilize glycogen during exercise, due most likely to the exceptionally low levels observed in the basal state. In a similar manner, the slightly reduced circulating NEFAs may be the result of attenuated glucose uptake by adipocytes leading to reduced precursors for fatty acid synthesis (39Li J. Houseknecht K.L. Stenbit A.E. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The decreased reliance on fatty acids as a substrate and decreased glycogen mobilization resulting in a reduction in the glucose-6-phosphate pool, coupled with mass action effects of higher glycemia, all favor increases in MGU. This combination of alterations in glycogen metabolism, reduced NEFAs, and slightly elevated plasma glucose may abrogate deficits in glucose transport created by partial GLUT4 knock-out and, hence, restore MGU to normal rates. Despite these compensatory mechanisms, the effectiveness of the HK II transgene is lost when combined with a reduction in total GLUT4 content. The results presented in this study are generally consistent across muscles with one exception. The exercise-stimulated Rg from SVL muscles is increased in GLUT4+/– as compared with WT mice, whereas they are equal in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. This response may be a result of the relative hyperglycemia during exercise in GLUT4+/– mice. Based on the genetic manipulation and commensurate reduction in GLUT4 protein content in this fast twitch muscle, these results are paradoxical, because reducing GLUT4 content in a muscle would be to, if anything, lower MGU during exercise. This result, however, further strengthens the general conclusions of this work, i.e. that glucose phosphorylation is the primary barrier to MGU during exercise and that the role of glucose phosphorylation in determining MGU is dependent on total GLUT4 content. Support for these conclusions is provided by the fact that HK II overexpression increases exercise-stimulated MGU in all muscles studied and that in a muscle where GLUT4 content is not markedly reduced the transgene effectiveness remains intact. In summary, a partial ablation of GLUT4 in C57BL/6J mice did not impair sedentary or exercise-stimulated indices of MGU (i.e. Kg and Rg). It did, however, eliminate the enhanced exercise-stimulated MGU created by HK II overexpression. Therefore, despite a 50% reduction of normal GLUT4 content, glucose transport is not a significant barrier to exercise-stimulated MGU. However, a 50% reduction in GLUT4 availability makes glucose transport become a limitation to exercise-stimulated MGU when the glucose phosphorylation barrier is functionally lowered by HK II overexpression. The implication of these findings is that impairments in MGU associated with insulin resistance may not uniformly or solely reflect deficits in glucose transport capacity. These studies are consistent with the notion that increasing HK II is a reasonable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes, provided that the insulin resistance is not associated with a critically low glucose transport capacity.

To examine the intracellular sites in which active γ-secretase resides, we expressed NCT variants harboring either an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (NCT-ER) or a trans-Golgi network (TGN) targeting motif (NCT-TGN) along with PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 and examined γ-secretase activity in these settings.

Several lines of evidence reveal that the steady-state accumulation of each of the components of the complex is coordinately regulated and, in large part, is dependent on the expression of other members of the complex (for review see Ref. 6Periz G. Fortini M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has also become apparent that APH-1 and NCT form a stable subcomplex that binds to PS (7LaVoie M.J.

This APH-1·NCT·PS1 complex then associates with PEN-2, resulting in endoproteolysis of PS to generate NTF and CTF, which are the preponderant PS-related species that accumulate in vivo (7LaVoie M.J.

We have previously demonstrated that stable coexpression of PS1, APH-1, NCT, and PEN-2 (ANPP) leads to hyperaccumulation of PS1 derivatives to levels ∼10-fold higher than endogenous levels. In these cell lines, we observed robust enhancement in the levels of APP intracellular domain (AICD) as well as a modest elevation in the production of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (8Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, we failed to demonstrate a corresponding increase in the levels of secreted Aβ. We suggested that the differential intracellular distributions of γ-secretase complex and/or its substrates have an impact on the relative levels of products generated in the reactions in vivo. In this regard, the intracellular compartments in which the γ-secretase complex is assembled and stabilized are still somewhat uncertain. To address this issue, we targeted the γ-secretase complex to specific intracellular compartments by modifying the NCT cytoplasmic domain to include signals known to target type I membrane proteins either to the ER or TGN. We now show that coexpression of NCT with an ER retention signal (NCT-ER) with PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 led to the hyperaccumulation of PS1 derivatives but that the generation of AICD derived from Swedish mutant APP (APPSwe) was not elevated in these cells, compared with cells coexpressing wild type NCT (NCT-WT), PS1, APH-1 and PEN-2. However, when APP harboring the ER retention signal, or a constitutionally active Notch mutant, NΔE, was coexpressed with NCT-ER, PS1, APH-1 and PEN-2, we observed enhanced production of AICD or NICD, comparable with cells expressing NCT-WT, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2. Indeed, we demonstrate that identical levels of PS1 derivatives can be photoaffinity cross-linked to a biotinylated and benzophenone-derivatized γ-secretase inhibitor in whole cell membranes from cells expressing PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and either NCT-WT, NCT-ER, or NCT-TGN. Furthermore, cell-free reconstitution assay using membrane fractions in the presence of an exogenous APP C100 substrate revealed nearly equivalent γ-secretase activities in cells expressing PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and either NCT-WT or NCT-ER. These results suggest that the “active” γ-secretase complex is generated in the early compartments of the secretory pathway but that this complex encounters and subsequently facilitates proteolysis of membrane-tethered substrates only in late compartments of the secretory apparatus.

The cDNAs encoding human NCT or APPSwe were modified by PCR-based mutagenesis to put additional amino acids (KKLN for the ER retention signal (14Cosson P. Letourneur F.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Western Blot—HEK293 cells or immortalized fibroblasts from mice with homozygous deletions of PS1 (PS1 –/–) were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 48–72 h after transfection, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (8Kim S.H.

The reactions were terminated by adding radioimmune precipitation buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were subject to centrifugation, and Aβ peptides in the supernatant fraction were quantified using an ECL-based assay (18Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K.

To gain a better understanding of cellular sites of γ-secretase assembly, we directed NCT to different subcellular compartments by introducing discrete modifications into its cytoplasmic tail. The addition of a dilysine (KK) motif at the –3 and –4 amino positions from the end of type I membrane proteins effectively retains these proteins in the ER (14Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), whereas the addition of SDYQRL signal from TGN-38 targets membrane proteins to the TGN (15Peraus G.C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7714-7724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated cDNAs encoding mutant NCT containing these modifications and transfected either NCT-WT or these mutant constructs into HEK293 cells together with cDNAs encoding PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2. Immunoblot analysis of detergent lysates of transfected cells with NCT54 antibody (8Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) revealed that NCT-WT and NCT-TGN migrated as an ∼110-kDa endoglycosidase H-sensitive immature form and heterogeneous ∼120-kDa endoglycosidase H-resistant mature forms (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 6). However, NCT-ER failed to undergo complex glycosylation to generate a mature form but instead mostly accumulated as an immature form (Fig. 1A, lane 5), suggesting that the NCT-ER mutant does not reach the late compartments where complex glycosylation occurs. As we have shown previously (8Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), coexpression of PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and NCT-WT leads to the hyperaccumulation of PS1 fragments (Fig. 1B, lane 4) compared with cells expressing PS1 alone (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Notably, in cells coexpressing NCT-ER or NCT-TGN with PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2, accumulated levels of PS1-CTF (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6) and NTF (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lanes 5 and 6) are also markedly elevated. The extent of hyperaccumulation of PS1 fragments was not significantly different among cells expressing NCT-WT, NCT-ER, or NCT-TGN with the three other components, suggesting that the stabilization and endoproteolysis of PS1 can occur in early compartments of the secretory pathway. Next, we examined whether the complexes consisting of PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and either NCT-WT, NCT-ER, or NCT-TGN could promote γ-secretase-mediated proteolytic conversion of APP-CTFs to AICD. Consistent with our earlier studies (8Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), coexpression of PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and NCT-WT led to the marked reduction of APP-CTFmycβ and CTFmycα and significant elevation of AICD (Fig 1C, lower panel, compare lanes 3 and 4). The levels of AICD were also higher in cells overexpressing NCT-TGN and the other components of the complex (Fig. 1C, lane 6), suggesting that post-Golgi compartments are sites at which APP-CTFs are processed to generate AICD. In contrast, coexpression of NCT-ER with PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2, failed to increase the level of AICD (Fig. 1C, lane 5), despite the fact that PS1 fragments hyperaccumulated to similar levels to that observed in cells expressing NCT-WT and the complex components. The levels of secreted Aβ peptides in vivo were not increased with expression of PS1, APH-1, NCT, and PEN-2 (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 3 and 4) as we described previously (8Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and were not significantly different between cells expressing the different NCT targeting variants (Fig. 1D, lanes 4–6). Why is the complex consisting of NCT-ER and the other components incapable of promoting γ-secretase processing of APP-CTFs to generate AICD? A simple explanation is that the γ-secretase substrates, APP-CTFβ and CTFα, known to be generated in late compartments of the secretory pathway, are not accessible to the active γ-secretase complex localized in the ER. To examine this issue, we chose to provide the NCT-ER complex with an APP substrate that is also ER-retained. Here, we coexpressed the APP Swedish variant (APPSwe) with the dilysine ER targeting signal (APPSwe-ER) together with NCT-ER and the other components. Although APPSwe is subject to β-secretase processing in the Golgi apparatus, we speculated that extended residence of this substrate in the ER would lead to enhanced processing by catalytically active pro-BACE1 (19Shi X.P. Chen E. Yin K.C. Na S. Garsky V.M. Lai M.T. Li Y.M. Platchek M. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Tang M.J. Thiebeau J. Wood T. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10366-10373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and, perhaps, newly synthesized TACE/α-secretase and subsequent generation of CTFβ and CTFα. Indeed, we show that the levels of APP-CTFs corresponding to CTFβ11 and CTFα are elevated in cells expressing APPSwe-ER (Fig. 2A, lane 6 versus 1). Consistent with previous results (Fig 1C), the levels of AICD were markedly elevated in cells expressing PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and either NCT-WT or NCT-TGN when coexpressed with wild type nontagged APPSwe or TGN-targeted APPSwe compared with cells expressing PS1 alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 5 versus 2; lanes 11 and 13 versus 10), whereas coexpression of NCT-ER with the other three components of the complex failed to elevate production of AICD (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 12). When we coexpressed APPSwe-ER with NCT-WT and the three other components of the γ-secretase complex, the levels of AICD generated were much lower compared with cells expressing wild type APPSwe and NCT-WT, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 (Fig. 2A, lane 7 versus 3). Interestingly, the levels of AICD that accumulate in cells that coexpress APPSwe-ER, NCT-ER, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 were much higher than those seen in cells coexpressing APPSwe-ER and PS1 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 6 and 8), suggesting that the retention of the γ-secretase complex (NCT-ER, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2) and the substrate (APPSwe-ER) in early compartments leads to enhanced proteolysis of APP-CTFs to generate AICD. In fact, in cells that coexpress NCT-WT, NCT-ER, or NCT-TGN in combination with the three remaining components and APPSwe-ER, the levels of AICD generated were extremely comparable (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 7–9). To determine whether intramembranous processing of APP-CTFs by the ER-retained γ-secretase complex was unique to this substrate, and to ask whether our results could be extended to another cell type, we evaluated the intramembranous processing of a Myc epitope-tagged version of the Notch-related membrane-tethered substrate NΔE in PS1-deficient fibroblasts. As γ-secretase processing of the truncated Notch derivative occurs in a ligand-independent, “constitutive” manner (20Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this molecule would encounter the γ-secretase complex in the ER and during transit to the plasma membrane. As we showed earlier (8Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Martys-Zage J.L. Kim S.H. Berechid B. Bingham S.J. Chu S. Sklar J. Nye J. Sisodia S.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), expression of PS1 in these cells enhances production of NICD, and these levels are further elevated upon coexpression of PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, with NCT-WT (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 3). Remarkably, the level of NICD generated in cells expressing PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and NCT-ER was comparable with that in cells expressing NCT-WT or NCT-TGN with the other three components of the complex (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4–6). These data on the processing of NΔE were indistinguishable from those observed in transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that the γ-secretase complex assembled in the ER is fully capable of promoting intramembranous proteolysis of APP-CTFs and NΔE to generate AICD and NICD, respectively, as long as the substrates are accessible to the enzyme complex. Although these latter data supported the notion that the γ-secretase complex assembled in the ER can promote intramembranous proteolysis of APP-CTFs and NΔE, it is known that only a small fraction of PS1 complexes participates in γ-secretase processing (22Lai M.T. Chen E. Crouthamel M.C. DiMuzio-Mower J. Xu M. Huang Q. Price E. Register R.B. Shi X.P. Donoviel D.B. Bernstein A. Hazuda D. Gardell S.J. Li Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22475-22481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Hence, it was conceivable that in the setting of hyperaccumulation of the complex, small increases in active γ-secretase are sufficient to drive conversion of substrates to completion. To examine the levels of active γ-secretase in cells expressing PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and NCT-WT or NCT targeting variants, we used two independent assays. In the first, we prepared membranes from cells that coexpress PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 and either NCT-WT, NCT-ER, or NCT-TGN and incubated these preparations at 4 °C for 60 min with 1 μm L-852,505 (17Li Y.M.

Mixtures were subject to photoactivation at 350 nm on ice for 90 min, and biotinylated polypeptides were recovered with immobilized streptavidin and subjected to Western blot analysis with αPS1Loop antibody. Significantly elevated levels of PS1-CTF are labeled by the photoprobe in membranes from cells expressing four components of the γ-secretase complex, compared with membranes from cells expressing PS1, alone (Fig. 3A, lane 7 versus 6). Importantly, the levels of PS1-CTF that were recovered with streptavidin are not significantly different among membranes from cells expressing NCT-WT, NCT-ER, or NCT-TGN (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9), suggesting that the levels of active γ-secretase in each complex are independent of the intracellular sites in which they reside. Second, and to further confirm that the γ-secretase complex present in the ER is fully active as an enzyme, we measured the in vitro γ-secretase activity using recombinant C100-FLAG as a substrate. Membrane fractions prepared from cells overexpressing PS1 alone, PS1·APH-1·PEN-2·NCT-WT, or PS1·APH-1·PEN-2·NCT-ER were incubated with C100-FLAG peptides with or without the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458, and the levels of Aβ peptides were measured as described (18Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Coexpression of PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and NCT-WT led to a marked increase of in vitro γ-secretase activity, which was fully inhibited by the specific γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 (Fig. 3B). More importantly, membranes from cells expressing PS1, APH-1, PEN-2, and NCT-ER exhibited in vitro γ-secretase activity comparable with that from cells expressing NCT-WT with the other three components of the γ-secretase complex (Fig. 3B), further supporting our view that the γ-secretase complex assembled in the ER is active in promoting intramembranous proteolysis of APP-CTFs. In the present study, we offer several important insights into the assembly and activity of γ-secretase. First, we show that expression of NCT-ER with PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 leads to the hyperaccumulation of active PS1 fragments and that the levels of γ-secretase activity in membranes from these cells are equivalent to those observed in cells that coexpress NCT-WT, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2. These findings indicate that the stabilization and assembly of the γ-secretase complex can occur in early compartments of the secretory pathway. However, we failed to observe the expected increase in the proteolytic conversion of APP-CTFs to AICD, an observation we interpret as suggesting that the substrates are not accessible to γ-secretase localized in the ER. In contrast, when coexpressed with an ER-targeted APP mutant or a constitutionally active Notch variant, NΔE, we observed that γ-secretase complex in the ER is capable of catalyzing proteolytic conversion of APP-CTFs and NΔE to AICD and NICD, respectively. Indeed, cell-free assays using recombinant C100-FLAG revealed that the γ-secretase complex assembled in the ER is active as the enzyme. It is not presently clear whether active γ-secretase complex assembled in the ER contributes to the generation of Aβ peptides under standard conditions. However, a fraction of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptides are known to be generated in the ER, but these peptides are retained in intracellular compartments and are generated independent of PS expression (24Wilson C.A. Doms R.W. Zheng H. Lee V.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overwhelming evidence has accrued to suggest that γ-secretase cleavage of APP-CTFs, Notch S2/NEXT, and presumably other γ-secretase substrates occurs in late compartments of the secretory pathway, including the TGN, endosomes, and plasma membrane (for review, see Ref. 1Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, although the bulk of PS1 is localized to the ER in mammalian cells, and presumably is associated with other components of complex, these species are largely “inert” because the substrates are unavailable to be processed. Indeed, we show that by forcing membrane-tethered substrates to encounter the PS1 complex in the ER, these molecules are subject to intramembranous proteolysis. Taken together with studies showing that a fraction of PS1 is engaged in an active γ-secretase complex (22Lai M.T. Chen E. Crouthamel M.C. DiMuzio-Mower J. Xu M. Huang Q. Price E. Register R.B.

It will be critical to identify the mechanism(s) by which PS and complex components are transported to late compartments and the biochemical and cellular events responsible for the encounter between γ-secretase and its substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2148679997,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare disease caused by the lack of a functional nuclear WS protein (WRN). WS is characterized by the early onset of premature aging signs and a high incidence of sarcomas. WS diploid fibroblasts have a short life span and extensive genomic instability. Mammalian cells are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which represent human mutagens and are thought to be a major contributor to the aging process. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a common ROS intermediate generated by various forms of oxidative stress. In response to H2O2-induced DNA damage, normal human diploid fibroblasts follow a pathway leading to irreversible proliferation arrest and premature senescence. Here we show that in contrast to normal human fibroblasts, WS diploid fibroblasts continue proliferating after extensive H2O2-induced DNA damage and accumulate oxidative DNA lesions. A direct role of WRN in this abnormal cellular response to H2O2 is demonstrated by interfering with WRN expression in normal human fibroblasts. We propose a role for WRN in the detection and/or processing of oxidative DNA lesions and in cellular responses to H2O2 as they relate to some of the phenotypical aspects of WS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014000350,"The complete cDNA sequence of the tilapia extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) was determined. The transcript length of tilapia CaR (tCaR) is 3.4 kbp and encodes a 940-amino acid, 7-transmembrane domain protein that is consistent in its structural features with known mammalian and piscine CaRs. The tCaR extracellular domain includes a characteristic hydrophobic segment, conserved cysteine residues that are implicated in receptor dimerization (Cys129 and Cys131) and in coupling to the transmembrane domain (nine conserved cysteine residues), and conserved serine residues (Ser147 and Ser169–171) that are linked to receptor binding of Ca2+ and l-amino acid-mediated potentiation of function. mRNA expression of tCaR was strong in kidney, brain, and gill. Weaker expression was observed in pituitary, stomach, intestine, urinary bladder, and heart. This distribution is consistent with possible physiological roles in endocrine cells, excitable tissues, and ion-transporting barrier epithelia. Expression of tCaR mRNA in kidney and intestine was salinity-dependent, suggesting a role for the receptor in iono-/osmoregulation in this euryhaline teleost species. Human embryonic kidney-293 cells transiently transfected with tCaR cDNA demonstrated dose-dependent phospholipase C activation in response to elevations in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o). Functional activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by high [Ca2+]o was also confirmed in these cells despite the naturally occurring truncation of the receptor's intracellular tail, which removes segments variably linked in mammalian CaRs to filamin-coupled activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Sensitivity of phospholipase C activation to [Ca2+]o was dependent on the ionic strength of the bathing medium, supporting a role in salinity sensing.

Sensitivity of phospholipase C activation to [Ca2+]o was dependent on the ionic strength of the bathing medium, supporting a role in salinity sensing. The roles for ionic calcium (Ca2+) in physiological functions are many and varied and essential for survival. Ca2+-dependent cellular processes include hormone secretion (stimulus-secretion coupling), excitability and cell motility (excitation-contraction coupling), and neurotransmission (Ca2+-based action potentials). This critical involvement of Ca2+ in these and other cellular functions is unique among ions. Ca2+ is simultaneously a controlled variable in physiological systems, an extracellular messenger in multicellular organisms, and an intracellular mediator in a variety of effector cells. Unicellular organisms acquire Ca2+ from the external environment; they have little control over the composition of the surrounding medium and thus had to evolve plasma membrane-bound and other cellular mechanisms to realize cellular Ca2+ homeostasis eventually permitting some degree of habitat survival and selection. In multicellular organisms, active regulation by integumentary tissues of the composition of an “extracellular fluid,” which bathes all cells, assures a constant internal milieu and contributes to normal Ca2+-dependent cell functions. In terrestrial vertebrates, Ca2+ homeostasis depends upon appropriate dietary intake, renal output, and osseous storage and mobilization of Ca2+. These processes are well known and are regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D acting on kidney, intestine, and bone. Activation of the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaR, extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; FW, freshwater-adapted; SW, seawater-adapted; PherR, pheromone receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; PLC, phospholipase C; HEK, human embryonic kidney; InsP, inositol phosphate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; TMD, transmembrane domain; ICD, intracellular domain; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; RT, reverse transcription; aa, amino acid(s). by its natural ligand, extracellular Ca2+, alters parathyroid hormone and calcitonin secretion and inhibits renal 1-hydroxylase to retard the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1Brown E.M.

Ca2+ balance is achieved through regulated calciotropic hormone secretion in response to the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o); the secreted hormones, in turn, control the activity of Ca2+-transporting tissues to bring about alterations in [Ca2+]o. Interestingly, in fishes, the calcium homeostatic process involves ion-transporting tissues not represented in other vertebrate classes (viz., the mitochondria-rich “chloride cells” of the gills and skin) and a different panel of hormones (prolactin and somatolactin from the pituitary, and stanniocalcin from the piscine corpuscles of Stannius (3Sasayama Y. Zool. Sci. 1999; 16: 857-869Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). Opportunities for cutaneous Ca2+ exchange with the environment are limited in terrestrial vertebrates, but for aquatic, water-breathing fishes, in contrast, there is substantial environmental exposure and risk to survival that is typically met by the efficient vectorial transport of Ca2+ across epithelial tissues contributing to the maintenance of a stable internal fluid composition (4Flik G. Verbost P.M. Wendelaar Bonga S.E. Wood C.M. Shuttleworth T.J. Cellular and Molecular Approaches to Fish Ionic Regulation. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 317-342Google Scholar, 5Loretz C.A. Wood C.M. Shuttleworth T.J. Cellular and Molecular Approaches to Fish Ionic Regulation. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 25-56Google Scholar). Moreover, the Ca2+ regulatory mechanism is part of a greater osmoregulatory scheme in which successful salinity adaptation involves coordinated physiological responses to external Ca2+, Na+ and Cl– concentrations, all of which generally co-vary. Maintenance of a stable Ca2+ concentration in the body fluids of fishes is complicated further in euryhaline species that may encounter daily, seasonal, or irregular changes in the composition of the external environment. Survival in fishes depends upon timely and appropriate physiological adaptation by epithelial tissues that separate inside from out; these include the branchial epithelium, the kidney, and the intestine. Direct effects of extracellular Ca2+ on these osmoregulatory tissues are clearly indicated. Bieter (6Bieter R.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1935; 53: 347-349Google Scholar) demonstrated many years ago that unilateral delivery of MgSO4 solutions to the aglomerular toadfish kidney caused ipsilateral diuresis and elevated Mg2+ excretion, consistent with a direct stimulatory action of Mg2+ and similar to that shown for Ca2+ in mammalian kidney (7Brown E.M.

In this study, we selected the euryhaline Mossambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) as our model system because aquatic vertebrates, in addition to the internal sensors of extracellular Ca2+, most likely possess external sensors of environmental Ca2+ that are exposed to a broad, yet natural, range of ligand concentrations ([Ca2+] in typical seawater: ∼10 mm; in fresh water, <0.5 mm). We report here on the cDNA cloning and sequencing of the tilapia CaR (tCaR), its tissue distribution, and the signal transduction properties for the first time of a teleost CaR in a mammalian expression system. Animals—Cultured Mossambique tilapia (O. mossambicus), weighing 50–80 g, were maintained in freshwater aquaria at 25 °C. Some of these tilapia were transferred to seawater aquaria, where they remained also at 25 °C for at least 2 weeks. These freshwater-adapted (FW) and seawater-adapted (SW) tilapia were used for tissue harvesting as described below. The salinities and Ca2+ concentrations of the fresh water and seawater were <10 mosm and 0.4 mm, and 1000–1020 mosm and 10 mm, respectively. Fish were maintained and handled in accordance with the Guidelines for Care and Use of Animals approved by the University of Tokyo. RNA Extraction—FW and SW tilapia were individually anesthetized in 0.1% (w/v) 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma), appropriately neutralized with sodium bicarbonate. After anesthesia, the brain, pituitary, gills (excluding the branchial arch cartilage), skin, heart, kidney, urinary bladder, liver, skeletal muscle, stomach, and intestine (that segment anterior to the easily identified sphincter marking the start of the posterior intestine) were isolated and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from about 0.5 g of frozen tissue using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). RNA was quantified using measured absorbance at 260 nm (Model DU 640 spectrophotometer, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—For cloning and sequencing, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA from the kidney of one FW tilapia using Oligotex-dT30 Super (Japan Synthetic Rubber, Tokyo, Japan). Double-stranded cDNA pools were prepared from 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using a SMART™ cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech) with manufacturer-supplied primers. A partial cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a sense and antisense degenerate primer pair (omTM-1F and omCT-1R, respectively; Table I) based on the CaR cDNA sequences of cow (GenBank™ accession number S67307), human (GenBank™ accession number U20759), rat (GenBank™ accession number U10354), mouse (GenBank™ accession number AF128842), pufferfish (GenBank™ accession number AB008857), and sea bream (GenBank™ accession number AJ289717). This primer pair was designed to recognize CaR sequences preferentially over structurally related pheromone receptor (PherR) sequences from the pufferfish (GenBank™ accession numbers AB008858 through AB008866). For this PCR amplification, the reaction conditions were: initial denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 50 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Each reaction mixture (25-μl total volume) contained PCR buffer, 2.5 mm dNTPs, cDNA template, 20 pmol of each primer, and 0.25 unit of Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing EtBr and were observed and recorded using a FAS-III Electronic UV Transilluminator (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Appropriate-sized bands were excised from the gels, and the PCR products were isolated using a GeneClean kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Following this, the PCR products were ligated and subcloned into pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Sequencing was performed using an ABI Prism Model 310 or 3100 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Hitachi Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Table ISequences of oligonucleotide primers for cDNA cloning and PCR screening of mRNA tissue distribution of tCaRNamePositions recognizedaNumbering relative to coding sequence of tilapia CaR or β-actin cDNAs.SequenceomTM-1F (s)bSense (forward) primer.2092-21145′-AGYWTCCAYCGNAARTGGTGGGG-3′omCT-1R (a)cAntisense (reverse) primer.2575-25965′-TRAAGGCRTGGGCNGCNGTRCT-3′omCaR-5Full (s)-97 to -765′-ACACAGCAGGCAGATTGATGGG-3′omCaR-836 (s)477-5005′-TTTCTACATTCCTCAGATCAGCTA-3′omCaR-14 (a)514-5355′-GATTCTTGTTGCTCAGTAGGCG-3′omCaR-108 (a)608-6295′-ATGACCCAGTTCCACTGAAAGT-3′omCaR-574 (s)679-7015′-GAGAAAGAGATGGAGGAGCGAGA-3′omCaR-804 (s)1313-13345′-AGAAAATGGARGCHTGGCAGGT-3′omCaR-5R3 (a)1354-13755′-CCATGCTGTTGGTGTAGTTCAA-3′omCaR-5R1 (a)2143-21635′-GACTTGGACAAATGTGCACAG-3′omCaR-5R2 (a)2214-22345′-ATGATCTCATCGATGTCATGA-3′omCaR-S1 (s)2290-23105′-ACATGCATATTGGCAGCCATA-3′omCaR-3R1 (s)2506-25265′-ATCTTCTTCAACAAGGTCTAC-3′omCaR-A1 (a)2547-25675′-ACTTCCTCAATGGTGTTCCTG-3′omCaR-3Full (a)3063-30845′-AACAGTGCGAACGCCTTTTAGA-3′omβactin-L (s)345-364dPosition within tilapia β-actin cDNA.5′-CAGGGAGAAGATGACCCAGA-3′omβactin-R (a)781-800dPosition within tilapia β-actin cDNA.5′-AGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAG-3′a Numbering relative to coding sequence of tilapia CaR or β-actin cDNAs.b Sense (forward) primer.c Antisense (reverse) primer.d Position within tilapia β-actin cDNA. Open table in a new tab Subsequently, the remainder of the full-length tCaR cDNA was determined stepwise using the PCR, cloning, and sequencing protocol described above. The primers for each PCR step comprised both specific primers based on the determined sequence for the tilapia CaR cDNA and degenerate primers designed on the basis of other known CaRs (Table I). Complete sequencing of the tCaR cDNA required four sequencing steps from the original fragment in the 5′ direction and a single sequencing reaction in the 3′ direction. The final sequencing step in each direction utilized 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with tCaR-specific primers (Table I) and the corresponding SMART™ 5′ and 3′ PCR primers, respectively. Tissue Distribution—tCaR mRNA expression was initially examined by RT-PCR in the several tilapia tissues collected from two FW and two SW fish. Total RNA was prepared as described above and was treated with DNase (TaKaRa DNase I) at 37 °C for 30 min to remove genomic DNA. Following DNase digestion, RNA was repurified, and its concentration was spectrophotometrically measured. Total RNA (1 μg) from all eight tissues of each fish was reverse transcribed using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. Negative control (without reverse transcriptase) PCR reactions were conducted for representative samples of all tissues to confirm the absence of contamination by genomic DNA. PCR was conducted in 25-μl reaction volumes using 1 μl of first strand cDNA template, 20 pmol of tCaR-specific primers omCaR-S1 and omCaR-A1, dNTPs, PCR buffer, and 0.25 unit of Ex Taq DNA polymerase, with the following program: initial denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 30 or 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 50 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The expression of tilapia β-actin mRNA was used as internal control. Specific primers for tilapia β-actin (omβactin-L and omβactin-R; Table I) were designed following confirmation of the cDNA sequence for tilapia β-actin (GenBank™ accession number AB037865). PCR for β-actin expression was conducted under the above conditions but for only 25 cycles of amplification. These amplification conditions were within the linear range of amplification (data not shown). PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels containing EtBr. The gels were visualized, and the images were recorded using a Fuji FLA-2000 imaging analyzer with ImageReader and ImageGauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Northern Blotting—Northern blotting using 7.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from the kidney of FW tilapia was performed according to standard procedures (19Hyodo S. Tsukada T. Takei Y. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2004; 138: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A synthetic 32P-labeled cDNA probe from the cloned tCaR (nucleotides 477–1375 in the extracellular domain (ECD)-coding region) was hybridized to membranes for 18 h. Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions (0.2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS (v/v) at room temperature for 10 min and then twice for 1 h each at 60 °C). Signal intensity was detected using the Fuji FLA-2000 imaging analyzer. Functional Expression—For assessing the function of tCaR, cDNA from kidney was synthesized using the SMART™ cDNA Library Construction kit as described above, but amplification was performed by primer extension at 95 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 10 min, and 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 3 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 68 °C for 8 min. Using this cDNA pool as template, a 3181-kbp full-length tCaR cDNA was amplified by PCR using the specific primers omCaR-5Full and omCaR-3Full (Table I) with the following thermocycler program: denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 5 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Because the full-length cDNA had no appropriate cloning sites for direct transfer to the pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) expression vector, the PCR product was ligated first into pT7Blue T-vector and subcloned. Clones were sequenced to confirm the identity and orientation of the cDNA insert. Using restriction digestion with SalI and BamHI (all restriction enzymes from TaKaRa), the full-length tCaR cDNA was shuttled from the pT7Blue vector into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector, restriction digested with BamHI and XhoI, again subcloned, and sequenced. Signal transduction by tCaR was evaluated by measuring high [Ca2+]o-induced activation of phospholipase C (PLC) in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (20Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were grown and transfected with tCaR or bCaR cDNA as previously described except for the use of transfection reagent, which was 40 μl/ml Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) in these experiments (20Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed, plated into 6-well culture plates, and allowed to attach and grow for 24–48 h. PLC activation was assessed by measuring total inositol phosphate (InsP) accumulation (as [3H]InsP) in HEK-293 cells after preloading with [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/ml) for 18–24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. [3H]InsP accumulation was measured following exposure to various [Ca2+]o (0.5–50 mm) for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of 140 mm NaCl and 10 mm LiCl. Total [3H]InsP were analyzed by anion-exchange chromatography and are expressed as the -fold increase in total [3H]InsP accumulation at the specified [Ca2+]o compared with basal [3H]InsP production at 0.5 mm Ca2+. Measurements were conducted in triplicate, and experiments were replicated at least three times. bCaR cDNA (10Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar) for control transfections was provided by Dr. Edward M. Brown (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Subsequently, the ability of tCaR to activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascade was assessed by examining phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Cells transfected with tCaR or bCaR cDNAs for 48 h were switched to a serum-deprived basal medium (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.2% w/v), MgSO4 (0.5 mm), and CaCl2 (0.5 mm)) for 18 h, and the medium was renewed 2 h prior to experiments. For time-course experiments, cells were switched to Basal Medium containing various CaCl2 concentrations (0.5, 3, and 5 mm) for 2–20 min. For Ca2+ dose-response experiments, cells were treated with different CaCl2 concentrations (0.5–10 mm) in Basal Medium for 5 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared by treating cell monolayers with rapid immunoprecipitation assay lysis solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate plus Complete™ Protease Inhibitor tablets (1 tablet/50 ml; Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 25 mm sodium fluoride). Total protein in the lysates was determined by a commercial kit (BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce). Cell proteins (20–35 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for expression of phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 by immunoblotting as detailed below, using specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for detection. Signals were developed with a Signal West Dura Substrate (Pierce), detected by BioMax x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY), and quantified by densitometry with a Microtek Scan Maker i900 scanner and Kodak 1D image analysis software (Kodak). The effects of different [Ca2+]o on MAP kinase activation were quantified by first calculating the signal ratio of phosphorylated ERK1/2 to total ERK1/2. These ratios were then normalized to the ratio of phosphorylated ERK1/2 to total ERK1/2 in tCaR-expressing cells at 0.5 mm Ca2+. The effects of different NaCl concentrations on PLC activation were tested in HEK-293 cells 3 days after transfections with tCaR or bCaR cDNAs. Cells loaded with [3H]myoinositol were incubated with HEPES-buffered saline solution (5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 g/liter dextrose, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) containing 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm LiCl (added to block phosphatase activity) in the presence of either 50 mm NaCl and 300 mm mannitol, or 200 mm NaCl and 0 mm mannitol. Cells in the low (50 mm) and high (200 mm) NaCl treatment groups were exposed to varying [Ca2+]o (0.1–30 mm) for 60 min at 37 °C. Total [3H]InsP accumulation was determined, and data were normalized and expressed as a percentage of the accumulation measured at 30 mm Ca2+. Immunoblotting—CaR expression was assessed by immunoblotting of HEK-293 cell lysates prepared at the same time as cells used for [3H]InsP accumulation and MAP kinase experiments as previously described (20Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins (5 μg for bCaR; 85 μg for tCaR) were electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking with Blotto (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with either anti-bCaR antiserum (21825A; 50 nm) or the same antiserum preincubated with 500-fold excess peptide. The antiserum was raised against an extracellular epitope of the bCaR (ADDDYGRPGIEKFREEAEERDI, corresponding to amino acid (aa) residues 215–236; see Fig. 2 (20Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). The corresponding sequence in tCaR (SDDEYGRPGIEKFENEMEERDI; aa residues 214–235) is ∼77% conserved. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA; 1:4000), a SuperSignal assay kit was used for signal detection (Pierce).Fig. 2Multiple sequence alignment of tilapia CaR (tCaR), representative piscine and mammalian CaRs, and a teleost pheromone receptor. sbCaR, sea bream CaR; fCaR, pufferfish (Fugu) CaR; hCaR, human CaR; bCaR, bovine CaR; SKCaR, dogfish shark calcium polyvalent cation-sensing receptor; fPherR, pufferfish pheromone receptor Ca13.

Statistical comparisons were conducted using paired or unpaired Student's t tests, as appropriate. Tilapia CaR cDNA Sequence and Deduced Protein Structure—Using a combination of RT-PCR and 5′- and 3′-(RACE), a 3394-bp length CaR cDNA was isolated from the kidney of fresh-water tilapia (GenBank™ accession number AY541693). An open reading frame marked by a Met start codon associated with a partial Kozak sequence began from nucleotide 149 of the transcript sequence. This open reading frame encoded a 940-aa protein (Fig. 1). The 3′-untranslated region (UTR) comprised 423 bp (excluding the stop codon) and included a single AATAAA polyadenylation signal. An N-terminal signal peptide of 18-aa length was predicted using SignalP version 2.0 (21Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Prot.

https://openalex.org/W2016590296,"In the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, catalase (KatA) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) are two highly abundant enzymes that are crucial for oxidative stress resistance and survival of the bacterium in the host. Here we report a connection unidentified previously between the two stress resistance enzymes. We observed that the catalase in ahpC mutant cells in comparison with the parent strain is inactivated partially (approximately 50%). The decrease of catalase activity is well correlated with the perturbation of the heme environment in catalase, as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To understand the reason for this catalase inactivation, we examined the inhibitory effects of hydroperoxides on H. pylori catalase (either present in cell extracts or added to the purified enzyme) by monitoring the enzyme activity and the EPR signal of catalase. H. pylori catalase is highly resistant to its own substrate, without the loss of enzyme activity by treatment with a molar ratio of 1:3000 H2 O2. However, it inactivated is by lower concentrations of organic hydroperoxides (the substrate of AhpC). Treatment with a molar ratio of 1:400 t-butyl hydroperoxide resulted in an inactivation of catalase by approximately 50%. UV-visible absorption spectra indicated that the catalase inactivation by organic hydroperoxides is caused by the formation of a catalytically incompetent compound II species. To further support the idea that organic hydroperoxides, which accumulate in the ahpC mutant cells, are responsible for the inactivation of catalase, we compared the level of lipid peroxidation found in ahpC mutant cells with that found in wild type cells. The results showed that the total amount of extractable lipid hydroperoxides in the ahpC mutant cells is approximately three times that in the wild type cells.

Our findings reveal a novel role of the organic hydroperoxide detoxification system in preventing catalase inactivation. The ability of pathogenic bacteria to resist oxidative stress is crucial to their infectiousness and pathogenesis in the host (1Storz G. Zheng M. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses.

To defend against reactive oxygen species that can cause protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage, living organisms rely on serial enzymatic machinery. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) 1The abbreviations used are: AhpC, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase; t-BOOH, t-butyl hydroperoxide. are virtually ubiquitous enzymes that confer oxidative stress resistance (3Imlay J.A.

Superoxide dismutase dismutates the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, and catalase breaks down H2O2 into water and O2. AhpC reduces organic hydroperoxides (ROOH, also extended to include HOOH) into the corresponding non-toxic alcohol (ROH). The elimination of organic hydroperoxides is particularly important for living cells because organic hydroperoxides can initiate a lipid peroxidation chain reaction and consequently propagate free radicals, leading to DNA and membrane damage (7Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). AhpC is a component of a large family of thiol-specific antioxidant proteins, with roles that are not generally well understood (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G Storz G Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 9Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). A highly successful human bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori induces a strong inflammatory response within the host, thereby releasing a high level of host-derived toxic oxygen species, but H. pylori can survive and colonize persistently in the harsh conditions of the gastric mucosa (10Bagchi D. Bhattachatya G. Stohs S.J. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Hazell S.L. Harris A.G. Trend M.A. Mobley H.L.T. Mendz G.L. Hazell S.L.

Trend M.A. Mobley H.L.T. Mendz G.L. Hazell S.L. Helicobacter pylori: Physiology and Genetics. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2001: 167-175Google Scholar). In addition, some other factors have been identified that play important roles in oxidative stress resistance. NapA, a ferritin-like iron-binding protein, is involved in oxidative stress resistance probably through sequestering free iron in the cells (13Olczak A.A. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3186-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Cooksley C. Jenks P.J. Green A. Cockayne A. Logan R.P. Hardie K.R. J. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 52: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); also, a NADPH quinone reductase (MdaB) confers oxidative stress resistance by maintaining the quinone pool of the cell in the reduced state (15Wang G. Maier R.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The disruption of each individual gene for superoxide dismutase, KatA, AhpC, or MdaB affects severely the ability of the bacterium to colonize the host stomach (15Wang G. Maier R.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Harris A.G. Wilson J.E. Danon S.J. Dixon M.F. Donegan K. Hazell S.L.

H. pylori expresses abundant levels of catalase and AhpC proteins (19Jungblut P.R. Bumann D. Haas G. Zimny-Arndt U. Holland P. Lamer S. Siejak F. Aebischer A. Meyer T.F. Mol.

It is a monofunctional catalase without peroxidase activity. A unique property of H. pylori catalase is that it has a pI of >9. Another property of H. pylori catalase, which is distinct from other typical catalases, is its stability at very high concentrations of H2O2 (20Hazell S.L. Evans D.J. Graham D.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). H. pylori cells were shown to be resistant to a high concentration (∼100 mm) of H2O2, and this resistance was abolished in katA– mutants (24Harris A.G. Hinds F.E. Beckhouse A.G. Kolesniow T. Hazell S.L. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3813-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). H. pylori AhpC is a major component of the AhpC-thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase-dependent peroxiredoxin system that catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides including H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides (22Baker L.M. Raudonikiene A. Hoffman P.S. Poole L.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Windle H.J. Fox A. Eidhin D.N. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5081-5089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as well as the reduction of peroxynitrite (26Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It was extremely difficult to obtain an ahpC knock-out mutant (21Lundstrom A.M. Bolin I. Microb. Pathog. 2000; 29: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Baker L.M. Raudonikiene A. Hoffman P.S. Poole L.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but the mutant was obtained eventually by screening transformants at a very low O2 (1% partial pressure) condition (13Olczak A.A. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3186-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AhpC mutant cells were shown to exhibit severe growth sensitivity to hydroperoxides and to the superoxide-generating agent, paraquat (13Olczak A.A. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3186-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We studied the relationship between these two important antioxidant proteins and discovered that the organic hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) plays a role that was unidentified previously in protecting catalase from inactivation by organic hydroperoxides. For the first time, it is shown that the loss of AhpC function leads to a significant increase of organic hydroperoxides within the cells and that these hydroperoxides are potent inhibitors of catalase. H. pylori Strains and Growth Conditions—H. pylori strain ATCC43504 or the isogenic mutants were cultured on Brucella agar (Difco) plates (called BA plates) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cultures of H. pylori were grown microaerobically at 37 °C in an incubator containing 5% CO2 and 2% oxygen. Chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) or kanamycin (40 μg/ml) was added in the medium for culturing mutants. DNA Techniques—All DNA manipulations were performed as described previously (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was extracted from H. pylori with the Aquapure genomic DNA extraction kit (Bio-Rad). Plasmid DNA preparations were carried out with the QiaPrep Spin mini kit (Qiagen). DNA fragments or PCR products were purified from agarose gels with the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). PCR was performed in a 2400 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with Taq or Pfu DNA polymerase (Fisher). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Construction of H. pylori Mutants—To construct a katA mutant, a 953-bp fragment containing the H. pylori katA gene with genomic DNA from strain ATCC43504 as a template was amplified by PCR using primers katAF (5′-TCCATAAGAGAACAAGCGCC-3′) and katAR (5′-CAACAATGTGATTACGGCCG-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned directly into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instruction, to generate pGEM-katA. The host strain used for cloning was Escherichia coli DH5α. Subsequently, a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase cassette was inserted at the unique HindIII site within the katA sequence of pGEM-katA. The recombinant plasmid was then introduced into H. pylori by natural transformation via allelic exchange, and chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were isolated. The disruption of the gene in the genome of the mutant strain (ATCC43504, katA:Cm) was confirmed by PCR showing an increase in the expected size of the PCR product. With a similar procedure, the ferritin mutant strain (ATCC43504, pfr:Kan) was constructed as follows. A 1213-bp fragment containing the H. pylori pfr gene was amplified by PCR using primers pfrF (5′-TGGCTAGTTTTAAGGGCATG-3′) and pfrR (5′-AAGCGCAAAATTTGCAAGCG-3′) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector. Subsequently, the 301-bp HindIII fragment within the pfr gene was replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette. The construction of other mutant strains (sodB, mdaB, ahpC1, ahpC2, ahpC,napA, and napA) in our laboratory was described previously (13Olczak A.A. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3186-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Wang G. Maier R.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Seyler R.W. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An H. pylori ATCC43504 katA,ahpC double mutant was constructed in this study by transforming ahpC:Kan (type I) mutant strain with the plasmid pGEM-katA:Cm. Cell-free Extract and Membrane Fraction—Plate-grown H. pylori cells were harvested and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 18,000 pounds/in2. Crude extracts were then cleared of unbroken cells by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (cell-free extract) was then subjected to ultracentrifugation (45,000 × g for 60 min) to obtain the membrane fraction (the pellet). Protein Concentration Determination and Gel Electrophoresis—Protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). For SDS-PAGE, 5 μg of cell extract was placed into an SDS buffer, boiled for 5 min, and applied to a denaturing 12.5% acrylamide gel. Densitometric measurements were made for all the protein bands on the SDS gel, and the portion (percentage) attributed to a specific protein (KatA or AhpC) was calculated. Based on this percentage, the molecular weight of the protein, and the total protein concentration, we estimated the molar concentration of KatA or AhpC in the cell extract. Purification of Catalase—Native H. pylori catalase was purified following a similar method described by Radcliff et al. (28Radcliff F.J. Hazell S.L. Kolesnikow T. Doidge C. Lee A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4668-4674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, H. pylori cells grown on plates were harvested by suspension in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in the buffer. Cells were disrupted by three cycles through a French pressure cell at 18,000 pounds/in2, and the lysate was centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was then collected and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was applied to a SP-Sepharose cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and proteins were eluted by the creation of a gradient with 1 m NaCl in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Catalase-positive fractions were selected by checking for oxygen-reducing activity in 3% H2O2. The pooled catalase-positive fractions were further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The purified catalase was then filtered to sterilize and stored at 4 °C, protected from light. Determination of Catalase Activity—The quantitative catalase activity of H. pylori cell extract or purified catalase protein was determined following the method described by Hazell et al. (20Hazell S.L. Evans D.J. Graham D.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, catalase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by following the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm (ϵ240 nm = 43.48 m–1 cm–1) of 13 mm H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline. All assays were repeated to give 12 rate determinations for the first minute of reaction. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of H2 O2– min 1 under the assay condition. Determination of Lipid Hydroperoxides—The amount of lipid hydroperoxides within H. pylori cell extracts or the membrane fractions was determined with a lipid hydroperoxide assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, lipid hydroperoxides within a sample were first extracted into chloroform, which eliminates any interference caused by hydrogen peroxide or endogenous ferric ions in the sample. The lipid hydroperoxides in the extracted sample were used directly in the assay by reacting them with ferrous ions. The resulting ferric ions were detected using thiocyanate ions as the chromogen by measuring absorbance at 500 nm (ϵ500nm = 16,667 m–1 cm–1). An ethanolic solution of 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid was used as a lipid hydroperoxide standard. Determination of Organic Peroxide Reductase Activity in Cell Extract—t-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) was added to the H. pylori wild type cell extract to a final concentration of 1 mm. At various time points, an aliquot of the sample was removed and assayed for the remaining amount of t-BOOH using the lipid hydroperoxide assay kit as described above. The organic peroxide reductase activity was expressed as the decrease in the amount (nmol) of t-BOOH/min/mg of total protein in the cell extract. EPR Spectroscopy—In this study, EPR spectroscopy was applied to whole cells, cell extracts, or purified catalase to monitor changes of the catalase heme environment. For whole cell samples, a 5-ml cell suspension in phosphate-buffered saline (A600nm = 8) was incubated with 20 mm des-ferrioxamine at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were then centrifuged, washed with cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), resuspended in a final volume of 0.4 ml of the same buffer, and frozen in 3-mm quartz EPR tubes by immersion in liquid nitrogen. For cell extracts or purified catalase, the samples were incubated (for 30 min at room temperature) with different concentrations of hydroperoxides, as indicated, and frozen immediately in EPR tubes. Samples were stored at –78 °C for EPR spectroscopic analysis. X band (∼9.6 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP-300E EPR spectrometer equipped with an ER-4116 dual mode cavity and an ESR-9 flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). The intensity of the EPR signals was normalized to the OD of whole cell samples and the protein absorption band of cell-free extracts and purified samples. Monitoring KatA and AhpC Proteins in H. pylori Cell Extract by SDS-PAGE—Both KatA and AhpC are major proteins expressed in H. pylori cells. Hazell et al. (20Hazell S.L. Evans D.J. Graham D.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported that catalase accounts for ∼1% of the total protein of the cell in H. pylori. The proteome analysis of Jungblut et al. (19Jungblut P.R. Bumann D. Haas G. Zimny-Arndt U. Holland P. Lamer S. Siejak F. Aebischer A. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) showed that AhpC (also called TsaA) is the third most abundant protein in H. pylori. The expression level of these proteins in H. pylori cells is visualized easily on SDS-PAGE. We identified the specific protein bands by (a) the expected molecular weight, (b) the loss of the band in the corresponding mutant strain, and (c) direct N-terminal sequencing of the protein band. The regulation mechanisms for the expression of KatA and AhpC in H. pylori are currently unclear, but they may involve regulation at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Using SDS-PAGE, we measured the net expression level of the proteins. There are some variations in the protein expression levels by different strains (data not shown). The profiles of the total proteins in the parent strain ATCC43504 and the isogenic mutant strains katA, ahpC, or napA are shown in Fig. 1. Compared with the wild type strain, the corresponding protein band of KatA, AhpC, and NapA was missing in the respective mutant strains. As shown previously (13Olczak A.A. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3186-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), there are two types of ahpC mutants, with the type I mutant overexpressing NapA. Based on densitometric measurement of the protein bands on the gel, KatA and AhpC each constitute 2–3% of the total proteins in the wild type cell. Compared with other bacteria, for example Campylobacter jejuni (29Baillon M.L. van Vliet A.H. Ketley J.M. Constantinidou C. Penn C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4798-4804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expression levels of KatA and AhpC are much higher in H. pylori. Decreased Catalase Activity in ahpC Mutant Cells—H2O2 is a general agent of oxidative stress to the cells. To determine the relative contributions of H. pylori superoxide dismutase, KatA, AhpC, NapA, or MdaB in resistance to H2O2, we determined the H2O2 decomposing activity of each mutant strain compared with the wild type strain. As shown in Fig. 2A, wild type H. pylori exhibited a high level of catalase activity (∼3000 units/mg of total protein), whereas, knock-out mutants in katA (the catalase gene) resulted in a complete loss of catalase activity. As expected, the disruption of other antioxidant genes such as sodB (the gene for superoxide dismutase) or mdaB (the gene for NADPH quinone reductase) did not affect significantly catalase activity of the cells. To our surprise, however, the catalase activity in gene-targeted ahpC mutant cells was determined to be approximately half of that in the wild type cells (Fig. 2A). It was observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that catalase activity is affected by the mutation of a separate gene (30Ma J.F. Ochsner U.A. Klotz M.G. Nanayakkara V.K. Howell M.L. Johnson Z. Posey J.E. Vasil M.L. Monaco J.J. Hassett D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3730-3742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); a bfrA mutant of P. aeruginosa had only 47% the KatA activity of wild type strain, despite possessing the wild type expression level of KatA. BfrA, composed of 24 subunits and capable of binding 700 iron atoms, is the major iron storage protein in P. aeruginosa (31Moore G.R. Kadir F.H. al-Massad F.K. Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Greenwood C. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The results of Ma et al. (30Ma J.F. Ochsner U.A. Klotz M.G. Nanayakkara V.K. Howell M.L. Johnson Z. Posey J.E. Vasil M.L. Monaco J.J. Hassett D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3730-3742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that BfrA is required as a source of iron for the heme prothetic group of KatA. H. pylori possess two iron storage proteins, NapA and Pfr. NapA is a homologue of bacterial DNA-protecting proteins, and its molecular structure has been determined (32Tonello F. Dundon W.G. Satin B. Molinari M. Tognon G. Grandi G. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33Zanotti G. Papinutto E. Dundon W. Battistutta R. Seveso M. Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has a dodecameric structure (12 subunits) that is capable of binding up to 500 iron atoms (32Tonello F. Dundon W.G. Satin B. Molinari M. Tognon G. Grandi G. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Pfr is the major iron storage protein in H. pylori (34Bereswill S. Waidner U. Odenbreit S. Lichte F. Fassbinder F. Bode G. Kist M. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2505-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As a typical ferritin, Pfr forms a 24-mer structure and binds more than 2000 iron atoms (35Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, H. pylori KatA activity was not affected significantly by the loss of either NapA or Pfr. Therefore, the observation that H. pylori KatA activity is affected by the loss of AhpC is an unusual phenomenon, unrelated to iron storage, which is different from the modulation of catalase activity by BfrA in P. aeruginosa. As shown in Fig. 1, the resolution of the KatA protein band and its density relative to the total protein pattern allow it to be monitored unambiguously. A comparison of the protein profiles from crude extracts of the wild type with various mutant strains (Fig. 1) indicated that the knock-out of AhpC did not change significantly the level of catalase protein expression. Hence, a regulatory role for AhpC in catalase expression was ruled out. Therefore, we hypothesized that the catalase in ahpC mutant cells might have undergone certain structural changes leading to its partial inactivation. Purified H. pylori AhpC was shown to be able to reduce H2O2in vitro at a rate similar to its t-BOOH reducing activity (22Baker L.M. Raudonikiene A. Hoffman P.S. Poole L.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the H2O2 decomposing activity in the katA mutant (AhpC+) cells was undetectable (our results are shown in Fig. 2A) (see Refs. 23Odenbreit S. Wieland B. Haas R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6960-6967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 24Harris A.G. Hinds F.E. Beckhouse A.G. Kolesniow T. Hazell S.L. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3813-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because AhpC requires thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase for its activity, failure to detect the H2O2 decomposing activity of AhpC could be the result of a limited amount of available thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase proteins. Therefore, we tested whether the wild type cell extract has the activity to reduce organic peroxides. Using t-BOOH as a substrate and without adding reductant, the wild type cell extract showed reductase activity, with a specific activity of 15.6 ± 2.3 nmol (t-BOOH reduced)/min/mg of total protein in the cell extract. If AhpC had a similar rate of H2O2 reducing activity, it would be far below the detection level of the assay system for catalase. Thus, the decrease of catalase activity observed in ahpC mutant cells could not be attributed to the loss of the H2O2 decomposing activity of AhpC but to the perturbation of catalase itself. A Perturbed Heme Environment Associated with Catalase in ahpC Mutant Cells—Catalase contains a heme-active site, which can be detected by EPR spectroscopy in ferric oxidation states (36Nicholls P. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 51-106Crossref Google Scholar). Purified H. pylori catalase exhibits a characteristic, nearly axial high spin ferric EPR signal in which effective g values = 6.36, 5.35, and 1.98 (37Loewen P.C. Carpena X. Rovira C. Ivancich A. Perez-Luque R. Haas R. Odenbreit S. Nicholls P. Fita I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3089-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Considering the high abundance of catalase protein in H. pylori and the high transition probability of the low field components of axial high spin ferric resonances, we applied EPR analysis to whole cells to mon"
https://openalex.org/W1971422980,"We have characterized Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase, a critical regulator of bacterial virulence. Steady-state kinetics, product inhibition, and isotope exchange studies are consistent with a kinetic mechanism in which the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine binds first, followed by sequence-specific DNA binding and catalysis. The enzyme has a fast methyl transfer step followed by slower product release steps, and we directly demonstrate the competence of the enzyme cofactor complex. Methylation of adjacent GATC sites is distributive with DNA derived from a genetic element that controls the transcription of the adjacent genes. This indicates that the first methylation event is followed by enzyme release. The affinity of the enzyme for both DNA and S-adenosylmethionine was determined. Our studies provide a basis for further structural and functional analysis of this important enzyme and for the identification of inhibitors for potential therapeutic applications.

Bacterial DNA methyltransferases generate N4-methylcytosine, C5-methylcytosine, and N6-methyladenosine in an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent reaction (1Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial DNA methylation plays critical roles, including DNA repair, phage protection, gene regulation, and DNA replication, in diverse biological pathways. The majority of DNA methyltransferases form one-half of a restriction-modification system that protects the host bacteria against bacteriophage infection. Together with cognate restriction endonucleases, which generally cleave a short palindromic sequence, these restriction-modification systems provide the foundation for many recombinant DNA manipulations; the endonucleases and methyltransferases have provided many structural and mechanistic insights into the process of sequence-specific DNA recognition and modification. Not all DNA methyltransferases have an endonuclease partner or at least one which is known. Thus, DNA adenine methyltransferase (DAM, 1The abbreviations used are: DAM, DNA adenine methyltransferase; hDAM, histidine-tagged DAM; CcrM, cell cycle-regulated methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; M., DNA methyltransferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MRB, methylation reaction buffer; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine.1The abbreviations used are: DAM, DNA adenine methyltransferase; hDAM, histidine-tagged DAM; CcrM, cell cycle-regulated methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; M., DNA methyltransferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MRB, methylation reaction buffer; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine. methylates the adenine in GATC) in γ-proteobacteria (2Hernday A.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are involved in post-replicative mismatch repair, DNA replication timing, cell cycle regulation, and the control of gene expression. DAM and CcrM have been identified as new targets for antibiotic development (5Wahnon D.C. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 976-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) because some pathogenic bacteria are either avirulent or not viable when the corresponding genes are removed. DNA adenine methylation regulates the pili formation genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella, providing one of the first and clearest examples of epigenetic gene regulation (2Hernday A. Krabbe M. Braaten B. Low D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16470-16476Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This DNA-mediated gene regulation involves differentially methylated GATC sites, which represent a small minority of the ∼5,000–20,000 GATC sites found in a typical bacterial genome. E. coli DAM is a functional monomer of 278 amino acids (6Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our present understanding of how this enzyme functions is based largely on a small number of reports (6Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Urig S. Gowher H. Hermann A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol.

Guschlbauer W. Fazakerley G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6394-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Herman and Modrich (6Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first characterized the enzyme with plasmid DNA, providing various kinetic parameters and evidence in support of a non-processive path during the methylation of multisite substrates. The apparent Km values (AdoMet and DNA), and the apparent turnover number (19 min–1) are similar to those determined for other DNA methyltransferases. The finding that the enzyme dissociates from DNA after an initial methylation cycle, at least with DNA in which the next site is 2455 bp away, has several biological implications (6Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the methylation state of two GATC sites in the Pap regulon in part determines the phase variation of pili formation (2Hernday A. Krabbe M. Braaten B. Low D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16470-16476Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that EcoRI DNA methyltransferase (M.EcoRI) is not processive with substrates in which adjacent sites are only 50 bp apart. We also identified the interesting trend that methyltransferases not part of a known restriction-modification system act processively, whereas those that are part of a restriction-modification system act distributively (11Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2209-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The demonstration that CcrM is a processive enzyme certainly fits into this pattern (13Berdis A.J. Lee I. Coward J.K. Stephens C. Wright R. Shapiro L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2874-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on the results of Hermann and Modrich (6Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DAM appears not to follow this trend. Subsequently, Bergerat et al. (8Bergerat A. Kriebardis A. Guschlbauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4064-4070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), provided evidence that the ability of DAM to methylate a particular GATC site depends on DNA sequences involving 2–3 bp flanking the recognition site. This qualitative analysis provided intriguing insights about how DAM might differentially methylate a subset of the thousands of GATC sites in a bacterial genome. The number and sequence context of such differentially methylated GATC sites remains poorly characterized (8Bergerat A. Kriebardis A. Guschlbauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4064-4070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the earlier work, Bergerat et al. (8Bergerat A. Kriebardis A. Guschlbauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4064-4070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed clear evidence for processive catalysis when adjacent sites were as close as 18 bp apart and in large substrates with longer inter-site distances. Recently, Urig et al. (7Urig S. Gowher H. Hermann A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) also showed evidence for processive catalysis with DNA of various lengths. Our interest in DAM from E. coli and other bacteria is to understand how DNA adenine methylation regulates gene expression and to develop therapeutics based on intervening in this process, either directly against DAM or against other components of the regulatory machinery. Here we present a further characterization of E. coli DAM. The enzyme's order of substrate and product binding and dissociation have been identified; the rate-limiting step during catalysis is product dissociation; and the distributive catalysis of the enzyme on a regulatory genetic element containing two GATC sites is shown. We also report on the stability constants of several enzyme complexes involving cofactors, cofactor analogs, and DNA. Our results provide the basis for a better understanding of this critical bacterial protein. SyberGold, calf thymus DNA, and ScintiVerse scintillation fluid were purchased from Molecular Probes, Roche Applied Science, and Fisher, respectively. Vistra Green, [methyl-3H]AdoMet (average specific activity: 75 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences. DE81 filters were from Whatman. S-Adenosylmethionine and sinefungin were from Sigma. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs. Determination of Protein Concentration—DAM concentrations were determined based on a molecular mass of 32 kDa and an extinction coefficient of ϵ = 1.15 ml/mg cm (6Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cofactor Purification—S-Adenosylmethionine was further purified as described previously (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All cofactor dilutions were in 0.1 n HCl. Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Purification—Mechanistic analysis required the use of a single site DNA substrate. The hairpin substrate and unmethylated and hemimethylated 20-mer substrates are shown below. The target base and the recognition sequence are bolded and underlined; the complementary strand, if it does not contain an adenine that can undergo methylation, is simply underlined; and the hairpin turn is italic and underlined. Substrate oligonucleotides were synthesized by Midland and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Dynamax PureDNA column (Rainin Instrument Co.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Oligonucleotides were stored in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Concentrations were determined using calculated extinction coefficients. For gel mobility shift assays, DNA substrates were radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Unincorporated label was removed with Bio-Gel P-6 spin columns (Bio-Rad). Preparation and Purification of DAM—We purified DAM from two expression constructs. DAM, overexpressed in E. coli strain XL-2Blue (Stratagene) harboring plasmid pDAL572 (provided by Bruce A. Braaten, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA) was grown in LB media (10 g of bacto-tryptone, 5 g of bacto-yeast, and 10 g of NaCl/liter) supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.60 was reached. The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.05% l-arabinose, grown for 4 h at 37 °C, centrifuged immediately, and stored at –20 °C. Cells were resuspended in 120 ml of P-11 buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol), protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), and 0.8 m NaCl and then lysed by French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 45 min in a Sorvall SA 600 rotor. The supernatant was loaded onto a 350-ml Whatman P-11 column and eluted with a salt gradient of 0.2-0.8 m NaCl. Fractions containing DAM were pooled, dialyzed in B-S buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a 30-ml blue Sepharose column (Pharmacia Corp.). DAM was eluted with a salt gradient of 0–1.5 m NaCl, and the appropriate fractions were pooled, flash frozen, and stored at –70 °C. A histidine-tagged DAM (hDAM) was generated by amplifying the dam gene with the Expand™ high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) using 0.1 μg of plasmid pTP166 input DNA (15Marinus M.G. Carraway M. Frey A.Z. Brown L. Arraj J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 192: 288-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The purified PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and cloned into PET-28a (Novagen). Three clones were sequenced, and one was found to have the correct nucleotide sequence. This plasmid was then transferred to the BL21(DE3)pLysS expression strain and selected on LB kanamycin/chloramphenicol plates. Plating and growth were done in LB with kanamycin/chloramphenicol selection. The enzyme was overexpressed as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein. A 12-liter culture was grown to an A595 of 0.6 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h before harvesting. The cell pellet was stored at –80 °C. As needed, the cell pellet was thawed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm imidazole) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed (1 mg/ml lysozyme, stirring for 30 min at 4 °C), sonicated, and centrifuged. The cell lysate supernatant was loaded onto 1.5–2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow columns (Qiagen Inc.) pre-equilibrated on fast protein liquid chromatography with buffer A. An imidazole gradient in buffer A (20–300 mm imidazole) eluted the protein, and the pooled fractions were dialyzed overnight in buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) at 4 °C. This was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose FF FPLC column (AP Biotech), and the protein was collected across a salt gradient of 50–600 mm NaCl. Pooled fractions were dialyzed overnight in DAM storage buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm EDTA), flash frozen in small aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. An 8-liter growth yielded 5 mg of 90% pure hDAM. Circular Dichroism Analysis of Protein Structure—Circular dichroism spectra were obtained using purified DAM and hDAM in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at room temperature. Data were collected on an Aviv 202 circular dichroism spectrophotometer using a 500-μl quartz fluorescence cuvette with a 0.2-cm slit width (Starna). Data were collected between 190 and 265 nm, and spectral data were fit to curves using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Secondary predictions of both DAM and hDAM were done using multiple CD spectra and the program CDSSTR from DichroWeb (16Lobley A. Whitmore L.

Methyltransferase Assays—Filter binding assays monitored the incorporation of tritium-labeled methyl groups into DNA (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 0.4 mg/ml BSA. Substrate concentrations were noted in each experiment. The methyltransferase was diluted in protein dilution buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). After incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by transferring aliquots to 2.5-cm Whatman DE81 circular filter papers. Filters were washed three times with 50 mm KH2PO4, once with 80% ethanol, once with 95% ethanol, and once with diethyl ether, for 10 min each time. Filters were air-dried, and tritium content was determined in 4 ml of Liquiscint using a Beckman model LS 1701 scintillation counter or ScintiVerse scintillation fluid using a Beckman model LS 6500. KdAdoMet Determination—Native protein fluorescence-based KdAdoMet determination was done on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B as described previously (17Maegley K.A. Gonzalez Jr., L. Smith D.W. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18527-18532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KdDNA Determination—DNA substrates were radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. For KdDNA determination in the presence of sinefungin, binding assays containing 5 nm32P-labeled DNA and DAM from 10–2000 nm in MRB (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.20 mg/ml BSA, and 10 mm DTT) and 50 μm sinefungin were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min (18Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8966-8970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DAM was diluted into protein dilution buffer. Samples were loaded onto pre-run 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were run at 300 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried, exposed to image plates, and analyzed on a STORM 840 densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Dissociation constants were derived from data fit to rectangular hyperbolic equations using KaleidaGraph. Kinetic Burst and Isotope Partitioning—[methyl-3H]AdoMet (30 μm) and DAM (60 nm, 150 nm) were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C. Calf thymus DNA (0.1 mg/ml) was added, and the reaction was stopped after 10, 30, 70, and 90 s by placing an aliquot onto DE81 filters (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the isotope partitioning experiments, a 15-μl reaction volume (MRB, 0.2 μm DAM, 5 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA) was preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min; a 4-μl aliquot was diluted to 100 μl containing MRB, calf thymus DNA (1 μm), and [methyl-3H]AdoMet (5 μm) (hot chase) or unlabeled AdoMet (cold chase). Aliquots of the chase solutions were placed onto DE81 filters and analyzed as described (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Processivity Analysis—Processivity was determined with a 326-bp PCR fragment with GATC sites at positions 122 and 225, which includes the Pap operon (20Braaten B.A. Nou X. Kaltenbach L.S. Low D.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 577-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), using a processivity assay as described previously (11Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2209-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DAM (10 nm) was incubated with the 326-bp PCR-amplified fragment (1 μm) and AdoMet (30 μm) in MRB. Aliquots (5 μl) were removed every minute up to 10 min and stopped with 195 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and 200 μl of phenol-chloroform. The isolated DNA was digested with DpnII endonuclease (cuts GATC sites only if not methylated), run on an 8% PAGE, stained with Sybergold, and analyzed by densitometry. Lineweaver-Burk Analysis—Reactions contained hDAM (2 nm), 20-mer duplex DNA (7.5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 nm), [3H]AdoMet (10, 15, 30, 100 μm), and BSA (1 mg/ml) in 1× MRB (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Methylation was initiated by adding either DNA or [3H]AdoMet and incubating at 37 °C for 20 min. 1/velocity versus 1/DNA concentration and 1/velocity versus 1/AdoMet concentration double-reciprocal plots were constructed. All kinetic analyses were performed using a BASIC version of the Cleland programs (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylhomocysteine Inhibition—Reactions with varying AdoMet and AdoHcy contained hDAM (2 nm), 20-mer duplex DNA (150 nm), AdoHcy (0, 75, 150, 250, 350 μm), [3H]AdoMet (2, 4, 8, 30 μm), and BSA (1 mg/ml) in 1× MRB. Reactions with varying DNA contained 20-mer duplex DNA at 20, 50, 100, and 300 nm, and [3H]AdoMet was 15 μm. Methylation was initiated by adding [3H]AdoMet, and incubation at 37 °C was for 20 min. Methylated DNA Inhibition—Reactions with varying methylated and unmethylated 20-mer duplex contained hDAM (2 nm), 20-mer duplex DNA (30, 50, 100, 200 nm), methylated 20-mer duplex DNA (0, 75, 150, 300 nm), [3H]AdoMet (15 μm), and BSA (1 mg/ml) in 1× MRB. For reactions where methylated 20-mer duplex and AdoMet were varied, reactions contained the same ingredients, except 20-mer duplex DNA was 60 nm, and [3H]AdoMet was 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 30, and 100 μm. Expression, Purification, and Preliminary Characterization of DAM and hDAM—DAM and the His-tagged construct hDAM were both overexpressed. The two-column purification procedure for DAM generated 2–5 mg of homogeneous protein/liter of bacterial culture (data not shown); the purification procedure for hDAM provided ∼1 mg of >90% pure protein/liter of bacterial culture. The apparent k (2.5 and 0.93 min–1), KmDNA (3.6 and 17.4 nm), and KmAdoMet (12 and 5.6 μm) for DAM and hDAM, respectively, were similar when the 20-mer DNA substrate was used. Circular Dichroism Results—Circular dichroism spectra of DAM and hDAM were used in conjunction with CDSSTR (16Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) to make secondary structure predictions. Similar values were predicted for both enzymes. The predicted DAM percentages were 49% α-helix, 25% β-sheet, 7% turn, and 17% unordered, whereas the predicted hDAM percentages were 54% α-helix, 24% β-sheet, 5% turn, and 15% unordered. DNA methyltransferases utilize a broad range of secondary structures, and our calculations fall within these values. Kinetic Mechanism—The kinetic mechanism was analyzed by double-reciprocal analysis using hDAM methyltransferase (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The 1/velocity versus 1/DNA concentration plot shows intersecting lines in the second quadrant, whereas the 1/velocity versus 1/AdoMet concentration plot shows lines intersecting on the y-axis (Fig. 1, A and B). A ping-pong mechanism is unlikely because the patterns in Fig. 1, A and B are intersecting, hence the ternary complex methyltransferase-DNA-AdoMet is indicated. Product inhibition studies with S-adenosylhomocysteine showed uncompetitive inhibition with DNA (Fig. 1E) and competitive inhibition with AdoMet (Fig. 1F). The simple competitive plot for AdoMet and AdoHcy at a constant DNA concentration rules out a random steady-state mechanism. The uncompetitive inhibition observed with AdoHcy and DNA at a constant AdoMet concentration also argues against random mechanisms; this pattern suggests that a binary methyltransferase-DNA complex can bind AdoHcy. Product inhibition studies with methylated DNA showed uncompetitive inhibition with DNA (Fig. 1C) and mixed type inhibition with AdoMet (Fig. 1D). These data are consistent with a steady-state ordered Bi Bi mechanism where the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine binds first. Additional evidence against a random rapid equilibrium mechanism and a DNA first-ordered mechanism is provided by the uncompetitive inhibition pattern observed with methylated DNA and DNA (Fig. 1C) because a competitive plot is expected in these cases. Although consistent with both an ordered AdoMet first mechanism (rapid equilibrium binding) and random steady-state mechanisms, such mechanisms are inconsistent with much of our other data. The reconciliation of the double-reciprocal analysis and product inhibition data forms the basis of the kinetic mechanism assignment. The kcat (0.93 ± 0.06 min–1), KmDNA (17.4 ± 3.0 nm), and KmAdoMet (5.6 ± 1.1 μm) were obtained using linear replots and SigmaPlot-calculated values. For all product inhibition analyses, data were fit to standard competitive, non-competitive, mixed type, and uncompetitive inhibition equations using SigmaPlot (21Spector T. Cleland W.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fit with the highest R2 value was selected as the best fit. Determination of KmAdoMet—E. coli DAM has two tryptophans at positions 10 and 236, which provide a basis for probing ligand-induced conformational changes (6Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet was added at 10 concentrations from 1 to 200 μm in MRB, and the decrease in native protein fluorescence was plotted as a function of AdoMet concentration. Triplicate determination was used to calculate the thermodynamic dissociation constant and associated standard error, 18.7 ± 1.81 (data not shown). The KdAdoMet is similar to the KmAdoMet (Table I), indicating that AdoMet is bound with comparable affinity in the binary complex and in the presence of DNA.Table IDAM kinetic and thermodynamic parametersdsaDouble-stranded. 20-merHairpinKmAdoMet(μM)5.6 ± 1.16.4 ± 1.2KmDNA(nM)17.4 ± 3.028.6 ± 0.16KaDNA(nM)119 ± 7.3NDbND, not detectable.kcat(min−1)0.93 ± 0.061.19 ± 0.33KlAdoHey(μM)41.6 ± 10.4NDKIDNAm(nM)350 ± 30NDa Double-stranded.b ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Determination of KdDNA—The affinity of the enzyme (DAM) for an unmethylated duplex (20-mer) was determined by gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 2) using 50 μm sinefungin. The dissociation constant (KdDNA), 119 ± 7.3 nm (Table I), was determined from the scanned gel and resultant binding isotherm. Although similar to KmDNA (Table I), direct comparison is compromised by the use of sinefungin for the KdDNA and AdoMet for KmDNA determinations. Burst Experiments—Burst experiments provide insight about which steps limit catalytic turnover, the amount of active enzyme, and an apparent kcat determination (19Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Under high enzyme and substrate (DNA and AdoMet) conditions, DAM manifests a burst of product formation, followed by a slower rate (Fig. 3A). Because the filter binding assay measures formation of methylated DNA, which includes product that is still associated with the enzyme, the simplest interpretation of these results is that methylation is faster than subsequent product release steps. The pre-steady-state phase (before 10 s) is followed by the steady-state phase, and the slope of the latter provides a measure of the apparent kcat. The slope of the higher enzyme condition (squares, 150 nm) is correspondingly greater than the lower enzyme condition (circles, 60 nm). Extrapolation of both plots to zero time provides an estimate of the active enzyme, which within experimental error is >95% active. Increasing the AdoMet concentration from the 30 μm used in these experiments does not result in any changes in the product formation profiles (data not shown). Isotope Partition—Our steady-state kinetic analysis suggests that the binary enzyme-AdoMet complex is catalytically competent. This can be directly tested through the use of an isotope-partitioning experiment (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As in the burst experiment (Fig. 3A), preincubation of radiolabeled AdoMet and enzyme followed by the addition of DNA and more radiolabeled AdoMet in a chase results in the rapid formation of product. Adding a 25-fold excess of unlabeled AdoMet in the chase along with DNA results in a 3-fold decrease in the vertical axis intercept. A non-zero vertical intercept under these conditions requires the initial binary enzyme-AdoMet complex to be catalytically competent because a 25-fold reduction in AdoMet-specific activity results in a near zero level of detected product when the labeled and unlabeled AdoMet are premixed (data not shown). The 3-fold decrease in vertical intercept shows that upon DNA addition, the binary complex dissociates to a greater extent than proceeding to form the ternary complex and catalysis (14Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2154155694,"The iron-dependent regulator (IdeR) protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and its better characterized homologue, the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, are iron-dependent regulatory proteins that control gene expression in response to iron availability in bacteria. IdeR regulates several genes required for iron uptake and storage including those involved in the synthesis of transition metal chelators called siderophores that are linked to the M. tuberculosis virulence. In this study, the metal ion and binding affinities for IdeR binding to an fxbA operator duplex DNA were estimated using fluorescence assays. The Fe2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ affinities of the two metal ion binding sites in IdeR that are involved in the activation of the regulator DNA binding process in vitro were independently estimated. Binding to the two metal ion binding sites is apparently cooperative and the two affinities differ significantly. Occupation of the first metal ion binding site causes dimerization of IdeR, and the metal ion affinity is about 4 μm for Ni2+ and much less for Fe2+ and Co2+. Binding of the second metal ion fully activates IdeR for binding to the fxbA operator. The equilibrium metal ion dissociation constants for IdeR-fxbA operator binding are ∼9 μm for Fe2+,13 μm for Ni2+, and 23 μm for Co2+.

Iron is an essential nutrient that is used in many critical physiological functions in living organisms. In mammalian hosts, iron is present as Fe3+ chelated to transferrin and lactoferrin. The concentration of free Fe3+ in human serum is extremely low and studies have reported its concentration to be from 10-9 to 10-15m (1Bullen J.J. Rogers H.J. Griffiths E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1978; 80: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bagg A. Neilands J.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is far below what is needed for normal bacterial growth. Pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae have developed an elaborate iron uptake system to overcome the low Fe3+ availability. This iron uptake system is tightly regulated because excess iron can cause irreparable oxidative damage to the organism once the Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ within the bacteria (3Sritharan M. World J. Microbio Biotech. 2000; 16: 769-780Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The iron-dependent regulator (IdeR) 1The abbreviations used are: IdeR, iron-dependent regulator; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DtxR, diptheria toxin repressor; DLS, dynamic light scattering; SH, Src homology domain.1The abbreviations used are: IdeR, iron-dependent regulator; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DtxR, diptheria toxin repressor; DLS, dynamic light scattering; SH, Src homology domain. protein from M. tuberculosis and its better characterized homologue, the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) from C. diphtheriae, regulate iron uptake at the transcriptional level. In the presence of reduced Fe2+, IdeR binds to the operator region of the genes that code for enzymes crucial for the production of siderophores and other virulence factors. Siderophores are transition metal chelators secreted by the bacteria to scavenge iron. Siderophore production insures the availability of Fe2+ needed for bacterial growth, and survival of the pathogen within the host is closely linked to virulence (4Macham L.P. Ratledge C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 89: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Payne S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Dhople A.M. Ibanez M.A. Poirier T.C. Microbios. 1996; 87: 77-87PubMed Google Scholar). IdeR is a key regulator of siderophore production in M. tuberculosis (7Rodriguez G.M. Gold B. Gomez M. Dussurget O. Smith I. Tuber. Lung Dis. 1999; 79: 287-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Fiss E.H. Yu S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Upon entering the host, M. tuberculosis secretes siderophores and other virulence factors capable of extracting iron from heme and iron transport proteins in the host (9Kochan I. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1973; 60: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Raghu B. Sarma G.R. Venkatesan P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the fxbA gene encodes a putative formyl-transferase that is crucial for siderophore production in M. smegmatis. The gene is transcribed under low iron conditions when IdeR is deactivated. Under high iron conditions, binding of Fe2+ activates IdeR binding to the fxbA operator, which prevents fxbA gene expression. Thus IdeR is critical to the survival and the virulence of M. tuberculosis because it plays a role in the maintenance of iron homeostasis and it regulates expression of virulence factors during infection. Indeed, ideR is an essential gene for M. tuberculosis survival. IdeR cannot be disrupted in M. tuberculosis in the absence of a second functional copy of the gene. Mutation studies have suggested that this essentiality of the ideR gene is related to its regulation of intracellular levels of iron (11Rodriguez G.M. Voskuil M.I. Gold B. Schoolnik G.K. Smith I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3371-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of IdeR and DtxR have shown that the regulators are homodimeric proteins in their active state. Two IdeR/DtxR homodimers bind to the operator region to form a dimer-dimer DNA binding complex (12Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 285: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Feese M.D. Ingason B.P. Goranson-Siekierke J. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5959-5966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Domain 1 is the DNA binding domain, and it contains a helix-turn-helix motif. Domain 2 is the dimerization domain and it contains metal ion binding sites 1 and 2. Domain 3 folds similarly to the well known Src-SH3 domains (18Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) even though it has no significant sequence homology to such domains. It is attached to domain 2 via a flexible tether region. Recent NMR studies reported by Wang et al. (19Wang G. Wylie G.P. Twigg P.D. Caspar D.L. Murphy J.R. Logan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6119-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggest that this third SH3-like domain in DtxR binds to a proline-rich region of domain 2, residues 125–139, possibly stabilizing the inactive monomeric form of IdeR. However, in the crystallographic studies (Pohl et al., Ref. 15Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) of the fully activated DtxR dimer in complex with DNA, as well as in the activated IdeR structure (Feese et al., Ref. 13Feese M.D. Ingason B.P. Goranson-Siekierke J. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5959-5966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and in the complex of IdeR with DNA (17Wisedchaisri G. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1155-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the SH3-like domain is found to wedge itself between domains 1 and 2 via multiple protein contacts contributing two of the ligands for the metal ion binding at site 1. It was postulated from these studies that the domain 3 to metal ion site 1 interaction facilitates DNA binding. Similar interactions have also been observed in IdeR (13Feese M.D. Ingason B.P. Goranson-Siekierke J. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5959-5966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The observation of two different binding modes for the third domain probably reflects the high flexibility of the tether region that connects the second and third domain. Even in crystal structures where the third domain is bound to the metal ion site 1, electron density for the tether region is often not or only poorly observed. It is also possible that the third domain interacts with different regions of the protein depending on the iron concentration. IdeR and DtxR also bind to and are activated by, divalent metal ions other than Fe2+ in vitro. Other activating metals include Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+. Gel mobility shift and DNase protection assays have shown that these metal ions have variable abilities to promote IdeR and DtxR binding to DNA (20Dussurget O. Timm J. Gomez M. Gold B. Yu S.

Structure. 1995; 3: 87-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The two metal ion binding sites have distinctly different characteristics. The metal ion at site 1 is pentavalent coordinate with distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry while the metal ion at site 2 is hexavalent coordinate with octahedral geometry (Fig. 1, A and B). These geometries are common, fairly low energy states for Fe2+, the biological IdeR cofactor. In IdeR, the side chains of Met10, Cys102, Glu105, His106, and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Cys102 coordinate the metal ion in binding site 2 (Fig. 1B). In the early DtxR crystal structures, the repressor was not co-crystallized with operator oligonucleotides, and the electron density for metal ion at binding site 2 was not consistently observed. Electron density for the metal ion in binding site 2 was either absent or far less (∼50% less) than the density seen in binding site 1, and Cys102 was found to be oxidized to a sulfenyl (RSO-) group, which is probably not its biologically relevant oxidation state. The structures of either the DtxR-DNA operator complex or fully activated IdeR exhibit complete metal ion electron density for both metal ion binding sites, and Cys102 is not oxidized. These results suggest that coordination with metal ion and DNA binding might make Cys102 less sensitive to oxidation. The coordination of the metal ion at binding site 2 by Sγ of Cys102 and Sγ of Met10 also causes the amino acid residues to move by 1.8 and 4.5 Å, respectively, in comparison to the aporepressor. These shifts in position are a possible indication of conformational changes due to metal ion binding and could be significant for the repressor activity. At metal binding site 1 (Fig. 1A), the side chains of His79, Glu83, and His98 of the dimerization domain bind to the metal ion. Initially, a fourth ligand for the metal ion had been identified as a sulfate anion (18Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although there is a formal possibility that the anion could also be phosphate, the crystals were obtained in the presence of 2 m sulfate. The sulfate forms extensive hydrogen bonds with multiple contacts to other domains of the protein, i.e. Arg80, Asn130, and Ser126. It also interacts with an ordered water molecule in metal ion binding site 1, which in turn forms a possible communication network between Arg13 from domain 1 and Glu105 from domain 2. Mutagenesis studies reported by Goranson-Siekierke et al. (25Goranson-Siekierke J. Pohl E. Hol W.G. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1806-1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the anion-coordinating residues, Arg80, Asn130, and Ser126, at binding site 1 are essential for the biological activity of the repressor. These observations support the suggestion that the sulfate anion is a mimic of a phosphate anion that would normally be part of site 1. Crystal structures of fully activated, un-oxidized IdeR and DtxR bound to DNA duplexes have been solved. Surprisingly, in several cases, the anion site in these structures is occupied by third domain residues: Glu172 and Gln175 in IdeR or Glu170 and Gln173 in DtxR (13Feese M.D. Ingason B.P.

The Glu and Gln side chains provide two additional metal ion ligands at metal ion binding site 1 and, more importantly, they supply all necessary hydrogen bonds formed by the previous observed anion. It is possible that the movements of the third domain to the metal binding site 1 orient the IdeR DNA binding helices in the correct mutual orientation and position to be ready for the operator region binding in a manner, similar to the “hinge” motion observed by Pohl et al. (26Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22420-22427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Metal ion binding sites 1 and 2 also seem to communicate with each other through Glu105 and His79, which implies cooperativity between the two sites. This communication might have to do with the observation of different electron density for the metal ion in site 2. Based on the crystal structures of IdeR and DtxR, it has been assumed that site 1 has a higher metal ion affinity than site 2. For example, site 1 was occupied in all crystal structures, while site 2 was only occupied when IdeR was fully activated or when DtxR was bound to the DNA. In addition, more recent studies of DtxR suggest that DtxR activation is a multistep process (27Spiering M.M. Ringe D. Murphy J.R. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3808-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Love J.F. vanderSpek J.C. Marin V. Guerrero L. Logan T.M. Murphy J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2506-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that DtxR is monomeric in the absence of metal ion, forms an activated dimer in the presence of metal ion, and then binds to the targeted DNA operator. In addition, it was proposed that IdeR activation occurs via sequential occupation of each metal binding site, from site 1 to site 2, through several conformational changes. However, the metal affinities of the two metal ion sites in IdeR and DtxR have not been well defined. Although mutagenesis of the metal ligands at site 2 or of the anion binding residues causes significant decreases in repressor activity, mutations of site 1 residues that directly bind the metal do not significantly decrease DNA binding (29Ding X. Zeng H. Schiering N. Ringe D. Murphy J.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These two results seem to contradict each other, and their significance is still unclear. One problem is that the affinities for each metal ion binding site and their functional roles are still not defined. Determining the binding affinities for the metal ions at each site, and the affinity of IdeR for its DNA operators, might yield further insights into the structural basis for IdeR function, particularly if these affinities and functional roles can be related to the most closely related homologue DtxR. Here, we report fluorescence anisotropy measurements of IdeR binding to the fxbA operator region of a DNA duplex. We also measured metal ion-dependent IdeR dimerization by fluorescence spectrophotometry to estimate the divalent metal ion affinities at binding sites 1 and 2. The results support a multistep mechanism for IdeR activation and DNA binding, and they explain the apparent discrepancy of the site 1 and 2 mutagenesis studies. Expression and Purification of IdeR and IdeR C102S—IdeR and IdeR-C102S were expressed from the plasmids pMTBKS and pMTBKSC102S, respectively in Escherichia coli DH5a (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (12Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). IdeR was purified from the expression strain by means of collecting cells by centrifugation and lysing in 10 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-micron filter. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The protein was then eluted by a linear gradient of imidazole from 0 to 100 mm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl. The fractions with IdeR that were more than 80% pure were pooled, and applied to an anion exchange column and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 50 mm to 1 m in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm tetrachloroethylphosphine (TCEP). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated and dialyzed thoroughly at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm TCEP. IdeR-C102S purification was identical to that of IdeR except that TCEP was not added at any step. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured, and the protein concentration was calculated based on a BSA standard curve. Construction of the IdeR-C102S Expression Plasmid—A PCR-based strategy based on the QuikChange method of Stratagene, La Jolla, CA was used to introduce a single nucleotide change in the ideR gene sequence, resulting in the gene ideRC102S, which encodes an IdeR protein that contains a single cysteine to serine amino acid change at position 102. Briefly, the IdeR expression plasmid pMTBKS (30Schmitt M.P. Predich M. Doukhan L. Smith I. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4284-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template in PCR with the following primers IdeR-C102Sfor, 5′-GCCGAGGCATCCCGGTGGGAGCACG-3′ and IdeR-C102Srev, 5′-CGTGCTCCCACCGGGATGCCTCGGC-3′. After PCR amplification the restriction endonuclease DpnI (which cleaves only methylated DNA) was added to restrict the template DNA, and the reaction was transformed in E. coli TE1 (31Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14662-14667Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plasmids from the transformation were isolated and screened by restriction digestion for the ideRC102S allele. Positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing to ensure they encoded ideRC102S rather than ideR, and the final resulting plasmid was named pMTBKSC102S. Nucleic Acids—Fluorescein-labeled (FAM) DNA used for the fluorescence anisotropy assay was purchased from Macromolecular Resources (Fort Collins, CO) as the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and polyacrylamide gel-purified, single-stranded oligonucleotides. The sequences are as follows: fxbA1: 5′FAM-GCCGGCATGCTATCAAAGGTAAGGCTTACCAATGTGGGGCTCGTTG-3′, and fxbA2: 5′-CAACGAGCCCCACATTGGTAAGCCTTACCTTTGATAGCATGCCGGC-3′. Duplex oligonucleotides were then formed by mixing 1.5/1 in mole ratio of unlabeled to labeled complementary oligonucleotide dissolved in 10 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5. The excess unlabeled DNA was used to minimize the concentration of non-annealed FAM-labeled single strain DNA fragments that would interfere with the assay. The oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 90 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool gradually to 4 °C. The formation of the annealed DNA duplex was confirmed on a 15% native polyacrylamide gel with Tris borate/EDTA buffer at pH 8.2. Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay—Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in a SPEX Fluorolog 1681 0.22m Spectrometer (Jobin YVON-SPEX Edison) with polarizers placed in the L-format. The measurements were taken at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm. For the IdeR-fxbA operator affinity determination, IdeR was titrated in 0.025-μm increments into a buffer containing 20 nmfxbA operator duplexes, 5 mm Mg2+, with or without 0.2 mm Ni2+, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm TrisHCl, 60 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) nucleotides at pH 7.0. Divalent metal-dependent DNA binding affinities were determined by titrating Ni2+, Co2+, and Fe2+ individually in 5-μm increments into a buffer containing 2 μm IdeR, 20 nmfxbA duplex, 5 mm Mg2+, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 60 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) nucleotides at pH 7.0. The antioxidant dithiothreitol (1 mm) was added to the buffer and the stock divalent metal solution when Fe2+ was used. All solutions were treated with Chelex 100 and sterile-filtered before use. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, r, was calculated as in Equation 1. r=IVV−GIVHIVV+2GIVH(Eq. 1) IVV and IVH are the parallel and perpendicular polarized fluorescence intensities measured with the vertically polarized excitation light. G is the monochromatic grating correction factor given by G = IHV/IHH, and IHV and IHH are exact fluorescence intensities measured with the excitation horizontally polarized. The r value is normalized to the maximum among the Ni2+, Co2+, and Fe2+ experiments. The DNA binding activity of IdeR was evaluated by measuring changes in the fluorescence anisotropy value of a 5′-end-labeled fxbA operator. In the presence of excess divalent metal cations, the association of IdeR with fxbA operator was described as the binding of two dimers to form a dimer-dimer protein-DNA complex. It was assumed that the initial binding event between the duplex fxbA sequences (FxbA) and an IdeR dimer (IdeR2) was described by the equilibrium fxbA + IdeR2 → fxbA-(IdeR2) → fxbA-(IdeR2)2, and that the process is cooperative. With limited DNA concentration (i.e. [IdeR2] ∼ [IdeR]total), the total anisotropy of IdeR-fxbA operator binding reactions were plotted against the concentration of added protein dimer, and the data were fit to a cooperative Hill equation with free floating h value (Equation 2) as described by Wilson et al. (32Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Moutafis M. Sinha S. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38400-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), A=Afree+(Abound−Afree)([IdeR2]/Kd)h1+([IdeR2]/Kd)h(Eq. 2) where Afree is the initial anisotropy in the absence of IdeR, Abound is the final anisotropy when fxbA is fully bound, Kd is the equilibrium constant, and h is the Hill coefficient. All equation parameters were solved by nonlinear regression of Atotal versus [IdeR2] data sets using KaleidaGraph version 3.6. A simple non-cooperative 2:1 (IdeR2/DNA) binding model did not fit the observed data; the fit gave nonsense errors. Intrinsic Fluorescence Emission—IdeR contains two tryptophan residues at positions 94 and 104. The tryptophan residue at position 104 is located at the dimerization interface. It transits from solvent-exposed to buried upon dimerization, and quenching of the corresponding DtxR tryptophan fluorescence has been used to assay for dimerization (33Tao X. Zeng H.Y. Murphy J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6803-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The initial concentration of IdeR was 2 μm in a buffer containing 5 mm Mg2+, 50 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0. The antioxidant (1 mm) dithiothreitol was added to the buffer and the stock divalent metal solution when Fe2+ was used. The intrinsic fluorescence emission of apoIdeR was measured in the SPEX Fluorolog 1681 0.22m Spectrometer without the polarizer after addition of various concentrations of Ni2+, Co2+, and Fe2+ at the excitation wavelength of 280 nm and the emission wavelength of 355 nm. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—Stokes radii and estimated IdeR molecular weights were determined using a Protein Solutions DynaPro Molecular Sizing Instrument (Protein Solution Ltd, Bucks, England). The measurements were taken using 1 mg/ml IdeR in a buffer solution containing 5 mm Mg2+, 50 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl at 20 °C. Because DLS is sensitive to as little as 0.01% mass aggregate, the autocorrelation functions were fit to double exponential functions to give two radii. In all cases, the high molecular size species, i.e. aggregates or particulates with molecular masses of > 2 × 106 Da, represented less that 0.05% of the solute mass. Higher order fits did not produce any additional low molecular mass species, and, thus, the solutions were effectively monodisperse. Data Analysis—Utilizing the anisotropy assay and the tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence of Trp104 of the IdeR, the divalent metal ion concentration requirement for the dimerization process and the fxbA operator sequence binding were measured for Ni2+,Co2+, and Fe2+. The cooperative Hill equation was used to fit the normalized curve as shown in Equation 3 (34Pan J. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6149-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A=[([M]/Kd)h1+([M]/Kd)h](Eq. 3) Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant where half of the IdeR is activated and bound to the fxbA operator region, M is the divalent metal ion concentration, and h is the Hill coefficient, which is often used as a measurement of cooperativity. All equation parameters were solved by nonlinear regression of A versus [M] data sets using KaleidaGraph version 3.6. The advantage of using Equations 2 and 3 is that only the properties of the equilibrium curve around the midpoint of the complex formation need to be known. In addition, the Hill coefficient measures the degree of cooperativity for dimer-dimer binding to the fxbA operator and for metal ion binding. Previously, IdeR binding to operator sites in the presence of divalent metal ion has only been demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays, DNase protection assays, and crystallization studies. Thus, the IdeR operator and metal ion affinities have not been defined. Utilizing fluorescence anisotropy, we were able to determine the binding affinity of holoIdeR for the fxbA operator in the presence of excess metal ion. The increased fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-labeled fxbA caused by added IdeR was fit to Equation 2, to give an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.14 ± 0.02 μm (n = 3; R2 = 0.997) for the holoIdeR2 (dimer) binding to fxbA in excess Ni2+ (Fig. 2A). The concentration is for holoIdeR2, because the model used for the fit is holoIdeR2 bound by 4 metal ions binding to one single, average operator site. The average Hill coefficient is 3.3. As a control, apoIdeR was also added to labeled fxbA duplex in the absence of divalent metal ion (Fig. 2B). As expected, no change in anisotropy"

In this study, we show that mRNA levels of enzymes involved in biotin utilization, including HCS, are down-regulated during biotin deficiency in liver while remaining constitutively expressed in brain. We propose that this mechanism of regulation is aimed at sparing the essential function of biotin in the brain at the expense of organs such as liver and kidney during biotin deprivation. In MCD, it is possible that some of the manifestations of the disease may be associated with down-regulation of biotin utilization in liver because of the impaired activity of HCS and that high dose biotin therapy may in part be important to overcoming the adverse regulatory impact in such organs.

The vitamin biotin functions as the cofactor in carboxylation reactions where it acts as the carboxyl carrier. In human cells, there are five biotin-dependent carboxylases: pyruvate carboxylase (PC), 1The abbreviations used are: PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PCC, propionyl-CoA-carboxylase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; SMVT, sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter; HCS, holocarboxylase synthetase; MCD, multiple carboxylase deficiency; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; 8-Br-cGMP, 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate; rtPCR, reverse transcription-PCR. propionyl-CoA-carboxylase (PCC), methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and two forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1 and ACC-2). Biotin-dependent carboxylases catalyze key reactions in gluconeogenesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and fatty acid synthesis, roles that underscore its broad impact in human metabolism (1Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill Professional, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar). During evolution, mammals lost the ability to synthesize biotin and now satisfy their need for the vitamin through a delicate balance between dietary biotin and reutilization of endogenous, protein-bound biotin (1Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill Professional, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar, 2Pacheco-Alvarez D.

To ensure a continuous supply of the vitamin, eukaryotic organisms have developed a biotin utilization cycle that depends on the participation of three different proteins. The first is a transporter for the uptake of biotin through the plasma membrane. Although different biotin transporters have been proposed in different species, only one has been confirmed by cDNA cloning (3Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H.

The sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) transports biotin, pantothenic acid, and lipoic acid and is characterized by a seemingly high Km for biotin (5Prassad P.D. Wang H. Huang W.

Physiol. 2003; 285: G73-G77Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The second is holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS). It catalyzes the biotinylation of carboxylases in a two-step, ATP-dependent reaction in which biotin is first activated to biotinyl-5′-AMP and then transferred to the apocarboxylase substrate (7Leon-Del-Rio A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The third enzyme of the biotin cycle is biotinidase. It is responsible for releasing biotin from protein-bound biotin by hydrolysis of biocytin (biotinyl-lysine) or short biotinylated peptides generated during digestion or turnover of endogenous carboxylases (10Hymes J. Wolf B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 255: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In humans, the balance between the utilization of exogenous and recycled biotin can be disrupted by genetic abnormalities with devastating consequences for metabolic homeostasis. Loss of HCS or biotinidase activity produces the neonatal or juvenile forms, respectively, of the disease multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD) (1Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill Professional, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar, 11Wolf B. Grier R.E. Secor McVoy J.R. Heard G.S. J. Inherit. Metab.

Both forms of MCD are potentially fatal. However, all clinical and biochemical manifestations can be reversed with pharmacological doses of biotin (1Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill Professional, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar). Biotin has been implicated in a number of other cellular processes including DNA and RNA synthesis, nitric oxide-like activity on cGMP synthesis, cell growth, and histone biotinylation (13Stanley J.S.

The non-classical effect of biotin that has been best characterized is its role in gene expression. Several groups have shown that in laboratory animals and cell cultures, biotin is required for optimal expression and activity of glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, ornithine transcarbamylase, asialoglycoprotein receptor, PCC, ACC-1, and HCS (20Spence J.T.

We investigated the effect of biotin deficiency in human fibroblasts and HepG2 cells and observed a reduction in mRNA levels for HCS, PCC-α subunit, and ACC-1, which are all returned to normal levels after biotin supplementation (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Biotin achieves this outcome by triggering a signaling cascade involving soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Significantly, cells from patients with neonatal MCD required 100 times more biotin than control cells to restore HCS mRNA to a normal level following growth in biotin-depleted medium (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the product of the HCS reaction, biotinyl-5′-AMP, and not biotin per se is responsible for the effect of biotin on gene expression. Although HCS-sGC-PKG-mediated signaling could explain the effect of biotin on gene expression, the physiological significance of this type of regulation and its relevance to the phenotype of MCD are unknown. The down-regulation of HCS and carboxylases during biotin depletion seems self-destructive given the essential function of biotin. Because the biotin cycle presents independent mechanisms for the utilization of exogenous biotin (uptake via SMVT) versus cellular biotin (recycling via biotinidase), we have examined the regulation of SMVT and biotinidase mRNA expression as a function of biotin access to determine whether the regulation is aimed at control of the biotin cycle. We have also assessed the regulation of PC given its prominence at the junction of gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the Krebs cycle. Significantly, we show that SMVT and PC mRNA expression, along with that of HCS, responds to biotin availability, whereas biotinidase does not. We demonstrate, in biotin-replete versus biotin-deficient rats, that whereas the HCS-sGC-PKG pathway down-regulates biotin utilization in liver and kidney, it does not in brain. Instead, we show that the biotin cycle in the brain is constitutively expressed or even enhanced in its capacity to scavenge biotin during biotin depletion. We put forward the hypothesis that the differential effect of biotin in liver and brain may be part of an altruistic mechanism for the repression of biotin utilization in liver so as to ensure the continued supply of biotin to the brain when dietary biotin becomes limiting or deficient. Materials—Biotin and 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) were from Sigma-Aldrich. The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, was from the American Type Cell Collection, and the rat C6 glioma line was kindly provided by Dr. H. Pasantes, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Normal human fibroblasts, fibroblasts from a patient with MCD (MCD-MK), and rabbit antibody to HCS (raised against an N-terminal peptide of human HCS, residues 58–78) have been described previously (19Narang M.A. Dumas R. Ayer L.M. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cultures were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing high glucose (biotin concentration 0.40 μm, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (biotin-replete medium). Biotin-deficient medium was prepared using biotin-free minimum Eagle's medium, dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and the same antibiotic concentration. Male Wistar rats were provided by Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Biotin-replete and biotin-deficient diets for laboratory animals were purchased from ICN Nutritional Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH. Cell Culture Experiments—The methods for biotin starvation of cell cultures are essentially as described previously (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in biotin-replete or biotin-deficient medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for up to 15 days. The medium was changed at 3-day intervals. For biotin-based recovery of cells grown in biotin-deficient medium, biotin, at concentrations from 0.001 to 1 μm, or 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP, a non-hydrolyzable form of cGMP, was added at day 14, and the cells were maintained in the biotin- or cGMP-supplemented medium for 24 h. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Western Blot—Procedures for RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and PCR (rtPCR) were as described previously, except that 4 μg of RNA and 0.5 μmol of the gene-specific oligonucleotide primers were used for cDNA synthesis and 0.3 μmol of specific sense and antisense primers were used to give PCR products 330–900 bp in length (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S.

PCR products were evaluated following electrophoresis on agarose gels and were quantified by densitometry using a molecular imager FX (Bio-Rad) and normalized to β-actin mRNA as described previously (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S.

The β-actin mRNA was present at equivalent levels in all RNA samples (see Figs. 1, 3, and 4).Fig. 3Differential effects of biotin deficiency in rat tissues. Adult male Wistar rats were fed with normal (N) or biotin-deficient (D) diets for 8 weeks.

The membranes were incubated in a 1:2000 solution of rabbit HCS antibody. Visualization of HCS bands was performed using a BM chemiluminescences Western blotting kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. Animal Model for Biotin Deficiency—Male Wistar rats, age 21–28 days, were placed in air filtered cages and fed a biotin-free diet ad libitum. The animals were sacrificed after 8–10 weeks when liver carboxylase activities were less than 30% of those of control animals fed a normal diet (28Maeda Y. Kawata S. Inui Y. Fukuda K. Igura T. Matsuzawa Y. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Rodriguez-Melendez R. Cano S. Mendez S.T. Velazquez A. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 1909-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The selected organs were rapidly removed, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from brain, liver, and kidney from normal and biotin-deficient rats, and mRNA levels were determined as described above. Biotin Content in Carboxylases from Normal and Biotin-deficient Rats—Liver and brain from rats fed on normal and biotin-deficient diets as described above were harvested and washed on cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer. A sample of tissue (1 g) was homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, 600 mm Tris-HCl and 1 m KCl, pH 7.5. The homogenates were centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged again at 150,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The samples (70 μg) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Visualization of biotin containing proteins was conducted by incubating the membranes in a 1:2000 solution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate following the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). Biotin containing bands were quantitated using an imager FX (Bio-Rad) as described above. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were done in triplicate and at least three different times using different RNA samples as the source of RNA for the rtPCR. Results of biotin starvation on mRNA were normalized to β-actin mRNA and expressed as a percentage of mRNA levels observed in cells or rats grown in biotin-replete medium. Data are presented as the mean of three different experiments ± S.E. Biotin Availability Regulates mRNA Levels of the Biotin Utilization Cycle Proteins in HepG2 Cells—To determine whether key components of the biotin cycle are under the control of the exogenous biotin concentration, we examined mRNA levels of SMVT and biotinidase, two proteins that control entry of biotin into the cycle. We also assessed PC mRNA because of its central role in metabolism and compared all three with HCS, which we showed previously to be regulated by biotin availability (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Human HepG2 cells were plated in triplicate in three experimental groups: cells incubated in biotin-replete medium as control, cells incubated in biotin-deficient medium for 15 days, and cells incubated in a biotin-deficient medium for 15 days, which was followed by the addition of 1 μm biotin for 24 h (biotin-recovery medium). After the treatments, total RNA was isolated, and mRNA levels were determined by rtPCR (Fig. 1A). Biotin starvation produced a significant decrease in the mRNA levels for SMVT (–71% ± 2), HCS (–64% ± 5), and PC (–68% ± 3) compared with cells in biotin-replete medium. However, there was little change in the mRNA for biotinidase (–16% ± 2) or actin, used as the control (Fig. 1B). The reduction in mRNA levels proved to be specific for biotin deficiency because the addition of the vitamin to 15-day biotin-starved cultures restored the mRNA for SMVT, HCS, and PC to normal levels (Fig. 1B). Biotinidase mRNA remained essentially unchanged in cells incubated in biotin-deficient or recovery medium relative to the control medium. We confirmed that the reduction in mRNA was reflected in the level of protein, using HCS for the analysis (Fig. 1C). A Western blot of HCS from the HepG2 treatment cultures showed that the amount of HCS protein was reduced by one-third for cells grown in biotin-deficient medium compared with the level obtained for cells in biotin-replete medium. As observed for the mRNA, the addition of biotin to the deficient cultures resulted in normalization of the protein to the level obtained for control cells (data not shown). We showed previously that the biotin effects on HCS and PCC-α subunit mRNA are mediated by sGC and cGMP (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether the expression of SMVT, PC, and biotinidase are under similar control, we examined the effect of stimulating biotin-starved cells with 8-Br-cGMP in place of biotin. The addition of 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP for 24 h increased the mRNA of SMVT and PC (as well as HCS) to starting levels, mimicking the response to biotin (Fig. 1A and Table I). In contrast, biotinidase mRNA, which was essentially unchanged in biotin-depleted medium (to 84% ± 2 of biotin-replete level), showed little change (to 91% ± 4 and 112% ± 10 of normal levels) on the addition of biotin or 8-Br-cGMP, respectively. These results show that biotin and the cGMP analogue have similar effects on mRNA levels in cells that had been previously depleted of biotin.Table IEffect of biotin and 8-Br-cGMP on mRNA levels in HepG2 cellsmRNABiotin deficientBiotin stimulatedcGMP stimulated%%%SMVT29 ± 292 ± 3101 ± 7HCS36 ± 5103 ± 1098 ± 8PC32 ± 3112 ± 11106 ± 4Biotinidase84 ± 291 ± 4112 ± 10Actin107 ± 394 ± 10109 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Biotin Cycle mRNA Levels in MCD Cells—We had shown that fibroblasts from a patient with neonatal MCD require much higher levels of biotin to elicit a change in its HCS mRNA following incubation in biotin-deficient medium (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we determined whether there is also an effect on SMVT and biotinidase mRNA, and consequently whether HCS is also implicated in their regulation. For MCD cells, we made use of the HCS-deficient MCD-MK cell line, which is homozygous for R508W, a mutation that gives its HCS an elevated Km for biotin (12Dupuis L. Campeau E. Leclerc D. Gravel R.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 66: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Morita J. Thuy L.P. Sweetman L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 64: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Normal and MCD-MK cells were incubated in biotin-deficient medium and compared for their ability to stimulate an increase in mRNA levels for SMVT, HCS, and biotinidase in response to the addition of different concentrations of biotin. When control and MCD-MK fibroblasts were grown in biotin-free medium, SMVT mRNA was decreased in each cell line as expected (12% ± 2 of pretreatment levels), and a similar reduction was obtained for HCS mRNA (to 29% ± 4) (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the two cell lines differed markedly in their response to the re-addition of biotin. In normal cells, biotin addition for 24 h resulted in a stimulation in the level of both mRNA species. For SMVT mRNA, the maximum recovery to the level observed in biotin-replete cells was observed at the lowest biotin concentration used, 0.001 μm, with higher concentrations giving marginally lower recoveries. Although biotinidase mRNA was not reduced by biotin deficiency, the addition of increasing biotin to the culture medium produced a tendency toward a reduction in biotinidase mRNA levels from 100% at 0.001 μm biotin to 78% ± 2 at 0.1 μm biotin (Fig. 2A). In keeping with our previous study (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), HCS mRNA also showed recovery to starting levels, but it increased more slowly with increasing biotin concentration so that full recovery was obtained at only the highest concentration of biotin (1 μm). The MCD-MK cells behaved very differently (Fig. 2B). At 0.001 μm biotin, SMVT mRNA increased from the biotin-starved level of 12% ± 9 of the biotin-replete level to 50% ± 5 and showed little additional change (63% ± 7 at 1 μm biotin). Like normal cells, biotinidase mRNA was not reduced in biotin-depleted medium, although it did show a downward trend on the readdition of biotin at the higher biotin concentrations. As observed before (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), HCS mRNA increased only at the higher biotin concentrations, beginning at 0.1 μm biotin and reaching 79% ± 4 of starting level at 1 μm biotin. These results show that, like HCS, SMVT requires at least 100 times more biotin than normal cells to achieve a similar increase in its mRNA level, whereas biotinidase mRNA is unaffected by the defective HCS. The integrity of the downstream elements of the HCS-sGC-PKG transduction pathway in MDC cells on the mRNA response was tested by incubating the normal and MCD-MK cells in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP. Treatment of biotin-starved MCD cells with 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP resulted in increases of HCS and SMVT mRNA comparable with those obtained previously for normal cells (data not shown) (29Solorzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results confirm that SMVT mRNA, like HCS mRNA, responds normally to the cGMP in MCD cells and that direct stimulation with the cGMP analogue bypasses the HCS defect. Biotin Cycle mRNA Levels in Rat Tissues—The above results suggest that low nutrient biotin or mutations in MCD result in a diminished capacity of cells to restore mRNA levels of proteins involved in the utilization of exogenous biotin while leaving unaffected the enzyme required for recycling endogenous vitamin. This mechanism of mRNA regulation seems to work against maintaining metabolic homeostasis because a reduction in the expression of SMVT and HCS mRNA would be expected to diminish the capacity to scavenge biotin in a low biotin nutrient source. To assess the physiological role of such a seemingly self-destructive process, we made use of a rat model of biotin deficiency and examined the impact of biotin starvation in different tissues. Male Wistar rats were fed a biotin-free diet, and after 8 weeks they presented with a characteristic biotin deficiency phenotype and a dramatic decrease in biotin-dependent PC and PCC activities (30Rodriguez-Melendez R. Cano S. Mendez S.T. Velazquez A. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 1909-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of SMVT, HCS, PC, and biotinidase were determined in different organs by densitometric analysis of rtPCR products. For clarity, only the results obtained in brain and liver are presented (Fig. 3) because preliminary data for kidney gave similar expression patterns as for liver. Biotin deficiency produced a decrease in liver mRNA levels (SMVT, 42% ± 3 of the biotin-replete level; HCS, 55% ± 3; PC, 17% ± 2) while showing little change in brain (SMVT, 90% ± 1; HCS, 94% ± 7; PC, 96% ± 3) in biotin-deficient rats (Fig. 3, a–c). Biotinidase mRNA was unaffected in liver (91% ± 2 of biotin replete level), resembling the data obtained in human cell cultures. Yet, in the brain of deficient rats, we found a modest increase (to 129% ± 10) over the value observed in normal animals (Fig. 3d). Biotin starvation had no effect on the mRNA levels of the reference gene actin (Fig. 3e) in either liver or brain. Western blot of liver and brain HCS sho"
https://openalex.org/W2076915309,"The ribonucleoprotein telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase minimally composed of an RNA, TER, and a protein catalytic subunit, TERT. The TER and TERT subunits of telomerase associate to form a dimeric enzyme in several organisms, including human. A small portion of TER, the template domain, is used by telomerase for the synthesis of tandem repeats of telomeric DNA. We studied some of the requirements for processive template usage by human telomerase. A blunt-ended duplex DNA primer was not utilized by telomerase. With a duplex telomeric DNA primer, a single-stranded 3' overhang with a minimum length of approximately 6 bases was required for efficient priming activity. Large substitutions in the human TER templating domain did not abolish enzymatic activity, although insertion of two residues into this sequence reduced processivity, as did a template mutation that results in a mismatch between the template region used for copying DNA and the region used for alignment of the substrate primer. Finally, by using a complementary pair of catalytically inactive telomerase RNA pseudoknot mutants in combination with a marked template, we demonstrated that processive synthesis by an obligatory dimer of human telomerase does not require template switching. These results indicate that processive template usage by human telomerase, like that of Tetrahymena telomerase, is strongly dependent on the base identities in the template domain and that a dimeric human telomerase can processively utilize a single template."

Recently, we have documented that the mouse Kcnq1 imprinting control region (ICR) harbors bidirectional silencing property, and this feature is linked to an antisense RNA, Kcnq1ot1. In this investigation, using genomic footprinting, we have identified three NF-Y transcription factor binding sites appearing in a methylation-sensitive manner in the Kcnq1ot1 promoter. By employing a dominant negative mutant to the NF-Y transcription factor, we have shown that the NF-Y transcription factor positively regulates antisense transcription. Selective mutation of the conserved nucleotides in the NF-Y binding sites resulted in the loss of antisense transcription. The loss of antisense transcription from the Kcnq1ot1 promoter coincides with an enrichment in the levels of deacetylation and methylation at the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 and DNA methylation at the CpG residues, implying a crucial role for the NF-Y transcription factor in organizing the parent of origin-specific chromatin conformation in the Kcnq1 ICR. Parallel to the loss of antisense transcription, the loss of silencing of the flanking reporter genes was observed, suggesting that NF-Y-mediated Kcnq1ot1 transcription is critical in the bidirectional silencing process of the Kcnq1 ICR. These data highlight the NF-Y transcription factor as a crucial regulator of antisense promoter-mediated bidirectional silencing and the parent of origin-specific epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR.

Transcriptome analysis in humans and in mice has revealed the presence of more than 2500 antisense transcripts, indicating a crucial role for antisense RNAs in the regulation of mammalian gene expression (2Yelin R.

Although the role of antisense transcription in gene regulation has been well established in the recent past, the mechanisms underlying the antisense RNA-mediated repression are yet to be investigated. It has recently been demonstrated that antisense RNAs produced from the imprinting control regions (ICRs) 1The abbreviations used are: ICR, imprinting control region; RPA, RNase protection assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; cpm, counts/minute.1The abbreviations used are: ICR, imprinting control region; RPA, RNase protection assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; cpm, counts/minute. play a key role in the manifestation of the parent of origin-specific gene expression patterns in the imprinted clusters (3Thakur N.

Barlow D.P. Nature. 2002; 415: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). One of these imprinted clusters, located at the distal end of the mouse chromosome 7, has been relatively well investigated. This cluster divided into two sub-expression domains by the H19 ICR and the Kcnq1 ICR. The Kcnq1 ICR, which is located in intron 10 of the Kcnq1 gene, has been shown to be involved in regulation of the imprinting of the flanking genes Kcnq1, Cdkn1c, Ascl2, Tssc4, Tssc3, and Slc22a11 (5Fitzpatrick G.V. Soloway P.D. Higgins M.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It is methylated on the maternal allele and unmethylated on the paternal allele. The unmethylated paternal Kcnq1 ICR allele harbors a promoter for a long transcript, Kcnq1ot1. This transcript is oriented in an antisense orientation to the Kcnq1 transcript (6Lee M.P. DeBaun M.R.

Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9514-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recently, by selectively deleting the region spanning the antisense promoter and attenuating the antisense transcription by poly(A) sequence, we have shown that the production of an antisense RNA, Kcnq1ot1, is critical in the bidirectional silencing property of the Kcnq1 ICR (3Thakur N.

In this instance, the antisense transcription not only silences the overlapping genes but also the non-overlapping genes, thus distinguishing this phenomenon from the other cases, where antisense transcription leads to the silencing of the overlapping gene (9Tufarelli C.

Genet. 1999; 21: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The antisense promoter activity is regulated by the parent of origin-specific epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR. Little is known how these epigenetic marks are laid down during gametogenesis (during early embryonic development) and maintained thereafter. Moreover, it has not been investigated whether the antisense promoter activity plays an important role in the maintenance of differential epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR. More importantly, loss of differential epigenetic marks at the human KCNQ1 ICR has been observed in >40% of sporadic Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients. This suggests that understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment and the maintenance of these epigenetic marks will provide more insights into the complex bidirectional silencing process mediated by the Kcnq1 ICR. Interestingly, although the silencing of flanking genes, which are spread over several hundreds of kilobases, occurs due to antisense transcription, it is unclear how the transcriptional competence is maintained at the antisense promoter under strong silencing conditions. Taken together, these observations indicate that antisense promoter activity plays an equally important role in the parent of origin-specific expression patterns at the Kcnq1 locus. We therefore were interested in understanding the role of antisense promoter activity in silencing and in the maintenance of differential epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR. Using genomic footprinting, we have earlier uncovered CCAAT boxes in the antisense promoter region (3Thakur N. Tiwari V.K. Thomassin H. Pandey R.R. Kanduri M. Gondor A. Grange T. Ohlsson R. Kanduri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CCAAT boxes are present in all sorts of promoters and have been shown to play an important regulatory role. They are usually recognized by NF-Y, a trimeric protein complex that consists of three subunits: NF-YA and histone-like NF-YB and NF-YC, all of which are required for DNA binding (11Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified NF-Y as the CCAAT activator and have set out to address the specific function of NF-Y binding sites in antisense transcription, bidirectional silencing, and the maintenance of differential epigenetic marks. By using the genomic footprinting approach, we have shown that occupancy of NF-Y binding sites is methylation-sensitive. By selective deletion of the promoter region containing the NF-Y binding sites, we showed that this region is important for antisense promoter as well as silencing activity. By employing dominant negative mutants of NF-YA and by selectively mutating the crucial nucleotides in all three NF-Y binding sites, we demonstrated that NF-Y occupancy plays an important role in the antisense promoter activity and that antisense promoter activity is critical for the silencing property of the Kcnq1 ICR. Interestingly, increased levels of deacetylation and methylation of the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 and methylation of CpG residues ablated the antisense promoter function, suggesting that the trimer plays an important role in maintaining the differential epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR on the parental alleles. Taken together, these observations suggest that NF-Y-mediated antisense promoter activity is crucial for the maintenance of imprinting at the Kcnq1 locus. In Vivo Footprinting—DNaseI footprinting was performed as described earlier (12Grange T. Bertrand E. Espinas M.L. Fromont-Racine M. Rigaud G. Roux J. Pictet R. Methods. 1997; 11: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼5 million Hep-3B cells, containing episomal plasmids inserted with the Kcnq1 ICR in methylated and unmethylated versions (see Ref. 13Kanduri C. Fitzpatrick G. Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri M. Lobanenkov V. Higgins M. Ohlsson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18106-18110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar for methylation conditions), were permeabilized with 0.4% Nonidet P-40 and treated with 10–20 μg of DNaseI at 4 °C for 3 min. For DMS footprinting, ∼5 million Hep-3B cells were treated with 0.1% DMS, and the DNA from the treated cells was prepared using a genomic DNA preparation kit (Promega). Chemical sequencing reactions and piperidine cleavage were performed as described earlier (12Grange T. Bertrand E. Espinas M.L. Fromont-Racine M. Rigaud G. Roux J. Pictet R. Methods. 1997; 11: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ligation-mediated PCR reactions were carried out using a procedure described earlier (12Grange T. Bertrand E. Espinas M.L. Fromont-Racine M. Rigaud G. Roux J. Pictet R. Methods. 1997; 11: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The primers used for footprinting were as follows: upper strand, primer 1, 5′-TAGACCGTAACCACG-3′; primer 2, 5′-AATCCAAAATGAGGCCGACCACACC-3′; primer 3, 5′-AAAATGAGGCCGACCACACCGGGCCT-3′. The ligation-mediated-PCR reactions were separated on a 5% urea-acrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. Plasmid Cloning Strategies—ΔCAT deletion in the Kcnq1 ICR was made by creating AgeI restriction enzyme sites flanking the NF-Y binding sites. One AgeI site was created at 199 bp upstream of the Kcnq1ot1 start site (by changing TCCTGT to ACCGGT) using a forward primer 5′-GCT AGG TCG TAC AAA CCG GTA CAA GCT CAC CC-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-GGG TGA GCT TGT ACC GGT TTG TAC GAC CTA GC-3′. Another AgeI site was created 10 bp upstream of the Kcnq1ot1 start site (by changing ACCCGT to ACCGGT) using a forward primer 5′-GGTAGGTGGCCTACCGGTTGTCGCTAGGAGG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-CCTCCTAGCGACAACCGGTAGGCCACCTACC-3′) using Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis followed by restriction digestion and re-ligation. The Kcnq1 ICR fragment carrying this deletion was cloned into the PH19 vector at a unique NotI site. The PS4CAT1 (carrying mutation at the CCAAT Box 1), PS4CAT1&2 (carrying mutations at the CCAAT Box 1 and 2), and PS4CAT1–3 (carrying mutations at the CCAAT Box 1, 2, and 3) constructs were made in the following manner. Initially, we generated mutations at all three NF-Y binding sites by changing the conserved nucleotides. In the case of CCAAT Box 1, we changed CCAAT to CCGGT and for CCAAT Box 2, we changed CCAAT to CCGGA. In the CCAAT Box 3, we changed CCAAT to CATCT. All of these mutations were created using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, using primers shown in Table I. The Kcnq1 ICR fragments carrying mutations at CCAAT Box 1, CCAAT Box 1 and 2, and CCAAT Box 1–3 were cloned at the unique NotI site of the PH19 episomal plasmid.Table IOligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and site-directed mutagenesisNameSequence (5′–3′)OrientationCCAAT1 (wt)TTCACCATCTGTCCAATCAACAGTGTCGTGFCCAAT1 (wt)CACGACACTGTTGATTGGACAGATGGTGAARCCAAT1 (mut)ATTCACCATCTGTCCGGTCAACAGTGTCGTGGFCCAAT1 (mut)CCACGACACTGTTGACCGGACAGATGGTGAATRCCAAT2 (wt)GTTTCCTCTTGGCCAATAAAAATAGTCAGCFCCAAT2 (wt)GCTGACTATTTTTATTGGCCAAGAGGAAACRCCAAT2 (mut)GTTTCCTCTTGGCCGGAAAAAATAGTCAGCACAGFCCAAT2 (mut)CTGTGCTGACTATTTTTTCCGGCCAAGAGGAAACRCCAAT3 (wt)TGTACAAGCTCACCCAATCCAAATGCTGGAGFCCAAT3 (wt)CTCCAGCATTTGGATTGGGTGAGCTTGTACARCCAAT3 (mut)TGTACAAGCTCACCATCTCCAAATGCTGGAGFCCAAT3 (mut)CTCCAGCATTTGGAGATGGTGAGCTTGTACAR Open table in a new tab The Episome Silencer/Insulator Assay—The pREP4-based episomal vectors were transfected into JEG-3 cells, according to the method described previously (14Kanduri C.

The RNase protection assay was performed as described previously using a 365-bp H19 antisense probe, a 150-bp GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) antisense probe as control (14Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a 270-bp Kcnq1ot1 probe. Ten μg of RNA was hybridized with α-35S-CTP-labeled antisense probes (600,000 cpm/reaction for H19 and Kcnq1ot1 and 40,000 cpm/reaction for GAPDH) overnight at 45 °C. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol for the RPAIII kit (Ambion). Quantification of individual protected fragments was done using a Fuji FLA 3000 phosphorimaging device. The H19 and Kcnq1ot1 expressions were corrected with respect to both internal control (GAPDH) and episome copy number as determined by Southern blot analysis of BglII-restricted DNA hybridized with H19 and PDGFB probes (14Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of Kcnq1 ICR-mediated bidirectional silencing on a hygromycin resistance gene, equimolar concentrations of episomal-based plasmids were transfected into JEG-3 cells. Following transfection, the cells were selected with 150 μg/ml of hygromycin until all the cells died in the control plate, which contained the cells incubated with transfection reagent without any episomal plasmid DNA. Following selection, the drug-resistant colonies were stained with hematoxylin and counted. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (15Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing NF-Y binding sites (see Table I) were end-labeled with γ-[32P]dATP. For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in 30 μl of binding buffer containing 10,000 cpm/10 fmol of labeled probe, one μg of poly(dI·dC), and nuclear extract containing 5.0 μg of protein. For the supershift assay, the nuclear extracts and antibodies were pre-incubated for 20 min at room temperature before the radiolabeled probe was added, followed by another 30-min incubation. Separation of unbound labeled DNA from the DNA·protein complexes was carried out on a 4% non-denaturing acrylamide gel at 200 V at 4 °C. The gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed overnight. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Single cell suspension of embryonic day 14.5 mouse fetal liver (Mus musculus domesticus) was prepared using the protocol described earlier (16Chandrasekhar K. Raman R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver tissue was minced in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1% glucose) and then incubated with trypsin (1 mg/ml) and crude DNaseI (5 μg/ml) to release the cells from clumps. The action of trypsin was blocked by 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen). The mouse fetal liver cells and Hep-3B cells transfected with episomal plasmids PS4CAT1–3 and PS4, containing Kcnq1 ICR in methylated and mock-methylated versions, were cross-linked, as described earlier (17Kuo M. Allis C. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Following isolation of nuclei and sonication to shear the DNA, the NF-Y-containing DNA·protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using an NF-Y antibody and protein A 4 Fast Flow-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitated DNA was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-GATTACTTCGGTGGGCTTCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GACCACCATGACGAAACAAG-3′. PCR conditions were 1 × 94 °C for 5 min; 3× (94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min); 24× (94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s), and 1 × 72 °C for 5 min. Genomic Footprinting Analysis Reveals Methylation-sensitive Occupancy at the Kcnq1ot1 Promoter—By using the genomic footprinting approach, we have earlier fine mapped DNaseI and DMS footprints containing several cis-acting elements (CTCF, OCT-1, CCAAT, YY1, GATA, and CREB) in the Kcnq1ot1 promoter region in unmethylated conditions (3Thakur N. Tiwari V.K. Thomassin H. Pandey R.R. Kanduri M. Gondor A. Grange T. Ohlsson R. Kanduri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Given that the Kcnq1 ICR is differentially methylated on the parental alleles and that DNaseI and DMS footprints were identified on the unmethylated ICR, we were interested to know whether these footprints are sensitive to CpG methylation. To this end, we used a genomic footprinting approach on episomal plasmids stably propagated in cultured cells, containing methylated and unmethylated versions of the Kcnq1 ICR in the PS4 orientation (in which the Kcnq1ot1 transcript faces toward the H19 reporter gene (see Fig. 5A). As seen in Fig. 1, the DNaseI and DMS footprints were sensitive to CpG methylation of the ICR on the upper strand, a treatment that inhibits its silencing activity. Interestingly, YY1 and all three NF-Y binding sites (CCAAT 1–3) show sensitivity to DNA methylation, although none of them contains any CpG nucleotides in their core binding sequence (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the CREB binding site contains CpG, and it is known that the in vitro interaction of CREB with its site is inhibited by CpG methylation (18Inamdar N.M. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Changes of reactivity toward DMS were also observed within the DNaseI footprinted regions (indicated by stars and arrowheads in Fig. 1B). We detected some of the DNaseI hypersensitive sites that flank the NF-Y binding sites in the unmethylated condition (Fig. 1B, HS). Similar HS sites were also scored in in vitro footprinting analysis of the Cyclin B2 promoter with recombinant NF-Y (19Salsi V. Caretti G. Wasner M. Reinhard W. Haugwitz U. Engeland K. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6642-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They are most likely due to DNA bending upon interaction with DNA, according to a model based on the crystallographic structure of the histone-like subunits recently presented (11Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). We have also carried out DNaseI and DMS footprinting on the lower strand in the antisense promoter region. The footprints detected on the lower strand were similar to the upper strand (Ref. 3Thakur N. Tiwari V.K. Thomassin H. Pandey R.R. Kanduri M. Gondor A. Grange T. Ohlsson R. Kanduri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and data not shown).Fig. 1Genomic footprinting reveals CpG methylation-sensitive occupancy of transcription factors in the Kcnqot1 promoter region. A shows a physical map of the Kcnq1-, Cdkn1c-, and Mash2-imprinted cluster. Underneath is an extended map of the 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR showing hypersensitive sites (represented as arrowheads), the Kcnq1ot1 start site, and positions of the footprint primers. B, DNaseI and DMS genomic footprinting analysis of the upper strand of the Kcnq1 ICR fragment. The analyses were performed using cultured cells transfected with the PS4 episomal plasmid containing the Kcnq1 ICR. The cells contained either an unmethylated plasmid (unmeth) or a plasmid that was methylated in vitro at CpGs within the ICR prior to transfection (Meth) (see Ref. 13Kanduri C. Fitzpatrick G. Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri M. Lobanenkov V. Higgins M. Ohlsson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18106-18110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar for methylation conditions). The genomic footprints were deduced by comparison with the pattern obtained following in vitro treatment with either DNaseI or DMS of naked DNA (Naked). As DNaseI reactivity is somehow affected by CpG methylation, both unmethylated and methylated DNA were used for in vitro treatment. The DNaseI footprint visible using cells transfected with the unmethylated ICR is shown on the right. Guanine residues that were protected from DMS in the cells are marked with stars and those that show hyperreactivity are marked with arrowheads between the meth and unmeth lanes on the DMS footprint. The numbering within the ICR is indicated in the middle. The location of the consensus binding sites for NF-Y binding sites that showed CpG methylation sensitivity are represented on the right. The transcription start site of the Kcnq1ot1 gene is marked by a curved arrow. C, DNA sequence of the upper strand of the Kcnq1ot1 promoter showing NF-Y binding sites (bold), and the conserved residues of the NF-Y binding sites that were mutated are represented above the sequence. The mutations that allowed the creation of the AgeI sites and were used to delete the Kcnq1ot1 promoter region (spanning the NF-Y binding sites) are represented above the sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Selective Deletion of DNaseI Footprint Containing NF-Y Binding Sites Results in Loss of Antisense Transcription and Bidirectional Silencing—As the antisense promoter lacks the TATA box, we presumed that three NF-Y binding sites upstream of the Kcnq1ot1 promoter might play a critical role in the antisense promoter activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we selectively deleted the antisense promoter region containing three NF-Y binding sites by introducing AgeI restriction sites into the Kcnq1ot1 promoter region (Fig. 1, B and C). To measure bidirectional silencing and antisense transcript levels from the wild type and the modified Kcnq1 ICRs, we used an episomal-based vector, PH19 (Fig. 2B, PH19), harboring the mouse H19 and hygromycin resistance gene (hygromycinR) as reporter genes. We inserted into the PH19 episomal plasmid the wild type and the modified versions of the Kcnq1 ICR between the H19 and hygromycinR reporter genes. This enabled us to simultaneously analyze the effects of the wild type and the modified Kcnq1 ICRs on the activity of H19 and hygromycinR reporter genes (see PS4 and ΔCATPS4 in Fig. 2B). These episomal plasmids were transiently transfected in cultured cells, and the activity of both the H19 and Kcnq1ot1 genes was analyzed by RNase protection assay (RPA) 4 days after transfection, whereas the hygromycinR gene activity was analyzed by counting the number of resistant colonies obtained after selection. The reporter gene activities of each construct are represented relative to the control PH19 (H19 and hygromycinR) or PS4 (Kcnq1ot1) vectors. As shown in Fig. 2, deletion of the antisense promoter region resulted in loss of antisense expression and parallel loss of the silencing of both H19 and hygromycinR reporter genes, suggesting that the region containing NF-Y binding sites plays a critical role in the Kcnq1ot1 promoter activity as well as silencing activity mediated by the Kcnq1 ICR. The Association of NF-Y Transcription Factor with the Kcnq1ot1 Promoter Region Regulates Antisense Transcription and Bidirectional Silencing Activity—The next logical question was whether or not NF-Y associates with the antisense promoter region in vivo. To address this issue, we carried out ChIP analysis on cross-linked chromatin obtained from the cells transfected with episomal plasmids harboring the wild type Kcnq1 ICR fragment. As shown in Fig. 3A, NF-Y indeed associates with the Kcnq1 ICR. We addressed the issue of whether association of NF-Y to the Kcnq1 ICR is determined by the CpG methylation status. We carried out ChIP analysis on episomal plasmids containing the methylated Kcnq1 ICR fragment. As can be seen from Fig. 3A, CpG methylation of the Kcnq1 ICR did indeed inhibit NF-Y association to DNA. To check the specificity of NF-Y association with the Kcnq1 ICR, we performed ChIP assays with cells transfected with episomal plasmids containing mutations at all three NF-Y sites within the conserved CCAAT pentanucleotide. We observed hardly any association of NF-Y to the Kcnq1 ICR fragment containing mutations (Fig. 3A). Next, we performed gel shift assays to check whether all three NF-Y binding sites associate with NF-Y. As shown in Fig. 3B, NF-Y does indeed associate with all three wild type CCAAT boxes but not to sites carrying mutations in the conserved nucleotides. Taken together, these observations indicate a specific association of NF-Y with the CCAAT boxes of the Kcnq1ot1 promoter region in vivo, in a methylation-sensitive manner. We were then interested in identifying the functional role of NF-Y in Kcnq1ot1 promoter activity. To this end, we introduced mutations into the conserved nucleotides at the three NF-Y binding sites in the antisense promoter region of the Kcnq1 ICR (see Fig. 1C). We inserted the wild type and the mutated Kcnq1 ICR fragments into the PH19 episomal plasmid, transiently transfected these plasmids into cells, and analyzed the antisense transcription using RPA as described above. The PS4 episomes with the Kcnq1 ICR carrying mutations at one NF-Y binding site (CCAAT 1) showed a marginal decrease in antisense expression as compared with wild type PS4 plasmid (compare PS4 with PS4CAT1 in Fig. 4, A and B). However, the PS4 episomal plasmids with Kcnq1 ICR carrying mutations at either two (CCAAT 1 and 2) or three (CCAAT 1–3) CCAAT boxes, showed a significant decrease in antisense expression (compare PS4 with PS4CAT1&2 and PS4CAT1–3 in Fig. 4, A and B). In fact, the Kcnq1 ICR with mutations at all NF-Y binding sites showed a maximum loss of antisense expression (compare PS4CAT1–3 with PS4 in Fig. 4, A and B). A gradual loss of antisense expression from the Kcnq1 ICR corresponds to the number of mutated NF-Y binding sites, which suggests that all three NF-Y sites are critical for the Kcnq1ot1 promoter activity. More importantly, we also observed loss of antisense expression when we cotransfected the episomal plasmids with dominant negative NF-Y mutants (Fig. 4, E and F). This observation further reinforces the importance of NF-Y in Kcnq1ot1 promoter activity. We addressed whether the Kcnq1ot1 promoter carrying NF-Y mutations supported the bidirectional silencing property of the Kcnq1 ICR. To assess this, we measured H19 and hygromycinR reporter gene activities as described previously. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, the H19 and hygromycinR reporter genes showed maximum expression in the episome carrying the Kcnq1 ICR mutated at all three NF-Y binding sites, when compared with episomes with mutations at one and/or two NF-Y binding sites (compare PS4CAT1–3 with PS4CAT1 and PS4CAT1&2 in Fig. 4, C and D). Taken together, these observations indicate that a gradual increase in H19 and hygromycinR reporter gene expression correlates to a gradual decrease in the Kcnq1ot1 expression in the Kcnq1 ICR carrying mutations at the NF-Y binding sites. Hence, NF-Y occupancy at the Kcnq1ot1 promoter determines the Kcnq1ot1 expression and bidirectional silencing property of the Kcnq1 ICR, proving its prominent role in the activity of the Kcnq1 ICR. NF-Y Transcription Factor Maintains Differential Epigenetic Marks at the Kcnq1 ICR—The Kcnq1 ICR carries differential epigenetic marks on the parental alleles, i.e. on the paternal chromosome, the Kcnq1 ICR is unmethylated at the CpGs, whereas on the maternal allele the Kcnq1 ICR is enriched with CpG methylation. It is, however, not known how these differential epigenetic marks are established and maintained at the ICR. We addressed whether NF-Y transcription factor occupancy has any role in the maintenance of differential epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR. For this purpose, we analyzed acetylation and methylation levels at the lysine 9 residue of the histone H3 and methylation at the CpG residues in the Kcnq1 ICR (Fig. 5, A and B). The histone acetylation and methylation levels were analyzed by ChIP on the cross-linked chromatin obtained from the JEG-3 cells transiently transfected for 20 days with episomal plasmids PS4 and PS4CAT1–3. As observed in Fig. 5B, the wild type Kcnq1 ICR was enriched with histone acetylation, whereas the histone methylation was present at low levels. However, the Kcnq1 ICR with mutations at the NF-Y binding sites showed low levels of histone acetylation and enhancement in the histone methylation levels. Next, we addressed whether mutations at the NF-Y binding sites affected the CpG methylation levels in the Kcnq1 ICR. We have shown earlier that JEG-3 cells have a capacity to methylate de novo episomal sequences upon transfection and that the intensity of de novo methylation over the episomal sequences increases with time in culture (20Kanduri C. Kanduri M. Thakur N. Pfeifer S. Ohlsson R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4545-4548PubMed Google Scholar). In that scenario, when NF-Y sites are involved in the maintenance of differential epigenetic marks, their mutations should enable rapid CpG methylation. As shown in Fig. 5C, the modified ICR was heavily methylated as compared with the wild type ICR (compare the PS4 lane with PS4CAT1–3). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that NF-Y transcription factor is involved in the maintenance of differential epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR. We have earlier documented that the Kcnq1 ICR spreads de novo methylation into the flanking H19 coding region (8Thakur N. Kanduri M. Holmgren C. Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9514-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that this property occurs as a consequence of antisense RNA-mediated silencing. Because antisense transcription is lost in the PS4CAT1–3 constructs, we tested for the methylation spreading property of the Kcnq1 ICR in the PS4CAT1–3 construct. Fig. 5D shows that CpG methylation over the H19 coding region is lost in the PS4CAT1–3 but not in the PS4 construct, suggesting that NF-Y-mediated antisense transcription is crucial for the spreading of heterochromatin blocks over the flanking H19 coding region. The following are the main observations we made. 1) By genomic footprinting, we have shown that most of the transcription factors in the antisense promoter region interact in a methylation-sensitive manner. 2) By selectively deleting the antisense promoter encompassing the binding sites for NF-Y, we have demonstrated that this region is crucial for antisense promoter activity and bidirectional silencing. 3) Using ChIP assay, we have shown specific association of NF-Y with the antisense promoter. 4) Introducing mutations at the conserved nucleotides in all three NF-Y binding sites resulted in loss of NF-Y occupancy. Loss of NF-Y occupancy at the Kcnq1ot1 promoter resulted in abrogation of antisense transcription and bidirectional silencing. 5) NF-Y occupancy at the Kcnq1ot1 promoter regulates the differential epigenetic marks such as CpG methylation, histone acetylation, and methylation, within the Kcnq1 ICR. We have documented earlier that the mouse Kcnq1 ICR harbors a bidirectional silencer activity and that this feature involves production of an antisense RNA, Kcnq1ot1 (3Thakur N. Tiwari V.K. Thomassin H. Pandey R.R. Kanduri M. Gondor A. Grange T. Ohlsson R. Kanduri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we demonstrated that NF-Y plays an important role in the regulation of the Kcnq1ot1 promoter activity and that the loss of NF-Y occupancy in the Kcnq1ot1 promoter region resulted in the loss of both Kcnq1ot1 transcription and the bidirectional silencing property of the Kcnq1 ICR. This conclusion is primarily based on the observation that mutation of conserved nucleotides in all three NF-Y binding sites leads to loss of antisense transcription and parallel loss of silencing of H19 and hygromycinR reporter genes in the episomal-based system. In our earlier study (3Thakur N. Tiwari V.K. Thomassin H. Pandey R.R. Kanduri M. Gondor A. Grange T. Ohlsson R. Kanduri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we have implicated antisense transcription in bidirectional silencing based on the selective deletion of the antisense promoter region. However, this does not rule out the possibility that the deleted region may contain cis-acting elements that independently participate in the Kcnq1 ICR-mediated silencing without interfering with antisense transcription. In this investigation, the correlation of loss of silencing with loss of antisense transcription in the NF-Y-mutated Kcnq1 ICR conclusively demonstrated that the antisense promoter activity is critical in the bidirectional silencing mediated by the Kcnq1 ICR. This conclusion is further corroborated by the loss of antisense transcription from the episomal plasmids cotransfected with plasmids containing a dominant negative form of NF-YA. A recent investigation in the multiple CCAAT-containing human KCNQ1OT1 promoter also implicated NF-Y with in vitro binding assays, although the effects on silencing were not determined (21Du M. Zhou W. Beatty L.G. Weksberg R. Sadowski P.D. Genomics. 2004; 84: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, NF-Y plays a critical role in regulating an evolutionarily conserved region within the Kcnq1ot1 promoter, which is crucial for the bidirectional silencing property of the Kcnq1 ICR. The tandem arrangement of conserved CCAAT boxes observed here is reminiscent of other systems, particularly cell-cycle promoters, in which NF-Y takes a prominent role (Ref. 19Salsi V. Caretti G. Wasner M. Reinhard W. Haugwitz U. Engeland K. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6642-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and references therein). Careful dissection of the triple CCAAT of the Cyclin B2 gene, for example, indicates that their precise stereo alignment is crucial for p300 recruitment and promoter function of co-activators with all CCAAT boxes, irrespective of their relative affinity for NF-Y and similarly contributing to the overall activity. Here, a gradual decrease in the antisense transcription and a corresponding increase in reporter gene expression in the PS4 mutated at the NF-Y sites suggests all three CCAAT boxes are important for the antisense promoter activity and that the levels of antisense RNA production may determine the extent of bidirectional silencing. We have proposed earlier (3Thakur N. Tiwari V.K. Thomassin H. Pandey R.R. Kanduri M. Gondor A. Grange T. Ohlsson R. Kanduri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that the Kcnq1ot1 transcript may silence the reporter genes by recruiting repressive complexes containing histone methyltransferases and histone deacetylases. In that scenario, we presume that recruitment of heterochromatic machinery is perhaps dependent on the levels of antisense RNA and that it is, in turn, correlated to the extent of silencing. Loss of methylation spreading in the flanking H19 coding region of PS4CAT1–3 further reinforces the suggestion that the antisense transcription is involved in the modification of chromatin. Consistent with this presumption, in a recent study (22Jeffery L. Nakielny S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49479-49487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it has been documented that the RNA component also plays a crucial part in recruiting DNA methyltransferases and methyl-specific CpG binding proteins complexed with histone deacetylases. One of the most interesting findings of our study is the loss of differential epigenetic marks in the Kcnq1 ICR with mutations in the NF-Y transcription factor binding sites. This suggests that the NF-Y transcription factor in association with other transcription factors may be involved in maintaining the differential epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR. This is an important finding from the perspective that the loss of differential epigenetic marks of the human KCNQ1 ICR is present in >40% of the sporadic Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients. We presume that deregulation of the functions that maintain the differential epigenetic marks could be a cause for the loss of differential epigenetic marks at the KCNQ1 ICR in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients. Loss of antisense transcription as well as differential epigenetic marks from the Kcnq1 ICR with mutations at the NF-Y binding sites suggests that the NF-Y transcription factor plays an important role not only in keeping the antisense promoter in a transcriptionally competent state under strong silencing conditions but also keeps the antisense promoter CpG methylation free by preventing de novo methylation. One of the main questions that needs to be addressed is how the NF-Y transcription factor is involved in maintaining the differential epigenetic marks at the Kcnq1 ICR. It has recently been documented that NF-Y recruits histone acetyltransferases and thereby keeps the promoter in a highly acetylated state (23Caretti G. Salsi V. Vecchi C. Imbriano C. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30435-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The presence of high acetylation and low methylation at the lysine 9 residue of H3 histone in the wild type Kcnq1 ICR probably suggests that NF-Y occupancy at the antisense promoter recruits histone acetyltransferases to keep the antisense promoter transcriptionally competent under strong silencing conditions.

The integrin β hybrid domain is proposed to be involved in the propagation of this activation signal. Our previous study showed that the integrin β2-specific monoclonal antibody 7E4 abrogates monoclonal antibody KIM185-activated but not Mg2+/EGTA-activated leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; αLβ2)-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1. Here we investigated the allosteric inhibitory property of 7E4. By using human/mouse chimeras and substitution mutations, the epitope of 7E4 was mapped to Val407, located in the mid-region of the β2 hybrid domain. Two sets of constitutively active LFA-1 variants were used to examine the effect of 7E4 on LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding. 7E4 attenuated the binding of variants that have modifications to regions membrane proximal with respect to the β2 hybrid domain. In contrast, the inhibitory effect was minimal on variants with alterations in the αL I- and β2 I-like domains preceding the hybrid domain. Furthermore, 7E4 abrogated LFA-1/ICAM-1 adhesion of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated MOLT-4 cells. Our data demonstrate that interaction between the hybrid and I-like domain is critical for the regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion.

Integrins are key proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, mediating essential biological processes such as embryogenesis, the immune response, and inflammation (1Shimaoka M.

They are heterodimeric type I membrane glycoproteins formed by noncovalent association of an α and a β subunit. In human, 9 of the 18 α subunits have an I (Inserted)-domain found between blades 2 and 3 of a seven-bladed β-propeller structure at its N-terminal end. For this particular subset of integrins, the I-domains are involved in ligand binding via their MIDAS 1The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; LFA-1, leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; NTR, N-terminal region. motifs (3Diamond M.S.

The β subunit is linearly organized into an N-terminal PSI-domain (for Plexins, Semaphorins, and Integrins) (7Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), a spacer region, an I-domain like structure (also known as the I-like domain or β A-domain), a mid-region, a cysteine-rich region containing four tandem IEGF (Integrin Epidermal Growth Factor)-domains, and a terminal domain followed by the transmembrane and cytoplasmic segment (Fig. 1A). In the integrins without an I-domain in their α subunits, the β I-like domain participates directly in ligand binding (8Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). However, in the integrins with an I-domain in their α subunits, the β I-like domain may, in addition, serve a regulatory role in the integrin-mediated adhesion (9Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19800-19805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Previously, we constructed integrin β2/β7 chimeras in which the N-terminal region (NTR, the combined PSI domain and spacer segment), I-like domain, and the mid-region of the β2 subunit were replaced with those of the β7 subunit (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The epitopes of five β2-specific mAbs were mapped by using these chimeras and were found to require both NTR and mid-region for their expression. Coupled with the observation that removal of the I-like domain did not affect the folding of the NTR-mid-region complex, we concluded that the NTR and mid-region interact extensively. This conclusion was in agreement with the crystal structure of αVβ3, in which the I-like domain of the β3 subunit is connected via its N and C termini to a hybrid domain formed by the spacer and mid-region, assuming an I-set immunoglobulin fold (11Xiong J.P.

The function of the hybrid domain has been suggested to involve the shape shifting of the I-like domain in α5β1 (12Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E.

Various mAbs (activating, inhibitory, and reporter) against integrins have provided much information on the regulation of integrin function (1Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 14Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21514-21524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, in our previous study, the properties of the five anti-β2 mAbs to the hybrid domain were investigated. Of note, 7E4 abrogated mAb KIM185-activated LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 but not Mg2+/EGTA-activated LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding. Although the end effect of both activating agents on LFA-1 is similar, their modes of action differ. Whereas the epitope and site of action of KIM185 lie in the IEGF-4 and terminal domain of the β2 subunit (16Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the effect of Mg2+/EGTA lies predominantly on the MIDAS and ADMIDAS of the β subunit (1Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Taken together, we reasoned that the properties exhibited by 7E4 provide a unique opportunity to address how the activation signal is propagated via the hybrid domain of LFA-1. To this end, we extended our investigation by fine mapping the epitope of 7E4 using human/mouse chimeras and amino acid substitution analyses. We were able to locate the key residue for the 7E4 mAb. In addition, the allosteric inhibitory property of 7E4 on LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding was examined by using αL and β2 variants, which confer constitutive activation of the resultant heterodimer.

The mouse β2 fragments Mo(Met1–Asp77), Mo(Met1–Glu298), and Mo(Glu298–Asn584) were generated by PCR using a mouse cDNA library as template. An EcoRV site is found in the mouse CD18 cDNA inclusive of the codons for the invariant residues Asp-Ile at positions 77–78 (see Fig. 1B). An EcoRV site was introduced into the equivalent position in the human CD18 cDNA. Mo(Met1–Asp77) was inserted into the NheI and EcoRV sites of CD18-pcDNA3.1/zeo(+) that had their corresponding human β2 fragments removed. Mo(Met1–Glu298) was inserted into the NheI and EcoRI sites and Mo(Glu298–Asn584) into the EcoRI and SacII sites of CD18-pcDNA3.1/zeo(+) (23Douglass W.A. Hyland R.H. Buckley C.D. Al-Shamkhani A.

The initiation methionine is assigned number 1 in the protein sequence. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in complete media containing the following: RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Transfections were performed using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol.

Cell Adhesion Assay—For analysis of LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1, the wells of Polysorb microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 μl/well of goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) at 5 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2) for 16–20 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, 50 μl of 1 μg/ml ICAM-1/Fc in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was added to each well of the coated plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequent steps were described previously (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol.

MHM24 was used at 10 μg/ml to inhibit LFA-1-mediated adhesion. 7E4 was studied for its effect on adhesion at three different concentrations of 20, 10, and 3 μg/ml. Mg2+/EGTA (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) was used to activate LFA-1-mediated adhesion. Total cell fluorescence was determined using a fluorescence plate reader (Cytofluor 4000; PerSeptive Diagnostics, Framingham, MA). For MOLT-4 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) ICAM-1 binding assay, the phorbol ester PMA (50 ng/ml) was employed for treatment of cells as described previously (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated with primary mAb, at 10 μg/ml unless otherwise stated, in RPMI 1640 for 1 h at 4 °C. They were then washed twice and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 secondary antibody (1:400 dilution; Sigma) for 45 min at 4 °C. Stained cells were washed once and fixed in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Expression index was calculated by EI = %GP × MFI/100, where EI is expression index, %GP is % cells gated positive, and MFI is mean fluorescence intensity. Positive gates were set to include 5% of the brightest cells stained with the irrelevant antibody KB43. Epitope Mapping—In a previous study (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we reported the mapping of several anti-β2 mAbs using β2/β7 hybrid chimeras. The epitope of mAb 7E4 was further studied by using human/mouse β2 chimeras (β2,Hu/Mo). Four chimeras were generated: β2,Hu/MoA contains the Met1 to Asn584 residues of the mouse β2 sequence; β2,Hu/MoB contains the Met1 to Asp77 residues; β2,Hu/MoC contains the Met1 to Glu298residues; and β2,Hu/MoD contains the Glu298 to Asn584 residues (Fig. 1A). These cDNAs were co-transfected with αL cDNA into COS-7 cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mAb KIM185 has its epitope located at IEGF-4/TD (Tail Domain) of the β2 subunit (16Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); hence it was included to monitor surface expression of the β2 wild-type and chimeric subunits. The expression of the 7E4 epitope was greatly reduced on the αLβ2,Hu/MoA transfectants (Table I) but was not significantly affected on the αLβ2,Hu/MoB and αLβ2,Hu/MoC transfectants. However, minimal expression was detected on αLβ2,Hu/MoD transfectants. Our previous study using β2/β7 chimeras showed that the expression of the 7E4 epitope requires the β2 residues both in the spacer and the mid-region, and expression is abolished if either region was substituted with the corresponding one from β7 (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the data presented here, its expression is only affected if the mid-region is from the mouse β2 subunit. Thus, we may conclude that the species-specific residues for the epitope reside in the mid-region, but residues in the spacer common to the human and mouse β2 subunits are also required for the expression of the 7E4 epitope.Table IExpression of antibody epitopes on human/mouse chimeric αLβ2 integrin subunitsaEpitope expression is measured using EI = %GP × MFI, where EI is expression index, %GP is % cells gated positive, and MFI is mean fluorescence intensity.

As before, the cDNA constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells, and surface expression of the epitope was monitored by flow cytometry. Of the mutants generated and tested, the 7E4 epitope was abolished with β2,Hu(V407N) but not with all other substitutions (Table II).Table IIExpression of antibody epitopes on β2 human/mouse “knock-out” mutants in the mid-regionβ2 human/mouse transfectants7E4MEM48β2,Hu (wt)100100β2,Hu(N372S/A373T)11164β2,Hu(V390A/T391S)92100β2,Hu(H392S/R393I)8095β2,Hu(N394G/Q395K)12495β2,Hu(P396S)63100β2,Hu(V407N)9105β2,Hu(I409V)13953β2,Hu(T416M)8192β2,Hu(T418S)85102β2,Hu(I436T)145183β2,Hu(L442R)122173 Open table in a new tab “Knock-in” mutants were constructed on the β2,Hu/MoA background, in which the PSI, I-like domain, hybrid domain (made up of the spacer and mid-region), IEGF-1, -2, and -3, and part of IEGF-4 (Fig. 1A) were those of the mouse β2 subunit. The 7E4 epitope expression was restored in the β2,Hu/MoA(N407V) variant which had the mouse Asn changed to a human Val residue (Table III).

In this work, we determined whether 7E4 can block the adhesion of several “constitutively active” LFA-1 to ICAM-1. β2NV1 is a β2/β1 chimera in which the cysteine-rich region of the β2 subunit was replaced that that of β1 (23Douglass W.A.

Law, unpublished observations. 7E4 was found to abolish the adhesion of 293T transfectants expressing the LFA-1 variants αLβ2C36S, αLβ2R593C, and αLβ2NV1 to ICAM-1 with higher efficiencies at high 7E4 concentrations. In contrast, 7E4, even at 20 μg/ml, has no significant effect on the adhesion of the αLβ2N351S variant to ICAM-1 (Fig. 2A). By using Mg2+/EGTA as the activating reagent, the blocking effect of 7E4 to ICAM-1 was minimal for all constructs (Fig. 2B). All adhesion was specific as they can be blocked with anti-αL antibody MHM24. In addition, similar results were obtained when LFA-1 was expressed on COS-7 cells (data not shown). In a separate experiment, we investigated the effect of 7E4 on the adhesive ability of transfectants expressing constitutively active LFA-1. β2C23* is a β2 truncation mutant in which the codon of Cys483 was converted to a stop codon. When combined with wild-type αL, the resultant heterodimer was found to be constitutively active (26Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The αL,C-C mutant has the I-domain locked in the active conformation and the LFA-1 that it forms with wild-type β2 is constitutively active (27Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc.

PMA activates protein kinase C, which is reported to activate LFA-1 via phosphorylation of its β2 cytoplasmic tail (31Valmu L. Fagerholm S. Suila H. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). PMA significantly augmented the binding of MOLT-4 to ICAM-1. Noteworthy, 7E4 effectively abrogated this binding similar to that observed in the presence of MHM24, an αL-specific function-blocking mAb. It is possible that 7E4 fails to block the adhesion of the LFA-1 variants αLβ2N351S and αL,C-Cβ2,wt to ICAM-1 because the epitope is not expressed on these variants. This is not the case as shown in Table IV; the epitope is expressed on wild-type and all the variants described in this article.Table IVExpression of the 7E4 epitope on 293T transfectants with variant αL and β2 subunitsEpitope expressionaExpression indices are shown.IB4bThe absolute level of LFA-1 expression, as indicated by the heterodimer-specific mAb IB4, is quite variable among the different transfectants.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Modeling of the β2 Subunit Expressing 7E4 Epitopes—By using the coordinates of the integrin αVβ3 as a template, a model of the hybrid and I-like domains of the β2 subunit was generated using the molecular modeling program MODELLER (Fig. 5). The 7E4 epitope Val407 is positioned at the N-terminal end of the E strand of the hybrid domain (11Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) and can be visualized to be close to the I-like domain of the β2 subunit. Based on electron micrographs of the representative integrins αIIbβ3 and α5β1, the general structure of the integrin molecule had been taken as a two-pronged plug having a globular head and two legs anchoring them into the membrane (33Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 34Nermut M.V. Green N.M. Eason P. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From numerous functional studies and other studies, it was also generally accepted that conformational change is an integral component in regulating integrin adhesiveness (36Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The conformational change had not been defined, but much experimental data pointed to the model that a resting integrin is highly constrained and a release of these constraints results in activation. The x-ray solution of αVβ3 showed a structure in which the two legs were bent, folding the integrin heterodimer into a compact conformation (11Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Extensive analyses of the electron micrograph images of the recombinant extracellular fragment of the αVβ3 integrin in different activation states were performed (33Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). It was found that the resting integrin in Ca2+/Mg2+ corresponds to the compact bent conformer, whereas the active integrin induced by Mn2+ or the cyclic RGD ligand corresponds to the extended conformer. These observations were in line with the “switchblade” model of integrin activation proposed based on the NMR analysis of the structure of the IEGF-2 and -3 of the β2 integrin subunit (37Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported the effect of the mAb 7E4 on LFA-1-mediated adhesion of MOLT-4 to immobilized ICAM-1 (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). If LFA-1 was activated by the mAb KIM185, 7E4 can block the adhesion. However, if Mg2+/EGTA was used to activate LFA-1, 7E4 has no effect. The switchblade model suggests that resting LFA-1 is presumably bent, and activation involves the transition of the molecule to the extended conformation. Support for this model for both KIM185 and Mg2+/EGTA-mediated activation of LFA-1 can be found with the study of the mAb KIM127. The epitope of the mAb KIM127 has been mapped to the IEGF-2 and IEGF-3 of the integrin β2 subunit (16Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 38Tan S.M. Walters S.E. Mathew E.C. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Superposition of the NMR structure of these two domains on the αVβ3 template (11Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) showed that the residues forming the epitope are buried (37Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of the KIM127 epitope is associated with the activation of LFA-1, which would require the binding of the mAb KIM185 (39Robinson M.K. Andrew D. Rosen H. Brown D. Ortlepp S. Stephens P. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar) or the incubation of the cells in Mg2+/EGTA.2 Taken together, both KIM185 and Mg2+/EGTA activate LFA-1 by exposing the KIM127 epitope, which may be interpreted as the conversion of the bent conformer into the extended conformer. KIM185-activated adhesion must start with the binding of the antibody to LFA-1 at its epitope site in the IEGF-4 and βTD domain of the integrin β2 subunit (16Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This binding induces a conformational change rendering LFA-1 the capacity to bind ICAM-1 at its ligand-binding site that is located at the I-domain of the αL subunit. Binding of 7E4 to the hybrid domain may thus be viewed as a blockade in communication between the activation site, i.e. KIM185-binding site, and the ligand-binding site. Mg2+/EGTA, on the other hand, is likely to induce the conformational change of LFA-1 at the MIDAS and ADMIDAS sites of the I-like domain of the β2 subunit (1Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Because the divalent cation-binding sites and the ligand-binding sites are both distal to the hybrid domain, 7E4 does not affect ICAM-1 binding induced by Mg2+/EGTA. If 7E4 blocks LFA-1 mediated adhesion by preventing signals originating from regions proximal to the membrane to the ligand-binding site, we should be able to test this hypothesis by using a number of LFA-1 variants that are constitutively inactive. Indeed, our results presented here showed segregation of these variants. The constitutive activity of LFA-1 due to modification on the membrane side of the hybrid domain is abolished by 7E4. These variants are αLβ2R593C (20Shaw J.M. Al-Shamkhani A. Boxer L.A. Buckley C.D. Dodds A.W. Klein N. Nolan S.M. Roberts I. Roos D. Scarth S.L. Simmons D.L. Tan S.M. Law S.K. Clin. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), αLβ2C23* (26Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and LFA-1 activated by KIM185 that binds to the “foot” of the β2 subunit. Most interestingly, also in this list is the LFA-1 variant with the C36S mutation (24Kijas J.M. Bauer Jr., T.R. Gafvert S. Marklund S. Trowald-Wigh G. Johannisson A. Hedhammar A. Binns M. Juneja R.K. Hickstein D.D. Andersson L. Genomics. 1999; 61: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in the PSI domain. Because the PSI domain is folded back under the hybrid domain, the mutation C36S can therefore be considered to be located on the membrane proximal side of the hybrid domain. Furthermore, activation of LFA-1 by PMA, originating from the inside the cell, was attenuated by 7E4. The corollary is that LFA-1 with modification distal to the hybrid domain should not be affected by 7E4 because they exert their effects to the ligand-binding site beyond the hybrid domain. They include the activation by Mg2+/EGTA (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the LAD mutation N351S in the I-like domain of β2 (25Nelson C. Rabb H. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the engineered disulfide lock in the I-domain of the αL subunit (27Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The β I-like domain is proposed to regulate the activity of the α I-domain. It has been known that mutations in the MIDAS residues in the I-like domain of the β2 integrin subunit would not affect LFA-1 expression, but the LFA-1 variants were incapable of ligand binding, irrespective of being treated with activating mAbs or Mg2+/EGTA (40Bajt M.L. Goodman T. McGuire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 41Hogg N. Stewart M.P. Scarth S.L. Newton R. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. Klein N. J.

Immunol. 2000; 121: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an invariant glutamate residue, located in the linker between the I-domain and the β-propeller in all I-domain containing α subunits had been identified. Mutation of this glutamate residue, Glu335 in the αL subunit, rendered the resultant LFA-1 inactive (43Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that an integral part of LFA-1 activation may lie in the binding of the β2 MIDAS motif with Glu335 in αL. This hypothesis received strong support from experiments in a recent publication in which the Glu335 of the αL subunit, and either one of the two residues on the β2 subunit, Tyr137 or Ala232, were converted to cysteines (44Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The two resultant LFA-1 variants were found to have the αL and β2 subunits disulfide-linked and are constitutively active with respect to ICAM-1 binding. Because both Tyr137 and Ala232 are in the proximity of the MIDAS motif of the β2 I-like domain, the LFA-1 variants may be considered as being “locked” into an active conformation similar to when the β2 MIDAS binds to the invariant Glu in the αL subunit. The epitope of 7E4 is complex and requires the split regions of the hybrid domain for expression (10Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By using single residue substitutions described in this article, the species-specific residue was identified to be Val407. Other residues, common to both human and mouse, must also contribute to the conformation of the epitope. Modeling on the αVβ3 template showed that it is close to the C-terminal helix of the I-like domain (Fig. 5). Thus, binding of 7E4 to the hybrid domain may alter its capacity to interact with the I-like domain, preventing LFA-1 from being activated perhaps by disabling the binding of the β2 MIDAS motif to the invariant glutamate in αL. In recent studies on the α5β1 integrin (12Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Luo B.H. Strokovich K. Walz T. Springer T.A. Takagi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27466-27471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the “swinging” of the hybrid domain away from the I-like domain is associated with the integrin being activated. In this article, our data do not provide support nor contradict this particular relative motion of the hybrid domain in integrin activation. However, it does concur that the hybrid domain plays a role in the regulation of LFA-1 activity. We thank Beckman Instruments for providing the mAb 7E4."

A variety of mechanisms used by nature to perform coupled reactions, a fundamental requirement for energy transduction processes, can now be established in detail for relatively small macromolecules that can couple the transfer of electrons and protons. The tetraheme cytochrome c3 is found in all organisms belonging to the Desulfovibrionaceae family as well as in other sulfate-reducing bacteria including Desulfomicrobium (Dsm) species, where it is produced in large quantities (1Coutinho I.B. Xavier A.V. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is a soluble protein of low molecular weight, with the c-type hemes covalently bound to the polypeptide chain by two thioether bridges provided by cysteine residues arranged in the typical -CXX(XX)CH-heme binding sequences, and axially coordinated by two histidines. Recently, tetraheme cytochromes c3 have been classified as type I and type II (2Valente F.M. Saraiva L.M. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. Pereira I.A. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the Dsm cytochromes studied in this work have mixed characteristics of both types. Like type I, these cytochromes have a heme-binding site of type -CXXXXCH-, acidic residues around heme I, and long N- and C-terminal regions. However, the region of positive charges surrounding heme IV, which is characteristic of type I cytochromes c3, is not well defined in these cytochromes. The close proximity of the hemes in cytochrome c3 results in homotropic redox cooperativities. Furthermore, their reduction potentials are very negative and pH-dependent in the physiological range (redox-Bohr effect) (3Santos H. Moura J.J. Moura I. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Turner D.L. Salgueiro C.A. Catarino T. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Together, these properties allow cytochromes c3 to couple the transfer of electrons and protons (5Xavier A.V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1986; 28: 239-243Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which for type I cytochrome c3 (2Valente F.M. Saraiva L.M. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. Pereira I.A. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is fundamental for its physiological function as partner of the periplasmic hydrogenase (6Yagi T. Honya M. Tamiya N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 153: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Louro R.O. Catarino T. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 488-491Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Desulfomicrobium norvegicum (Dsmn) cytochrome c3 has been proposed to be involved in electron transfer between the [NiFeSe] hydrogenase and the octaheme cytochrome c3 (8Aubert C. Brugna M. Dolla A. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in a similar way as that for type I and type II cytochromes c3 from Desulfovibrio africanus (2Valente F.M. Saraiva L.M. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. Pereira I.A. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent studies allowed the identification of the key residues involved in homotropic and/or heterotropic cooperativities in type I cytochromes c3 from Desulfovibrio gigas (Dg) (9Brennan L. Turner D.L. Messias A.C. Teodoro M.L. LeGall J. Santos H. Xavier A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) (10Matias P.M. Frazao C. Morais J. Coll M. Carrondo M.A. J. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 281: 719-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies were used to further probe the role of some specific residues in the modulation of the redox properties of these proteins (12Saraiva L.M. Salgueiro C.A. LeGall J. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Xavier A.V. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 542-550Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Saraiva L.M. Salgueiro C.A. da Costa P.N. Messias A.C. LeGall J. van Dongen W.M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9709-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these cytochromes an antielectrostatic (conformationally mediated)-positive homotropic cooperativity between two hemes governs a coordinated two-electron transfer, whereas a positive redox-Bohr effect controls their proton thrusting activity. Subsequent characterization of the cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 (15Louro R.O. Catarino T. LeGall J. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Louro R.O. Bento I. Matias P.M. Catarino T. Baptista A.M. Soares C.M. Carrondo M.A. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. J. Biol.

This alternative mechanism is achieved by the concerted effect of two positive redox-Bohr effects governing a proton-assisted coordinated two-electron transfer. Furthermore, these positive redox-Bohr effects are also responsible for the proton thrusting activity of this cytochrome (17Louro R.O. Catarino T. Turner D.L. Picarra-Pereira M.A. Pacheco I. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15808-15815Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Tetraheme cytochromes c3 from Dsm were isolated from organisms that live in different habitats. D. norvegicum (Dsmn) (18Genthner B.R.S. Friedman S.D. Devereux R. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 889-892Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was isolated in a pure culture from a saltwater sample from Oslo harbor (19Miller J.D.A. Saleh A.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1964; 37: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and Desulfomicrobium baculatum (DSM 1743) (Dsmb) was isolated from the mud of the Kujalnik estuary near Odessa and Lake Saksky (Crimea) (20Shaposhnikov V.V. Kondratieva E.N. Fedorov V.D. Nature. 1960; 187: 167-168Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as part of a symbiotic consortium with a green sulfur bacterium (21Pfennig N. Biebl H. Arch. Microbiol. 1976; 110: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, these two strains have virtually identical 16 S ribosomal RNAs (18Genthner B.R.S. Friedman S.D. Devereux R. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 889-892Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating a very close evolutionary proximity. In line with this observation, these Dsm cytochromes c3 have a highly similar primary structure, with Thr-37, Val-45, and Phe-88 in the cytochrome c3 from Dsmn being substituted by Ser, Ala, and Tyr, respectively, in the cytochrome c3 from Dsmb. Also, as shown in this work, its three-dimensional structure, determined by x-ray crystallography, is almost identical to that of Dsmn (22Czjzek M. Payan F. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as might be expected from the difference in habitat, their microscopic thermodynamic properties are different. The study of closely similar proteins, such as the natural variants of cytochromes c3 from Dsmn and Dsmb, presents the advantage of probing modifications in the primary sequence that are obviously compatible with the maintenance of function. Thus, it may help to characterize the biological factors relevant to the evolution of the protein function. Crystallization—The conditions that successfully crystallized cytochrome c3 from Dsmn (23Frey M. Haser R. Pierrot M. Bruschi M. Le Gall J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) did not induce any crystals of cytochrome c3 from Dsmb, which was crystallized in 25% PEG6K at a pH between 7.5 and 8.0 using Tris/HCl, 0.1 m as buffer. Thin needles of cytochrome c3 from Dsmb were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Thicker crystals were obtained when the hanging-drop technique was substituted by the batch technique, which improved the intensity and resolution of the diffraction pattern. Cytochrome c3 from Dsmb crystallizes in the trigonal space group P31, with cell parameters a = 43.0 Å, b = 43.0 Å, and c = 64.7 Å, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 53.3%. Data Collection—Room temperature diffraction data were collected on a MAR Research detector at station 9.5 at the SRS, CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK, using a wavelength of 0.99 Å. The diffraction images were processed and scaled by programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N.W. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 71-79Google Scholar); structure factor magnitudes were calculated with the CCP4 package (25P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of cytochrome c3 from Dsmb was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Cryst. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) with the 1.7-Å structure of the cytochrome c3 from Dsmn (22Czjzek M. Payan F. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as a search model. A clear solution with a correlation coefficient of 59.6% and an R factor of 34.0% was found. The first refinement steps, including rigid body minimization, simulated annealing, and a gradual refinement of B factors, were performed with X-PLOR (27Brünger A.T. X-plor: A System for Protein Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar) using the molecular replacement solution and data to 1.8 Å. The calculated R factor at that point was 26.9%. A further stage of refinement was carried out using SHELXL-96 (28Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) using a restrained conjugated gradient weighted least squares procedure on F2. During each cycle of refinement a free R factor (29Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) was calculated from 8% of the input 11633 reflections. Following each refinement run, 2m|Fo| – D|Fc| and m|Fo| – D|Fc| electron density maps were calculated and inspected on a graphics workstation using TURBO software (30, Roussel, A., Fontecilla-Camps, J. C., and Cambilllau, C. (1990) XV IUCr Congress (Authier, A., ed) pp. C66–C67, Bordeaux, FranceGoogle Scholar) to adjust incorrect side chain positions to the electron density, to check for previously unseen side chain atoms, and to add water molecules to the model. The criteria followed throughout for including a water molecule were that the corresponding peak should be visible on both the 2m|Fo| – D|Fc| and m|Fo| – D|Fc| Fourier maps, and there should be at least one hydrogen bond (between 2.5 and 3.2 Å). The heme irons were refined anisotropically. The main chain positions of loop residues Lys-21 and Gly-22 were not clear, so an omit map was calculated and used for rebuilding the loop. As a result of this procedure the R factor was lowered to 16.4% and the final free R value to 23.2%. The large difference between the two R factors suggested the existence of severe bias in the refined model. NMR data had shown that Phe-88 was substituted by a Tyr (31Coutinho I.B. Turner D.L. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but the sequencing of the cytochrome c3 gene, which was finished only when the refinement process was started, showed two more differences, Thr-37 and Val-45. Those mutations were introduced in the model and refinement continued with REFMAC version 5.1.24 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). This program uses maximum likelihood implementation, described as a good tool for improving the diffraction information quality all over the structure.

Open table in a new tab Standard protocols were used for DNA manipulation (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1999Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the first 29 residues of Dsmb cytochrome c3 was found to be identical to the residues of cytochrome c3 from Dsmn. Hence, based on the amino acid sequence available and assuming that the C-terminal sequences of the two cytochromes are also identical, two degenerate oligonucleotides were designed: 5′GAYGCVCCSGGBGAYGAYTAYG-3′ and 5′RTTSGTSGTRTGRCACTTVCC-3′. By using these primers, Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) amplified a 351-bp DNA sequence from the Dsmb genomic DNA. The reaction product was cloned into EcoRV cut pZErO™-1 (Invitrogen) vector and transformed into competent cells of Escherichia coli XL-2 Blue (Stratagene). Recombinant plasmids were isolated, sequenced on both strands with the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE Biosystems), and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 377A DNA Sequencer. Sample Preparation—Cytochromes c3 from Dsmn and Dsmb were purified as described previously (1Coutinho I.B. Xavier A.V. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the NMR samples were prepared at a concentration of 0.5 mm. The ionic strength of the samples was set to ∼360 mm through the addition of a concentrated solution of KCl in D2O to reduce the intermolecular electron transfer rate. The pH of the sample was adjusted for each experiment by adding small volumes of concentrated solutions of DCl and NaOD inside an anaerobic glove box. The pH values reported were not corrected for the isotope effect (34Delgado R. Frausto da Silva J.J.R. Amorim M.T.S. Cabral M.F. Chaves S. Costa J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1991; 245: 271-282Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and cover the range of 4.8–9.6 in Dsmn and 4.5–8.8 in Dsmb. The reduced and intermediate oxidation states of the protein were obtained by the method described previously (35Salgueiro C.A. Turner D.L. Santos H. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), using catalytic amounts of the periplasmic iron hydrogenase isolated from DvH under an H2 atmosphere as electron donor. NMR Spectroscopy—Two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm inverse detection probe with an internal B0 gradient coil and a BVT3000 temperature controller. The temperature of the samples was kept at 297.0 ± 0.1 K. The EXSY spectra were acquired with a mixing time of 25 ms and a sweep width of 35 kHz (in both dimensions). The spectra were processed with 1024 × 1024 data points using a Gaussian function in F2 and sine bell function in F1. They were calibrated using Tris as internal reference, with the pH-dependent chemical shift of Tris calibrated separately against 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid. Redox Titrations Followed by Visible Spectroscopy—The redox titrations of both cytochromes were performed at 297.0 ± 1.0 K using an adaptation of the method described previously (15Louro R.O. Catarino T. LeGall J. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using ∼80 μm protein solutions in 360 mm Tris/maleic acid buffer, pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. The high protein concentration required the use of an optical cell with 1-mm path length to acquire the data. The redox mediators were chosen according to the procedures defined in the literature (36Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 37, Catarino, T. (1998) Thermodynamic and Kinetic Modelling of the Redox Properties of Tetrahaem Cytochromes c3. Ph.D. thesis, Universidade Nova de LisboaGoogle Scholar). A mixture of anthraquinone 2-sulfonate (Aldrich), diquat (Riedel den Haan), indigo disulfonate (Merck), indigo trisulfonate (Sigma), methyl viologen (Sigma), neutral red (Sigma), and safranine O (Sigma) was used in all three experiments. In addition to the previous list, gallocyanine (Sigma), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Aldrich), indigo tetrasulfonate (Aldrich), and methylene blue (Sigma) were also used at pH 8. At pH 7, anthraquinone 2,7-disulfonate (Aldrich), benzyl viologen (Sigma), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Aldrich), indigo tetrasulfonate (Aldrich), and phenosafranine (BDH) were also used, whereas at pH 6 anthraquinone 2,7-disulfonate (Aldrich) and phenosafranine (BDH) were added to the basic mixture of mediators. The final concentration of each mediator was between 4 and 7 μm. To ensure that the results were not subject to interference resulting from specific interactions between the protein and the mediators, several ratios of protein versus mediator were tested. A combined Pt/Ag/AgCl electrode was used for measuring the solution potential/ and the reported values are relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Sample Preparation—Stock solutions of cytochromes c3 from Dsmn and Dsmb were degassed with alternate cycles of argon and vacuum in order to remove the dissolved oxygen and placed in an anaerobic chamber. Dilutions to the desired concentrations were made using 100 mm Tris maleate, pH 5.9, 7.1, and 8.4 for cytochrome c3 of Dsmn and at pH 5.9, 7.2, and 8.4 for cytochrome c3 of Dsmb. The ionic strength was set to ∼360 mm through the addition of KCl. After each experiment the actual pH of the reaction was measured, and the concentration of the proteins was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy using ϵ552 = 120,000 m–1 cm–1. Sodium dithionite was used as the reducing agent. A large excess of this reagent was used to guarantee pseudo-first order kinetics, irreversible electron transfer steps, and the complete reduction of the cytochrome at every pH value. In order to obtain >95% pure material, the reducing agent was recrystallized inside an anaerobic glove box according to the method described in the literature (38McKenna C.E. Gutheil W.G. Song W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1075: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The solution of sodium dithionite was obtained by adding solid sodium dithionite to degassed 10 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 8.5, with 360 mm KCl, inside the anaerobic chamber, to give approximately the final desired concentration. The actual concentration of the reducing agent was determined after the experiment, by UV-visible spectroscopy inside the anaerobic chamber, using ϵ314 = 8,000 m–1 cm–1 (39Dixon M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Data Collection—The kinetic data were obtained using a stopped-flow instrument (SF-61 HI-TECH Scientific), placed inside an anaerobic chamber. The traces were acquired at 552 nm, and the temperature was maintained at 298.0 ± 1.0 K by the use of an external circulating bath. To perform rapid mixing kinetic experiments starting with various degrees of reduction of the protein sample, a few microliters of concentrated sodium dithionite solution were added to the protein solutions before running the experiments. Shots of the protein against potassium ferricyanide were made in order to get the reference value for ODox. To obtain the reference value for ODred, the final absorbance was taken at effectively infinite time after each experiment. The kinetic curves obtained at different values of solution pH were normalized in order to report oxidized fraction versus time. The time scale of the traces was corrected to account for the dead time of the apparatus. Thermodynamic and Kinetic Modeling—In the redox titrations followed by NMR spectroscopy, the resonance positions and the line widths of one methyl group resonance from each heme were followed in different stages of oxidation, defined by the number of oxidized hemes in the molecule from 0 (fully reduced) to 4 (fully oxidized), and at different pH values. The heme methyl groups M181 I, M181 II, M121 III, and M181 IV (IUPAC-IUB nomenclature is used to identify the methyl groups and the hemes are indicated by roman numbers according to the order of attachment to the polypeptide chain) were chosen because they point toward the protein surface. Thus, their chemical shifts include only a small extrinsic paramagnetic contribution from the oxidation of the other hemes, which nevertheless was corrected on the basis of calculations using the information from magnetic susceptibility tensors, according to the methods previously described (40Salgueiro C.A. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Turner D.L. Brennan L. Chamberlin S.G. Louro R.O. Xavier A.V. Eur. Biophys.

Soc. 1998; 120: 13240-13247Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After this correction the paramagnetic chemical shift of any heme substituent, in each oxidation stage, is a weighted average of the populations that have this particular heme oxidized in that oxidation stage. The data obtained by NMR, visible, and stopped-flow kinetics were fitted simultaneously to a thermodynamic model (4Turner D.L. Salgueiro C.A. Catarino T. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 43Turner D.L. Salgueiro C.A. Catarino T. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and to a kinetic model (44Catarino T. Turner D.L. ChemBioChem. 2001; 2: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic and kinetic models are applicable to systems in fast intramolecular electron transfer and slow intermolecular electron transfer in the time scale of the experiments (3Santos H. Moura J.J. Moura I. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 44Catarino T. Turner D.L. ChemBioChem. 2001; 2: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on the NMR data it is only possible to establish the relative order of oxidation of the hemes, because the solution potential was not measured inside the NMR tube. The calibration of the heme potentials, the heme-heme interactions, and of the redox-Bohr effect was achieved through the redox titrations followed by visible spectroscopy, performed at different pH values. The kinetic model makes use of the thermodynamic parameters to obtain information on the rate constants for the reduction of the individual hemes. Each heme is characterized by a reference rate constant (ki0) that accounts for differences in binding, accessibility to the electron donor, and other structural factors, and it is assumed that this reference constant does not change throughout the reduction process. The actual 64 microscopic rate constants are the product of the reference constant of the heme that is being reduced in a particular microstep and a factor γi (Equation 1), derived from Marcus theory (45Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7802) Google Scholar) that accounts for the thermodynamic driving force (ΔG) of the electron transfer process in that microstep:γi=exp(eiF2RT(1+eDFλ−eiF2λ)−)(Eq. 1) Here, ei is the reduction potential of center i in a particular microstep; eD is the midpoint potential of the electron donor (SO2−), –0.3 V, which is pH-independent (44Catarino T. Turner D.L. ChemBioChem. 2001; 2: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 46Neta P. Huie R.E. Harriman A. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 1606-1611Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar); and λ is the reorganization energy, assumed to be constant and estimated to be 1 eV (47Christiansen H.E.M. Coutinho I. Conrad L.S.

https://openalex.org/W2011614308,"A novel cytoplasm protein, interphase cytoplasm foci protein 45 kDa (ICF45), was identified by screening the cDNA expression library for HeLa cells with serum from an autoimmune patient. The complete cDNA sequence of ICF45 was determined to be 1.32 kb and to encode 298 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa. The ICF45 transcripts were detected in different tissues and were relatively rich in human liver and lung tissues but scarce in brain tissue. Immunofluorescence with anti-ICF45-specific antibodies demonstrated that ICF45 is strongly expressed in interphase and cannot be seen in mitosis. The subcellular localization of ICF45 and fusion proteins GFP-ICF45, ICF45-GFP, and HA-ICF45 showed ICF45 centralized into 1-2 dots in the cytoplasm and always near the nuclear membrane. The staining foci of ICF45 appeared to be slightly larger than centrosomes and in some cases were found to colocalize with centrosomes. After effectively silencing the ICF45 by RNAi, the growth and proliferation of the cells were significantly inhibited, and p53 was detected to be up-regulated. The silencing of ICF45 also resulted in an appearance of polycentrosome and multinuclear cells, which finally went to apoptosis. Our results suggest that ICF45 is a highly conserved novel protein, which is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and seemed to be involved in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation.

After effectively silencing the ICF45 by RNAi, the growth and proliferation of the cells were significantly inhibited, and p53 was detected to be up-regulated. The silencing of ICF45 also resulted in an appearance of polycentrosome and multinuclear cells, which finally went to apoptosis. Our results suggest that ICF45 is a highly conserved novel protein, which is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and seemed to be involved in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. In the past a few decades, the autoantisera from patients with certain autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma polymyositis, have been a valuable and important resource for finding new proteins, including some well known proteins (1Pollard K.M.

The development of some newer techniques, such as RACE, 1The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PI, propidium iodide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; RT, reverse transcriptase; nt, nucleotide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EST, expressed sequence tag. GFP, and RNAi, has been dramatically speeding up the process of identifying new proteins and their function. Moreover, it is to be expected that some nontarget proteins might be caught during screening cDNA library with autoimmune patient sera, and some of these proteins could also be completely new and important. It was during our screening of HeLa cells from the cDNA expression library λEXlox with the autoantiserum EJ, which recognizes mammalian centromeres (8He D. Zeng C. Woods K. Zhong L. Turner D. Busch R.K. Brinkley B.R. Busch H. Chromosoma (Berlin). 1998; 107: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Watson M. Hally R.J. Mccue P.A. Varga J. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), when 11 positive clones were selected in the first round, and one of them was recognized as a centromere nonrelated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa. What interested us the most about the protein is that the presence of this novel protein was highly cell cycle-dependent. It exists specifically in interphase cells and cannot be seen in mitosis. More interestingly, this protein was found to centralize into 1 or 2 sharp dots near the nuclear membrane at the cytoplasmic site. It was thus named ICF45 (Interphase Cytoplasmic Foci protein 45 kDa). In this study, we investigated the cellular dynamic distribution of ICF45 by using GFP fusion protein, and we probed the possible role of ICF45 with RNAi. The results suggested that this novel protein ICF45 is an essential factor in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Antibodies—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The reagents used were Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen), G418 (Sigma), FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG, and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Oligonucleotides were synthesized from Takara. Autoantiserum EJ used for the cDNA library screening was from a patient with gastric antral vascular ectasia or watermelon stomach disease (12Watson M. Hally R.J. Mccue P.A. Varga J. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cloning of ICF45 cDNA—The positive cDNA clones were obtained by screening HeLa cells from the cDNA expression library λEXlox (Novagen) with EJ serum. The cDNA fragment was constructed into pEXlox plasmid by automatic subclone according to the manufacturer's instructions and was sequenced by Takara. The cDNA clone contained 130-1320 bp of full-length cDNA. The 5′ end of the transcript was derived from 5′-RACE by using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs for 5′-RACE were synthesized by RT-PCR from HeLa total RNA. The primers used for PCR were GSP1, 5′-CACCACGACTCTTCCGTCAAAGCCTG-3′ for first PCR amplification, and NGSP1, 5′-CTGGAGAGCACGGCTGTCATTGGGT-3′ for nest PCR. The PCR products were inserted into TA cloning vector (Takara) and sequenced. The 5′-RACE product contains 88-371 bp of full-length cDNA. The DNA sequence was compared with NCBI GenBank™ nonredundant, expressed sequence tag (EST) and the genome data base by using BLASTN. The protein sequence of ICF45 was used to search homologous proteins of identical and differential species in the NCBI/EMBL protein data base by BLASTP. Polyclonal Antibody Production—The entire encoding sequence of ICF45 was amplified by PCR using pEXlox-ICF45 recombination plasmid as a template and inserted into the BamHI site of pGEX-2Z (constructed by pGEX-2T), and the primers were 5′-CGCGGATCCTGGGGCGCCTGTAAA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCGCAAAAGGGTCAG-5′. The cDNA fragment was then cleaved with NdeI/XhoI enzymes from pGEX-2Z-ICF45 and ligated into the same sites of pET-30a (Novagen). The protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLyE induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After purification, the protein was used to immunize rabbits. The specific antibodies were further affinity-purified with prokaryote expression protein coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose-4B (Amersham Biosciences). Semiquantification of RT-PCR—Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR of various human tissues was conducted by using Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels (Clontech). The primers used were 5′-CACCAGTACAAGCCCAAGGGAGATTACA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCGCAAAAGGGTCAG-3′, corresponding to 725-752 and 1020-1033 bp of ICF45 cDNA. The PCR was carried out at 94 °C for 20 s, 68 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s using 0.4 μm primer per reaction for 30 cycles. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control. Construction and Transient Transfection of Fusion Protein Expression Plasmids—GFP-ICF45 and HA-ICF45 fusion protein mammalian expression vectors were constructed by cleaving cDNA fragment ICF45 from pGEX-2Z-ICF45 with BamHI and ligating into the same sites of pEGFP-C1 and pCMV5-HA vectors (gifts from Dr. Yeguang Chen) separately and were confirmed by sequencing. The ICF45-GFP expression vector was constructed by PCR amplification of the entire encoding sequence of ICF45 by using pEXlox-ICF45 as a template and subcloning into PstI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2. This was confirmed by sequencing. The primers were 5′-ATACTGCAGCGCCACCATGTGGGGCGCCTGTA-3′ and 5′-GCGCGGATCCTTTTGAGCTGTCTTCATCTAG-3′. The vectors were transiently transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Forty eight hours after transfection, GFP fusion protein expression cells were directly observed with an Olympus laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV300). HA fusion protein expression cells were fixed with methanol for immunostaining. Construction of Hairpin siRNA Expression Vector—Two sequences of the type AA (N19) from the ICF45 mRNA 224-242 and 498-516 bp were selected to construct hairpin siRNA expression vector. In the second fragment (498-516 bp), one nucleotide was designed for mutation (Fig. 5A). The selected sequences were compared with the human genome data base and EST data base to ensure that only the ICF45 gene was targeted. To design the hairpin siRNA insert, we specified a 19-nt sequence derived from the transcript, separated by a 9-nt spacer from the reverse complement of the same 19-nt sequence. The hairpin siRNA sequences were synthesized as two complementary DNA oligonucleotides, annealed and ligated into SalI/SacII sites of pAVU6 + 27 (13Paul C.P. Good P.D. Winer I. Engelke D.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and sequenced. The resulting transcript was predicted to form a 19-bp stem-loop structure (Fig. 7A). Construction of Cell Lines with Stable Silencing of ICF45—Recombinant DNA construction pAVU6 + 27-ICF45 and empty vector pAVU6 + 27 were transfected into HeLa cells by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen), and then the transfected cells was selected with G418 (450 μg/ml) for 14 days. Clones were selected and identified for stable silencing of ICF45. Then these cells were fixed for immunostaining and extracted for immunoblotting. Cells Growth Curve—Stable RNAi cells and control cells were seeded in a 24-well plate with 1 × 104 cells in each well and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2. Three wells of cells from each group were harvested every day for up to 8 days, and the number of cells was counted by using a hemocytometer. Flow Cytometry—Stable RNAi cells and control cells were trypsinized and washed three times with cold PBS and were then fixed with 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. After RNase digestion for 30 min at 37 °C, PI was added in a final concentration of 65 μg/ml, and a flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACS Calibur (Coulter EPICS XL). Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE. After the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, the proteins were probed with anti-ICF45-specific antibodies (1:100). The membrane was developed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega). Immunostaining—Cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 8 min or fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 at room temperature for a further 10 min. After washing three times with PBS and blocking for 30 min in a blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS), the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used are as follows: affinity-purified rabbit anti-ICF45-specific antibody (1:10), mouse anti-γ-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma), rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma), rabbit anti-Centrin-specific antibody (1:100, produced by our laboratory), mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:200, Sigma), and mouse anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The cells were washed three times for 10 min each in PBS followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with the second antibody. The second antibodies used were FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:100 dilution) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) (all the four antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were then washed three times with PBS and/or followed by counterstaining with propidium iodide (PI) (Molecular Probes) and mounted antifade solution. Samples were observed with Olympus laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview FV300). Identification and Characterization of ICF45 Gene—We obtained 11 positive clones by screening HeLa cells from the cDNA expression library λEXlox with EJ serum from an autoimmune patient, and the cDNA fragments were constructed into pEXlox vector and sequenced. Then the 11 sequences were searched against the EST and GenBank™ nonredundant data bases using BLASTN, and one of the 11 clones was identified as a novel gene. We later named it the ICF45 gene. The cDNA of the ICF45 contains a polyadenylation signal consensus sequence (ATAAA) (14Sheets M. Ogg S. Wickens M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 18: 5799-5805Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For determining the complete cDNA and the translation initiation site of the ICF45 transcript, we used the 5′-RACE method, and we obtained a 283-bp fragment. The RACE product was further used to search the human EST data base using BLASTN, and we obtained an EST clone (GenBank™ accession number N72931). We aligned these sequences of the original cDNA fragment 130-1320 bp from the cDNA library, the 5′-RACE product 88-371 bp, the new EST clone 1-289 bp, and the human genome data base with Vector NTI 6.0 software, and we finally obtained the complete ICF45 cDNA sequence. The complete ICF45 cDNA has 1320 bp and encodes a 298-amino acid polypeptide (Fig. 1). Its theoretical pI is 8.12, and the predicted molecular mass is 34.8 kDa (predicted by PeptideMass) (15Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of ICF45 by Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (smart.embl-heidelberg.de) (16Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar, 17Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) revealed an unknown conserved function domain DUF549 (Pfam accession number PF04446). In addition, two potential N-glycosylation sites (underlined in Fig. 1), a tyrosine sulfation site, three cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, three protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, four casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, two N-myristoylation sites (boxed in Fig. 1), and an amidation site were suggested by searching the PROSITE data base (18Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). High Conservation of ICF45 in Eukaryotes—To investigate the homologous proteins of ICF45 in other species, a BLAST search of the NCBI/EMBL protein data base nonredundant with the ICF45 protein sequence was performed and revealed the existence of a series of ICF45 homologs from yeast to human. However, these homologs were all hypothetical proteins predicated (with no experimental evidence) from corresponding cDNA sequences. These homologous proteins were mouse AK010876 with identities of 89% (GenBank™ accession number BAB27240); Drosophila melanogaster BG:DS00929 with identities of 55% (GenBank™ accession number AAF44908); Anopheles gambiae st. PEST agCP9855 with identities of 52% (GenBank™ accession number EAA00037); Arabidopsis thaliana AC005700 with identities of 49% (GenBank™ accession number AAC69945); Saccharomyces cerevisiae RGR024C with identities of 52% (GenBank™ accession number CAA97007); Schizosaccharomyces pombe with identities of 49% (GenBank™ accession number CAB40011); Plasmodium yoelii yoelii with identities of 48% (GenBank™ accession number EAA21470); and Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 with identities of 47% (GenBank™ accession number CAD50977). These hypothetical proteins were highly homologous with human ICF45. In S. cerevisiae, homolog of ICF45, the hypothetical protein RGR024C was essential for cell viability, as deleting the gene from the genome rendered the yeast unviable (19Giaever G. Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K. Andre B. Arkin A.P. Astromoff A. El-Bakkoury M. Bangham R. Benito R. Brachat S. Campanaro S. Curtiss M. Davis K.

Johnston M. Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). This result suggests that ICF45 might play an important role in the growth and proliferation in most eukaryotic cells. Tissue-specific Distribution of ICF45 mRNA—To determine the transcriptional levels of the human ICF45 gene in various tissues, a human multiple tissues cDNA panel (Clontech) was used for the quantification (Fig. 2A). The primers used were designed to amplify the 309-bp fragment (725-1033 bp). The ICF45 transcripts were detected in various tissues except in the brain, and the most abundant transcript was found in the liver and lung, and it was relatively abundantly expressed in the heart and placenta. However, it was weakly expressed in skeletal muscle and the pancreas, and its expression in kidney tissue was barely detectable. All these differences were confirmed by the comparison with the RT-PCR of the housekeeping enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as the reference. Characterization of ICF45 Protein Expression—The entire encoding sequence of ICF45 was subcloned into pGEX-2Z and pET-30a expression vectors and induced to express in Escherichia coli. The prokaryote expression protein all came into the inclusion body. The inclusion bodies were then further purified and used to immunize rabbits to produce anti-ICF45-specific antibodies. To characterize this novel protein in eukaryotic cells, the total protein extracts of HeLa cells and prokaryote expressed protein were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-ICF45-specific antibodies and control of preimmune rabbit serum. The results revealed that the ICF45 protein in eukaryote form and prokaryote form migrates on SDS-PAGE differently and yields the apparent molecular masses of about 45 and 34 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B). The full-length cDNA of ICF45 encoded 298 Aa with a predicted molecular mass of 34.7 kDa. The ∼10-kDa difference between the observed and predicted molecular mass was most probably because of post-translation modification, such as multiphosphorylation, N-glycosylation, or N-myristoylation. Such modifications have been predicted by protein sequence analysis and speculated to slow down the mobility of ICF45 and increase its apparent molecular mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Subcellular Localization of ICF45—To determine the subcellular location of ICF45, an indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed with the affinity-purified anti-ICF45 antibodies in HeLa cells. The results showed that the novel protein ICF45 centralized into a 1-2 sharp dot pattern in cytoplasm (Fig. 3A), and these cells were all in interphase. The number of cells containing one dot protein was 58.6 ± 3.4% and with two dots was 40.6 ± 3.3%. For the latter, the two dots in many cells were inter-connected and seemed to be dividing from one dot into two separate dots. This observation was further confirmed with the GFP-ICF45 and ICF45-GFP assay that allowed us to get more dynamic information on its subcellular distribution (Fig. 3B). A very small number of cells contained no dots or more than two dots. It was clearly shown that ICF45 presented a cell cycle-dependent expression fashion. It was specifically expressed in interphase, located close to the nuclear envelope, and was followed by its disappearance when cells reached mitosis (Fig. 3A). The cell cycle expression of ICF45 implied that ICF45 might play an active role in cell cycle progression. To determine further the subcellular localization and dynamic distribution of ICF45 in living cells, GFP-ICF45 and ICF45-GFP were transfected and expressed separately in HeLa cells. After transient transfection for 24-48 h, GFP fusion proteins had been richly expressed in cells and showed green fluorescent dots and centralized into bright 1-2 dots in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). The two GFP fusion proteins displayed a clear dynamic process of the “division” of ICF45-rich dot structure. At first, a single dot emerged in the most transfected cells, and as the division began, the resulting two dots demonstrated a connection to each other (Fig. 3B), and finally became two well separated or widely separated dots, whereas their position remained close to the nuclear membrane. After the cells came into mitosis, the green fluorescent dots of GFP-ICF45 and ICF45-GFP began to fade out quickly. The dynamic distribution patterns of ICF45 ligated to C-terminal and N-terminal ends of GFP in HeLa cells were basically the same. The only known cellular structure that displays a more or less similar structure is the centrosomes, which show 1-2 dot patterns in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). To analyze the relation of ICF45 and centrosome, double immunostaining was performed with anti-γ-tubulin and anti-ICF45 antibodies. In interphase cells, the localization of ICF45 was close to the centrosomes, but was usually significantly larger than the latter (Fig. 4A). In some cells, ICF45 was found co-localized with centrosomes (Fig. 4A), and the proportion of cells displaying co-localization of ICF45 and centrosome was 4.8 ± 0.4% of total cells, and this result was further testified by tracing the dynamic distribution of GFP-ICF45 combined with anti-γ-tubulin immunostaining at chosen time points (Fig. 4B). In the cells that contain a single centrosome (a sign of G1 or early S phase), GFP-ICF45 mostly appeared as one dot or a pair of closely connected dots and adjacent to the centrosomes. When centrosomes were divided (showing the cells are in late S or G2 phase), GFP-ICF45 also revealed two separate dots in most cages. When centrosomes moved to the two poles of the cells, which marked when the cells came into mitosis, the green fluorescent dot of GFP-ICF45 began to disappear. The results suggest that GFP-ICF45 presented typical cell cycle-dependent dynamics and showed a coordinate relation with the centrosome, which is far from random or by accident. HA-tagged ICF45 fusion protein was used in a similar experiment to localize ICF45 in HeLa cells since HA-ICF45 seems more close to the native protein in size compared with the GFP fusion protein. The results were as expected, except for some cells, where HA-ICF45 was overexpressed, and it displayed a larger speckle near the nuclear membrane (Fig. 3C). In many cells, the two dots of HA-ICF45 were found very close and inter-connective to each other, suggesting the HA fusion protein is capable of carrying out the “normal” functions in division and redistribution. Cell Growth and Proliferation Was Inhibited after Silencing of ICF45—By transfecting the pAVU6 + 27-ICF45 hairpin siRNA expression vector into HeLa cells, we obtained a clonal cell line in which ICF45 was stably silenced by G418 selection and was identified with anti-ICF45-specific antibodies; shown in Fig. 5, B and D, the hairpin fragment was 224-242 bp of ICF45, but a control vector clonal cell line and the second hairpin fragment of 498-516 bp had no specific silencing response. In the cell line of stable silencing of ICF45, the cell morphology had dramatic changes and formed large numbers of aberrant cells. The cells became much larger and contained multiple nuclei (Fig. 5C). The cell number was 15.1 ± 1.9% of total cells, and the control cells were 0.8 ± 0.3%. Cell growth and proliferation of the stable ICF45 knock down cells were greatly inhibited by the cell growth curve (Fig. 5E), and by the 5th day, the growth speed of the control cell line was 10 times higher than the RNAi cell line, and many cells were found to have stopped growing and became quiescent. Polycentrosomal and Multinuclear Cells Formed after Silencing of ICF45—To find out whether centrosomes also had changes in the stable silencing of the ICF45 cell line, immunostaining analysis was performed with anti-γ-tubulin and anti-centrin-specific antibodies. Many cells displayed an overduplication of centrosomes, and this resulted in polycentrosomal morphology (Fig. 6, A and B). The proportion of multicentrosome cells was about the same as that of multinuclear cells, i.e. 15.7 ± 1.6%, and this proportion in the control cells was 0.8 ± 0.3%. Further immunostaining assay with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibodies also showed a dramatic change in spindle structure and organization (Fig. 6B), and for the resulting multipole mitotic spindles (Fig. 6C), the proportion of abnormal spindle cells was 19.2 ± 2.6% in total mitosis cells and 1.0 ± 0.3% in control cells. The multipole spindles and the failure after cytokinesis seemed to be the reason for the formation of many coenocytes. Furthermore, these large multinuclear cells were found to stop growing; their DNA began to condense and fragmentize, and finally they went to apoptosis (Fig. 6A). In these apoptotic multinuclear cells, centrosomes became smaller and distinctly diminished (Fig. 6A), which indicated that cell apoptosis resulted in the cessation of centrosome duplication and the diminishment of the centrosomes themselves. Silencing of ICF45 Causes p53 Up-regulation—The expression of p53 as one of the major candidate factors that may influence the apoptosis susceptibility was observed in the stable transfected cell line by Western blot and anti-p53 immunostaining. The Western blot showed that p53 was prominently up-regulated (Fig. 5G), and this up-regulation was extremely obvious in the abnormal multinuclear cells as shown by immunostaining (data not shown). Flow cytometry also showed the apoptotic rate of ICF45 stable silenced cells increased to 5.2 ± 0.2% from 0.7 ± 0.2% of the control cells (Fig. 5F). In time, an increasing number of the multinuclear cells showed classic signs of apoptosis such as shrinking cytoplasm, membrane blebbing (data not shown), and chromatin condensation (Fig. 6A), and finally cells detached from the culture substrate. In the present study we report the identification of a novel cytoplasm protein by screening the cDNA expression library for HeLa cells with EJ serum from an autoimmune patient with the rare disease gastric antral vascular ectasia (12Watson M. Hally R.J. Mccue P.A. Varga J. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our original goal was to clone the gene of a constitutive centromere protein CENP-G, which was recognized by this serum (8He D. Zeng C. Woods K. Zhong L. Turner D. Busch R.K. Brinkley B.R. Busch H. Chromosoma (Berlin). 1998; 107: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During the early rounds of this screening, we harvested many positive clones including some nontarget novel genes. As we checked these new genes, one of them attracted our attention because of its unique distribution and its specific cell cycle-dependent expression. We later named it ICF45. This new gene showed no significant similarities to any known gene in the BLAST NCBI/EMBL data base. It has been found that several unknown homologous mRNA sequences are presented in the EST data base. As all these sequences were incomplete and had no certain translation initiation sites, it was necessary to use the 5′-RACE and bioinformation methods to determinate the 5′ end of ICF45 transcription and to obtain the full-length cDNA of ICF45. Using the protein sequence of ICF45 to search the NCBI/EMBL protein data base revealed that its homologous proteins exist in many eukaryote species from yeast to human. Although these were hypothetical proteins (with no experimental evidence), this high evolutionary conservation implies that ICF45 may have an important function. Indeed, the experimental deletion of the homologous gene from yeast revealed it serves as an essential factor for yeast proliferation and viability (19Giaever G. Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K. Andre B. Arkin A.P. Astromoff A. El-Bakkoury M. Bangham R. Benito R. Brachat S. Campanaro S. Curtiss M. Davis K. Deutschbauer A. Entian K.D.

Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). This was also confirmed in our present observation that human cell growth and proliferation were strongly inhibited after silencing of ICF45 (Fig. 5E). The protein sequence analysis of ICF45 predicts that it has a molecular mass of 34.7 kDa, which is quite different from the apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE. ICF45 was also predicted to have two N-glycosylation sites and some other modification sites (Fig. 1). These possible post-translation modifications might explain in part the difference between the predicted and apparent molecular mass, and the predicted multiphosphorylation sites most likely could be involved in the cell cycle regulation functions such as described here. The unique localization of ICF45 is one of the most exciting aspects that require further study. The predicted subcellular localization of ICF45 by TargetP version 1.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP) (20Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. Heijne G.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar) was to mitochondria (probability 68.2%), the secretory pathway (7.1%), and others (25.5%). However, our immunostaining analysis with anti-ICF45-specific antibodies showed 1-2 sharp and round dots near the nuclear membrane in the cytoplasm, which only presents in interphase and is lacking in mitosis (Fig. 3A). The dynamic distribution visualized using both GFP C-terminal and N-terminal ICF45 fusion proteins obtained the same result (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that neither the N nor the C terminus of ICF45 had any effect on the distribution of ICF45. The key domain affecting the subcellular localization should be in the middle of the ICF45 protein sequence. Such a distinct and highly centralized distribution of ICF45 strongly suggests some kind of corresponding subcellular structure or some solid and huge molecular complexes. It has been widely believed that because the electron microscope was intensively used, every cellular organelle had been discovered. Indeed, during last few decades, there were few new structures added to the list. One of them is the coiled body, which was also first detected by auto-antiserum, and most interestingly, it was also recognized as a few (∼1-6 dots) round dots, which appeared in interphase cells and disappeared in mitosis as ICF45, but only inside nucleus (21Andrade L.E.C. Chan E.K.L. Raska I. Peebles C.L. Roos G. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1407-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is particularly exciting and challenging that to our knowledge there is no organelle that could correspond to the ICF45 distribution pattern. We did some gold immunoelectron-microscopic experiments, and we failed to resolve any detectable ultrastructure behind the gold labeling (data not shown). The extensive analysis of the interacting partners of ICF45 is still ongoing in our laboratory in order to determine its possible structure or molecular complex. Another obvious characteristic of ICF45 is the cell cycle-dependent manner of its expression. Here we provide some observations showing that ICF45 could also play an active role in cell cycle regulation. After stable silencing of ICF45 by RNAi, cell growth and proliferation were strongly inhibited (Fig. 5E); the inter-dependence of growth in the cells was greatly increased, and cells became unable to grow in soft agar. Furthermore, silencing of ICF45 induced wide morphological changes, including an increase in the cell volume and the emergence of multinuclear cells (about 15.1 ± 1.9% of total cells) that contained 2-10 nuclei in one cell (Fig. 5C and Fig. 6A). This shows that the cell cycle progression was not only inhibited but also seriously disrupted in more than one aspect. Most interestingly, ICF45 showed a close but unclear relationship with the centrosome. First, the subcellular distribution pattern of ICF45 was very similar to that of the centrosome (Fig. 4). The location of ICF45 was often found adjacent to the centrosomes, and in some cases, they were co-localized, the proportion was 4.8 ± 0.4% in total cells (Fig. 4). Recently, research has suggested that the centrosome plays active roles not only in microtubule nucleation but also in the cell cycle regulation (22Lange B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Centrosome duplication must occur in coordination with other cell cycle events, mainly DNA synthesis (23Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Abrogation of the regulation that coordinates centrosome and DNA duplication will likely increase the frequency of centrosome hyperamplification and lead to cytokinesis failure (24Brinkley B.R. Geopfert T.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the silencing of ICF45 causes polycentrosome cells, followed by multipole spindles (Fig. 6C), and finally results in the formation of coenocytes (Fig. 5C and Fig. 6A) which is probably due to cytokinesis failure. There are two possible ways by which ICF45 could affect the cell cycle and centrosomes. ICF45 could regulate cell cycle progression, which in turn affects centrosome function, and vice versa. Because we have detected a strong up-regulation of p53, and cell growth and proliferation were effectively inhibited in all cells, whereas the polycentrosomes accumulate in a part of the cell population, we think ICF45 may first influence the cell cycle regulation and further affect the centrosome cycle. At the same time, p53 elevation could also be responsible for the increase of apoptotic rate seen in the RNAi cells as suggested by many earlier reports (25Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In summary, our research has identified a novel cytoplasm protein, ICF45, a novel and conservative protein with unusual subcellular localization and cell cycle dynamics. It may represent a new group of proteins, and its investigation could probably provide a new connection among centrosome, nuclear dividing, and cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2068877274,"The identification of the epitopes recognized by autoantibodies against cytochrome P450s (CYPs) associated with drug-induced hepatotoxicity is difficult because of their conformational nature. In the present investigation, we used a novel approach based on the analysis of the whole molecule antigenic capacity following single amino acid substitutions to identify the conformational epitopes on CYP2E1. A molecular model of CYP2E1 was generated based on the CYP2C5 crystal structure, and potential motifs for amino acid exchanges were selected by computer simulation in the surface of alpha helices and beta sheets. Fourteen modified, apparently correctly folded CYP2E1 variants were produced in Escherichia coli and evaluated in immunoprecipitation experiments using sera with anti-CYP2E1 autoreactivity from 10 patients with halothane hepatitis and 12 patients with alcoholic liver disease. Ala substitution of Glu-248 and Lys-251 as well as of Lys-324, Lys-342, Lys-420, and Phe-421 severely decreased or abolished CYP2E1 recognition by the majority of both the halothane hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease sera, whereas the other substitutions had only minor effects. Based on the structural model, these substitutions identified two distinct epitopes on the CYP2E1 surface corresponding to the G-helix and an area formed by juxtaposition of the J' and K'' helices, respectively. The combined use of molecular modeling and single amino acid mutagenesis is thus a useful approach for the characterization of conformational epitopes recognized by autoantibodies."

Subsequent electron transfer from FADH2 to a nonflavin redox center, located on the si face of the FAD, is also a common feature of these enzymes. An exception is STH, which appears to lack a nonflavin redox center. The nature of the nonflavin redox center varies, and three types have been identified (1Argyrou A. Blanchard J.S. Prog.

LipDH, GR, trypanothione reductase, and mycothione reductase form a subgroup (Group 1) of the FDR enzyme family (1Argyrou A. Blanchard J.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 89-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of these proteins align well with one another along the entire polypeptide chain of ∼50 kDa. Particularly noteworthy are the following four signature motifs (Fig. 1A). Two heptapeptide sequence motifs (GXGXXG), one at the N terminus and the other roughly in the middle of the polypeptide chain, are involved in recognizing the ADP portion of the FAD and pyridine nucleotide, respectively (9Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). The nonflavin redox center is an enzymic redox-active disulfide, which is invariably present in a CXXXXC motif and located near the N terminus of the polypeptide chain, whereas an essential His-Glu pair (HXXXXE), located at the C terminus of the adjacent monomer of the homodimeric enzyme, comprises the final motif (1Argyrou A.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome encodes five open reading frames with significant amino acid sequence identity to the Group 1 FDR enzymes (Fig. 1A).

The sth (Rv2713) gene product bears high sequence identity (∼42%) with several well characterized STHs (12Rydstrom J. Hoek J.B. Ernster L. Boyer, P. D. The Enzymes. XIII.

The lpdA (Rv3303c) and lpdB (Rv0794c) genes were annotated as probable LipDHs based on sequence homology to LipDHs from other organisms (15Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill T.G. Churcher C. Harris D.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6473) Google Scholar). Although both lpdA and lpdB contain FAD and pyridine nucleotide binding motifs, they both lack essential catalytic residues known to be critical for LipDH catalysis. Specifically, lpdA lacks one of two cysteine residues that comprise the enzymic redox-active disulfide and involved in dithiol-disulfide interchange with lipoyl substrates (16Hopkins N. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11766-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Hopkins N. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11757-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as well as the His-Glu pair involved in general acid catalysis (18Benen J. van Berkel W. Dieteren N. Arscott D. Williams Jr., C. Veeger C. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and lpdB lacks the His residue. Therefore, neither lpdA nor lpdB are expected to have LipDH activity. In this report, we describe the cloning, expression in Escherichia coli, and purification of the LpdA protein. We show that, even though LpdA cannot catalyze reduction of disulfide-bonded substrates, including lipoamide, lipoic acid, glutathione, cystine, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), or 4,4′-dithiodipyridine, it catalyzes the reduction of nonspecific electron acceptors such as 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ) and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone (5-HNQ). We additionally crystallized and solved the three-dimensional crystal structure of LpdA in complex with FAD. The structure confirmed the absence of a redox-active disulfide and of a His-Glu pair in the active site and rationalizes the inability of this enzyme to catalyze reduction of disulfide-bonded substrates. We also show that LpdA co-purifies, not only with a tightly bound FAD, but with a tightly bound NADP+ per monomer as well. The kinetic consequences resulting from the tight binding of NADP+ to the enzyme are also described. Materials—dl-Lipoamide, dl-lipoic acid, NADH, NADPH, NAD+, NADP+, thio-NAD+, ATP, Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (type XXIV), Neurospora crassa NAD+ nucleosidase, Thermoplasma acidophilum glucose dehydrogenase, and yeast hexokinase (type C-300) were from Sigma. 5-HNQ, DMBQ, and d-(+)-glucose-1-d (97% atom D) were from Aldrich. All restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase were obtained from New England Biolabs. General Methods—Solution pH values were measured at 25 °C with an Accumet® model 20 pH meter and Accumet® combination electrode standardized at pH 7.00 and 4.00 or 10.00. Protein purification was performed at 4 °C using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Column chromatography of small molecules was performed at room temperature on a Hewlett Packard 1100 HPLC system equipped with a UV-visible absorbance detector. Spectrophotometric assays were performed using a UVIKON XL double beam UV-visible spectrophotometer (BIO-TEK Instruments). Cloning and Expression of M. tuberculosis LpdA—The lpdA gene (Rv3303c) from M. tuberculosis was amplified by PCR to generate blunt-ended DNA with NdeI and XhoI restriction sites at the ends. The oligonucleotide primers were: 5′-ATTCCATATGGTGACCCGCATCGTGATCC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTTACTCGTCGGTAGGTGGTG-3′. The amplified DNA product was ligated into the pCR®-Blunt plasmid and transformed into One Shot™ TOP10 cells following the instructions supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA isolated from these cells was then digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the purified insert was ligated into purified plasmid pET-23a(+) (Novagen) previously linearized with the same restriction enzymes. Cloning into these restriction sites adds a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of LpdA. This recombinant plasmid was then transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The BL21(DE3) cells containing pET23a(+):lpdA were grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.7 in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were then cooled to 16 °C, temperature was equilibrated for 2 h, and induction of protein expression by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was allowed to proceed for 36 h at 16 °C. DNA sequencing of the cloned lpdA gene showed that it was free of mutations. Purification of the LpdA Protein—All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cell paste (43 g) was suspended in 40 ml of 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, containing two tablets of Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 15 mg of chicken egg white lysozyme (Sigma), 6 mg of bovine pancreas DNaseI (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm MgCl2, and stirred for 30 min. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was dialyzed for 4 h against 4 liters of 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, and the precipitate, which formed during dialysis, was removed by centrifugation as above. The dialysate (75 ml) was applied to a 50-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His·Bind Superflow (Novagen) equilibrated with 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8 (Buffer A), containing 0.3 m NaCl. The column was washed with 150 ml of the same buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient (200 ml) from 0 to 0.25 m imidazole in Buffer A also containing 0.3 m NaCl. The yellow fractions containing the LpdA protein were pooled, dialyzed against 4 liters of Buffer A for 5 h, and applied to a 25-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A, and eluted with a linear gradient (200 ml) from 0 to 0.6 m NaCl in Buffer A. The fractions containing the LpdA protein, which eluted at ∼0.3–0.4 m NaCl, were pooled, concentrated down to ∼5 ml, and applied to a 320-ml calibrated HiTrap Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The LpdA protein eluted at the volume calculated for a tetramer. The fractions containing the LpdA protein were pooled, concentrated down to 25 mg ml-1 (∼2.8 ml), and dialyzed against two changes of 4 liters of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Half of the protein was used to set up crystallization trays (see below), whereas the remainder was frozen at –70 °C in 50% glycerol. Approximately 70 mg of purified LpdA was obtained from 43 g of cell paste. Determination of Protein Concentration—The enzyme concentration was determined from ϵ458 nm = 12,000 m-1cm-1 for native LpdA, and turnover numbers were based on enzyme monomers. This value of the extinction coefficient was determined by normalizing the absorbance of the FAD cofactor at 450 nm (ϵ = 11,300 m-1cm-1) (19Macheroux P. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Methods Mol. Biol.131. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 1-7Google Scholar) of 1% SDS-denatured LpdA to that at 458 nm of native LpdA. The concentration of enzyme determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard agrees favorably (only 20% higher) with the value obtained using the above experimentally determined extinction coefficient, suggesting that the majority of the enzyme co-purifies with FAD bound. Crystallization of LpdA and Data Collection—Crystals of LpdA were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were grown at room temperature from 5-μl drops containing 3 μl of protein solution (25 mg ml-1 in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and 2 μl of precipitant solution (0.1 m trisodium citrate, pH 5.4–5.8, 2.5–5.0% polyethylene glycol 6000). Crystals appeared in 3 (low pH) to 7 (high pH) days. Crystals were immersed in a solution of 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm MES, pH 5.75, and 25% glycerol prior to vitrification by immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were measured at 75 K using an in-house Rigaku R-Axis IV++ image plate detector and RU-H34 rotating anode x-ray generator equipped with Osmic Blue Optics and operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. All data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (20, Otwinowski, Z. (1993) Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United KingdomGoogle Scholar). The LpdA crystals belong to space group R32 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 244.2 Å, c = 104.8 Å, and there are two monomers per asymmetric unit yielding a solvent content of 58% (Table I).Table IData collection statistics Figure of merit (50–2.8Å) = 0.50; cosine of the error in phase.Data setNativeKAu(CN)2PtCl6aData sets that have unseable anomalous signal, and data statistics are listed with unmerged Bijvoet valuesHgCl2aData sets that have unseable anomalous signal, and data statistics are listed with unmerged Bijvoet valuesTMLAaData sets that have unseable anomalous signal, and data statistics are listed with unmerged Bijvoet valuesConcentration42 mm15 mm2.5 mm100 mmSoak time10 min10 min5 min10 minResolution range (Å)50–2.850–2.850–2.850–2.850–2.8Unique reflections29,13625,83950,18851,88247,544Completeness (%)bData in parentheses are for the highest resolution bins99.8 (99.7)87.4 (67.6)87.9 (66.3)91.7 (77.1)83.3 (66.0)RedundancybData in parentheses are for the highest resolution bins8.6 (6.8)2.6 (1.7)2.0 (1.5)2.2 (1.7)2.5 (1.9)I/σ(I)bData in parentheses are for the highest resolution bins18.3 (5.1)13.5 (2.4)9.3 (2.6)9.5 (3.9)11.0 (3.7)RsymbData in parentheses are for the highest resolution bins10.2 (25.0)6.0 (17.3)5.9 (16.2)5.6 (13.0)5.6 (13.4)No. of sites3356Phasing power (centric/acentric)cPhasing power = 〈FH〉/E, where FH is the root mean square heavy-atom structure factor amplitude, and E is the residual lack of closure error0.55/0.570.82/0.800.77/0.840.61/0.73a Data sets that have unseable anomalous signal, and data statistics are listed with unmerged Bijvoet valuesb Data in parentheses are for the highest resolution binsc Phasing power = 〈FH〉/E, where FH is the root mean square heavy-atom structure factor amplitude, and E is the residual lack of closure error Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The “quick soak” method (21Sun P.D.

Refinement of the heavy atom parameters, phase calculation, and solvent flattening were carried out with the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The anomalous signal from the lead, mercury, and platinum data was also used in the phasing and improved the resultant electron density maps. Features within the initial SOLVE/RESOLVE MIRAS electron density map were used to determine the noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry operator relating the two monomers per asymmetric unit. The SOLVE/RESOLVE MIRAS map was 2-fold-averaged and the auto-fitting program MAID (23Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used to get a start on the building of the LpdA model. Due to the limiting resolution (2.8 Å), a fair proportion of the structure was built manually within the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation followed by ultrafiltration of the yellow solution using an YM10 membrane (Millipore). The pH was then adjusted to 8.0 by adding 25 μl of a 1 m Tris base solution. Aliquots (200 μl) were either: 1) untreated, 2) treated with 0.05 unit/μl CIP for 30 min, 3) treated with 0.03 unit/μl T. acidophilum glucose dehydrogenase in the presence of 20 mm d-(+)-glucose for 30 min, or 4) treated with glucose dehydrogenase in the presence of d-(+)-glucose for 30 min, followed by treatment with CIP for an additional 30 min. After removal of the enzymes by ultrafiltration using an YM10 membrane as above, aliquots (100 μl) were applied to a 1 ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and analyzed by HPLC. After an 8-ml wash with the same buffer, the bound cofactors were eluted with a linear gradient (30 ml) from 0 to 0.3 m NaCl in the same buffer. The pyridine nucleotides and FAD standards were prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and were standardized as described below. Synthesis of 2′-Phospho-ADP-Ribose—2′-Phospho-ADP-ribose was prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis of NADP+ with N. crassa NAD+ nucleosidase. 8 mg of NADP+ was dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. N. crassa NAD+ nucleosidase (0.7 unit) was then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for ∼16 h. The reaction, after removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration using an YM10 membrane (Millipore), was then applied to an 18 ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m ammonium bicarbonate. The fractions containing 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose, which eluted at 0.3–0.35 m ammonium bicarbonate, were pooled. Excess ammonium bicarbonate was removed by repeatedly (three times) lyophilizing and re-dissolving the residue in water. Standardization of Aqueous Solutions of Cofactors, Substrates, and Inhibitors of LpdA—The concentration of aqueous solutions of the following molecules were determined spectrophotometrically: FAD, ϵ450 nm = 11300 m-1 cm-1 (19Macheroux P. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Methods Mol. Biol.131. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 1-7Google Scholar); NAD(P)H, ϵ340 nm = 6220 m-1 cm-1 (26Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and NAD(P)+, ϵ260 nm = 18000 m-1 cm-1 (27Siegel J.M. Montgomery G.A. Bock R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose were dephosphorylated completely using CIP, and the released inorganic phosphate was quantitated as described previously (28Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). This standardized solution gave ϵ260 nm = 18000 m-1 cm-1 for 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose, which is identical to that of NAD(P)+. Preparation of [4S-2H]NAD(P)H—[4S-2H]NAD(P)H was prepared by enzymatic reduction of the oxidized pyridine nucleotide with Leuconostoc mesenteroides (type XXIV) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase using [1-2H]glucose 6-phosphate as the deuterium source as described previously (29Ottolina G. Riva S. Carrea G. Danieli B. Buckmann A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 998: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). [4S-2H]NAD(P)H was purified on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (30Orr G.A. Blanchard J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the fractions with absorbance ratios A260 nm/A340 nm ≤ 2.3 were pooled. Assays for LpdA—All assays were performed at 25 °C under initial rate conditions. The NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of DMBQ and 5-HNQ catalyzed by LpdA was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ϵ = 6220 m-1 cm-1) (26Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) associated with the oxidation of NAD(P)H. Assays contained: 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 1% (v/v) acetonitrile (for quinones). For the inhibition experiments by NADP+ and 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose, assays also contained 20 mm EDTA. The reduction of thio-NAD+ was monitored at 398 nm (ϵ = 11900 m-1 cm-1) (31Stein A.M. Lee J.K. Anderson C.D. Anderson B.M. Biochemistry. 1963; 338: 1015-1017Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Stock solutions (50 mm) of DMBQ and 5-HNQ, which are water-insoluble, were made in acetonitrile. When NADH was used as reductant, the LpdA stock solution was pre-treated with CIP (see “Results”): 5 μm LpdA was incubated for 4 h on ice with 0.2 unit/μl CIP in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For the inhibition experiments by NADP+ and 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose, CIP was subsequently inhibited by the addition of 20 mm EDTA and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Data Analysis—Data were fitted using the nonlinear least squares curve-fitting programs of SigmaPlot 2000 for Windows version 6.00 (SPSS Inc.). Individual saturation curves were fitted to Equation 1,v=VA/(A+K)(Eq. 1) where V is the maximal velocity, A is the substrate concentration, and K is the Michaelis constant (Km). Data showing parallel initial velocity patterns on reciprocal plots were fitted to Equation 2,v=VAB/(KAB+KBA+AB)(Eq. 2) where A and B, and KA and KB, are the concentrations, and Michaelis constants, respectively, for the substrates. Data displaying competitive inhibition were fitted to Equation 3, where I is the inhibitor concentration and Ki is the inhibition constant in Equation 3.v=VA/[K(1+I/Ki)+A](Eq. 3) Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects were calculated from Equation 4,v=VA/[K(1+FiEV/K)+A(1+FiEV)](Eq. 4) where EV/K and EV are the isotope effects minus 1 on V/K and V, respectively, and Fi is the fraction of isotopic label.

https://openalex.org/W2103270517,"The [URE3] yeast prion is a self-propagating inactive form of the Ure2 protein. Ure2p is composed of two domains, residues 1–93, the prion-forming domain, and the remaining C-terminal part of the protein, which forms the functional domain involved in nitrogen catabolite repression. In vitro, Ure2p forms amyloid filaments that have been proposed to be the aggregated prion form found in vivo. Here we showed that the biochemical characteristics of these two species differ. Protease digestions of Ure2p filaments and soluble Ure2p are comparable when analyzed by Coomassie staining as by Western blot. However, this finding does not explain the pattern specifically observed in [URE3] strains. Antibodies raised against the C-terminal part of Ure2p revealed the existence of proteolysis sites efficiently cleaved when [URE3], but not wild-type crude extracts, were submitted to limited proteolysis. The same antibodies lead to an equivalent digestion pattern when recombinant Ure2p (either soluble or amyloid) was analyzed in the same way. These results strongly suggest that aggregated Ure2p in [URE3] yeast cells is different from the amyloid filaments generated in vitro.

These results strongly suggest that aggregated Ure2p in [URE3] yeast cells is different from the amyloid filaments generated in vitro. Prion proteins are misfolded proteins that propagate through their interaction with the normal (correctly folded) host protein. The prion concept, initially launched in 1967 (1Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and clearly established in 1982 (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar), is the result of several decades of studies related to mammalian transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The prion protein involved in this pathological process is PrP. The cellular isoform PrPc consists mainly of α-helices, whereas its pathological isoform PrPSc represents predominantly β-sheets (3Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). PrPSc is prone to aggregation and is protease-resistant. Only very recently, protease-resistant PrP aggregates generated in vitro have been reported to be infectious (4Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.B. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of the infectious agent remains unknown.The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains several proteins with prion-like properties (5Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 6Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Santoso A. Chien P. Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because the “prionization” mechanism has been conserved through evolution (8Bach S. Talarek N. Andrieu T. Vierfond J. Mettey Y. Galons H. Dormont D. Meijer L. Cullin C. Blondel M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), they are highly tractable models for studying the mechanisms of prion propagation. The most extensively studied yeast prion proteins are Ure2p and Sup35p, responsible for the [URE3] and [PSI] phenotypes, respectively. Ure2p is a regulator of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) 1The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; Usa, ureidosuccinate; PFD, prion-forming domain.1The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; Usa, ureidosuccinate; PFD, prion-forming domain. sensitive transcription in S. cerevisiae (9Drillien R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Drillien R. Aigle M. Lacroute F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the presence of a good nitrogen source (asparagine, ammonia, or glutamine) Ure2p complexes with the Gln3p transcription factor in the cytoplasm (11Cox K.H. Rai R. Distler M. Daugherty J.R. Coffman J.A. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), thus preventing the transcription of genes expressed upon nitrogen starvation. One of these genes is DAL5, which encodes a permease for ureidosuccinate (Usa) (13Turoscy V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2598-2600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the prion isoform of Ure2p is inactive, DAL5 is expressed in [URE3] cells, and the yeast are capable of importing Usa thus permitting the growth in selective medium (14Aigle M. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 136: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Sup35p is a component of the translation termination factor in S. cerevisiae (15Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I. Paushkin S.V. Nierras C.R. Cox B.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Tuite M.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4365-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). [PSI] prion causes partial read through of stop codons (16Cox B.S. Heredity. 1965; 20: 505-521Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These two proteins have an asparagine/glutamine-rich N-terminal domain, called the prion-forming domain (PFD), which is necessary and sufficient to propagate the prion state.The nature of the conformational changes between the cellular and the prion isoforms of these proteins was largely investigated but still remains unclear. The self-propagating species especially, called propagon, has not been yet characterized. A clear link exists between the yeast prion phenotype and the aggregation of the protein involved in this process. The [PSI] model is the most documented. In [PSI] yeast cells, Sup35p aggregates and is found in the pellet fraction in sedimentation assays (17Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 18Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The Sup35-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins form several foci in yeast cells that bear [PSI] (18Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sup35p forms amyloid fibrils in vitro (19Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 811-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), which are infectious and recapitulate all strain properties when introduced in yeast cells (20King C.Y. Diaz-Avalos R. Nature. 2004; 428: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 21Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar).Like Sup35p, Ure2p has similar properties of assembly into amyloid fibrils in vitro (22Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In a test tube, the N-terminal PFD connects each subunit and forms an amyloid filament backbone surrounded by the C-terminal moieties (23Baxa U. Taylor K.L. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Cheng N. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43717-43727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the role of aggregation in [URE3] prion propagation is controversial. Ure2-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins only form foci in [URE3] yeast cells (24Edskes H.K. Gray V.T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1498-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) under experimental conditions leading to the elimination of the prion (25Fernandez-Bellot E. Guillemet E. Ness F. Baudin-Baillieu A. Ripaud L. Tuite M. Cullin C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Fernandez-Bellot E. Guillemet E. Cullin C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3215-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Ripaud L. Maillet L. Cullin C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Otherwise the fluorescence remains diffuse. Sedimentation assays also led to contradictory results. Although Schlumpberger et al. (28Schlumpberger M. Prusiner S.B. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) observed increased aggregation in [URE3] cells, the only difference we noticed is a decrease in Ure2p concentration measured in a Western blot of a crude extract of the [URE3] strains(27Ripaud L. Maillet L. Cullin C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In this work we have investigated these discrepancies. We observed that Ure2p is actually aggregated in [URE3] cells. These aggregates behave differently from the Sup35p aggregates found in [PSI]-containing cells. The Ure2p aggregates are resistant to boiling in 2% SDS buffer and need strong denaturing agents to be detected on Western blots. We determined the amount of Ure2p required to give a wild-type phenotype and concluded that in [URE3] yeast cells, the aggregated protein should be inactive. We further characterized [URE3] aggregates by limited proteolysis using antibodies raised against the full-length protein. We could definitively confirm that Ure2p is not proteolyzed in the same way in [URE3] or in wild-type yeast cells. Next, we used antibodies raised against the C-terminal part of Ure2p to analyze the proteolyzed species. As the proteolysis pattern of Ure2p in [URE3] is not consistent with the amyloid pattern of Ure2p (23Baxa U. Taylor K.L. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Cheng N. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43717-43727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29Thual C. Bousset L. Komar A.A. Walter S. Buchner J. Cullin C. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1764-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we produced both soluble and amyloid Ure2p and compared their proteolysis pattern under the same experimental conditions. We concluded that the process in [URE3] leading to Ure2p aggregates differs from the process leading to amyloid fibers formed in a test tube.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—The following strains of S. cerevisiae were used in this study. CC30 genotype is trp1-1, ade2-1, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, Δura2::HIS3. The CC34 [URE3] strain is isogenic to CC30. The CC32 genotype is trp1-1, ade2-1, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, Δura2::HIS3, cyh2r, Δure2::CYH2. Yeast transformations were carried out as described previously (30Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Unless specified, yeasts were grown in YPD (1% bactoyeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, 2% dextrose, 20 mg/liter adenine). SD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose) was supplemented with 20 mg/liter adenine, 20 mg/liter tryptophan, and 60 mg/liter leucine. Either 20 mg/liter uracil or 15 mg/liter ureidosuccinate was added as specified in the text.The pYe2L-URE2 BamHI-HpaI fragment containing the URE2 open reading frame was cloned under the control of the TET-repressible promoter into pCM183 linearized with the same enzymes resulting in pCM183/URE2. URE2 open reading frame was PCR-amplified from pUHE-URE2 and cloned into pET3a resulting in pET3a-URE2. The His6 tag was PCR-amplified and inserted at the 3′-end of URE2 resulting in pET3a-URE2tagHIS.Antibodies Production and Purification—The AGTTPMSQSR-FFDYP peptide corresponding to the Ure2p sequence from amino acids 284 to 298 was synthesized with an additional cysteine at the N terminus end coupled to hemocyanin. Rabbit antiserum was affinity-purified, and the specificity of this antibody was checked. No signal was detected in cells expressing a Ure2 protein truncated from the C-terminal domain (data not shown).Protein Extraction, Sedimentation Analysis, and Western Blotting— Total yeast protein extracts were prepared by glass bead disruption in TnT buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Sedimentation analyses were performed as described previously (27Ripaud L. Maillet L. Cullin C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Samples were boiled for 5 min in 1× loading buffer (0.06 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Urea was added to an 8 m final concentration in all samples unless otherwise specified. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie or used in Western blots to transfer proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BA-S83, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with specific affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against full-length Ure2p, against an Ure2p peptide corresponding to amino acids 284 to 298, and against Pap1p or Ade13p. Polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies. Secondary antibody binding was detected with the SuperSignal reagent (Pierce) and the VersaDoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad). Signals were quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Limited Proteolysis—Protein extracts were prepared as described in TnT without protease inhibitors and clarified for 5 min at 1000 × g. 500 μg of yeast total protein extracts from CC30 and CC34 were diluted to 54 μlinTnT buffer, mixed with 6 μl of appropriate dilutions of proteinase K, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Digestion was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm. Sample buffer and urea (to a final concentration of 8 m) were added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Recombinant Ure2p was digested in the same way after a dilution of 60 μg of purified protein (soluble and amyloid fibrils) into 54 μlofTnT buffer. Alternatively 500 ng of amyloid fibrils were incubated in 500 μg of yeast total protein extracts from CC32 for 5 min before proteolysis.Ure2p Expression, Purification, and Fibril Formation—Ure2p-His6 was expressed from pET3a-URE2tagHIS in Escherichia coli BL21codon+DE3 strain (Stratagene) in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Induction was performed overnight at 18 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g. Ure2p-His6 was bound on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), washed extensively with buffer A, and eluted with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8). Imidazole was eliminated using a Sepharose G25 column (HiTrap desalting, Amersham Biosciences). The native conformation of soluble Ure2p was checked with circular dichroism spectroscopy (data not shown). Fibrils were assembled by incubating proteins at 1 mg/ml in buffer A at 4 °C during a 1–2 week period.Electron Microscopy—Protein samples were loaded onto a 400 mesh copper electron microscopy grid coated with a plastic film (Formvar). To avoid rapid desiccation, sedimentation was allowed during a 10–30 min period in a moist Petri dish. Grids were then rinsed with 15–20 drops of freshly prepared 1% uranyl acetate in water (passed over 0.22-μm filter, Millipore), dried with filter paper, and observed with a Phillips Tecnai 12 Biowin electron microscope at 100 kV.RESULTSUrea Enhances Ure2p Detection from [URE3] Extracts in Western Blots—In a previous work, we found that the Ure2p signal intensity in Western blot experiments was very low in the [URE3] strain compared with the wild-type strain. This may be because of a lower Ure2p concentration in a prion-containing cell, or alternatively to a lower detection efficiency. The effect of denaturing agents like urea already used by others (28Schlumpberger M. Prusiner S.B. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was then tested. With our previous standard protocol we observed that the Ure2p signal intensity was 10 times lower in the CC34 [URE3] strain than in CC30 [ure3-0] (27Ripaud L. Maillet L. Cullin C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When urea was added to a final concentration of 8 m in the loading buffer, a 5-fold increase of this signal was observed (data not shown). This increase shows that most Ure2p [URE3] was not detected after boiling in 2% SDS buffer. To analyze whether the urea-sensitive fraction was soluble or aggregated, a 100,000 × g sedimentation assay was performed. Without urea, most Ure2p was detected in the supernatant fraction, whether the proteins were prepared from the wild-type or the [URE3] strains (Fig. 1A). Addition of urea after fractionation had no effect on the signal detected in wild-type extracts (Fig. 1A, wt, columns S and P). The intensity of the Ure2p species remained the same in both the pellet and the supernatant. In [URE3] extracts, the supernatant fraction exhibited the same intensity whether urea was added or not (Fig. 1A, [URE3], column S), whereas in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1A, [URE3], column P) the presence of urea strongly increased the detected signal. Thus, most Ure2p is aggregated in [URE3] cells. Without urea, this fraction (representing 80% of total Ure2p) is not efficiently detected on Western blot. In a previous work, Schlumpberger et al. (28Schlumpberger M. Prusiner S.B. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) found that Ure2p was completely insoluble in [URE3] strains, whereas we found that even in [URE3] 20% remains soluble. The difference in the level of aggregation is in fact because of growth conditions. When CC34 [URE3] cells were grown overnight (for 5–7 generations) in rich medium YPD, 80% of the Ure2p signal was detected in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1, B and C). When the same strain was grown in SD + Usa (accordingly to the conditions used by Schlumpberger et al. (28Schlumpberger M. Prusiner S.B. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) no signal was detected in the supernatant (Fig. 1, B and C) indicating a complete aggregation of Ure2p. This result was also found for another yeast strain (Fig. 1C), indicating that this rather represents a general feature being independent of the genetic background of our strain. The SD + Usa medium is selective for the presence of [URE3] prion. However, decrease in Ure2p aggregation in non-selective medium could not be explained by a partial [URE3] curing in the population, because all the yeast cells remained [URE3] after growth in YPD (data not shown). As the SD + Usa medium is selective for the loss of function of Ure2p, enhanced aggregation of this protein in this medium might be because of a need of its complete inactivation. To test for this hypothesis, we investigated which amount of Ure2p was required for the wild-type phenotype (absence of growth in SD + Usa).Ure2p Quantity Sufficient to Inhibit Usa Uptake—The URE2 open reading frame was cloned upstream of a tetracycline-repressible promoter in the pCM183/URE2 plasmid. This plasmid was transformed into the CC32 ure2Δ. In this strain, URE2 expression is inversely proportional to the doxycycline concentration in the medium. Without doxycycline, a 5-fold increase in Ure2p level was observed compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2A, compare columns 1 and 2). The Ure2p level was quantified by comparing the signal obtained with antibodies against Ure2p, to the one obtained with antibodies to poly(A) Pap1p (31Lingner J. Kellermann J. Keller W. Nature. 1991; 354: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a protein not involved in prion processes. Using 0.2 μg/ml of doxycycline, the level of Ure2p production was about 60% of the wild-type level (Fig. 2A, column 3). This is sufficient for the complementation of the URE2 deletion in CC32. No growth was observed on SD + Usa, as for the controls without doxycycline in wild-type and PTET-URE2 strains (Fig. 2B, columns 1–3). One third of the wild-type Ure2p level, which was obtained with 0.3 μg/ml of doxycycline, leads to an incomplete complementation phenotype (Fig. 2, A and B, column 4). The growth on SD + Usa is heterogeneous. Using 2 μg/ml of doxycycline, the Ure2p level is about 15% of the wild-type level. In this condition, yeast cells clearly grow on SD + Usa as the ure2Δ control (Fig. 2B, columns 5 and 6). These results suggest that less than 15% of Ure2p (in comparison to the wild-type level) gives rise to a mutant phenotype. If aggregation leads to Ure2p inactivation, then a complete aggregation of Ure2p is not required to obtain the mutant [URE3] phenotype. We next investigated the biochemical nature of the aggregated form of Ure2p in [URE3] cells.Fig. 2Estimation of Ure2p quantity sufficient to inhibit Usa uptake. The URE2 open reading frame was cloned under the control of the TET-repressible promoter in pCM183, creating pCM183/URE2. CC32 (ure2Δ) transformants with pCM183/URE2 are noted PTET-URE2. In this strain Ure2p is under the control of the TET-repressible promoter. The CC30 (wt), CC32 (ure2Δ) and PTET-URE2 were grown overnight in liquid medium SD + uracil and doxycycline ranging from 0 to 2 μg/ml. A, then an aliquot of each culture was used to quantify Ure2p production by Western blot analysis. An antibody against Pap1p was used to normalize the quantification. The Ure2p level was finally expressed as a ratio based on the concentration found in the wild-type strain. B, another aliquot of liquid cultures was used to test for the complementation phenotype. Growth was compared on SD + Usa and SD + uracil, both containing the same concentration of doxycycline as each liquid culture tested. The absence of growth on SD + Usa indicates complementation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ure2pc- and Ure2p[URE3]-limited Proteolysis—We further characterized these aggregates by limited proteolysis. This is a tool to investigate protein structure, as flexible regions are more sensitive to proteolysis than folded polypeptide chains. Moreover, the core of ordered aggregates has a lower accessibility to proteases and is expected to be very resistant to proteolysis. Proteins extracted from wild-type and [URE3] strains were digested for 30 min with proteinase K concentrations ranging from 0 to 15 μg/ml. As proteins were extracted and incubated without protease inhibitors for 30 min, each sample was analyzed by Coomassie staining to ensure that proteins were not degraded in the control without proteinase K (Fig. 3A). Then, Western blots were performed with antibodies raised against Ure2p. In wild-type extracts, Ure2p was completely digested after a treatment with 10 μg/ml of proteinase K (Fig. 3B, wt blot). In contrast, full-length Ure2p was still detected with 15 μg/ml of proteinase K in [URE3] extracts (Fig. 3B, [URE3] blot). Partial degradation of Ure2p from wild-type extracts with 1 μg/ml of proteinase K produced a fuzzy band at 30 kDa, probably corresponding to several fragments arising from different cleavage sites. With higher proteinase K concentration (4 μg/ml), one additional faint band at 25 kDa was observed. When [URE3] crude extracts were analyzed in the same way, a 30-kDa fragment was observed with concentrations of proteinase K ranging from 1 to 4 μg/ml. Two additional fragments of 28 and 26 kDa were detected with increased proteinase K concentration. These three fragments were resistant against up to 50 μg/ml of proteinase K (data not shown). These results clearly indicated that the presence of [URE3] induced a dramatic change in both the resistance and the proteolysis pattern of Ure2p.Fig. 3Limited proteolysis of Ure2p cellular and prion isoforms. A, total protein extracts were prepared from wild-type and [URE3] strains. They were digested with increasing proteinase K concentrations at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. B, samples were then analyzed on a Western blot probed with an antibody raised against full-length Ure2p. The numbers on the vertical axis denote the masses of marker proteins (kDa). wt, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize which domains of Ure2p had an increased resistance to proteolysis, an antibody raised against a peptide located in the C-terminal domain of Ure2p, from amino acids 284 to 298, was used to probe the Western blots. In [URE3] extracts, full-length Ure2p was revealed by the “C-terminal” antibody, but none of the three bands in the range of 26–30 kDa was detected (Fig. 4A, Cter-Ure2p). When the same membrane was incubated with anti-Ure2p antibodies raised against the full-length protein, the full-length Ure2p and the 26–30-kDa fragments were detected (Fig. 4A, Ure2p). As the fuzzy 30-kDa species generated by controlled proteolysis of wild-type crude extract are recognized by the anti-C-terminal antibodies (Fig. 4B), we concluded that the more accessible proteinase K sites of Ure2p in [URE3] cells are different from Ure2p in wild-type.Fig. 4Characterization of proteolysis pattern in [URE3] strain. A, an [URE3] crude extract was partially digested and analyzed on Western blot with an antibody raised against a peptide located between amino acids 284 and 298 (closed box) in the C-terminal end of Ure2p (left panel). From the left to the right, samples were digested with 7, 10, and 15 μg/ml of proteinase K. The same membrane was reprobed with an antibody raised against full-length Ure2p. The three bands not recognized by the anti-Ure2p284–298 antibodies are represented. B, a wild-type (wt) crude extract was analyzed as in A. From the left to the right, samples were digested with 0 and 1 μg/ml of proteinase K. The bands recognized by the anti-Ure2p284–298 antibodies are represented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Limited Proteolysis for Recombinant Soluble Ure2p and Ure2p Amyloid Fibrils—To test whether aggregated Ure2p[URE3]was compatible with an amyloid fibril conformation or not, proteolysis patterns of Ure2p extracted from yeast cells were compared with the ones of recombinant soluble Ure2p and Ure2p amyloid fibrils. Ure2p-His6 was expressed and purified from E. coli. Amyloid fibrils formation was checked using negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 5A). We first tested the influence of temperature and urea on the solubility of Ure2p. As expected, neither boiling nor adding urea enhanced the level of protein detected by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE when the soluble protein was analyzed (data not shown). On the other hand, when the amyloid sample was boiled for 5 min, a massive increase of soluble Ure2p was observed (Fig. 5B). Interestingly the presence of urea only slightly changes Ure2p solubility under these conditions. On one hand, urea does not provoke a significant increase in the capacity of Ure2p amyloid fibrils to enter in the polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5B) but on the other hand, under the same conditions, provokes a 5–10-fold increase in the solubility of aggregated Ure2p in [URE3] cells (Fig. 1A). This suggests that either the amyloids produced in vitro are different from in vivo aggregates or that amyloids interaction with proteins from yeast crude extract change their sensitivity toward SDS. We therefore tested whether incubation of amyloids with a yeast extract changed their properties. Recombinant amyloid fibrils were incubated in ure2Δ crude extract for 5 min prior addition to sample buffer with or without urea. Samples were then incubated for 5 additional min either at room temperature or at 100 °C and analyzed by Western blot. We observed an increase in the Ure2p signal when samples were heated in SDS 2% (Fig. 5C). Addition of 8 m urea was not required to efficiently detect this signal (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the incubation with a crude extract did not change the solubility pr"
