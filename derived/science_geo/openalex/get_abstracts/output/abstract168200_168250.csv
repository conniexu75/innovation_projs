https://openalex.org/W1965020427,"We demonstrate logic circuits with field-effect transistors based on single carbon nanotubes. Our device layout features local gates that provide excellent capacitive coupling between the gate and nanotube, enabling strong electrostatic doping of the nanotube from p-doping to n-doping and the study of the nonconventional long-range screening of charge along the one-dimensional nanotubes. The transistors show favorable device characteristics such as high gain (>10), a large on-off ratio (>10(5)), and room-temperature operation. Importantly, the local-gate layout allows for integration of multiple devices on a single chip. Indeed, we demonstrate one-, two-, and three-transistor circuits that exhibit a range of digital logic operations, such as an inverter, a logic NOR, a static random-access memory cell, and an ac ring oscillator."
https://openalex.org/W1981147791,"Individuals affected with developmental disorders of speech and language have substantial difficulty acquiring expressive and/or receptive language in the absence of any profound sensory or neurological impairment and despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. Although studies of twins consistently indicate that a significant genetic component is involved, most families segregating speech and language deficits show complex patterns of inheritance, and a gene that predisposes individuals to such disorders has not been identified. We have studied a unique three-generation pedigree, KE, in which a severe speech and language disorder is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. Our previous work mapped the locus responsible, SPCH1, to a 5.6-cM interval of region 7q31 on chromosome 7 (ref. 5). We also identified an unrelated individual, CS, in whom speech and language impairment is associated with a chromosomal translocation involving the SPCH1 interval. Here we show that the gene FOXP2, which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain, is directly disrupted by the translocation breakpoint in CS. In addition, we identify a point mutation in affected members of the KE family that alters an invariant amino-acid residue in the forkhead domain. Our findings suggest that FOXP2 is involved in the developmental process that culminates in speech and language."

https://openalex.org/W2114604545,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening systemic illness of abrupt onset and unknown cause. Proteolysis of the blood-clotting protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) observed in normal plasma is decreased in TTP patients. However, the identity of the responsible protease and its role in the pathophysiology of TTP remain unknown. We performed genome-wide linkage analysis in four pedigrees of humans with congenital TTP and mapped the responsible genetic locus to chromosome 9q34. A predicted gene in the identified interval corresponds to a segment of a much larger transcript, identifying a new member of the ADAMTS family of zinc metalloproteinase genes (ADAMTS13). Analysis of patients' genomic DNA identified 12 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene, accounting for 14 of the 15 disease alleles studied. We show that deficiency of ADAMTS13 is the molecular mechanism responsible for TTP, and suggest that physiologic proteolysis of VWF and/or other ADAMTS13 substrates is required for normal vascular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2170471837,"Genome sequencing projects are producing linear amino acid sequences, but full understanding of the biological role of these proteins will require knowledge of their structure and function. Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling, rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single proteins and on the scale of whole genomes. We then discuss the important role that protein structure prediction methods play in the growing worldwide effort in structural genomics."

Complex striping patterns are readily prepared by sequential electrochemical deposition of metal ions into templates with uniformly sized pores.

https://openalex.org/W2116513121,"The Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the systemic invasive infectious disease classically referred to as plague, and has been responsible for three human pandemics: the Justinian plague (sixth to eighth centuries), the Black Death (fourteenth to nineteenth centuries) and modern plague (nineteenth century to the present day). The recent identification of strains resistant to multiple drugs and the potential use of Y. pestis as an agent of biological warfare mean that plague still poses a threat to human health. Here we report the complete genome sequence of Y. pestis strain CO92, consisting of a 4.65-megabase (Mb) chromosome and three plasmids of 96.2 kilobases (kb), 70.3 kb and 9.6 kb. The genome is unusually rich in insertion sequences and displays anomalies in GC base-composition bias, indicating frequent intragenomic recombination. Many genes seem to have been acquired from other bacteria and viruses (including adhesins, secretion systems and insecticidal toxins). The genome contains around 150 pseudogenes, many of which are remnants of a redundant enteropathogenic lifestyle. The evidence of ongoing genome fluidity, expansion and decay suggests Y. pestis is a pathogen that has undergone large-scale genetic flux and provides a unique insight into the ways in which new and highly virulent pathogens evolve."

https://openalex.org/W2091366475,"Although trafficking and degradation of several membrane proteins are regulated by ubiquitination catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligases, there has been little evidence connecting ubiquitination with regulation of mammalian G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) function. Agonist stimulation of endogenous or transfected beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2ARs) led to rapid ubiquitination of both the receptors and the receptor regulatory protein, beta-arrestin. Moreover, proteasome inhibitors reduced receptor internalization and degradation, thus implicating a role for the ubiquitination machinery in the trafficking of the beta2AR. Receptor ubiquitination required beta-arrestin, which bound to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Abrogation of beta-arrestin ubiquitination, either by expression in Mdm2-null cells or by dominant-negative forms of Mdm2 lacking E3 ligase activity, inhibited receptor internalization with marginal effects on receptor degradation. However, a beta2AR mutant lacking lysine residues, which was not ubiquitinated, was internalized normally but was degraded ineffectively. These findings delineate an adapter role of beta-arrestin in mediating the ubiquitination of the beta2AR and indicate that ubiquitination of the receptor and of beta-arrestin have distinct and obligatory roles in the trafficking and degradation of this prototypic GPCR."
https://openalex.org/W2008486131,"Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to map the detailed topography of chromosome replication in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The times of replication of thousands of sites across the genome were determined by hybridizing replicated and unreplicated DNAs, isolated at different times in S phase, to the microarrays. Origin activations take place continuously throughout S phase but with most firings near mid-S phase. Rates of replication fork movement vary greatly from region to region in the genome. The two ends of each of the 16 chromosomes are highly correlated in their times of replication. This microarray approach is readily applicable to other organisms, including humans."

https://openalex.org/W2031340189,"The definition of centromeres of human chromosomes requires a complete genomic understanding of these regions. Toward this end, we report integration of physical mapping, genetic, and functional approaches, together with sequencing of selected regions, to define the centromere of the human X chromosome and to explore the evolution of sequences responsible for chromosome segregation. The transitional region between expressed sequences on the short arm of the X and the chromosome-specific alpha satellite array DXZ1 spans about 450 kilobases and is satellite-rich. At the junction between this satellite region and canonical DXZ1 repeats, diverged repeat units provide direct evidence of unequal crossover as the homogenizing force of these arrays. Results from deletion analysis of mitotically stable chromosome rearrangements and from a human artificial chromosome assay demonstrate that DXZ1 DNA is sufficient for centromere function. Evolutionary studies indicate that, while alpha satellite DNA present throughout the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome appears to be a descendant of an ancestral primate centromere, the current functional centromere based on DXZ1 sequences is the product of the much more recent concerted evolution of this satellite DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2090085993,"Toxoplasma gondii is a common human pathogen causing serious, even fatal, disease in the developing fetus and in immunocompromised patients. Despite its ability to reproduce sexually and its broad geographic and host range, Toxoplasma has a clonal population structure comprised principally of three lines. We have analyzed 15 polymorphic loci in the archetypal type I, II, and III strains and found that polymorphism was limited to, at most, two rather than three allelic classes and no polymorphism was detected between alleles in strains of a given type. Multilocus analysis of 10 nonarchetypal isolates likewise clustered the vast majority of alleles into the same two distinct ancestries. These data strongly suggest that the currently predominant genotypes exist as a pandemic outbreak from a genetic mixing of two discrete ancestral lines. To determine if such mixing could lead to the extreme virulence observed for some strains, we examined the F(1) progeny of a cross between a type II and III strain, both of which are relatively avirulent in mice. Among the progeny were recombinants that were at least 3 logs more virulent than either parent. Thus, sexual recombination, by combining polymorphisms in two distinct and competing clonal lines, can be a powerful force driving the natural evolution of virulence in this highly successful pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1993111592,"Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) binds all elongator aminoacyl–transfer RNAs (aa-tRNAs) for delivery to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Here, we show that EF-Tu binds misacylated tRNAs over a much wider range of affinities than it binds the corresponding correctly acylated tRNAs, suggesting that the protein exhibits considerable specificity for both the amino acid side chain and the tRNA body. The thermodynamic contributions of the amino acid and the tRNA body to the overall binding affinity are independent of each other and compensate for one another when the tRNAs are correctly acylated. Because certain misacylated tRNAs bind EF-Tu significantly more strongly or weakly than cognate aa-tRNAs, EF-Tu may contribute to translational accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W1977233215,"Ordering particles at the nanometre length scale is a challenging and active research area in materials science. Several approaches have so far been developed, ranging from the manipulation of individual particles to the exploitation of self-assembly in colloids. Nanometre-scale ordering is well known to appear spontaneously when anisotropic organic moieties form liquid-crystalline phases; this behaviour is also observed for anisotropic mineral nanoparticles resulting in the formation of nematic, smectic and hexagonal mesophases. Here we describe a lyotropic liquid-crystalline lamellar phase comprising an aqueous dispersion of planar solid-like sheets in which all the atoms involved in a layer are covalently bonded. The spacing of these phosphatoantimonate single layers can be increased 100-fold, resulting in one-dimensional structures whose periodicity can be tuned from 1.5 to 225 nanometres. These highly organized materials can be mechanically or magnetically aligned over large pH and temperature ranges, and this property can be used to measure residual dipolar couplings for the structure determination of biomolecules by liquid-state NMR. We also expect that our approach will result in the discovery of other classes of mineral lyotropic lamellar phases."

https://openalex.org/W2038417097,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) in the innate immune system have not been identified in non-mammalian vertebrates. Two types of TLR were cloned from a chicken bursa cDNA library using degenerate primers based on the consensus sequences of mouse and Drosophila Toll and designated as chicken TLR(chTLR) type 1 and type 2. Of the nine human TLRs reported to date, these chTLRs showed the highest homology to human TLR2. The extracellular regions of type 1 and type 2 contained a distinct ∼200-amino acid stretch and were 45.3 and 46.3% homologous to that of human TLR2. The intracellular Toll/interleukin-1R homology domain of type 1 and type 2 was perfectly identical to each other and highly homologous (80.7%) to that of human TLR2. Both types were widely detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting in various chicken organs, especially those rich in connective tissue. Both genes were mapped to chromosome 4q1.1, suggesting that they arose by gene duplication. By reporter gene assay, type 2 and to a lesser extent type 1, selectively signaled the presence of mycoplasma macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2/M161Ag in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell system. Cotransfection of type 2 and human CD14 or MD-2 into human embryonic kidney 293 cells allowed the response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas type 1 did not signal LPS or any other microbial components tested.

It is generally accepted that the typical immune system consisting of both innate and acquired immunity emerged in the bony fish, the jaw-less fish, which are vertebrates, and all invertebrates survive without lymphocytes (1Cooper E.L. Rinkevich B. Uhlenbruck G. Valembois P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1992; 35: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mammalian immune system is more complicated than those of invertebrates because of a conjunction of the innate immune system with the acquired immune system, which has been characterized as a mechanism for the recognition of microbe antigens by huge clonal variations and proliferation of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte activation tends to be augmented by the addition of innate immune stimuli. Thus, after connection of the innate and acquired systems, these two systems have become interdependent. In human and mouse, the dysfunction of the lymphocyte system has very severe consequences (2McMichael A. Murphy P.M. Janeway Jr., C.A. Travers P. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, NY1999: 363-578Google Scholar). Hence, the lymphocyte system has been the main research target in the field of immunology for >50 years, but the essential requirement of innate immune responses by microbial stimuli for activation of antigen-presenting cells was proposed only a few years ago. Accordingly, insufficient information is available on the innate immune system of vertebrates to determine how the immune system was established. Phylogenic comparison of the innate immune system may further our understanding of this issue. A major participant in the innate system was recently discovered inDrosophila melanogaster as the Toll receptor (3Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2967) Google Scholar). InD. melanogaster, Toll and another Toll homologue, 18-Wheeler, participate in discrimination of microbial substances of fungi and bacteria, respectively (3Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2967) Google Scholar, 4Williams M.J. Rodriguez A. Kimbrell D.A. Eldon E.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6120-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The major output of their signaling pathways is the secretion of anti-microbial peptides, which effectively eliminate invading microorganisms (3Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2967) Google Scholar, 4Williams M.J. Rodriguez A. Kimbrell D.A. Eldon E.D.

A. 2000; 97: 10520-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This system should be representative of ancient host defense mechanisms. The Toll-mediated host defense system has been considered to be conserved across a wide range of species from drosophila to humans (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4396) Google Scholar), and in mammals it is defined as essential for the activation of antigen-presenting cells in the immune system (7Rescigno M. Granucci F. Citterio S. Foti M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 200-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). The current concept is that Toll-like receptors (TLR)1 expressed on human or mouse macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in recognition and discrimination of microbial components. For example, TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane (9Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). TLR2, on the other hand, recognizes peptidoglycans and lipoproteins from Gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas, mycobacteria, and spirochetes (12Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33419-33425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The TLR signaling in mouse macrophage dendritic cells results in induction or up-regulation of initial cytokines and costimulatory molecules, thereby augmenting the lymphocyte-activation ability of antigen-presenting cells (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4396) Google Scholar, 7Rescigno M. Granucci F. Citterio S. Foti M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Immunol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). In mammals, Toll signaling is evolved as an inducer of innate immune responses to complete activation of the acquired immune system. However, it is notable that in any lower vertebrates other than mammals, the TLR host defense system has not yet been systematically characterized. In this study, we identified and characterized two chicken TLRs mapped to chromosome 4, a considerably conserved region among species from chickens to humans (13Boyd Y. Goodchild M. Morroll S. Bumstead N. Immunogenetics. 2001; 52: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One of these receptors governs both lipopeptide- and LPS-mediated signals in a distinct manner in terms of molecular combinations.

Various chicken tissues were solubilized with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, using a potter-type homogenizer. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, each lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was measured using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts (500 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (6% acrylamide) under reducing conditions and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by the method described previously (22Iwata K. Seya T. Yanagi Y. Pesando J.M. Johnson P.M. Okabe M. Ueda S. Ariga H. Nagasawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15148-15152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After blocking with skimmed milk, blots were incubated with anti-chTLR Ab (5 μg/ml) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:10000) and detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). N-Glycosidase treatment was performed by the method described previously (19Inoue N. Fukui A. Nomura M. Matsumoto M. Toyoshima K. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RK13 cells were transfected with empty vector, type 1 chTLR, or type 2 chTLR by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris maleate, pH 8.6) at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Aliquots of 30 μl of each lysate were incubated with 100 microunits of neuraminidase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with 250 microunits of N-glycosidase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) at 37 °C for 16 h. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-chTLR Ab. Transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with 30 μl of 50 μg/ml anti-chTLR Ab or 50 μg/ml pre-immune rabbit IgG at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing, cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 (American Qualex Antibodies, San Clemente, CA). The stained cells were analyzed using FACSCalibur. HEK293 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates, and the following day they were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate (Mammalian Transfection kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with 2.5 μg of expression plasmids, 1.0 μg of NF-κB reporter plasmid-encoding luciferase (pNFκB-Luc, Stratagene), and 2.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for normalization of transfection efficiency. The total expression plasmid concentration was made up to 5 μg with empty vector (pME18 s). After 40 h, cells were harvested, seeded into five wells of 24-well plates, and treated with 10 μg of LPS, 1 μm MALP-2, or various bacterial suspensions at 37 °C for 6 h. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with the reagents and protocols from PicaGene (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). The specific activities were calculated as light intensity with stimulation/light intensity without stimulation. TLR has not been identified in non-mammalian vertebrates. First, we attempted to isolate chicken TLR homologues to compare their structural/functional relationship with those of mammals reported to date, i.e. mice and humans. Several degenerate primers were designed based on sequences of the TIR domain conserved among mice TLR2, TLR4, and D. melanogaster Toll (Fig. 1). Nested PCR was performed with two specific primers for the vector (pME18s), each degenerate primer and template (chicken bursa of Fabricius cDNA library). After second PCR, the PCR fragments of various sizes were subcloned into the vector pCR2.1, and their sequences were determined. One of the clones was found to contain a sequence similar to the TIR domain of human and mouse TLR2s. Finally, the full coding regions of two TLRswere identified by 3′ and 5′ RACE. The presence of these twoTLR sequences was confirmed by RT-PCR in six clones from chicken liver mRNA, and then they were designated type 1 and type 2TLR. From the nucleotide sequences of the two chTLRs, type-specific sequences were identified at their 5′ proximal sites, ∼600 bp in their putative extracellular domains, and 3′ proximal regions (Fig. 2). The former two sites led to differences in amino acid sequence between type 1 and type 2, whereas the latter did not. These two types ofchTLRs were 88.5% homologous over the whole sequence and 57.0% homologous in the 600-bp type-specific sequences. The coding regions of both types consisted of a single exon. Furthermore, single introns of ∼500 bp and 1.5–1.8 kilobase pairs were found immediately upstream of the coding regions of type 1 and type 2, respectively. Thus, the two independent genes encoded the two chTLR types, suggestive of no participation of alternative splicing in generating the two similar types of chTLRs. The deduced amino acid sequences of type 1 and type 2 chTLR proteins are shown in Fig. 3. Both type 1 and type 2 possessed >12 LRRs and one C-terminal-flanking region in the putative ectodomains. Their TIR domains were completely identical. The type-specific amino acid sequences were found in the middle of the LRR domain and the N-terminal regions of the two types, reflecting the distinct nucleotide sequences. Of the nine human TLRs sequenced to date, both of the chTLR proteins exhibited the highest degrees of homology to human TLR2 (Table I). In particular, the TIR domain of chTLRs was ∼80% identical to that of human TLR2.Table IHomologies between chTLRs and human TLRschTLRshuTLRs123456789%Type 1Total30.352.621.724.921.629.324.523.221.1LRR25.845.323.126.120.324.622.123.429.0(39.8)1-150Homologies in specific regions for each type of chTLR.Type 2Total29.553.023.124.922.029.223.623.122.7LRR24.846.323.120.020.924.622.021.129.0(45.0)1-150Homologies in specific regions for each type of chTLR.TIR52.480.727.339.928.351.738.835.834.0The results are shown as percentages (%) of homologies at the amino acid level. huTLR, human TLR.1-150 Homologies in specific regions for each type of chTLR.

To determine the chromosomal localization of type 1 and type 2 chTLRs, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed. Probes of ∼800 bp containing the type-specific region of ∼600 bp were used to map type 1 and type 2 individually. Because each probe detected the indistinguishable region, 4q1.1 proximal (Fig. 4), the two chTLRs genes were both localized to the q1.1 proximal region of chromosome 4 (ChickGBASE, www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/chickmap/). To determine the tissue distributions of chTLR mRNAs, we first conducted RNA-blotting analysis. Total RNAs from various chicken tissues were blotted onto membrane, and type 2chTLR ORF (2345 bp) was used as a probe. A single band was detected at ∼3.4 kb in all tissues (data not shown). Because the probe contained the region common to both types of chTLR, we could not discriminate one from the other. We also confirmed the expression of chTLR mRNAs by RT-PCR. (Fig. 5 A). Type 2 chTLR was detected in all tissues tested. Type 1, on the other hand, was hardly detected in the brain, spleen, and skeletal muscle. In heart, lung, liver, and ovary, both types of chTLR were abundantly expressed. We next determined molecular masses and tissue distributions of the two chTLRs by immunoblotting. Various chicken tissues were homogenized, and aliquots of 500 μg of each extract were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. ChTLRs were detected by anti-chTLR Ab established for this study. As controls, the soluble fraction of RK13 cells expressing each type of recombinant chTLR (His-tagged) were simultaneously analyzed on the same blots. Type 1 and 2 chTLR were detected at 102 kDa, and 97 and 99 kDa as a single band and double bands, respectively (Fig. 5 B). These bands were also detected using anti-His-tag antibody (data not shown). ChTLRs were expressed in almost all tissues, although in the lung, kidney, testis, and ovary, the signals were marginal. Strong signals were detected in the heart, liver, gizzard, and muscle, which suggested that chTLRs are preferentially expressed in the connective tissues. We could not determine which type of chTLR was dominant in each tissue, because our polyclonal antibody recognized both type 1 and type 2. Both types of chTLR were predicted to have eight N-linked glycosylation sites from their primary sequences, and the molecular masses estimated from immunoblotting were larger than those expected. To determine the amount of N-linked sugar, we performed deglycosylation analysis of chTLRs. Lysates of RK13 cells transfected with vector only, type 1, or type 2 chTLR cDNA were treated withN-glycosidase followed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting with anti-chTLR Ab. After glycosidase treatment, molecular sizes of both types were shifted down to the sizes predicted from the primary sequences (Fig. 5 C). The signals were intensified through deglycosylation, suggesting that the epitopes may be disclosed by the removal of the sugars. Hence, type 1 and type 2 chTLRs were predicted to be type I transmembrane proteins with N-linked sugars corresponding to 19 kDa and 14–17 kDa in their extracellular domain, respectively. Type 1 is more heavily glycosylated than type 2. Both types of chTLR proteins may be analogues of human TLR2 (Table I). Human and mouse TLR2 act as pattern-recognition receptors and signal the presence of various bacteria through the activation of NF-κB leading to immune responses. Here, we tested whether bacterial components activate NF-κB via stimulation of chTLRs. Human and mouse TLR2 activate NF-κB in the HEK293 cell line. The TIR domain of chTLR was highly homologous to those of human TLR2, and the amino acid residues responsible for signaling were seemingly conserved in chTLR. Hence, the cDNA/plasmid of each chTLR was transfected into the HEK293 cell line. In some cases, other cDNAs were cotransfected together with chTLRs. First, we checked the surface expression of type 1 and type 2 chTLR in transiently transfected HEK293 cells by flow cytometric analysis and using anti-chTLR Ab. Some shifts specific for chTLR were detected in type 1 and type 2 HEK293 cells (Fig. 6 A), however, type 2 expression was lower than that of type 1. By immunoblotting analysis, the expression of type 1 and type 2 in HEK293 cells was clearly confirmed (Fig. 6 A). Next, ligand-mediated activation of NF-κB was analyzed using these type 1 and type 2 transfectants. LPS and MALP-2 were used as representative ligands for TLR4 and TLR2 in mammals, respectively (9Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C.

Despite its low surface expression compared with type 1, type 2 can signal the presence of human TLR2 ligand mycoplasma lipoprotein, suggesting that even minimal expression of type 2 is sufficient for signaling. In fact, although we adjusted the expression levels of type 1 and type 2 in HEK293 transfectants, specific activity was not changed (data not shown). NF-κB was more effectively activated by MALP-2 in the cells cotransfected with type 1 and type 2 chTLR than in those transfected with either type alone. The function of chMD-1 has not been determined (17Burk O. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3713-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although its human homologue was shown to be a cofactor for RP-105, which is an LRR protein and enhances LPS signaling on B cells (25Miura Y.

In this study, chMD-1 was found to subtly up-regulate MALP-2-dependent chTLR type 2 activation by NF-κB reporter gene assay (Fig. 6 D). On the other hand, MALP-2-dependent type 1 activation was not potentiated by cotransfection withchMD-1. E. coli or S. minnesota LPS did not activate NF-κB in either type transfectant (Fig. 6 D). In mammals, CD14 and/or MD-2 have been identified as TLR cofactors for LPS signaling to facilitate NF-κB activation (27Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I.

Cotransfection with type 2 and either human MD-2 or humanCD14 allowed the transfectants to respond to E. coli LPS. In particular, CD14 more efficiently enhanced type 2-mediated response to LPS than MD-2. These responses were inhibited by the treatment with polymyxin B (data not shown), indicating that the observed NF-κB activation was attributable to a specific chTLR response by LPS. Salmonella LPS, on the other hand, failed to activate NF-κB through type 2 signaling. Unlike type 2, type 1"

Our radio interferometric observations of the quasar 3C273 made with the orbiting radio telescope, HALCA, and an array of ground telescopes have yielded an image in which the emission across the jet is resolved, revealing two threadlike patterns that form a double helix inside the jet. This double helical structure is consistent with a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and at least five different instability modes can be identified and modeled by a light jet with a Lorentz factor of 2 and Mach number of 3.5. The model reproduces in detail the internal structure of the jet on scales of up to 30 milli–arc seconds (∼300 parsecs) and is consistent with the general morphology of the jet on scales of up to 1 kiloparsec."

There is an inverse relation between the length of exposure to oxic conditions and the relative abundance of nonprotein alkyl (alkyl NP ) carbon, whose concentration is two orders of magnitude higher in coastal sediments with short exposure times than in deep-sea sediments with long exposure times. All alkyl NP -rich samples contain a physically separate polymethylene component similar in composition to algaenans and kerogens in type I oil shales. The duration of exposure to oxic conditions appears to directly influence the quality and oil generation potential of OM in marine shales."

Although metazoan cohesin associates with chromosomes and was shown to function in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during interphase, the majority of cohesin was found to be off chromosomes and reside in the cytoplasm in metaphase. Despite its dissociation from chromosomes, however, microinjection of an antibody against human SMC1 led to disorganization of the metaphase plate and cell cycle arrest, indicating that human cohesin still plays an important role in metaphase. To address the mitotic function of human cohesin, the subcellular localization of cohesin components was reexamined in human cells. Interestingly, we found that cohesin localizes to the spindle poles during mitosis and interacts with NuMA, a spindle pole-associated factor required for mitotic spindle organization. The interaction with NuMA persists during interphase. Similar to NuMA, a significant amount of cohesin was found to associate with the nuclear matrix.

Sister chromatid cohesion, which ensures the pairing of the two sister chromatids, is a prerequisite for proper chromosome segregation at anaphase. Cohesin is a multiprotein complex required for sister chromatid cohesion in eukaryotes. Cohesin was first characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is composed of two structural maintenance ofchromosome (SMC)1family proteins, Smc1p and Smc3p, as well as the non-SMC components Scc1 and Scc3p (Refs.1–3 and see review in Ref. 4Nasmyth K.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2757-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, cohesin functions in both the establishment and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion from S phase to metaphase (1Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Cell. 1997; 91: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 2Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Consistently, cohesin in S. cerevisiae stays associated with chromosomes from the late G1 phase until the onset of anaphase (3Toth A. Ciosk R. Uhlmann F. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Scc1p is a homolog of Rad21 identified earlier in S. pombe(8Birkenbihl R.P. Subramani S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 25: 6605-6611Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of Scc1p by the cysteine protease separin, which is indirectly promoted by the anaphase-promoting complex at the end of metaphase, is responsible for the destruction of cohesin and the initiation of sister chromatid segregation in anaphase (9Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.-A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). A similar observation was made in S. pombe, although S. pombe cohesin stays associated with chromosomes throughout the cell cycle (7Tomonaga T. Nagao K. Kawasaki Y. Furuya K. Murakami A. Morishita J.

Studies of S. cerevisiae identified thein vivo binding sites of cohesin on the chromosome arms at estimated intervals of 13 kb with the highest concentration at the centromeric regions (10Tanaka T.

In metazoans, the protein composition of cohesin is conserved, although there are two Scc3p homologs, stromal antigen 1 (SA1) and 2 (SA2), forming separate cohesin complexes in the cell (5Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,6Sumara, I., Vorlaufer, E., Gieffers, C., Peters, B. H., and Peters, J.-M. (2000) J. Cell Biol.Google Scholar). Interestingly, chromosomal association of cohesin in metazoans differs from that of yeast cohesin. In a Xenopus oocyte cell-free system, depletion of cohesin during interphase prior to entering mitosis inhibited subsequent mitotic cohesion of sister chromatids, suggesting that the complex is required for establishing cohesion following DNA replication (13Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In contrast to S. cerevisiae, however, metazoan cohesin was found to dissociate from chromosomes prior to entering mitosis (6Sumara, I., Vorlaufer, E., Gieffers, C., Peters, B. H., and Peters, J.-M.

Therefore, it is unclear how sister chromatid cohesion is maintained during metaphase. A recent study using Myc-tagged human RAD21 (hRAD21/Scc1) suggested that at least a small amount of hRAD21 is in the centromeric regions during metaphase and is subject to a similar proteolytic cleavage as in yeast (15Waizenegger I.C.

In Xenopus, SA1 was shown to localize between two sister chromatids in vitro, suggesting that a low amount of cohesin may continue to associate with metaphase chromosomes in higher eukaryotes, reminiscent of buttons on a jacket securing a few critical regions of sister chromatids together (5Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It was reasoned that the chromosomes of higher eukaryotes must condense to a higher level and that the presence of too many cohesin molecules may interfere with efficient chromosome condensation. However, the observed localization represents a very minor population of cohesin (estimated to be ∼5%) (5Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and the role of metazoan cohesin in metaphase cohesion has not been clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, it is not known whether cytoplasmic cohesin plays any role in mitosis. Despite the fact that the majority of cohesin is in the cytoplasm in mitotic cells, we previously showed that the injection of an antibody specific for hSMC1 into human mitotic cells blocked the progression of metaphase and led to disorganization of the metaphase plate, suggesting a role for cohesin in mitosis (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, its mechanism was unknown. The same antibody failed to detect any hSMC1 at the interface between the two sister chromatids, which would be the predicted site for cohesin localization. To further address the mitotic role of human cohesin, we characterized the human cohesin complex containing hSMC1, hSMC3, hRAD21, and SA1/SA2 and performed detailed immunostaining and biochemical analyses of cohesin subcellular localization in human cells. Here we report that cohesin localizes at the spindle poles during mitosis and interacts with the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) and more weakly but specifically with dynein and β-tubulin. Similar to NuMA, cohesin also interacts with the nuclear matrix during interphase. Further analysis showed that cohesin is required for mitotic spindle aster assembly in vitro. Our studies suggest a novel function of cohesin in mitotic spindle organization. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamate, and penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells were synchronized to the S and G2 phases by a double thymidine block, and to G1 phase by an additional nocodazole treatment as previously described (17Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The DNA content profile from cells synchronized at each cell cycle stage was analyzed by a FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen). For FACS analysis, cells were fixed in 75% ethanol at −80 °C. Cells were then stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide in the presence of 300 μg/ml RNase A. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant polypeptides expressed in Escherichia colicorresponding to the middle and C-terminal domains of hSMC1 (amino acids 402–894 and 888–1233, respectively), the N-terminal domain of hSMC3 (amino acids 1–303), the N- and C-terminal domains of human SA1 designated as SA1N and SA1C (amino acids 1–230 and 1028–1258, respectively), the C-terminal domain of hRAD21 (amino acids 286–543), and the N terminus of NuMA (amino acids 1–307). Antibodies were affinity-purified with the same recombinant polypeptides purified and cross-linked to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad) or expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins crosslinked to glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.) with dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma). Anti-Xenopus RAD21 (XRAD21) peptide antibody against the conserved C-terminal domain was kindly provided by Dr. Tatsuya Hirano at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (13Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Anti-DNA ligase III antibody was generously provided by Dr. Thomas Lindahl at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, United Kingdom. Anti-BRCA1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Ramin Shiekhattar at the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA. Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for NuMA (Calbiochem), for the dynein 70-kDa subunit (Sigma), and for β-tubulin (Sigma) were also used for colocalization studies and Western blot analyses. Secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Cy3 (Jackson Laboratory), and donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein (Vector Laboratory). Large scale immunoprecipitation and peptide sequencing protocols used for the identification of hRAD21 are similar to those described (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed by either colorimetric reaction (Promega) or enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To estimate sedimentation coefficient values, crude HeLa cell nuclear extracts in 0.4 m salt were subjected to 5–30% sucrose gradient centrifugation at 155,000 × g for 15 h with a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Each fraction was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Standard proteins bovine serum albumin (4.6 S), catalase (11.3 S), and ferritin (16.5 S) were run in the same gradient multiple times to confirm the linearity of the gradient. Immunofluorescent staining of cells was performed as described previously (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent image analysis was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a Photometrics Sensys Camera. J/C Cittert iterative digital deconvolution was performed using the Zeiss KS 300 program. Alternatively, the analysis was carried out using an Olympus IX70 with the MagnaFire digital charge-coupled device camera system. In situ cell extraction was performed essentially as described (17Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cell extraction was performed either in situ on coverslips for immunostaining analysis or in test tubes for Western blot analysis. The same number of cells were used for the extraction in test tubes. Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, and 3 mm MgCl2). Cells were extracted using CSK buffer with 0.5% Triton-X for 5 min at 4 °C to remove soluble cytoplasmic proteins. Cells were then treated with an extraction buffer (42.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 8.5 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm MgCl2, 1% Tween 20, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cytoskeletal proteins. The cells were subsequently treated with CSK buffer (containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2), 0.5% Triton X, and 100 μg/ml DNase I (Worthington) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with 0.25 m ammonium sulfate in CSK. In a control sample, cells were treated with the same buffer without DNase I. Between each step, cells were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was recovered as the CSK extraction and DNase fractions. The pellet was washed twice in CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The experiments were repeated at least three times. The intensities of the protein bands in the Western blots from at least three experiments were quantitated by NIH IMAGE. The in vitro aster assembly assay was performed using the protocol of Gaglio et al. (18Gaglio T. Dionnne M.A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Gaglio T. Saredi A. Bingham J.B. Hasbani M.J. Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Compton D.A. J.

Briefly, HeLa cells were synchronized at mitosis as described above. Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off and incubated with 20 μg/ml cytochalasin B. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in KHM buffer (78 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride) containing cytochalasin B at a concentration of ∼3 × 107cells/ml. Cells were Dounce-homogenized, and the crude extract was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and a fraction of it was subjected to immunodepletion. Approximately 10–20 μg of either preimmune IgG purified with protein A beads, antigen affinity-purified anti-hSMC1, anti-hSMC3, anti-SA-1N, anti-hRAD21, or anti-BRCA1 antibody were coupled to protein A beads and incubated with 20 μl of mitotic extracts for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were spun down, the supernatants were collected, and the depletion process was repeated. The final supernatants were passed through empty spin columns to remove any remaining beads. The supernatants were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in the presence of 2.5 mm ATP and 10 μm taxol for the in vitro aster assembly. After the reaction, a small portion of each sample was dropped onto a coverslip and subjected to immunofluorescent staining with an antibody specific for β-tubulin (Sigma) or co-stained with anti-NuMA antibody. The remaining portions of the samples were used for Western blot analysis to detect the presence of hSMC1, β-tubulin, and NuMA. Mitotic asters assembled in a control reaction without immunodepletion were sedimented at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C as described (18Gaglio T. Dionnne M.A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the presence of NuMA and hSMC1 in the supernatant and pellet was analyzed by Western blot. Previously, we identified the stable heterodimeric complex of hSMC1 and hSMC3 in human cells (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of the endogenous hSMC1 and hSMC3 proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts indicates that the SMC molecules are engaged in a highly stable heterodimeric complex resistant to a mild denaturant (2 m guanidine) in an equimolar ratio in the absence of any other associated proteins (Fig. 1 A). Because microinjection of an antibody against hSMC1 blocked the progression of metaphase in the previous study (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we first wanted to determine whether hSMC1-hSMC3 is still in the cohesin complex in mitotic cells. Under the coimmunoprecipitation condition, including a 1 m salt wash, human cohesin containing hRAD21 and SA1/SA2 is coimmunopurified with antibody specific for hSMC1 (Fig. 1, B and C). The association of hRAD21 and SA1/SA2 with hSMC1-hSMC3, although resistant to the 1 m salt wash, is sensitive to 2m guanidine unlike the interaction between hSMC1 and hSMC3 (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, an hSMC1-hSMC3 heterodimer is a core subunit of cohesin, and hRAD21 and SA1/SA2 associate with it. The presence of hRad21 was also confirmed by peptide sequence analysis of the 115-kDa protein corresponding to hRAD21 (KINHL (amino acid 210) and KGGEADNLDEFLK (amino acid 410)) (GenBankTM accession numberD38551) (21Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarabayashi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The amounts of hRAD21 and SA1/SA2 coimmunoprecipitated with anti-hSMC1 antibody are comparable between S- and M-phase extracts, indicating that hSMC1-hSMC3 is part of cohesin during both S phase and mitosis (Fig. 1, B andC). Anti-SA1N antibody (directed against the N terminus of SA1) detected both SA1 and SA2, whereas anti-SA1C (against the C terminus) antibody detected a single protein species (SA1), consistent with the different C-terminal sequences in SA1 and SA2 (Fig. 1,C and D) (5Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Because bovine SMC1 and SMC3 was found to be part of the recombination repair complex, RC-1 (22Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the presence of DNA ligase III in the hSMC1 coimmunoprecipitation was also examined. DNA ligase III was not detected in our coimmunoprecipitation from HeLa nuclear extracts, indicating that the RC-1 repair complex represents a very minor complex in human cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that hSMC1-hSMC3 is in the cohesin complex in both S phase and mitotic cells at similar levels. The specificity of the antigen affinity-purified antibodies specific for hSMC1, hSMC3, hRAD21, and SA1N and SA1C was demonstrated by Western blot analysis using crude HeLa extracts from various cell cycle stages (14Schmiesing J.A. Ball A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as well as mitotic whole cell extracts (Fig. 1 D). Using the above antibodies, we next tested whether cohesin localizes to specific sites in mitotic cells. We performed a partial in situ extraction of soluble proteins for this purpose (CSK extraction, see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that a subpopulation of cohesin localizes to spindle poles in mitotic cells, both in metaphase and anaphase (Fig. 2). Spindle pole staining was detected using antibodies against hSMC1 (produced in two different rabbits), hSMC3, SA1N (which also recognizes SA2), and SA1C (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The corresponding preimmune antisera and antigen-depleted antibodies did not show spindle pole staining, indicating that the staining is antigen-specific (data not shown). The spindle pole localization was verified by co-staining with both β- and γ-tubulin antibodies (data not shown). Thus, cohesin is present at spindle poles during mitosis. Based on the above results, we next tested for potential interactions of cohesin with proteins that are known to localize to the spindle poles. We found that cohesin specifically interacts with NuMA. NuMA plays an important role in mitotic spindle organization in vivo and in vitro (20Gaglio T. Saredi A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 693-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). NuMA interacts with dynein/dynactin and β-tubulin and is targeted to the mitotic spindle poles by the dynein/dynactin-dependent transport mechanism (23Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 24Merdes A. Heald R. Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). An anti-hSMC3 antibody co-precipitated NuMA from mitotic HeLa extracts, which is resistant to a 1 m salt wash (Fig. 3, lane 4). Neither the protein A beads alone nor the preimmune antibody precipitated NuMA (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). Because NuMA interacts with dynein and β-tubulin, cohesin interaction with these proteins was also tested. Anti-hSMC3 antibody coimmunoprecipitated dynein and β-tubulin from mitotic extracts (Fig. 3, lanes 5–15). No dynein or β-tubulin was precipitated with protein A beads alone or with preimmune IgG (lanes 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14). In contrast to the NuMA interaction, however, these interactions were entirely sensitive to 1 m salt, indicating that the interaction is weaker and may be indirect (Fig. 3,lanes 8 and 15). The interaction of NuMA and cohesin was also examined in S phase (Fig. 4, A and B). Anti-hSMC1 antibody co-precipitated NuMA from both S and M phase extracts (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and6). In contrast, CNAP1 (hCAP-D2), a component of the condensin complex that is present abundantly in the mitotic cytoplasm as well as on chromosomes (17Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), failed to co-precipitate with hSMC1, demonstrating the specificity of the coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 9–12). Consistently, NuMA reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated hSMC1 from both S- and M-phase extracts (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, SA1/SA2, hRAD21, and NuMA co-precipitated each other in a 1 m salt-resistant manner (data not shown). Interestingly, among the multiple species of NuMA, only a subspecies of NuMA appears to tightly interact with cohesin (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 4; Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1, 2,5, and 6). The one that preferentially interacts with cohesin in a 1 m salt-resistant manner differs between S and M phases, a faster migrating species in S phase and a slower one in M phase (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and6). NuMA was shown to be hyperphosphorylated in a mitosis-specific manner by cdc2 kinase, which results in slower migration of the protein in SDS-PAGE (25Hsu H.-L. Yeh N.-H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 277-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was shown to be critical for the proper targeting of NuMA to spindle microtubules and is thus important for the function of NuMA in spindle organization (26Compton D.A. Luo C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 621-633PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that cohesin specifically interacts with NuMA localized at the spindle structure in mitosis (Fig. 3, lane 4; Fig. 4 A,lane 6). However, the tight interaction was only seen with a subpopulation of each form of NuMA (Fig. 4 A, compare 1 m salt and guanidine eluate), and the peak of NuMA in sucrose density gradient centrifugation did not coincide with that of cohesin, indicating that NuMA is not a component of cohesin (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, the identified interaction of cohesin with the known spindle pole-associated protein NuMA, as well as weaker but specific interactions with dynein and β-tubulin, further supports the observed localization of cohesin at the spindle poles. NuMA was shown to associate with the nuclear matrix during interphase (27Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because cohesin interacts with NuMA in interphase, we next tested whether cohesin also associates with the nuclear matrix. We performed serial extractions of cells on coverslips with detergent and DNase I to visualize the proteins tightly associated with the nuclear matrix (28Fey E.G. Wan K.M. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Completion of DNA digestion and extraction was monitored by the disappearance of DAPI staining (Fig. 5, panel 4). The results revealed that a significant amount of hSMC1 associates tightly with the nuclear matrix. Similar results were obtained with antibodies against hSMC3, hRAD21, and SA1/SA2 (data not shown). No significant difference was observed between the cells extracted with or without high salt after DNase I treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that the observed nuclear matrix localization is due to the precipitation of cohesin proteins. The nuclear matrix association of cohesin contrasts with the observation noted with condensin, the other SMC-containing complex, the nuclear localization of which was sensitive to DNase I treatment (17Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We next performed the same experiments"

This heterodimeric protein possesses a regulatory subunit carrying a heme where NO binding occurs, while the second subunit harbors the catalytic site. The binding of NO and the subsequent breaking of the bond between the proximal histidine and the heme-Fe2+ are assumed to induce conformational changes, which are the origin of the catalytic activation. At the molecular level, the activation and deactivation mechanisms are unknown, as is the dynamics of NO once in the heme pocket. Using ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, we measured the kinetics of NO rebinding to sGC after photodissociation. The main spectral transient in the Soret band does not match the equilibrium difference spectrum of NO-liganded minus unliganded sGC, and the geminate rebinding was found to be monoexponential and ultrafast (τ = 7.5 ps), with a relative amplitude close to unity (0.97). These characteristics, so far not observed in other hemoproteins, indicate that NO encounters a high energy barrier for escaping from the heme pocket once the His–Fe2+ bond has been cleaved; this bond does not reform before NO recombination. The deactivation of isolated sGC cannot occur by only simple diffusion of NO from the heme; therefore, several allosteric states may be inferred, including a desensitized one, to induce NO release. Thus, besides the structural change leading to activation, a consequence of the decoupling of the proximal histidine may also be to induce a change of the heme pocket distal geometry, which raises the energy barrier for NO escape, optimizing the efficiency of NO trapping. The non-single exponential character of the NO picosecond rebinding coexists only with the presence of the protein structure surrounding the heme, and the single exponential rate observed in sGC is very likely to be due to a closed conformation of the heme pocket. Our results emphasize the physiological importance of NO geminate recombination in hemoproteins like nitric-oxide synthase and sGC and show that the protein structure controls NO dynamics in a manner adapted to their function.

The binding of NO induces a several hundred-fold increase of the sGC catalytic activity, leading to cGMP production from GTP. This heterodimeric enzyme possesses a heme in the β-subunit where NO binding takes place, while the α-subunit harbors the catalytic site, which binds the precursor substrate GTP. The second messenger cGMP then triggers the downstream events leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Regarding diatomic ligand binding, sGC differs from other hemoproteins like myoglobin or hemoglobin; while sGC displays a very high affinity for NO, its affinity for O2 is very low, but the structural features giving rise to this property are unknown. As in Hb and Mb, the heme iron of sGC is bound to a His side chain (5Wedel B. Humbert P. Hartenek C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon binding of NO to the heme, the His–Fe2+ bond is cleaved, as reflected by the change in Soret absorption position, leading to a five-coordinate Fe2+ with NO on the distal side. This event is thought to trigger the structural changes that occur in the regulatory β-subunit and propagate through the interface between subunits and then lead to the activated conformation of sGC. Furthermore, the protoheme alone enables the activation of sGC depleted in heme independently of NO (7Friebe A. Wedel B. Hartenek C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), showing that, besides the absence of the His–Fe2+ bond, the presence of the heme is essential for maintaining the activated conformation of sGC. When the NO-sGC complex forms from NO in solution, a transient six-coordinate heme occurs before the formation of the five-coordinate activated species (8Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, many structural features of the protein and mechanisms of its action, such as the nature of the molecular events that follow His-heme bond cleavage, the subsequent activation, and the deactivation processes, remain unknown. Two possible deactivation mechanisms have been hypothesized; the first one involves simple diffusion of NO from the heme pocket (9Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 11Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and possible subsequent scavenging by an agent like hemoglobin (12Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In a second model, sGC would deactivate before NO release by increasing the rate of NO release through an allosteric transition. The possible action of an endogenous effector is supported by the observation that deactivation occurs faster in whole cells (13Bellamy T.G. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or in cytosol preparations (14Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) than it does in the isolated enzyme. The nature of this possible effector has been the subject of different hypotheses. The substrate or the product cGMP itself could bind close to the heme, exerting a feedback action (15Tomita T. Ogura T. Tsuyama S. Imai I. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10155-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); alternatively, a proteic factor (16Kim T.D. Burstyn J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might directly interact with either subunit, although it would act on a different time scale from that of NO diffusion from the heme. The action of proteins must be regulated at different levels and on different time scales. In the case of nitric-oxide synthase, physiological regulation occurs at the level of gene expression and/or via effectors binding, but such mechanisms for sGC still await demonstration. However, regulation mechanisms at the molecular level, by means of the control of ligand dynamics on the ultrafast time scale are necessary and expected. More specifically, the control of NO dynamics in the vicinity of the heme, including binding and release, may be involved in the physiological regulation of sGC activity. To investigate these points, we measured the kinetics of NO rebinding after photodissociation by using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy in the picosecond range. This allows the probing of the dynamics of NO when sGC is in the activated state. We purified sGC from bovine lung using a modified method from Mulsch and Gerzer (17Mulsch A. Gerzer R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Stone and Marletta (18Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14668-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. One kg of bovine lung was homogenized in 1 liter of buffer (25 mmTEA, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through eight layers of gauze and then centrifuged again at 40,000 × g for 2 h. One liter of this surpernatant was loaded by means of a peristaltic pump (3 ml/min) onto a column (2.5 cm × 90 cm) containing Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Sigma) previously equilibrated with homogenizing buffer. The column was then washed with two volumes of the same buffer. All of the following chromatographic steps were performed using an Akta Purifier FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 400 mm NaCl (flow 2.5 ml/min). The elution profile was continuously monitored for absorption at 280, 430, and 460 nm as well as for pH and conductivity. The fractions (10 ml each) were assayed for cyclase activity (see below), and the active ones were pooled and diluted 3 times in buffer without NaCl to get about 85 mm NaCl. This solution (about 220 ml) was then loaded onto a high resolution anion exchange column (Source 30Q; 2.6 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was subsequently washed with two volumes of buffer A (25 mm TEA, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine). The proteins were eluted by means of a linear gradient from 50 to 400 mm NaCl (2.5 ml/min). The 10-ml fractions were assayed for GMP cyclase activity. The more active ones were pooled (60 ml in total) and concentrated in a stirring concentrator with a 50-kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore Corp.) under argon at a positive pressure of 1 bar. The solution was supplemented with additional DTT (5 mm), and 8 ml were injected onto a high resolution gel filtration column (Superdex 200pg; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 2.6 × 60 cm), from which proteins were separated using an isocratic elution with buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fractions (25 ml in total) were concentrated in a centrifugation device with a 50-kDa cut-off membrane (Ultrafree-15; Millipore) to 3 ml. The buffer A was exchanged for buffer G (same as buffer A but without NaCl and containing 5 mmMnCl2). This last solution concentrated to 1.5 ml was loaded into a GTP-agarose affinity column (2.6 × 3 cm; Sigma) equilibrated with buffer G, which was immediately eluted (0.5 ml/min) with a linear gradient from buffer G to buffer C (25 mm TEA, pH 7.4, 6 mmATP, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine). The purified sGC was eluted as a single peak at 62% of buffer C (about 3.7 mm ATP). The active fractions (9 ml) are pooled and concentrated to 50 μl. For spectroscopic measurements, the buffer was exchanged for only 25 mm TEA, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, by means of successive dilutions and centrifugations in order to obtain less than 50 nm ATP and DTT. The specific activity (see below) was measured, and the presence of two bands at 72–75 kDa was checked on 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS electrophoresis. The Q-Sepharose fast flow chromatography allowed the rapid processing of a large amount of crude supernatant, and the very high resolution anionic exchange medium for the second step was found to be more efficient than the use of blue Sepharose. The GTP affinity medium was progressively degraded by sGC and was used only twice. The ultrafast kinetic measurements were completed within 4 days following the last column elution. The activity of sGC in the fractions was measured after each column. In a first step, cGMP was synthesized by sGC from GTP, based on the method proposed by Mulsch and Gerzer (17Mulsch A. Gerzer R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and then the cGMP is assayed by immunodetection using a commercial kit and 96-well microtitration plates (RPN 226;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The incubation buffer for cGMP formation contained 100 mmTEA, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 150 units/liter creatine phosphokinase, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.1 mm sodium nitroprusside. An aliquot (5 or 10 μl) of the fractions to be assayed was mixed with 90 μl of this buffer previously warmed at 37 °C. Incubation was performed for 10 min and then stopped by placing the tubes on ice and immediately adding 400 μl of zinc acetate followed by 500 μl of Na2CO3. The precipitate was separated by centrifugation at 4 °C (10 min, 14,000 rpm), and 10 μl of the supernatant were put in polypropylene tubes for acetylation simultaneously to the cGMP standards (2–512 fmol of cGMP) and diluted with buffer to 500 μl. All of the samples were then acetylated by adding 50 μl of acetic anhydride/triethylamine (33:67 mixture), and then 50 μl of the acetylated samples were deposited into the wells of the antibody-coated microtitration plate. The manufacturer's instructions were followed for the subsequent steps. The protein content was assayed by means of the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) adapted for a microtitration plate with bovine serum albumin as a standard. We obtained specific activities of 1.2 ± 0.3 μmol of cGMP/min/mg of protein in the presence of Mn2+ (3 mm) and 0.1 mm sodium nitroprusside. An aliquot of sGC solution (70 μl at about 30–50 μm) was put in a 1-mm optical path length quartz cell sealed with a rubber stopper and degassed with four cycles of vacuum and purging with argon (99.9999%; Alphagaz). Since sGC is purified directly in its ferrous state, it was not necessary to add any reducing agent; however, we verified that no change occurred in the Soret band upon the addition of sodium dithionite. For preparing NO-liganded sGC, 1 ± 0.02% NO diluted in N2 (Alphagaz) was directly introduced into the spectroscopic cell through the gas train at a total pressure of 1.3 bar (about 20 μm NO in the aqueous phase), and a second stopper (silicone) was stacked on the cell; for CO-liganded sGC, we used 100% CO (Alphagaz). Equilibrium spectra were recorded at each step for monitoring the evolution of the Soret band. Horse heart myoglobin (80 μm) was prepared from lyophilized powder (Sigma) dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and reduced with sodium dithionite. Time-resolved spectroscopy was performed with the pump-probe laser system previously described (19Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Photodissociation of NO was achieved with an excitation wavelength in the α band at 560 nm with a pulse duration of 40 fs and a repetition rate of 30 Hz. The transient absorption after a variable delay was probed with a wide spectrum pulse from a continuum, whose group velocity dispersion was minimized at 415 nm by double path in a line of prisms. The same sample quartz cell (1-mm optical path length) was used for recording equilibrium spectra and for kinetics, and the absorbance of samples was in the range 0.2–0.6 at the maximum of the Soret band. The sample was continuously moved perpendicularly to the laser beam during the recording, and the temperature was 18 °C. Time windows of 6, 20, and 100 ps were scanned, and up to 80 scans were recorded and averaged with a dwell time of 2 s at each point. Analysis of the data was performed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the time-wavelength matrix (20Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1988: 59-70Google Scholar), and the kinetics associated with the SVD components having the highest singular value were fit with a minimum number of exponential components. Recording of NO-liganded reduced myoglobin kinetics was performed under identical conditions. The equilibrium spectrum of unliganded sGC under argon is displayed in Fig. 1 A. The enzyme is purified with the heme in the reduced form and reveals a characteristic absorption maximum at 431.5 nm. After the addition of 1% NO, the Soret band immediately shifts to 399 nm upon formation of the NO-five-coordinate species, and the difference spectrum shows a maximum and a minimum located at 434 and 397 nm, respectively. The raw difference spectra at successive time delays after photolysis of NO are displayed in Fig. 1 B. Two main features are observed: 1) the maximum of induced absorption centered at about 426 nm and the minimum of bleaching at 395 nm decrease without shifting, within the spectral resolution, and 2) a shift of the isosbestic point occurs within 4 ps from ∼408 to 405 nm. A similar shift also appears around 460 nm in the same time range. These shifts indicate that excited state species are involved in the early time kinetics. We performed an SVD of the time-wavelength matrix, which resulted in two spectral components (Fig. 1 C). The main component (SVD1) corresponds to geminate recombination, as shown by the decrease of the bleaching at 395 nm, due to the five-coordinate Fe2+-NO formation. The second spectral component (SVD2; Fig. 1 C), whose intensity is lower, is associated with the decay of the excited states of photodissociated heme, as has been identified in the case of hemoglobin and myoglobin (21Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The higher rank SVD components contained only contributions considered as noise within the resolution of the experiment. The kinetics associated with the SVD1 component, which corresponds to NO geminate recombination (Fig. 2 A), was fit to a monoexponential function (τ = 7.5 ps; A = 0.97 ± 0.01) with a very low base line (A 2= 0.03), revealing a very fast and almost complete rebinding of NO. The comparison with NO rebinding to Mb, which follows biexponential kinetics, and to endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, which is still unliganded after 50 ps, reveals the differences of the control of the NO dynamics by the three proteins. The transient spectrum after 2 ps following dissociation of NO is compared with that of wild type myoglobin (Fig. 2 B), which reveals the maximum absorption and a minimum of bleaching at 438 and 418 nm, respectively, while sGC shows these features located at 426 and 395 nm, indicating that the coordination state of the heme-iron is different for both proteins at 2 ps. We measured the rebinding of CO to sGC in order to compare it with its behavior in Mb. The equilibrium spectra of unliganded and CO-liganded sGC are shown in Fig. 3 A(inset) together with the kinetics. CO binding results in an absorption spectrum with a maximum at 424 nm, similar to MbCO. The kinetics reveal the presence of two excited state transients (associated with a 0.9-ps rise and a 3-ps decay in the first time window) and a long lived unliganded ground state sGC (τ > 5 ns). Clearly, CO does not rebind to sGC on a short time scale, similarly to myoglobin. Remarkably, the transient difference spectra are similar for Mb and sGC (Fig. 3 B), and both are superimposable with the unliganded minus CO-liganded equilibrium difference spectra, showing that the coordination states are identical in both cases. We made attempts to remove liganded NO from sGC by means of several vacuum-argon cycles for scavenging NO. The absorption at 399 nm did not decrease even after 24 h. We then tried to replace NO by CO (100% CO, 1.4 bar in the gas phase) in the same sample. Only a very small shoulder appeared around 420 nm, with no significant decrease of the absorption at 399 nm. We then photodissociated NO in the laser beam in the presence of 100% CO for 2 h (at 30 Hz; 18 °C), but no subsequent evolution of the steady-state spectrum was observed. Further degassing led to the disappearance of the shoulder due to CO but only to a very small decrease of the Soret band due to NO-liganded species. This shows that the affinity for NO is such that it cannot be removed quickly by diffusion, when removing free NO, or competing with CO. The spectra of the excited states constitute markers of the heme-iron coordination state. We thus measured the kinetics of reduced unliganded sGC in order to compare its excited state spectrum with that of the five-coordinate heme in Mb and with that of sGC after NO and CO photodissociation. The results are shown in Fig. 4, and the evolution of the differential spectrum for unliganded sGC is presented in Fig. 4 A as raw data, similar to data previously reported for Mb (21Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 22Vos M.H. Lambry J.-C. Martin J.-L. J. Chin. Chem. Soc. 2000; 47: 765-768Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and similar to the spectral evolution of the unliganded oxygen sensor FixL that we also recorded. While the main SVD component is the spectral evolution of an excited state for unliganded proteins (Fig. 4 B), in the case of liganded sGC, the second SVD spectral component corresponds to an excited state species decaying in 2 and 3.2 ps, respectively, after NO and CO photorelease (Fig. 4 C); SVD1 is geminate rebinding in this case. This spectrum is identical for both unliganded proteins, with a maximum of induced absorption located at 445 ± 1 nm. When sGC is liganded with CO, the photodissociation produces an excited state whose spectrum is similar to that of unliganded proteins (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas the photodissociation of NO leads to a different spectrum with a maximum at 434 nm and two absorption bands developing below 400 nm and above 440 nm. The bleaching around 410 nm should thus be due to the appearance of a ground state heme. This SVD2 differential spectrum evolves with a time constant of 2 ps, close to the values observed (21Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) for the decay of an excited state assigned to the heme still being in a near planar conformation. The binding of NO induces the breaking of the His–Fe2+ bond, which is hypothesized to be the first molecular event leading to activation of sGC through structural changes. A major question is the reversibility of this process and its consequences for the deactivation of sGC. If only NO diffusion from the heme pocket to the solvent allows a fast deactivation, the dissociation of NO would lead to reformation of the His–Fe2+ bond; consequently, a His-five-coordinate heme and a six-coordinate intermediate species would be involved in the transient spectra. There are at least two species involved in the raw differential spectra (Fig. 1 B), as shown by the shift of the isosbestic points, which give rise to two SVD spectral components (Fig. 1 C). The major component corresponds to NO rebinding to a ground state species, while the second corresponds to the disappearance of an excited species. Since the spectra of the four-coordinate heme species are not known, either in the excited or in the ground state, we compared the major spectral feature with that obtained from systems possessing a heme that cannot form a transient proximal fifth coordination after photodissociation. We have measured the kinetics and spectra of NO rebinding to the H93G mutant of myoglobin, 2M. Négrerie, S. Franzen, M. H. Vos, J.-C. Lambry, S. G. Boxer, and J.-L. Martin, submitted for publication. which lacks the coupling coordination between the proximal His and the iron (23Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24De Pillis G. Decatur S.M. Barrick D. Boxer S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6981-6982Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hemoproteins lacking such a proximal side chain are liganded with a water molecule in the absence of NO (25Wilks A. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2925-2926Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Das T.K. Franzen S. Pond A. Dawson J.H. Rousseau D.L. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 38: 1952-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, Decatur et al. (27Decatur M.S. Franzen S. De Pillis G.D. Dyer R.B. Woodruff W.H. Boxer S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4939-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have shown by Raman spectroscopy that H93G-Mb is not six- but five-coordinate in its NO-liganded steady state, in agreement with a Soret position at 400 nm. Consequently, this mutant becomes four-coordinate immediately upon photodissociation and cannot form a His-five-coordinate species before NO rebinding. We found that both the four-coordinate Mb mutant and sGC show a raw transient difference spectrum after NO photodissociation similarly shifted with respect to that of wild type Mb, suggesting identical coordinated heme intermediates for both proteins during the first picoseconds. Therefore, we assigned the transient spectrum characterized by a 7.5-ps decay time and an absorption band centered at 426 nm (Fig. 1 B) to the rebinding of NO to a four-coordinate ground state heme. A spectrum similar to that of sGC was observed for two wild type myoglobin species at low pH (28Duprat A.F. Traylor T.G. Wu G.Z. Coletta M. Sharma V.S. Walda K.N. Magde D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2634-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a condition that leads to the breaking of the Fe2+-His bond and to the lack of proximal ligation after photodissociation of NO; a broad induced absorption appears centered between 424 and 428 nm and assigned to the transient four-coordinate heme. The kinetics of NO binding from the solution measured by stopped flow (8Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) clearly reveal the presence of a six-coordinate intermediate absorbing at 420 nm before the formation of the final NO-five-coordinate activated form. Furthermore, this study revealed that the conversion from six- to NO-five-coordinate heme is 103 times slower than the initial binding step. Thus, the conversion of six- to five-coordinate heme subsequent to NO recombination is unlikely to occur on the picosecond time scale. If the histidine would rebind before NO, we should observe both His-five- and His-six-coordinate intermediate species. In this case, there should be a differential spectral transient with a bleaching at 400 nm simultaneous to an induced absorption around 420 nm, characteristic of six-coordinate heme as detected by Zhao et al. (8Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and another one with an induced absorption located around 431 nm. We did not observe such transients associated with His rebinding, but we found only one spectral feature corresponding to NO rebinding to a ground state species absorbing at 426 nm. These data support the assignment of NO rebinding directly to a four-coordinate heme. The transient spectrum of the unliganded sGC is identical to that o"
