https://openalex.org/W2268491398,"The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 cleaves double-stranded DNA targets complementary to the guide RNA and has been applied to programmable genome editing. Cas9-mediated cleavage requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) juxtaposed with the DNA target sequence, thus constricting the range of targetable sites. Here, we report the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structures of Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9), one of the largest Cas9 orthologs, in complex with a guide RNA and its PAM-containing DNA targets. A structural comparison of FnCas9 with other Cas9 orthologs revealed striking conserved and divergent features among distantly related CRISPR-Cas9 systems. We found that FnCas9 recognizes the 5'-NGG-3' PAM, and used the structural information to create a variant that can recognize the more relaxed 5'-YG-3' PAM. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FnCas9-ribonucleoprotein complex can be microinjected into mouse zygotes to edit endogenous sites with the 5'-YG-3' PAM, thus expanding the target space of the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox."
https://openalex.org/W2269299490,"Microtubule-severing enzymes are critical for the biogenesis and maintenance of complex microtubule arrays in axons, spindles, and cilia where tubulin detyrosination, acetylation, and glutamylation are abundant. These modifications exhibit stereotyped patterns suggesting spatial and temporal control of microtubule functions. Using human-engineered and differentially modified microtubules we find that glutamylation is the main regulator of the hereditary spastic paraplegia microtubule severing enzyme spastin. Glutamylation acts as a rheostat and tunes microtubule severing as a function of glutamate number added per tubulin. Unexpectedly, glutamylation is a non-linear biphasic tuner and becomes inhibitory beyond a threshold. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of localized glutamylation propagates across neighboring microtubules, modulating severing in trans. Our work provides the first quantitative evidence for a graded response to a tubulin posttranslational modification and a biochemical link between tubulin glutamylation and complex architectures of microtubule arrays such as those in neurons where spastin deficiency causes disease."

Little is known about how such ensembles emerge during acquisition and eventually form the cellular engram. Manipulating the activity of granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG), we reveal a mechanism of lateral inhibition that modulates the size of the cellular engram. GCs engage somatostatin-positive interneurons that inhibit the dendrites of surrounding GCs. Our findings reveal a microcircuit within the DG that controls the size of the cellular engram and the stability of contextual fear memory."
https://openalex.org/W2337180881,"Recent studies have emphasized the role of perivascular inflammation in cardiovascular disease. We studied mechanisms of perivascular leukocyte infiltration in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension and their links to vascular dysfunction. Chronic Ang II infusion in mice increased immune cell content of T cells (255 ± 130 to 1664 ± 349 cells/mg; P < 0.01), M1 and M2 macrophages, and dendritic cells in perivascular adipose tissue. In particular, the content of T lymphocytes bearing CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 1, CCR3, and CCR5 receptors for RANTES chemokine was increased by Ang II (CCR1, 15.6 ± 1.5% vs. 31 ± 5%; P < 0.01). Hypertension was associated with an increase in perivascular adipose tissue expression of the chemokine RANTES (relative quantification, 1.2 ± 0.2 vs. 3.5 ± 1.1; P< 0.05), which induced T-cell chemotaxis and vascular accumulation of T cells expressing the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5. Mechanistically, RANTES–/– knockout protected against vascular leukocyte, and in particular T lymphocyte infiltration (26 ± 5% in wild type Ang II vs. 15 ± 4% in RANTES–/–), which was associated with protection from endothelial dysfunction induced by Ang II. This effect was linked with diminished infiltration of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ and double-negative CD3+CD4–CD8– T cells in perivascular space and reduced vascular oxidative stress while FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells were unaltered. IFN-γ ex vivo caused significant endothelial dysfunction, which was reduced by superoxide anion scavenging. In a human cohort, a significant inverse correlation was observed between circulating RANTES levels as a biomarker and vascular function measured as flow-mediated dilatation (R = –0.3, P < 0.01) or endothelial injury marker von Willebrand factor (R= +0.3; P< 0.01). Thus, chemokine RANTES is important in the regulation of vascular dysfunction through modulation of perivascular inflammation.—Mikolajczyk, T.

Transcriptional regulation during differentiation and organogenesis relies on the fine quantitative regulation of thousands of genes.

The nature and importance of heterotypic TF interactions are therefore incompletely understood. The T-box TF TBX5 and the homeodomain TF NKX2-5 regulate several aspects of heart development (Bruneau et al., 2001Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A.

TBX5 and NKX2-5 can interact physically, and their potential for co-activation of target genes is apparent in their synergistic action in vitro on reporter constructs (Bruneau et al., 2001Bruneau B.G.

This interaction has been proposed to be the basis for the similar congenital heart defects caused by mutations in either TBX5 or NKX2-5 in humans (Basson et al., 1997Basson C.T. Bachinsky D.R.

Similarly, mutations in the zinc finger TF gene GATA4 result in congenital heart defects, and GATA4 has been proposed to be a functional partner of TBX5 and NKX2-5 (Durocher et al., 1997Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M.

Joo K. et al.GATA4 mutations cause human congenital heart defects and reveal an interaction with TBX5.Nature. 2003; 424: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice doubly heterozygous for null alleles of Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 or Tbx5 and Gata4 have defects in heart formation that are more severe than those caused by each individual mutation (Maitra et al., 2009Maitra M. Schluterman M.K. Nichols H.A. Richardson J.A. Lo C.W. Srivastava D. Garg V. Interaction of Gata4 and Gata6 with Tbx5 is critical for normal cardiac development.Dev.

Relative doses of TBX5, NKX2-5, and GATA4 are clearly important, but it is not known what the overlapping roles are for these important cardiac TFs or how this interaction is coordinated at the genomic or molecular level. TBX5 and GATA4 can, together with additional factors, induce cardiac gene expression programs de novo (Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G.

Bruneau B.G. Directed transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to heart tissue by defined factors.Nature. 2009; 459: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Therefore, they are clearly positioned in a robust gene-regulatory network. Drosophila orthologs of TBX5, NKX2-5, and GATA4 function together as a collective unit with shared binding that does not rely on motif grammar (Junion et al., 2012Junion G. Spivakov M. Girardot C. Braun M. Gustafson E.H. Birney E. Furlong E.E. A transcription factor collective defines cardiac cell fate and reflects lineage history.Cell. 2012; 148: 473-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism is retained in mammals is not known. A mechanistic understanding of the collaborative function of TBX5, NKX2-5, and GATA4 will have important implications for understanding congenital heart disease and for developing strategies for cardiac regeneration and, more broadly, for understanding fundamental principles of heterotypic TF interactions. Here, we examined the overlapping function of TBX5 and NKX2-5 in mouse cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis and their relationship with GATA4. We find that they function cooperatively across the genome, participating in a complex and dynamic TF network regulating programs of gene expression required for expansion of cardiac progenitors and for cardiac differentiation. This cooperative interaction relies on the interdependent binding of the three TFs. The crystal structure of the ternary complex of TBX5 and NKX2-5 and a bona fide DNA target provides an atomic structural basis for this interdependent interaction. We also find that, surprisingly, in the absence of TBX5 or NKX2-5 (or both), the remaining TFs redistribute to other genomic sites associated with genes with increased expression in the TF-null cells. Therefore, in addition to cooperative binding for gene activation, the interdependent binding of heterotypic factors serves to prevent TF distribution to lineage-inappropriate sites. This redistribution relies on the establishment of new DNA/protein interactions able to induce ectopic gene activation and unveils a tightly regulated genomic distribution that may underlie the dysregulation of gene expression in congenital heart defects. The genomic interactions between TBX5 and NKX2-5, dictated by a preferential motif arrangement, define a molecular and genomic logic for the regulation of mammalian differentiation by heterotypic TFs. Perinatal death of mice doubly heterozygous for Tbx5- and Nkx2-5-null alleles (Moskowitz et al., 2007Moskowitz I.P. Kim J.B. Moore M.L. Wolf C.M. Peterson M.A. Shendure J. Nobrega M.A. Yokota Y.

Using mice carrying a null allele of Nkx2-5 (Tanaka et al., 1999Tanaka M. Chen Z. Bartunkova S. Yamasaki N. Izumo S. The cardiac homeobox gene Csx/Nkx2.5 lies genetically upstream of multiple genes essential for heart development.Development. 1999; 126: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a conditional allele of Tbx5 (Mori et al., 2006Mori A.D.

These ESCs were used to generate entirely ESC-derived WT, single, and double knockout (KO) embryos (Figure S1B). TKO and NKO embryonic day (E) 9.5 embryos recapitulated phenotypes reported previously (Bruneau et al., 2001Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M.

DKO ESCs yielded embryos that died by E9.5 and had, in the most extreme cases, only a small patch of quiescent or very slowly beating heart tissue (Figures 1D, 1E, 1I, 1J, 1N, and 1O). Marker analysis confirmed the significant increase in phenotypic severity in the DKO embryos (Figures 1P–1W).

A second major group with upregulated gene expression in DKO hearts was identified, highlighting the existence of TBX5- and/or NKX2-5-dependent repressed genes (clusters 1–8, yellow bracket). Although major groups showed some regulatory contexts depending on only one or the other TF (clusters 1, 6–8, 11, 15, and 16), complex patterns were also identified (e.g., cluster 9), reflecting complexity in the genetic interaction between Tbx5 and Nkx2-5. For a detailed understanding of the genetic programs regulated by these factors during cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation and to overcome the early lethality of the mutant embryos, we used a directed differentiation system (Kattman et al., 2011Kattman S.J.

The directed differentiation protocol yielded cultures enriched (80%–90%) in cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) (+) beating CMs for all genotypes. The dynamics of differentiation were different across the four genotypes. NKO cells begin spontaneous contractions 12 hr earlier than WT cells, and TKO cells do so 12 hr later. DKO cells begin beating approximately 6 hr later than WT cells, suggesting a major role for TBX5 in the induction of CM differentiation and for NKX2-5 as a repressor of premature cardiac differentiation (Figure 2A; Prall et al., 2007Prall O.W.

We examined gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at the CP and CM stages and clustered transcripts by expression pattern at each specific stage (Figures 2B and 2C; Tables S1 and S2). Although no correlation was found between TKO cells and embryonic gene expression analysis (likely because of the TKO embryonic phenotype, which is largely a hypoplasia of Tbx5-expressing tissue; Bruneau et al., 2001Bruneau B.G.

The analysis of changes in gene ontology (GO) terms between clusters/stages allowed us to understand the temporal dynamics of Tbx5/Nkx2-5-dependent regulation of gene expression (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S2). Concordant with early NKO differentiation, two major groups of Nkx2-5-dependent genes were identified at CPs: repressed genes (CP1 and CP2) associated with cell division and cycle progression and upregulated genes (CP5–CP9) associated with cardiac differentiation and function. Two clusters in this second group (CP8 and CP9) presented a different behavior between NKO and DKO cells, suggesting that genes in these two clusters could be responsible for the different beating initiation between NKO and DKO cells. The dynamics of expression of these clusters showed predominant early expression of downregulated cell proliferation genes (CP1 and CP2) in contrast to later predominant expression of upregulated CM differentiation-specific genes (CP7 and CP9) (Figures 2D and S2A), finding a similar temporal pattern in genes associated with these functions identified at CMs (Figures 2E and S2B). This stage specificity is more obvious in cluster CP9, whose genes are highly expressed in WT cells at CMs, activated by both NKX2-5 and TBX5, but are repressed by NKX2-5 at CPs. These results confirm the role of NKX2-5 as a repressor of premature cardiac differentiation (Prall et al., 2007Prall O.W. Menon M.K. Solloway M.J. Watanabe Y. Zaffran S. Bajolle F. Biben C. McBride J.J. Robertson B.R.

At the CM stage, although NKX2-5 seems to still promote cell proliferation (CM10), NKO cells showed upregulated (CM5, CM9, and CM11) and downregulated (CM6 and CM7) cardiac differentiation genes. In contrast, TBX5 functions as a repressor of proliferative genes (cluster CM10), and is primarily required for CM differentiation (CM3, CM5, CM9, and CM11). We also found clusters with increased or ectopic gene expression in single and double KO cells. For example, cluster CM1 comprised genes with an additive repressor effect of TBX5 and NKX2-5 and was highly enriched for endocardial genes (e.g., Dll4, Edn1, Cdh5, Nrg1, Angpt2, and Cd34) and collagen and extracellular matrix genes, suggesting a role for TBX5 and NKX2-5 in repressing alternate cell lineages during cardiac differentiation. Overall, these results highlight an unappreciated complexity of the interaction between Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 during the progression of cardiac differentiation. To understand mechanisms underlying the dynamic gene regulation described above, we examined the genomic localization of TBX5, NKX2-5, and GATA4 at the CP and CM stages by chromatin immunoprecipitation with exonuclease (ChIP-exo) (Rhee and Pugh, 2011Rhee H.S. Pugh B.F. Comprehensive genome-wide protein-DNA interactions detected at single-nucleotide resolution.Cell. 2011; 147: 1408-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar; Figure 3A). As negative controls for NKX2-5 and TBX5, we used NKO, TKO, and DKO cells. Any footprint (fp) remaining in the KO of the respective factor was discarded. We identified 4,985, 8,718, and 11,000 fps at CPs and 8,952, 25,381, and 10,641 fps at CMs for TBX5, NKX2-5, and GATA4, respectively. Concordant with the dynamics of Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 expression, stage-specific occupancy analysis revealed varied temporal patterns, including single-stage occupancy events and sites occupied in CPs and CMs (Figure 3B). Taking advantage of the high resolution of ChIP-exo, we characterized TBX5, NKX2-5, and GATA4 binding at each stage, performing de novo motif discovery on the fps for each TF. In both stages, the most significantly enriched motifs in NKX2-5 and GATA4 fps matched motifs characterized previously (Figure 3C). For TBX5, the most enriched motif in both stages has a 6-bp consensus s"
https://openalex.org/W2257753958,"Reward motivation is known to modulate memory encoding, and this effect depends on interactions between the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area complex (SN/VTA) and the hippocampus. It is unknown, however, whether these interactions influence offline neural activity in the human brain that is thought to promote memory consolidation. Here we used fMRI to test the effect of reward motivation on post-learning neural dynamics and subsequent memory for objects that were learned in high- and low-reward motivation contexts. We found that post-learning increases in resting-state functional connectivity between the SN/VTA and hippocampus predicted preferential retention of objects that were learned in high-reward contexts. In addition, multivariate pattern classification revealed that hippocampal representations of high-reward contexts were preferentially reactivated during post-learning rest, and the number of hippocampal reactivations was predictive of preferential retention of items learned in high-reward contexts. These findings indicate that reward motivation alters offline post-learning dynamics between the SN/VTA and hippocampus, providing novel evidence for a potential mechanism by which reward could influence memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2273232783,"To discover regularities in human mobility is of fundamental importance to our understanding of urban dynamics, and essential to city and transport planning, urban management and policymaking. Previous research has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable."

This idea originally arose from observations that NMDAR antagonists can transiently induce the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia in healthy individuals (Javitt and Zukin, 1991Javitt D.C.

Decreased NMDAR function may in principle be corrected by pharmacologically boosting activation of the remaining functional NMDARs, yet this approach risks eliciting excitotoxicity through excessive activation of NMDARs (Heng et al., 2009Heng M.Y.

Therefore, to selectively enhance physiological NMDAR function, we set out to discover molecules that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) to enhance the natural physiological pattern of activation of these receptors while avoiding indiscriminate activation caused by stimulation with orthosteric agonists. To further ensure enhancement of physiological, but not pathological, activation of NMDARs, we sought to discover PAMs with selectivity for GluN2A subunit-containing NMDARs. The GluN2 subunit composition is a critical determinant of the physiological and pathological contributions of NMDAR activation (Paoletti et al., 2013Paoletti P. Bellone C. Zhou Q. NMDA receptor subunit diversity: impact on receptor properties, synaptic plasticity and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). During brain development, there is a switch from an early dominance of GluN2B subunit expression to incorporation of GluN2A subunits at mature synapses (Sheng et al., 1994Sheng M. Cummings J.

It recently has become clear that mature synapses contain not only GluN2A diheteromers (GluN1/GluN2A composition), but also a significant portion of triheteromers (GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B), which play key roles in synaptic plasticity and signaling (Gray et al., 2011Gray J.A.

In any case, pharmacological over-activation of GluN2B diheteromers in particular could risk pathogenic consequences. Therefore, the discovery of NMDAR enhancers that selectively potentiate GluN2A-containing NMDARs without affecting GluN2B diheteromeric receptors would not only provide a valuable tool for dissecting physiological NMDAR function, but also could represent an attractive therapeutic approach. Here we describe a novel class of compounds that act as PAMs at GluN2A-containing NMDARs and thus enhance the normal synaptic activation of NMDARs without causing activation in the absence of stimulation. X-ray crystallography reveals that these compounds act via a novel NMDAR positive modulator binding site at the interface between the GluN1 and GluN2A ligand-binding domains (LBDs), a site that is analogous to a known PAM site found in AMPA receptors (AMPARs). These GluN2A PAMs potentiate recombinant diheteromeric and triheteromeric NMDARs as well as native NMDARs in brain slices during synaptic activation. Distinct but chemically related GluN2A PAMs alter channel deactivation kinetics and Glu affinity to varying degrees and also show differing dependence on Glu concentration. These distinct GluN2A PAMs also show differential impacts on synaptic plasticity that correlate with differences in their ability to affect synapses on pyramidal neurons versus interneurons. GluN2A PAMs therefore represent novel tools that can provide insight into the mechanisms of NMDAR activation and the subunit-specific roles of NMDARs in circuit function. This new class of selective NMDAR modulator also demonstrates that NMDARs can be pharmacologically targeted in a manner that may be therapeutically desirable for neurological disorders involving NMDAR hypofunction. To screen for compounds that can enhance NMDAR activation in response to application of Glu in the presence of saturating glycine (Gly), we established a cell-based Ca2+ influx assay using HEK293 cells stably expressing GluN1 and GluN2A. A library of 1.4 million compounds was tested for the ability to increase the Ca2+ influx fluorescence signal significantly above the signal obtained by subsaturating (EC30) Glu alone. GNE-3476 was identified as a hit in this high-throughput screen (HTS), with 6 μM compound leading to a marked enhancement of the response to EC30 Glu (Figures 1A and 1B ). Follow-up assays showed a dose-dependent enhancement of NMDAR activation by GNE-3476 (estimated EC50 = 10.3 μM) (Figure 1C). Subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) led to GluN2A PAMs with enhanced potency in the Ca2+ influx assay compared to GNE-3476, as exemplified by GNE-3419 (2.03 μM EC50), GNE-6901 (0.33 μM), and GNE-8324 (2.43 μM) (Figure 1C). Electrophysiological measurements of NMDAR currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing GluN1 and GluN2A confirmed that these compounds act as allosteric modulators rather than orthosteric agonists, with robust potentiation of the response to saturating Glu (100 μM) under various conditions where compound alone resulted in little to no signal (Figures 1D and S1). We next assessed selectivity of these more potent GluN2A PAMs by determining the dose-response relationship from cell lines expressing GluN1 paired with GluN2B, GluN2C, or GluN2D (Figures 1E–1G). Little or no compound-induced potentiation was detected in the GluN2B and GluN2C cell lines. While significant potentiation of GluN1/GluN2D NMDARs was seen with GNE-3419 and GNE-6901, the potency was 10-fold lower with GluN2D compared to GluN2A NMDARs. The amino-terminal domains (ATDs) of NMDARs can bind an array of ligands that act as subunit-specific allosteric modulators (Zhu and Paoletti, 2015Zhu S. Paoletti P. Allosteric modulators of NMDA receptors: multiple sites and mechanisms.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2015; 20: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Yet functional characterization of NMDARs with chimeric ATDs or ATD deletions demonstrated that the ATD was not required for PAM effects (Figures S2A and S2B). To examine the LBD as a potential binding site, we crystallized and solved a 2.1-Å structure of the isolated human GluN1/GluN2A LBD dimer in complex with GNE-6901. The binding site of GNE-6901 was found to lie at the inter-domain interface between GluN1 and GluN2A LBDs (Figures 2A and 2B ). This site is analogous to the binding site of AMPAR PAM molecules such as cyclothiazide (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and aniracetam (Jin et al., 2005Jin R. Clark S. Weeks A.M. Dudman J.T. Gouaux E. Partin K.M. Mechanism of positive allosteric modulators acting on AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9027-9036Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Yet while the AMPAR PAMs bind a symmetric interface formed between two GluA1 LBD homodimers, the heterodimeric GluN1/GluN2A LBD interface exhibits elements of both symmetry and asymmetry (Figures 2C–2E). Comparison of the binding site of GNE-6901 to an apo GluN1/GluN2A structure (Figure 2C) reveals that the side chains of GluN1 Y535 and GluN2A E530 change rotamer conformations to permit binding of GNE-6901. To test whether these rotamer movements are important for PAM effects on the channel, we mutated GluN1 Y535 and GluN2A E530 to alanine individually or in combination, and we performed functional analysis using oocyte electrophysiology. These alanine mutants showed increased potentiation of NMDAR currents by GNE-6901 while minimally affecting the compound EC50 (Figure S2G), suggesting that rearrangements of the GluN1 Y535 and GluN2A E530 side chains (which are required for formation of the GNE-6901 binding site) do not appear to be required for mediating potentiation. While no previous NMDAR modulators have been shown to bind at the GluN1/GluN2A LBD interface, chimera and mutational analyses have identified interface residues required for the action of the GluN2A-selective negative allosteric modulator (NAM) TCN-201 (Hansen et al., 2012Hansen K.B. Ogden K.K. Traynelis S.F. Subunit-selective allosteric inhibition of glycine binding to NMDA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 6197-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To compare the binding modes of this well-characterized class of NAM with GNE-6901, we attempted co-crystallization of the GluN1/GluN2A LBD with TCN-201 and related compounds. While TCN-201 (compound 1; Bettini et al., 2010Bettini E. Sava A. Griffante C. Carignani C. Buson A. Capelli A.M. Negri M. Andreetta F. Senar-Sancho S.A. Guiral L. Cardullo F. Identification and characterization of novel NMDA receptor antagonists selective for NR2A- over NR2B-containing receptors.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 335: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) did not lead to an X-ray structure, we were able to obtain a 2.5-Å structure of the highly related GluN2A NAM, compound 6 (Bettini et al., 2010Bettini E. Sava A. Griffante C. Carignani C. Buson A. Capelli A.M. Negri M. Andreetta F. Senar-Sancho S.A. Guiral L. Cardullo F. Identification and characterization of novel NMDA receptor antagonists selective for NR2A- over NR2B-containing receptors.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 335: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This structure revealed that compound 6 binds to a distinct but overlapping region of the inter-domain interface as the GluN2A PAMs (Figure 2E). Interestingly, the side chain rotamer conformation of GluN1 Y535 is similar to that found in the apo conformation, while GluN2A E530 moves into a conformation similar to that of the PAM-bound structure to accommodate the pyridine ring of compound 6. Together, these structures identify similar but unique binding sites for GluN2A-selective PAMs and NAMs. In comparing our compound-bound GluN1/GluN2A LBD structure with the full-length GluN1/GluN2B structure (Karakas and Furukawa, 2014Karakas E. Furukawa H. Crystal structure of a heterotetrameric NMDA receptor ion channel.Science. 2014; 344: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2014Lee C.H. Lü W. Michel J.C. Goehring A. Du J. Song X. Gouaux E. NMDA receptor structures reveal subunit arrangement and pore architecture.Nature. 2014; 511: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), we identified an important difference in the PAM-binding site targeted by GNE-6901. V783 in GluN2A is a key border residue of the PAM-binding site, and it is in direct van der Waals contact with the methyl group on the thiazolopyrimidinone core of GNE-6901 (Figure 2D). The much larger corresponding residue, F784 in GluN2B, protrudes into the binding site and may prevent PAM binding to GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs. To test the functional importance of this residue in PAM selectivity, we expressed GluN2A NMDARs with a V783F mutation, as well as GluN2B NMDARs with the converse F784V mutation, in oocytes and tested their sensitivity to GNE-6901. The V783F mutation in GluN2A virtually abolished GNE-6901 sensitivity, while the F784V mutation in GluN2B conferred an ability of GNE-6901 to potentiate GluN1/GluN2B NMDARs (Figures 2F and 2G). This striking swap of sensitivity between GluN2A and GluN2B NMDARs by exchange of a single residue demonstrates that GluN2A V783 is a key determinant of PAM selectivity. Further experiments show that the corresponding residue in GluN2D, which corresponds to a Leucine (L811), is also a determinant of the less potent PAM effect of GNE-6901 observed on GluN2D receptors (Figures S2C–S2F). Interestingly, GluN2A V783 was identified previously as essential for the action of the NAM TCN-201 (Hansen et al., 2012Hansen K.B. Ogden K.K. Traynelis S.F. Subunit-selective allosteric inhibition of glycine binding to NMDA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 6197-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To better characterize the overlapping binding sites of our series of PAMs and the prior series of NAMs, we performed mutational analysis to confirm unique and shared structural determinants. Consistent with predictions from our structures and prior work with TCN-201, we found that while GluN2A V783F blocks the effects of both GNE-6901 and the NAM (compound 6), GluN2A T758A blocks the PAM effect, but not the NAM effect, and GluN1 R755A blocks the NAM effect, but not the PAM effect (Figures 2H and S2H–S2J). This demonstration of both common and specific structural determinants of PAMs and NAMs confirms the overlapping nature of the binding sites. Given that the GluN1/GluN2 heterodimer interface where GNE-6901 binds is equivalent to the binding site of AMPAR PAMs, we tested the selectivity of our GluN2A PAMs against AMPARs using a Ca2+ influx assay in cell lines expressing GluA2 AMPARs. These experiments revealed that, while GNE-3419 potentiates both flip and flop variants of GluA2, GNE-6901 and GNE-8324 show no appreciable activity on these AMPARs (Figures 3A and 3B ). To further dissect mechanisms of NMDAR versus AMPAR selectivity, we attempted to co-crystallize these compounds with the AMPAR LBD dimer (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Mechanisms for activation and antagonism of an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor: crystal structures of the GluR2 ligand binding core.Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Consistent with the functional effect on AMPARs, soaking of GNE-3419 in AMPAR crystals resulted in a compound-bound structure, which revealed that GNE-3419 binds in the AMPAR dimer interface (Figure 3C) in a position equivalent to the PAM-binding site in GluN1/GluN2A (Figure 3D). The corresponding residue to GluN2A V783 in the AMPAR flip isoform is Serine 786, and our structure demonstrates that this Ser residue is not large enough to disrupt the AMPAR-binding pocket. While we did not crystallize the AMPAR LBD with the flop Asn residue at this position (Asn786), our functional assays indicate Asn also does not disrupt GNE-3419 potentiation (Figure 3B). To test for potentiation of native AMPARs during physiological activation, we examined AMPAR excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons during Schaffer collateral stimulation. These experiments were consistent with the cell-based assay, with robust potentiation of AMPAR EPSPs by GNE-3419 and no detectable impact of GNE-6901 (Figures 3E and 3F). Surprisingly, the potentiation of the AMPAR EPSP by GNE-3419 could be reversed with the addition of GNE-6901. Conversely, pre-incubation with GNE-6901 prevented potentiation by subsequent addition of GNE-3419 (Figures S3A–S3D). This dose-dependent antagonism of the GNE-3419 potentiation of AMPARs by GNE-6901, coupled with the absence of any impact of GNE-6901 alone on the AMPAR EPSPs, indicates that GNE-6901 may act as a silent allosteric modulator (SAM) of AMPARs. In other words, the functional selectivity achieved for GluN2A PAMs against AMPARs may be due to a lack of efficacy rather than potency at AMPARs. Given the high degree of sequence similarity between AMPA and kainate receptors (KARs) at the PAM-binding site (Figure S2C), we tested if GNE-3419 might potentiate KARs as well as AMPARs using voltage-clamp measurements from oocytes expressing GluK2. While the positive control PAM, Concanavalin A (ConA), which blocks KAR desensitization, revealed robust Glu-evoked currents, GNE-6901, GNE-8324, and GNE-3419 all failed to act on GluK2 in a similar manner. Parallel experiments with GluA2 confirmed that GNE-3419, but not the other PAMs, could block AMPAR desensitization in this same experimental paradigm (Figures S3E and S3F), supporting selectivity against KARs. While the cell-based assays used to test GluN2A PAMs demonstrated potentiation of GluN2A, but not GluN2B-containing NMDARs, the cell lines used in these assays express pure populations of diheteromeric receptors. Synaptic NMDARs, however, are thought to contain a significant proportion of triheteromeric NMDARs comprised of both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits (Gray et al., 2011Gray J.A. Shi Y. Usui H. During M.J.

Achieving this goal requires elucidation of fundamental mechanisms that control nAChR biogenesis.

Piotrowski D.W. et al.A novel positive allosteric modulator of the alpha7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: in vitro and in vivo characterization.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4396-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) produced a small calcium signal (Figure S1A). For FLIPR screening in a 384-well plate format, ACh (25 μM) and ACh plus PNU-120596 (10 μM) were sequentially applied to HEK cells in wells that had been individually co-transfected with α7 plus one of 3,880 clones from a cDNA library encoding almost all human transmembrane and secreted proteins (Origene). The single library clone that most profoundly augmented ACh + PNU-120596-induced responses (Figure S1A) derived from TMEM35, also termed unknown factor-1 (TUF-1), which encodes a small (167 amino acid) uncharacterized four-pass transmembrane protein (Figures S2A and S2B), whose expression in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells is increased by sodium depletion (Tran et al., 2010Tran P.V. Georgieff M.K. Engeland W.C. Sodium depletion increases sympathetic neurite outgrowth and expression of a novel TMEM35 gene-derived protein (TUF1) in the rat adrenal zona glomerulosa.Endocrinology. 2010; 151: 4852-4860Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We named this novel nAChR regulator (NACHO). To evaluate the effect of NACHO on α7 receptors, we performed electrophysiological experiments. Consistent with published studies (Cooper and Millar, 1997Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. Host cell-specific folding and assembly of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit.J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2005Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. Ric-3 promotes functional expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we could not detect ACh-evoked currents in HEK cells transfected with α7 alone. Strikingly, co-transfection of NACHO with α7 yielded large, rapidly desensitizing ACh-evoked currents (Figures 1A and 1B ). NACHO also significantly increased ACh-evoked currents in HEK cells co-transfected with α4 + β2 nAChR subunits (Figures 1A and 1B), which form hetero-pentameric receptors (Gotti and Clementi, 2004Gotti C. Clementi F. Neuronal nicotinic receptors: from structure to pathology.Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In contrast, NACHO had no significant effect on glutamate- or 2-methyl-5-HT-evoked currents in cells co-transfected with NACHO and GluA1 or 5-HT3A/B receptors, respectively (Figures 1A and 1B). Furthermore, NACHO did not affect other ionotropic receptors tested including NMDA receptors, kainate receptors, TrpV1, and TrpM8 (Figure S1B). We asked whether NACHO increases surface expression of nAChR proteins. Therefore, we engineered in extracellular HA-tags that do not interfere with channel function and enable immunofluorescent detection of surface receptors. In HEK cells transfected with such a HA-tagged α7 construct alone, no labeling was detected following incubation of unpermeabilized cells with an anti-HA antibody (Figures 1C and 1D). Remarkably, co-transfection of NACHO yielded strong surface labeling for α7 (Figures 1C and 1D). We next evaluated the effect of NACHO on surface expression of HA-tagged α4β2, GluA1, and 5-HT3A/B proteins. Consistent with our electrophysiological data, NACHO markedly increased α4β2 surface protein levels and had no effect on GluA1 or 5-HT3A/B (Figures 1C and 1D). NACHO is distantly related to only one human gene, ZMYM6NB, which also encodes a small, multi-pass transmembrane protein. We found that ZMYM6NB does not enhance the functional expression of α7 in co-transfected HEK cells (Figures S3A and S3B). A single potential ortholog of NACHO is present in the genomes of all vertebrates and some lower organisms. The NACHO homolog in Drosophila melanogaster (DNACHO) shares just 37% identity with human NACHO, yet it fully augments both functional and surface expression of co-transfected human α7 (Figures 1B and 1D). We compared functional effects of NACHO with Ric-3, which is essential for nAChR responses in C. elegans (Nguyen et al., 1995Nguyen M. Alfonso A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Caenorhabditis elegans mutants resistant to inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.Genetics. 1995; 140: 527-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but whose mammalian homolog has mixed effects on α7, α4β2, and 5-HT3 receptors (Halevi et al., 2003Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. Conservation within the RIC-3 gene family. Effectors of mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Millar, 2008Millar N.S. RIC-3: a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor chaperone.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: S177-S183Google Scholar). In transfected cell lines, mammalian Ric-3 only modestly enhances α7 activity (Kuryatov et al., 2013Kuryatov A. Mukherjee J. Lindstrom J. Chemical chaperones exceed the chaperone effects of RIC-3 in promoting assembly of functional α7 AChRs.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e62246Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Endogenous Ric-3 is absent from hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons that are enriched in α7 (Halevi et al., 2003Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. Conservation within the RIC-3 gene family. Effectors of mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that complete knockdown of Ric-3 does not diminish α7 function in rat pituitary cells (Koperniak et al., 2013Koperniak T.M. Garg B.K. Boltax J. Loring R.H. Cell-specific effects on surface α7 nicotinic receptor expression revealed by over-expression and knockdown of rat RIC3 protein.J. Neurochem. 2013; 124: 300-309Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) demonstrating that endogenous Ric-3 is not essential. In whole-cell recordings from α7 co-transfected HEK cells, NACHO induces much larger ACh-evoked currents than does Ric-3 (Figures 2A and 2B ). Interestingly, when both NACHO and Ric-3 are co-transfected, they synergistically increase ACh-evoked currents from α7 receptors, suggesting that they work through distinct mechanisms (Figures 2A and 2B). Assembly of α7 receptors can be quantified with α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt), a snake venom component, which only binds to properly-folded α7 receptors (Couturier et al., 1990Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. A neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (alpha 7) is developmentally regulated and forms a homo-oligomeric channel blocked by alpha-BTX.Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, Schoepfer et al., 1990Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Brain alpha-bungarotoxin binding protein cDNAs and MAbs reveal subtypes of this branch of the ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily.Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We used α-Bgt and α7 surface labeling, to compare effects of NACHO and Ric-3 on folding and trafficking of co-transfected α7-HA. In HEK cells transfected with α7-HA alone, neither surface α7 protein (purple) nor fluorescent α-Bgt binding before (red) or after (green) cell permeabilization could be detected (Figure 2C). In cells co-transfected with Ric-3 and α7-HA, α-Bgt binding and surface α7 labeling are also below our detection limits (Figure 2C). In striking contrast, co-transfection of α7-HA with NACHO yields abundant α-Bgt binding and α7 protein expression on the surface of unpermeabilized cells (Figure 2C). Following permeabilization of these α7 + NACHO co-transfectants, additional α-Bgt binding occurs (Figure 2C), which indicates the presence of folded intracellular α7 receptors that are not apparent without permeabilization (Figure 2C′). Co-transfection of NACHO and Ric-3 together with α7-HA further increases both surface α-Bgt binding and surface α7 protein levels and has no further effect on intracellular α-Bgt binding sites (Figure 2C). Immunofluorescent labeling for α7 following permeabilization shows that total α7 levels are similar in all transfection conditions (Figure 2C, cyan). NACHO mRNA is uniquely enriched in brain (GTEx Project [Consortium, 2015Consortium G.T. GTEx ConsortiumHuman genomics. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pilot analysis: multitissue gene regulation in humans.Science. 2015; 348: 648-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3074) Google Scholar]) and is discretely expressed in specific regions including hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb (Figure S4A). Immunoblotting of rat hippocampal membranes or NACHO-transfected HEK cells with a NACHO antibody detects a protein band migrating at 18 kDa (Figure S4B), consistent with the predicted size of NACHO protein. This band is not present in rat liver or untransfected HEK cells. Importantly, this band is present (Figure S4B) in two neuroendocrine cell lines (PC12 and GH4C1) that can functionally express transfected α7 (Cooper and Millar, 1997Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. Host cell-specific folding and assembly of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit.J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Koperniak et al., 2013Koperniak T.M. Garg B.K. Boltax J. Loring R.H. Cell-specific effects on surface α7 nicotinic receptor expression revealed by over-expression and knockdown of rat RIC3 protein.J. Neurochem. 2013; 124: 300-309Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent labeling of cultured hippocampal cells shows that NACHO occurs in neurons (identified with MAP2) and is not present in astrocytes (identified with GFAP) (Figure 3A). Higher-power magnification shows that NACHO co-localizes with an ER-resident protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Figure 3B). This ER localization of NACHO may be mediated through its extreme C-terminal tail (Figure S2A), which contains a canonical recognition sequence (KxKxx) that typically binds to β’-COP subunits for Golgi-to-ER retrieval (Jackson et al., 2012Jackson L.P. Lewis M. Kent H.M. Edeling M.A. Evans P.R. Duden R. Owen D.J. Molecular basis for recognition of dilysine trafficking motifs by COPI.Dev. Cell. 2012; 23: 1255-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Surface biotinylation on cultured hippocampal neurons did not detect NACHO protein on the surface of neurons (Figure 3C), consistent with NACHO being an intracellular (ER) protein. In α7-transfected HEK cells with or without Ric-3, all α7 protein is sensitive to Endo H glycosidase (Figure 3D), indicating that α7 in these cells does not progress properly from ER through Golgi. By contrast, co-transfection with NACHO generates an Endo H-resistant population of α7 (Figure 3D), implying that NACHO enables α7 maturation. Ric-3 further enhances the effect of NACHO on α7 maturation (Figure 3D). Whereas NACHO promotes α7 assembly and biogenesis, we found that NACHO does not alter the desensitization or deactivation kinetics of either α7 (Figures S5A and S5B) or α4β2 (Figures S5D and S5E). We also investigated recovery from desensitization, which evaluates response to ACh at increasing intervals following a desensitizing pulse of ACh. Again, NACHO does not affect recovery from desensitization for either α7 (Figure S5C) or α4β2 (Figure S5F). Furthermore, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments to assess whether NACHO and α7 tightly interact in hippocampal tissue. Because no available antibodies are suitable for western blotting of α7 in rodent brain (Moser et al., 2007Moser N. Mechawar N. Jones I. Gochberg-Sarver A. Orr-Urtreger A. Plomann M. Salas R. Molles B. Marubio L. Roth U. et al.Evaluating the suitability of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies for standard immunodetection procedures.J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we detected α7 by [125I]α-Bgt binding. These experiments showed that NACHO immunoprecipitation does not bring down [125I]α-Bgt binding sites (Figure 3E). Conversely, α7 immunoprecipitation does not bring down NACHO protein. These results show that NACHO and α7 do not form a stable complex. Taken together, these data indicate that NACHO is not a surface-expressed α7 auxiliary subunit but rather is a neuronal, ER-localized chaperone for α7. To evaluate functions for neuronal NACHO, we first identified an shRNA construct that effectively suppresses NACHO expression in hippocampal neurons (Figure 4B, purple). We quantified α7-mediated sustained currents in hippocampal neurons by applying ACh (1 mM) in the presence of PNU-120596 (1 μM), an α7 potentiator, that blocks the receptor desensitization. Remarkably, our shRNA-mediated knockdown of NACHO abolished the α7-mediated currents (Figure 4A). For α4β2, we quantified currents evoked by ACh (1 mM) that are sensitive to 10 μM dihydro-β-erythroidine (DhβE). We found that NACHO knockdown significantly decreases but does not eliminate these α4β2-mediated currents (Figure S6D), which fits our data in HEK cells that NACHO augments α4β2 currents (Figure 1B). These effects were specific as NACHO knockdown did not affect AMPA receptor-mediated currents (Figure 4A). Transfection of hippocampal neurons with an HA-tagged α7 yields abundant cell surface α7 and surface α-Bgt binding sites (Figure 4B, red). By contrast, HA-tagged α7 in neurons lacking NACHO are not present on the cell surface and do not form α-Bgt binding sites (Figure 4B). We derived NACHO knockout mice (TMEM35tm1(KOMP)Vlcg) from the trans-NIH knockout mouse project (KOMP) repository (UC Davis). These knockout mice are viable, and they entirely lack NACHO protein and mRNA in brain (Figures S6A and S6B), whereas α7 mRNA is unaffected (Figure S6B). Electrophysiological recordings from acutely isolated hippocampal neurons showed complete absence of α7-mediated currents in NACHO knockouts. This deficit is specific, as AMPA receptors remain intact (Figure 4C). Furthermore, [125I]α-Bgt autoradiography shows that properly folded α7 receptors are undetectable in NACHO knockout brain (Figures 4D and S6C). This study identifies NACHO as an essential factor for folding, maturation, and membrane insertion of α7. Our high-throughput screen of all predicted human transmembrane proteins indicates that NACHO has, by far, the greatest capacity to enhance assembly and function of α7. We find that the Drosophila NACHO ortholog effectively reconstitutes human α7 folding and function, which implies that the NACHO mechanism is phylogenetically conserved. Most importantly, genetic deletion of NACHO abolishes functional α7 receptors throughout the brain. Whereas NACHO is required for α7 channel activity in brain, our heterologous cell and neuronal transfection experiments show that NACHO does not alter total α7 protein levels. The disposition of α7 protein in NACHO knockout mice is unknown because, unfortunately, no antibodies are suitable for immunostaining or immunoblotting of α7 in mouse brain (Moser et al., 2007Moser N. Mechawar N. Jones I. Gochberg-Sarver A. Orr-Urtreger A. Plomann M. Salas R. Molles B. Marubio L. Roth U. et al.Evaluating the suitability of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies for standard immunodetection procedures.J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the complete loss of [125I]α-Bgt binding sites in NACHO knockout brain demonstrates absence of folded α7 pentamers. Cell biological properties distinguish NACHO from previously described neurotransmitter receptor partner proteins. Certain glutamate-gated ion channels, including AMPA and kainate receptors, also require neuronal accessory proteins (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A. The expanding social network of ionotropic glutamate receptors: TARPs and other transmembrane auxiliary subunits.Neuron. 2011; 70: 178-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, Tomita and Castillo, 2012Tomita S. Castillo P.E. Neto1 and Neto2: auxiliary subunits that determine key properties of native kainate receptors.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Best studied are transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), which, by analogy to NACHO, enhance surface trafficking of AMPA receptors (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A. The expanding social network of ionotropic glutamate receptors: TARPs and other transmembrane auxiliary subunits.Neuron. 2011; 70: 178-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, Tomita and Castillo, 2012Tomita S. Castillo P.E. Neto1 and Neto2: auxiliary subunits that determine key properties of native kainate receptors.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, TARPs are not essential for AMPA receptor folding or tetramer assembly. Instead, TARPs are auxiliary subunits of AMPA receptors and associate with surface channels to control gating and pharmacology (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A. The expanding social network of ionotropic glutamate receptors: TARPs and other transmembrane auxiliary subunits.Neuron. 2011; 70: 178-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, Tomita and Castillo, 2012Tomita S. Castillo P.E. Neto1 and Neto2: auxiliary subunits that determine key properties of native kainate receptors.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By contrast, NACHO is fundamentally required for folding and assembly of α7 receptors and is the first essential, client-specific chaperone identified for a mammalian neurotransmitter receptor. The neuronal nAChR family comprises nine α and three β subunits, and all receptors other than α7-10 contain heteromeric subunits (Gotti and Clementi, 2004Gotti C. Clementi F. Neuronal nicotinic receptors: from structure to pathology.Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, Le Novère et al., 2002Le Novère N. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. The diversity of subunit composition in nAChRs: evolutionary origins, physiologic and pharmacologic consequences.J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Certain biologically important AChR subtypes, including α6β2-containing receptors, cannot be functionally expressed in recombinant systems (Kuryatov et al., 2000Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J. Human α6 AChR subtypes: subunit composition, assembly, and pharmacological responses.Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2570-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We also find that NACHO and Ric-3 are insufficient to promote functional expression of α6β2-containing nAChR (data not shown), which suggests that additional subtype-specific chaperones likely exist for these nAChR subtypes. Furthermore, selective chaperones may well mediate assembly of other neurotransmitter receptors. Neurotransmitter receptor auxiliary subunits and regulatory proteins have mostly been discovered by genetic screens (Nguyen et al., 1995Nguyen M. Alfonso A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Caenorhabditis elegans mutants resistant to inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.Genetics. 1995; 140: 527-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Zheng et al., 2004Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Brockie P.J.

SOL-1 is a CUB-domain protein required for GLR-1 glutamate receptor function in C. elegans.Nature. 2004; 427: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and biochemical techniques (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C.

Castillo P.E. Neto1 and Neto2: auxiliary subunits that determine key properties of native kainate receptors.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas these approaches have been applied to nAChRs, they did not identify NACHO. Our discovery of NACHO took advantage of a high-throughput screening strategy enabled by the recent availability of genome-wide cDNA libraries. Our new approach complements existing strategies and should help identify assembly proteins and auxiliary subunits for numerous other receptors and ion channels. Genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological studies validate α7 as a therapeutic target for treating Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia (Dineley et al., 2015Dineley K.T. Pandya A.A. Yakel J.L.

Sci. 2015; 36: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Freedman, 2014Freedman R. α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia.Annu.

Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Challenges in reliably reconstituting functional α7 in cells lines have impeded pharmacological studies. Co-expression of NACHO with α7 solves this issue and will facilitate drug discovery. The chaperone function of NACHO may also represent a valuable drug target. Nicotine itself promotes maturation of several types of nAChRs (Schwartz and Kellar, 1983Schwartz R.D. Kellar K.J. Nicotinic cholinergic receptor binding sites in the brain: regulation in vivo.Science. 1983; 220: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and this likely contributes to nicotine’s inadvertent beneficial effects in certain cognitive and neurodegenerative conditions (Lester et al., 2009Lester H.A. Xiao C. Srinivasan R. Son C.D. Miwa J. Pantoja R. Banghart M.R. Dougherty D.A. Goate A.M. Wang J.C.

Implications for drug discovery.AAPS J. 2009; 11: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Enhancing NACHO effects on nAChR assembly could provide a medical target devoid of nicotine’s addictive and toxic properties. High-throughput FLIPR assays were performed using HEK cells in 384-well plates. Briefly, cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well and transfected 4 hr after seeding with Fugene HD. After 2 days of incubation, cells were washed three times with assay buffer (137 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES [pH7.4]) and loaded with Calcium5 dye (Molecular Device) and 1.25 mM probenecid for 1 hr at RT. After three washes, the plates were placed in the FLIPR stage. After establishing baseline, 25 μM acetylcholine was applied for a 1.5 min recording, then 25 μM acetylcholine plus 10 μM PNU120596 were applied for another 2.5 min recording. For surface staining, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml α-Bgt or primary antibodies in culture medium for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. As indicated, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with antibodies or α-Bgt to probe intracellular components. Following incubation with secondary antibodies, cells were stained with DAPI for 5 min. Images were captured using a Zeiss M2 Imager or Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. [125I]α-BTX Autoradiography was performed as described (Orr-Urtreger et al., 1997Orr-Urtreger A. Göldner F.M. Saeki M. Lorenzo I. Goldberg L. De Biasi M. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. Beaudet A.L. Mice deficient in the alpha7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor lack alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites and hippocampal fast nicotinic currents.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-specific binding was assessed by inclusion of 1 μM unlabeled α-BTX. At the end of the incubation, sections were washed four times and dried. Images were captured with β-Imager DFine (Biospacelab). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, transfected cells were transferred to the recording chamber submerged in extracellular solution composed of 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4), and 300 mM mOsm. For cultured neurons, synaptic activity was blocked with TTX (0.5 μM), NBQX (10 μM; except when measuring whole-cell AMPA currents), and d-APV (50 μM). Whole-cell recordings used intracellular solution composed of 140 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.4 mM Na-GTP, and 0.6 mM EGTA (pH 7.3). Ultra-fast acetylcholine was applied onto HEK cells using a piezo-driven perfusion system and theta glass (Siskiyou). Fast perfusion onto neurons used a Perfusion Fast-Step System (Warner Instruments). Acute hippocampal neurons were obtained from 7-week-old male mice. Horizontal slices, 300 μm thick, were obtained using a VT1200S microtome (Leica Biosystems). Slices were cut in ice-cold solution composed of 150 mM sucrose, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM Na3PO4, and 0.5 mM CaCl2 equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Hippocampi were isolated and transferred to HibernateA (no calcium, BrainBits) solution containing 1 mg/ml papain (Worthington) and 0.5 mM Glutamax (Life Technologies) and digested at 37°C for 30 min. Slices were gently triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. The cell suspension was then plated onto coverslips and isolated neurons were used for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. All dissociated cell recordings were done at room temperature and membrane potentials were held at −60 mV. Recordings used an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). For transfected HEK cells, signals were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz. For neurons, signals were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Data acquisition and online analysis were done using pClamp 9 (Axon Instruments). For recovery from desensitization, an initial desensitizing pulse of ACh was followed by a second pulse of ACh at varying time intervals. At each time interval, recovery from desensitization was expressed as the fraction of the current peak amplitude of the second pulse to the first pulse. Current decay kinetics and recovery from desensitization were fitted with double exponential functions and expressed as weighted decay time constants. D.S.B. supervised the project.

Here we present a practical, stable interface for stimulation and recording of large-scale cortical circuits. To obtain optogenetic expression across a broad region, here spanning primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, we used convection-enhanced delivery of the viral vector, with online guidance from MRI. To record neural activity across this region, we used a custom micro-electrocorticographic (μECoG) array designed to minimally attenuate optical stimuli. Lastly, we demonstrated the use of this interface to measure spatiotemporal responses to optical stimulation across M1 and S1. This interface offers a powerful tool for studying circuit dynamics and connectivity across cortical areas, for long-term studies of neuromodulation and targeted cortical plasticity, and for linking these to behavior."

Here, we calculated Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD) in resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 41 healthy controls (age: 20–89 years) and 67 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients (age: 50–88 years), to investigate whether HFD is sensitive to brain activity changes typical in healthy aging and in AD. Additionally, we considered whether AD-accelerating effects of the copper fraction not bound to ceruloplasmin (also called “free” copper) are reflected in HFD fluctuations. The HFD measure showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with age in healthy people (R2 = .575, p < .001). Onset of HFD decline appeared around the age of 60, and was most evident in central-parietal regions. In this region, HFD decreased with aging stronger in the right than in the left hemisphere (p = .006). AD patients demonstrated reduced HFD compared to age- and education-matched healthy controls, especially in temporal-occipital regions. This was associated with decreasing cognitive status as assessed by mini-mental state examination, and with higher levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper. Taken together, our findings show that resting-state EEG complexity increases from youth to maturity and declines in healthy, aging individuals. In AD, brain activity complexity is further reduced in correlation with cognitive impairment. In addition, elevated levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper appear to accelerate the reduction of neural activity complexity. Overall, HDF appears to be a proper indicator for monitoring EEG-derived brain activity complexity in healthy and pathological aging."
https://openalex.org/W1500583457,"The wealth of sensory data coming from different modalities has opened numerous opportunities for data analysis. The data are of increasing volume, complexity and dimensionality, thus calling for new methodological innovations towards multimodal data processing. However, multimodal architectures must rely on models able to adapt to changes in the data distribution. Differences in the density functions can be due to changes in acquisition conditions (pose, illumination), sensors characteristics (number of channels, resolution) or different views (e.g. street level vs. aerial views of a same building). We call these different acquisition modes domains, and refer to the adaptation problem as domain adaptation. In this paper, instead of adapting the trained models themselves, we alternatively focus on finding mappings of the data sources into a common, semantically meaningful, representation domain. This field of manifold alignment extends traditional techniques in statistics such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to deal with nonlinear adaptation and possibly non-corresponding data pairs between the domains. We introduce a kernel method for manifold alignment (KEMA) that can match an arbitrary number of data sources without needing corresponding pairs, just few labeled examples in all domains. KEMA has interesting properties: 1) it generalizes other manifold alignment methods, 2) it can align manifolds of very different complexities, performing a discriminative alignment preserving each manifold inner structure, 3) it can define a domain-specific metric to cope with multimodal specificities, 4) it can align data spaces of different dimensionality, 5) it is robust to strong nonlinear feature deformations, and 6) it is closed-form invertible, which allows transfer across-domains and data synthesis. To authors’ knowledge this is the first method addressing all these important issues at once. We also present a reduced-rank version of KEMA for computational efficiency, and discuss the generalization performance of KEMA under Rademacher principles of stability. Aligning multimodal data with KEMA reports outstanding benefits when used as a data pre-conditioner step in the standard data analysis processing chain. KEMA exhibits very good performance over competing methods in synthetic controlled examples, visual object recognition and recognition of facial expressions tasks. KEMA is especially well-suited to deal with high-dimensional problems, such as images and videos, and under complicated distortions, twists and warpings of the data manifolds.

A new method for isolation of plasma platelet-derived exosomes is described and used to examine effects of aging and aspirin on exosome cargo proteins. Exosome secretion by purified platelets in vitro did not increase after exposure to thrombin or collagen, as assessed by exosome counts and quantification of the CD81 exosome marker. Thrombin and collagen increased exosome content of α-granule chemokines CXCL4 and CXCL7 and cytoplasmic high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, but not membrane platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI), with dependence on extracellular calcium. Aspirin consumption significantly blocked thrombin- and collagen-induced increases in exosome cargo levels of chemokines and HMGB1, without altering total exosome secretion or GPVI cargo. Plasma platelet-derived exosomes, enriched by absorption with mouse antihuman CD42b [platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb)] mAb, had sizes and cargo protein contents similar to those of exosomes from purified platelets. The plasma platelet-derived exosome number is lower and its chemokine and HMGB1 levels higher after age 65 yr. Aspirin consumption significantly suppressed cargo protein levels of plasma platelet-derived exosomes without altering total levels of exosomes. Cargo proteins of human plasma platelet-derived exosomes may biomark platelet abnormalities and in vivo effects of drugs.- Goetzl, E. J., Goetzl, L., Karliner, J. S., Tang, N., Pulliam, L.

https://openalex.org/W2264114185,"Immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) is one of the highest induced genes in macrophages under pro-inflammatory conditions. Its function has been recently described: it codes for immune-responsive gene 1 protein/cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase (IRG1/CAD), an enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid from cis-aconitic acid, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. Itaconic acid possesses specific antimicrobial properties inhibiting isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, an anaplerotic pathway that bypasses the TCA cycle and enables bacteria to survive on limited carbon conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying itaconic acid production through IRG1 induction in macrophages, we examined the transcriptional regulation of IRG1. To this end, we studied IRG1 expression in human immune cells under different inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα and IFNγ, in addition to lipopolysaccharides. Under these conditions, as previously shown in mouse macrophages, IRG1/CAD accumulates in mitochondria. Furthermore, using literature information and transcription factor prediction models, we re-constructed raw gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for IRG1 in mouse and human macrophages. We further implemented a contextualization algorithm that relies on genome-wide gene expression data to infer putative cell type-specific gene regulatory interactions in mouse and human macrophages, which allowed us to predict potential transcriptional regulators of IRG1. Among the computationally identified regulators, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in macrophages significantly decreased the expression of IRG1/CAD at the gene and protein level, which correlated with a reduced production of itaconic acid. Using a synergistic approach of both computational and experimental methods, we here shed more light on the transcriptional machinery of IRG1 expression and could pave the way to therapeutic approaches targeting itaconic acid levels."

The species have been listed as endangered in South Korea due to the loss of natural habitats caused by anthropogenic activities. The decreasing population and a lack of genomic information on the species is concerning for environmentalists and conservationists. In this study, we conducted a de novo transcriptome sequencing and annotation analysis of C. plicata using Illumina HiSeq 2500 next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, the Trinity assembler, and bioinformatics databases to prepare a sustainable resource for the identification of candidate genes involved in immunity, defense, and reproduction.The C. plicata transcriptome analysis included a total of 286,152,584 raw reads and 281,322,837 clean reads. The de novo assembly identified a total of 453,931 contigs and 374,794 non-redundant unigenes with average lengths of 731.2 and 737.1 bp, respectively. Furthermore, 100% coverage of C. plicata mitochondrial genes within two unigenes supported the quality of the assembler. In total, 84,274 unigenes showed homology to entries in at least one database, and 23,246 unigenes were allocated to one or more Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The most prominent GO biological process, cellular component, and molecular function categories (level 2) were cellular process, membrane, and binding, respectively. A total of 4,776 unigenes were mapped to 123 biological pathways in the KEGG database. Based on the GO terms and KEGG annotation, the unigenes were suggested to be involved in immunity, stress responses, sex-determination, and reproduction. A total of 17,251 cDNA simple sequence repeats (cSSRs) were identified from 61,141 unigenes (size of >1 kb) with the most abundant being dinucleotide repeats.This dataset represents the first transcriptome analysis of the endangered mollusc, C. plicata.

https://openalex.org/W2287449522,"In breast cancer (BC) patients, local recurrences often arise in proximity of the surgical scar, suggesting that response to surgery may have a causative role. Radiotherapy (RT) after lumpectomy significantly reduces the risk of recurrence. We investigated the direct effects of surgery and of RT delivered intraoperatively (IORT), by collecting irradiated and non-irradiated breast tissues from BC patients, after tumor removal. These breast tissue specimens have been profiled for their microRNA (miR) expression, in search of differentially expressed miR among patients treated or not with IORT. Our results demonstrate that IORT elicits effects that go beyond the direct killing of residual tumor cells. IORT altered the wound response, inducing the expression of miR-223 in the peri-tumoral breast tissue. miR-223 downregulated the local expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), leading to decreased activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) on target cells and, eventually, dampening a positive EGF–EGFR autocrine/paracrine stimulation loop induced by the post-surgical wound-healing response. Accordingly, both RT-induced miR-223 and peri-operative inhibition of EGFR efficiently prevented BC cell growth and reduced recurrence formation in mouse models of BC. Our study uncovers unknown effects of RT delivered on a wounded tissue and prompts to the use of anti-EGFR treatments, in a peri-operative treatment schedule, aimed to timely treat BC patients and restrain recurrence formation."

Increasing evidence reveals that Notch pathway has an important role in the invasion ability of tumor cells, including leukemia, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain mostly unclear. Here, we show that Notch3 is a novel target protein of the prolyl-isomerase Pin1, which is able to regulate Notch3 protein processing and to stabilize the cleaved product, leading to the increased expression of the intracellular domain (N3IC), finally enhancing Notch3-dependent invasiveness properties. We demonstrate that the combined inhibition of Notch3 and Pin1 in the Notch3-overexpressing human leukemic TALL-1 cells reduces their high invasive potential, by decreasing the expression of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9. Consistently, Pin1 depletion in a mouse model of Notch3-induced T-ALL, by reducing N3IC expression and signaling, impairs the expansion/invasiveness of CD4(+)CD8(+) DP cells in peripheral lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. Notably, in in silico gene expression analysis of human T-ALL samples we observed a significant correlation between Pin1 and Notch3 expression levels, which may further suggest a key role of the newly identified Notch3-Pin1 axis in T-ALL aggressiveness and progression. Thus, combined suppression of Pin1 and Notch3 proteins may be exploited as an additional target therapy for T-ALL."

Evidence suggests lack of quality in the health management information system (HMIS), however there is no robust analysis to assess the extent of its inaccuracy. We aim to bridge this gap in evidence by assessing the extent of completeness and quality of HMIS in Haryana state of India.Data on utilization of key maternal and child health (MCH) services were collected using a cross-sectional household survey from 4807 women in 209 Sub-Centre (SC) areas across all 21 districts of Haryana state. Information for same services was also recorded from HMIS records maintained by auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) at SCs to check under- or over-recording (Level 1 discordance). Data on utilisation of MCH services from SC ANM records, for a subset of the total women covered in the household survey, were also collected and compared with monthly reports submitted by ANMs to assess over-reporting while report preparation (Level 2 discordance) to paint the complete picture for quality and completeness of routine HMIS.Completeness of ANM records for various MCH services ranged from 73% for DPT1 vaccination dates to 94.6% for dates of delivery. Average completeness level for information recorded in HMIS was 88.5%. Extent of Level 1 discordance for iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation, 3 or more ante-natal care (ANC) visits and 2 Tetanus toxoid (TT) injections was 41%, 16% and 2% respectively. In 48.2% cases, respondents from community as well as HMIS records reported at least one post-natal care (PNC) home visit by ANM. Extent of Level 2 discordance ranged from 1.6% to 6%. These figures were highest for number of women who completed IFA supplementation, contraceptive intra-uterine device insertion and provision of 2nd TT injection during ANC.HMIS records for MCH services at sub-centre level in Haryana state were satisfactory in terms of completeness. However, there were significant differences in terms of reported and evaluated coverage of MCH services.

Many molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC’s ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC’s performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested.

https://openalex.org/W2285494695,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and metastatic form of breast cancer that lacks the estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors and is resistant to targeted and hormone therapies. TNBCs express high levels of the transmembrane glycoprotein, complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1 (CUB)-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1), which has been correlated with the aggressiveness and poor prognosis of multiple carcinomas. Full-length CDCP1 (flCDCP1) can be proteolytically cleaved, resulting in a cleaved membrane-bound isoform (cCDCP1). CDCP1 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases in its full-length and cleaved states, which is important for its pro-metastatic signaling. We observed that cCDCP1, compared with flCDCP1, induced a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of the migration-associated proteins: PKCδ, ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in HEK 293T. In addition, only cCDCP1 induced migration of HEK 293T cells and rescued migration of the TNBC cell lines expressing short hairpin RNA against CDCP1. Importantly, we found that only cCDCP1 is capable of dimerization, which can be blocked by expression of the extracellular portion of cCDCP1 (ECC), indicating that dimerization occurs through CDCP1's ectodomain. We found that ECC inhibited phosphorylation of PKCδ and migration of TNBC cells in two-dimensional culture. Furthermore, ECC decreased cell invasiveness, inhibited proliferation and stimulated apoptosis of TNBC cells in three-dimensional culture, indicating that the cCDCP1 dimer is an important contributor to TNBC aggressiveness. These studies have important implications for the development of a therapeutic to block CDCP1 activity and TNBC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2269350947,"Agonist-mediated signaling by the endothelium controls virtually all vascular functions. Because of the large diversity of agonists, each with varying concentrations, background noise often obscures individual cellular signals. How the endothelium distinguishes low-level fluctuations from noise and decodes and integrates physiologically relevant information remains unclear. Here, we recorded changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in response to acetylcholine in areas encompassing hundreds of endothelial cells from inside intact pressurized arteries. Individual cells responded to acetylcholine with a concentration-dependent increase in Ca2+ signals spanning a single order of magnitude. Interestingly, however, intercellular response variation extended over 3 orders of magnitude of agonist concentration, thus crucially enhancing the collective bandwidth of endothelial responses to agonists. We also show the accuracy of this collective mode of detection is facilitated by spatially restricted clusters of comparably sensitive cells arising from heterogeneous receptor expression. Simultaneous stimulation of clusters triggered Ca2+ signals that were transmitted to neighboring cells in a manner that scaled with agonist concentration. Thus, the endothelium detects agonists by acting as a distributed sensing system.

Airway remodeling involves differentiation of airway epithelial cells into myofibroblasts via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to intensify the degree of subepithelial fibrosis. EMT involves loss in E-cadherin with an increase in mesenchymal markers, including vimentin and N-cadherin. There is growing evidence that vitamin D has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects are still unclear. In this study, we examined the contribution of vitamin D on the AHR, airway inflammation and expression of EMT markers in the airways of mice sensitized and challenged with a combination of clinically relevant allergens, house dust mite, ragweed, and Alternaria (HRA). Female Balb/c mice were fed with vitamin D-sufficient (2000 IU/kg) or vitamin D-supplemented (10,000 IU/kg) diet followed by sensitization with HRA. The density of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung histology, and expression of EMT markers by immunofluorescence were examined. Vitamin D-supplementation decreased AHR, airway inflammation in the BALF and the features of airway remodeling compared to vitamin D-sufficiency in HRA-sensitized and -challenged mice. This was accompanied with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased vimentin and N-cadherin expression in the airways. These results indicate that vitamin D may be a beneficial adjunct in the treatment regime in allergic asthma."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the manufacturing site of newly synthesized proteins that are folded and targeted to their destination. The ER works continuously with the outer layer of the nuclear envelope but separate from the Golgi apparatus. Protein transport from the ER to Golgi occurs through coatomer I- and II-coated vesicles, with final transport to the plasma membrane occurring via endosomes. Cell migration requires the transport of proteins to the leading edge to establish cell polarity, filopodia and lamellipodia formation, adhesion, signaling, and translocation. In addition, several secretory proteins are required at the leading edge to break down the ECM that aids in cell motility. GRP94 is the ER-resident HSP90 molecular chaperone that modulates protein folding, processing, and secretion.

More recently, studies in liver-specific GRP94 knock-out mice revealed that GRP94 is a pro-oncogenic chaperone (13.Rachidi S. Sun S. Li Z. Endoplasmic reticulum heat shock protein gp96/grp94 is a pro-oncogenic chaperone, not a tumor suppressor.Hepatology. 2015; 61: 1766-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although there are several reports that highlight the biological functions of GRP94 using organ-specific knock-out mice, the role of GRP94 in cellular biology remains relatively underinvestigated. In this study, the effect of GRP94 on cell migration was assessed using a stable GRP94 knockdown in the highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC3-MM2. GRP94 knockdown cells were defective in cell migration due to a deficit in migration directionality. The GRP94 knockdown cells manifested an unusual morphology that formed multipolar spindles instead of bipolar spindles and were unable to form filopodia. Proteomic analysis revealed that GRP94 knockdown resulted in a deficit in proteins that regulate cellular transport processes. Further investigation determined that GRP94 is required for the transport of F-actin, fascin, integrin α2, and integrin αL toward the cell surface. The GRP94 knockdown cells were also defective in the transport of secretory vesicles containing HSP90α-AHA1-survivin to the leading edge of the migrating cells. Consequently, the GRP94 knockdown cells migrated randomly, were deficient in cell-matrix adhesion, and were unable to form three-dimensional spheroidal structures in vitro. Collectively, this work provides novel mechanistic insight into the importance of GRP94 in regulating cancer cell migration. The novobiocin analogue, KU-135, was synthesized as described previously, and purity was verified as >95% by NMR and mass spectrometry (14.Shelton S.N. Shawgo M.E. Matthews S.B. Lu Y. Donnelly A.C.

Staurosporine was obtained from Sigma. Staurosporine, KU-135, and TRAIL were dissolved in DMSO and stored at −20 °C until use. AHA1-GFP plasmid was obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD) (catalogue no. RG201782). Canine GRP94-KDEL-GFP plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Yair Argon (15.Ostrovsky O. Makarewich C.A. Snapp E.L. Argon Y. An essential role for ATP binding and hydrolysis in the chaperone activity of GRP94 in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11600-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transfected into PC3-MM2 wild type and GRP94 knockdown cell lines using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer. The GRP94 shRNA (RHS4696-99638599), (5′-GGAAAGAATCAAGGAGG-3′) and scrambled shRNA plasmids were obtained from Open Biosystems. The following antibodies were used for Western blotting and/or co-immunoprecipitation: rabbit anti-HSP90α RB-119-P (Neomarkers/Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA); rabbit anti-phospho-HSP90α Thr-5/7 (catalog no. 3488) and rabbit anti-survivin (catalog no. 2808) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); goat anti-HSP90β (catalog no. sc1057), rat anti-GRP94 (catalog no. sc32249), goat anti-integrin αL (catalog no. sc6609), rabbit anti-SYNE2 (catalog no. sc99066), and rabbit anti-actin (catalog no. sc1616-R) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); mouse anti-TRAP1 (catalog no. 612344) (BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-AHA1 (catalog no. ab83036), mouse anti-AHA1 (catalog no. ab56721), mouse anti-RAC (catalog no. ab13048) (detects RAC1 with slight cross-reactivity with RAC2), and rabbit anti-integrin α2 (catalog no. ab181548) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); rabbit anti-RAB3GAP1 (catalog no.

W6748) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The GRP94 shRNA construct along with the control (nonspecific shRNA) were obtained as glycerol stocks, and the plasmids were recovered with a Qiagen plasmid kit (MIDI prep) using the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids containing the nonspecific and GRP94-specific shRNA were packaged into third generation lentivirus particles (Clontech) and concentrated using the Lenti-X concentrator kit. The concentrated lentiviral particles were transduced according to the protocol mentioned in the Open Biosystems manual and then selected for puromycin resistance. The puromycin-resistant control and GRP94 knockdown cells were monitored by the TurboRFP signal, and knockdown was verified by Western blotting analysis. PC3-MM2 cell lines with a stable knockdown of HSP90α and HSP90β have been reported earlier (16.Peterson L.B. Eskew J.D. Vielhauer G.A. Blagg B.S. The hERG channel is dependent upon the Hsp90α isoform for maturation and trafficking.Mol. Pharm. 2012; 9: 1841-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The PC3-MM2 cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin, and penicillin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The stable HSP90 isoform-specific knockdown cells were cultured as above but with the addition of 5 μg/ml puromycin. The various cell lines were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice for 1 h in mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Cancer patients' tissue samples were obtained from the University of Kansas Medical Center. Approximately 5 mg of the tissue samples were homogenized in ∼300 μl of mammalian protein extraction reagent lysis buffer, and the lysates were clarified at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit per the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of protein (2.5–20 μg) were electrophoresed under reducing conditions (8% polyacrylamide gel), transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with the corresponding specific antibodies. Membranes were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, developed with a chemiluminescent substrate and visualized. PC3-MM2 cell lines were plated in 10-cm cell culture dishes or T25 flasks and allowed to grow to ∼80% confluence. PC3-MM2 cell lines were untreated or received DMSO (0.1%) or the indicated drug treatment. After drug treatment, the PC3-MM2 cell lines were harvested in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. For co-immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of total protein was diluted to a 500-μl total volume in lysis buffer and incubated with 10 μl of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Immune complexes were captured with 30 μl of DynaBeads Protein G (Invitrogen) for 3 h with rocking at 4 °C. Protein G bead complexes were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. For cell imaging, 1-μm Slide 8-well ibidiTreat IBIDITM glass slides were used. PC3-MM2 cells were fixed with freshly made 4% (w/w) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% (w/w) Tween 20 in PBS for 5 min, and quenched with 0.1% (w/w) sodium borohydride for 5 min. The sections were blocked with 3% (w/w) BSA in PBS for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody at a 1:100 concentration in 1% BSA in PBS overnight, prior to incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 for 3 h. The sections were counterstained with DAPI and/or with phalloidin to visualize DNA and F-actin, respectively. The wells were washed three times with PBS after each step. Confocal images were acquired using a custom epifluorescent/confocal microscope composed of the following components: an Olympus IX81 inverted spinning disc confocal microscope base (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA), a Prior microscope stage for automated image acquisition (Prior Scientific, Rockland, MA), an Olympus ×60 oil immersion objective for confocal images (Olympus) and a Hamamatsu (Hamamatsu, Japan) electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. Images were captured using the SlideBook acquisition and analysis software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Images were collected with 8–10 image stacks with a 0.3-μm step size through the cells. Images were processed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The cells were seeded in a 24-well plate in complete medium and allowed to form a monolayer. After monolayer formation, a scratch was introduced with a sterile 0.1–10-μl pipette tip. The medium was replaced with fresh medium in the absence or presence of the indicated drug concentrations. Photomicrographs were taken at different time points with an Olympus IX71 microscope using a ×10 air lens and CellSans Dimensions software. The images were processed with ImageJ software. The average horizontal distance between the scratches was measured at various time points. The control (nonspecific shRNA), GRP94 knockdown, or AHA1-GFP transfected cells were seeded in 1-μm Slide 8-well ibidiTreat IBIDI glass slides to form a monolayer. After monolayer formation, the scratch was introduced with a sterile 0.1–10-μl pipette tip. Live cell images were acquired using a custom epifluorescent microscope composed of the following components: an Olympus IX81 inverted base (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA), a Prior microscope stage for automated image acquisition, a Sutter automated optical filter wheel (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA), an Olympus ×40 long working distance air objective (Olympus), and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash version 4.0 complementary metal-oxide semiconductor camera. Images were captured and processed using the SlideBook acquisition and analysis software. The image tracking analysis was performed by using the manual tracking plugin in ImageJ. The ImageJ manual tracking data were then used in the IBIDI Chemotaxis and Migration Tool to generate the graphs. The morphology of the cells was measured quantitatively using the CellProfiler program. The live cell bright field images of the control and GRP94 knockdown cells were used to plug in to the CellProfiler software, and the characteristics of the cell phenotypes were measured according to previously published literature (17.Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C. Kang I.H. Friman O. Guertin D.A. Chang J.H. Lindquist R.A. Moffat J. Golland P. Sabatini D.M. CellProfiler: image analysis software for identifying and quantifying cell phenotypes.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R100Crossref PubMed Scopus (3329) Google Scholar). The co-localization of two proteins in immunofluorescent images were measured by using JACoP (Just Another Co-localization Plugin) in the ImageJ software, and Pearson's co-efficient (r) was measured (18.Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Lysine- and arginine-deficient DMEM was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Isotopically enriched (>98%) l-Lys (12C6,14N2,2H4 (K4) and 13C6,15N2 (K8)) and l-Arg (13C6,14N4) (R6) and 13C6,15N4 (R10)) were obtained from Sigma-Isotec. For proteomic analysis, the control cells, HSP90β knockdown cells, and GRP94 knockdown cells were grown in DMEM SILAC medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, streptomycin, penicillin, and light (125 mg/liter K0, 84 mg/liter R0), medium (K4/R6), or heavy (K8/R10) labeled medium, respectively. The cells were passaged at least 5 times to ensure complete incorporation of labeled amino acids into the cells. Five 15-cm plates of each cell line were expanded in K0/R0-, K4/R6-, or K6/R10-containing medium before harvesting. The cells were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 10 ml of isolation buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m d-mannitol, 0.05 m sucrose, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (19.Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. Subcellular distribution of superoxide dismutases (SOD) in rat liver: Cu,Zn-SOD in mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized with the aid of a Teflon pestle, and lysis was confirmed microscopically. After sedimenting the cell debris, the protein concentration of each lysate was measured in quadruplicate using the BCA protein assay and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The coefficient of variation was determined for each set of quadruplicate measures, and if the variability exceeded 5%, the protein assay was repeated for that set of samples. The samples were then mixed together in a 1:1:1 mass ratio, yielding 24–30 mg of protein. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min, and the crude mitochondrial pellet was washed twice in isolation buffer and frozen. The reserved supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g to isolate a microsomal fraction, and the remaining supernatant was concentrated overnight by TCA precipitation; the resulting protein fraction was frozen. The microsomal pellet was washed as above and dissolved in a minimum amount of isolation buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were identified following one-dimensional SDS-PAGE coupled to reverse phase HPLC with introduction of the effluent into a linear quadrupole ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometer (20.Steen H. Mann M. The ABC's (and XYZ's) of peptide sequencing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). About 75–100 μg of protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were visualized by staining the gel, and the lane was cut into 13 sections for in-gel tryptic digestion. The gel pieces were placed in silanized microcentrifuge tubes and destained with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile (21.Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3529) Google Scholar). Following reduction (10 mm dithiothreitol at 55 °C for 1 h) and alkylation (55 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at room temperature), the gel pieces were washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile, dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, and dried. The gel pieces were rehydrated on ice in a minimal volume of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, containing 12.5 ng/μl Trypsin Gold (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), covered with a sufficient volume of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, and the proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C. The samples were briefly centrifuged, the trypsin was inactivated by the addition of formic acid to a final concentration of 5%, and the supernatant was used to provide two technical duplicates for LC-MS/MS analysis. The chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions were as described in our previous reports (22.Zhang L. Zhao H. Blagg B.S. Dobrowsky R.T.

MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification.Nat.

Spectra were searched against a concatenated forward-reverse protein sequence database composed from Uniprot Human_2013_01 (68,079 sequences) appended with common contaminants. See supplemental Table 1 to view all of the identification and quantification parameters used in the analysis. The isotopic multiplicity was set to consider the K4/R6 and K8/R10 isotope combinations, and quantification required at least two peptides. PC3-MM2 cells pretreated for 24 h with DMSO, or the drugs were used for the three-dimensional cell culture assays. Three-dimensional gel chambers were made using Matrigel (BD Bioscience) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin, and penicillin, with or without the drugs dissolved in DMSO. Approximately 5000 PC3-MM2 drug-treated cells were added in each well in overlay medium containing 2% Matrigel and 5 ng/ml EGF (Promega) and incubated for 5 days. Photomicrographs were taken after 5 days with an Olympus IX71 microscope using a ×10 air lens with CellSans Dimensions software. The images were processed with ImageJ software. Cell motility/migration is critical to metastasis. In vitro cell migration assays and live cell microscopy with both control and GRP94 knockdown cells were performed to investigate the role of GRP94 in the cell migration process. Whereas wild type and control cells migrated toward the wound and closed the gap within 24 h, the GRP94 knockdown cells manifested a defect in cell migration and were unable to move efficiently toward the wound (Fig. 1A). Supplemental Videos 1 and 2 and Fig. 1A show that the control cells exhibit a bipolar morphology and formed filopodia toward the direction of migration. However, the GRP94 knockdown cells exhibited a round morphology during translocation/retraction and produced shorter projections throughout the cell membrane. The whole-cell motility behaviors were analyzed from long time lapse videos by tracking the movement of individual control or GRP94 knockdown cells toward the wound. Only independent cells moving into the wound were tracked because interactions with neighboring cells could complicate motility. Tracking studies yielded data for accumulated (total distance traveled) and Euclidean distance (straight line distance between the two points) (Fig. 1B). Comparisons of these data indicate that the GRP94 knockdown cells traveled ∼3-fold less total distance (Fig. 1B), but the Euclidean distance was ∼21-fold less than control cells during the same time. The control and GRP94 knockdown cells were similarly motile, and the trajectory plot shows that control cells moved toward the scratch. However, GRP94 knockdown cells moved in random directions and consequently did not travel toward the wound (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that the GRP94 knockdown cells are unable to sustain the directionality of movement. Consistent with the quantitative analyses, video observations of cell movement showed that the mutant cells exhibit a reduced ability to maintain the leading edge. Rescue experiments were performed to validate the effects of the GRP94 knockdown by introducing a canine GRP94-GFP-KDEL plasmid into the GRP94 knockdown cells. Fig. 1D is a fluorescent live cell image of a GRP94 knockdown cell expressing the GRP94-GFP with the ER marker KDEL (15.Ostrovsky O. Makarewich C.A. Snapp E.L. Argon Y. An essential role for ATP binding and hydrolysis in the chaperone activity of GRP94 in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11600-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rescue strain along with the control and GRP94 knockdown cells were used in the cell migration assay, and expression of GRP94-KDEL-GFP enabled the cells to migrate into the wound and completely close the wound gap in 24 h, similar to the control cells. As expected, the non-transfected GRP94 knockdown cells remained defective in cell migration (Fig. 1E). The morphology of control and GRP94 knockdown cells was studied by immunostaining with wheat germ agglutinin and live cell imaging. Control cells were mainly bipolar and produced a spindle-shaped morphology, whereas GRP94 knockdown cells exhibited a multipolar morphology with multiple edges (Fig. 2A). The morphological characteristics of the cells were measured using CellProfiler software. The compactness, minimum Feret diameter, and mean radius of GRP94 knockdown cells were significantly different from the control cells. The compactness of a cell is the variance of the radial distance of the object's pixels from the centroid divided by the area; a rounder cell is more compact. GRP94 knockdown cells are more compact than the control cells. Similarly, minimum Feret diameter is the minimum distance between two parallel lines tangent on either side of the object. A bipolar spindle-shaped cell will have lower minimum Feret diameter than a multipolar round shaped cell. Control cells had a lower minimum Feret diameter than the GRP94 knockdown cells. The mean radius is the mean distance of any pixel in the object to the closest pixel outside of the object. The mean radius of a circular object will be higher than a spindle-shaped cell. Quantification of the morphology of the control and GRP94 knockdown cells supports our observation that the control cells are bipolar and longer, whereas the GRP94 knockdown cells are multipolar and rounder (Fig. 2B). The canine GRP94-KDEL-GFP plasmids were transfected in the GRP94 knockdown cells, and the morphology was determined. The GFP-positive cells were bipolar, whereas the GFP-negative cells were multipolar/rounder in shape, clearly demonstrating the impact of GRP94 on cell morphology (Fig. 2C). Because the morphologies of the cells are heterogeneous and depend on whether the cells are actively moving, spreading cell assays were performed to investigate formation of the bipolar morphology. Cells were detached by trypsinization and allowed to respread on IBIDI-treated 15-μm slide wells, and cell morphology was recorded by time lapse imaging (Fig. 2D and supplemental Videos 3–5). The videos and the time lapse images of representative control, GRP94 knockdown, and GRP94 knockdown + GRP94-KDEL-GFP cells showed the control an"
https://openalex.org/W2263806061,"Abstract NusA is an essential protein that binds to RNA polymerase (RNAP) and also to the nascent RNA, and influences transcription by inducing pausing and facilitating the process of transcription termination / antitermination. Its participation in Rho-dependent transcription termination has been perceived, but the molecular nature of this involvement is not known. We hypothesized that as both Rho and NusA are RNA-binding proteins and have the potential to target the same RNA, the latter is likely to influence the global pattern of the Rho-dependent termination. Analyses of the nascent RNA-binding properties and consequent effects on the Rho-dependent termination functions of specific NusA-RNA binding domain mutants revealed an existence of Rho-NusA direct competition for the overlapping nut (NusA-binding site) and rut (Rho-binding site) sites on the RNA. This leads to delayed entry of Rho at the rut site that inhibits the RNA release process of the latter. High density tiling micro-array profiles of these NusA mutants revealed that a significant number of genes, together with transcripts from intergenic regions are up-regulated. Interestingly, majority of these genes were also up-regulated when the Rho function was compromised. These are strong evidences for the existence of NusA-binding sites in different operons which are also the targets of Rho-dependent terminations. Our data strongly argue in favor of a direct competition between NusA and Rho for the access of specific sites on the nascent transcripts in different parts of the genome. We propose that this competition enables NusA to function as a global antagonist of the Rho function, which is unlike its role as a facilitator of hairpin-dependent termination."
https://openalex.org/W2281022131,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is a well-studied growth regulatory pathway implicated in breast cancer biology. Clinical trials testing monoclonal antibodies directed against the type I IGF receptor (IGF1R) in combination with estrogen receptor-α (ER) targeting have been completed, but failed to show benefits in patients with endocrine-resistant tumors compared to ER targeting alone. We have previously shown that the closely related insulin receptor (InsR) is expressed in tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) breast cancer cells. Here we examined if inhibition of InsR affected TamR breast cancer cells. InsR function was inhibited by three different mechanisms: InsR short hairpin RNA, a small InsR-blocking peptide, S961 and an InsR monoclonal antibody (mAb). Suppression of InsR function by these methods in TamR cells successfully blocked insulin-mediated signaling, monolayer proliferation, cell cycle progression and anchorage-independent growth. This strategy was not effective in parental cells likely because of the presence of IGFR /InsR hybrid receptors. Downregulation of IGF1R in conjunction with InsR inhibition was more effective in blocking IGF- and insulin-mediated signaling and growth in parental cells compared with single-receptor targeting alone. Our findings show TamR cells were stimulated by InsR and were not sensitive to IGF1R inhibition, whereas in tamoxifen-sensitive parental cancer cells, the presence of both receptors, especially hybrid receptors, allowed cross-reactivity of ligand-mediated activation and growth. To suppress the IGF system, targeting of both IGF1R and InsR is optimal in endocrine-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2277731790,"Elvitegravir (EVG), an integrase inhibitor for the treatment HIV infection, is increasingly becoming the part of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. EVG is mainly metabolized through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Previously, we have shown that ethanol alters ART-CYP3A4 interactions with protease inhibitors thereby altering their metabolisms. However, as EVG is a fairly new class of drug, its kinetic characteristics and the effect of ethanol on EVG-CYPP3A4 interaction is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized EVG and cobicistat (COBI)-boosted EVG metabolism in human microsomes followed by ethanol-EVG, ethanol-COBI-EVG interaction with CYP3A. First, we developed and validated a simple, sensitive, and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of EVG in the human liver microsomes. The lower limit of quantification for the drug was at 0.003 μM (1.34 ng/ml). Extraction yield, matrix effects, drug stability, and calibration curves for the proposed method were validated according to the FDA guidelines. Time dependent kinetics data showed that 20mM ethanol decreases the apparent half-life of EVG degradation by ~50% compared to EVG alone. Our substrate kinetic results revealed that ethanol mildly decreases the catalytic efficiency for EVG metabolism. Inhibition studies demonstrated that EVG inhibits CYP3A4, and 20 mM ethanol causes a decrease in the IC50 of EVG. However, in the presence of COBI we were unable to determine these parameters effectively because COBI, being a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, blocked the EVG/ethanol-CYP3A4 interactions. Docking studies predicted a shift of EVG or COBI binding to the active site of CYP3A4 in the presence of ethanol. Taken together, these results suggest that ethanol interacts with microsomal CYP3A and alters EVG-CYP3A4 interaction thereby altering EVG metabolism and inhibition of CYP3A4 by EVG. This finding has clinical significance because alcohol use is highly prevalent in HIV population, and there are no separate guidelines for these patients while they are on ART medication."
https://openalex.org/W2256783701,"Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently one of the most popular, high-throughput and sensitive technologies available for quantifying gene expression. Its accurate application depends heavily upon normalisation of gene-of-interest data with reference genes that are uniformly expressed under experimental conditions. The aim of this study was to provide the first validation of reference genes for Lupinus angustifolius (narrow-leafed lupin, a significant grain legume crop) using a selection of seven genes previously trialed as reference genes for the model legume, Medicago truncatula. In a preliminary evaluation, the seven candidate reference genes were assessed on the basis of primer specificity for their respective targeted region, PCR amplification efficiency, and ability to discriminate between cDNA and gDNA. Following this assessment, expression of the three most promising candidates [Ubiquitin C (UBC), Helicase (HEL), and Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)] was evaluated using the NormFinder and RefFinder statistical algorithms in two narrow-leafed lupin lines, both with and without vernalisation treatment, and across seven organ types (cotyledons, stem, leaves, shoot apical meristem, flowers, pods and roots) encompassing three developmental stages. UBC was consistently identified as the most stable candidate and has sufficiently uniform expression that it may be used as a sole reference gene under the experimental conditions tested here. However, as organ type and developmental stage were associated with greater variability in relative expression, it is recommended using UBC and HEL as a pair to achieve optimal normalisation. These results highlight the importance of rigorously assessing candidate reference genes for each species across a diverse range of organs and developmental stages. With emerging technologies, such as RNAseq, and the completion of valuable transcriptome data sets, it is possible that other potentially more suitable reference genes will be identified for this species in future."
https://openalex.org/W2259361357,"Polyandry is widespread and influences patterns of sexual selection, with implications for sexual conflict over mating. Assessing sperm precedence patterns is a first step towards understanding sperm competition within a female and elucidating the roles of male- and female-controlled factors. In this study behavioural field data and genetic data were combined to investigate polyandry in the chokka squid Loligo reynaudii. Microsatellite DNA-based paternity analysis revealed multiple paternity to be the norm, with 79% of broods sired by at least two males. Genetic data also determined that the male who was guarding the female at the moment of sampling was a sire in 81% of the families tested, highlighting mate guarding as a successful male tactic with postcopulatory benefits linked to sperm deposition site giving privileged access to extruded egg strings. As females lay multiple eggs in capsules (egg strings) wherein their position is not altered during maturation it is possible to describe the spatial / temporal sequence of fertilisation / sperm precedence There were four different patterns of fertilisation found among the tested egg strings: 1) unique sire; 2) dominant sire, with one or more rare sires; 3) randomly mixed paternity (two or more sires); and 4) a distinct switch in paternity occurring along the egg string. The latter pattern cannot be explained by a random use of stored sperm, and suggests postcopulatory female sperm choice. Collectively the data indicate multiple levels of male- and female-controlled influences on sperm precedence, and highlights squid as interesting models to study the interplay between sexual and natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W2259843633,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized and studied as a mediator of heart disease. Extracellular flux analysis (XF) has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate cellular bioenergetics in the context of cardiac health and disease, however its use and interpretation requires improved understanding of the normal metabolic differences in cardiomyocytes (CM) at various stages of maturation. This study standardized XF analyses methods (mitochondrial stress test, glycolytic stress test and palmitate oxidation test) and established age related differences in bioenergetics profiles of healthy CMs at newborn (NB1), weaning (3WK), adult (10WK) and aged (12–18MO) time points. Findings show that immature CMs demonstrate a more robust and sustained glycolytic capacity and a relative inability to oxidize fatty acids when compared to older CMs. The study also highlights the need to recognize the contribution of CO2 from the Krebs cycle as well as lactate from anaerobic glycolysis to the proton production rate before interpreting glycolytic capacity in CMs. Overall, this study demonstrates that caution should be taken to assure that translatable developmental time points are used to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction as a cause of cardiac disease. Specifically, XF analysis of newborn CMs should be reserved to study fetal/neonatal disease and older CMs (≥10 weeks) should be used to investigate adult disease pathogenesis. Knowledge gained will aid in improved investigation of developmentally programmed heart disease and stress the importance of discerning maturational differences in bioenergetics when developing mitochondrial targeted preventative and therapeutic strategies for cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2265822778,"In cervical squamous cell carcinomas, high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) DNA is usually integrated into host chromosomes. Multiple integration events are thought to be present within the cells of a polyclonal premalignant lesion and the features that underpin clonal selection of one particular integrant remain poorly understood. We previously used the W12 model system to generate a panel of cervical keratinocyte clones, derived from cells of a low-grade premalignant lesion naturally infected with the major HRHPV type, HPV16. The cells were isolated regardless of their selective advantage and differed only by the site of HPV16 integration into the host genome. We used this resource to test the hypothesis that levels of HPV16 E6/E7 oncogene expression in premalignant cells are regulated epigenetically. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic landscape of the integrated HPV16 DNA in selected clones, in which levels of virus oncogene expression per DNA template varied ~6.6-fold. Across the cells examined, higher levels of virus expression per template were associated with more open chromatin at the HPV16 long control region, together with greater loading of chromatin remodelling enzymes and lower nucleosome occupancy. There were higher levels of histone post-translational modification hallmarks of transcriptionally active chromatin and lower levels of repressive hallmarks. There was greater abundance of the active/elongating form of the RNA polymerase-II enzyme (RNAPII-Ser2P), together with CDK9, the component of positive transcription elongation factor b complex responsible for Ser2 phosphorylation. The changes observed were functionally significant, as cells with higher HPV16 expression per template showed greater sensitivity to depletion and/or inhibition of histone acetyltransferases and CDK9 and less sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibition. We conclude that virus gene expression per template following HPV16 integration is determined through multiple layers of epigenetic regulation, which are likely to contribute to selection of individual cells during cervical carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2257631245,"Saliva is an integral factor in the feeding success of veterinary and medically important ticks. Therefore, the characterization of the proteins present in tick saliva is an important area of tick research. Here, we confirmed previously generated sialotranscriptome data using quantitative real-time PCR. The information obtained in this in-depth study of gene expression was used to measure the effects of metalloprotease gene silencing on tick feeding. We analyzed the temporal expression of seven housekeeping genes and 44 differentially expressed salivary molecules selected from a previously published Amblyomma americanum sialotranscriptome. Separate reference genes were selected for the salivary glands and midgut from among the seven housekeeping genes, to normalize the transcriptional expression of differentially expressed genes. The salivary gland reference gene, ubiquitin, was used to normalize the expression of 44 salivary genes. Unsurprisingly, each gene family was expressed throughout the blood meal, but the expression of specific genes differed at each time point. To further clarify the complex nature of the many proteins found in the saliva, we disrupted the translation of several members of the metalloprotease family. Intriguingly, the nucleotide sequence similarity of the reprolysin metalloprotease gene family is so homologous that a single synthesized dsRNA sequence knocked down multiple members of the family. The use of multigene knockdown yielded a more significant picture of the role of metalloproteases in tick feeding success, and changes were observed in the female engorgement weight and larval hatching success. Interestingly, the depletion of metalloprotease transcripts also reduced the total number of bacteria present in the salivary glands. These data provide insight into the expression and functions of tick salivary proteins expressed while feeding on its host."
https://openalex.org/W2276029261,"The transport of monocarboxylate fuels such as lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies across brain endothelial cells is mediated by monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1). Although the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is required for rodent blood-brain barrier development and for the expression of associated nutrient transporters, the role of this pathway in the regulation of brain endothelial MCT1 is unknown. Here we report expression of nine members of the frizzled receptor family by the RBE4 rat brain endothelial cell line. Furthermore, activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway in RBE4 cells via nuclear β-catenin signaling with LiCl does not alter brain endothelialMct1mRNA but increases the amount of MCT1 transporter protein. Plasma membrane biotinylation studies and confocal microscopic examination of mCherry-tagged MCT1 indicate that increased transporter results from reduced MCT1 trafficking from the plasma membrane via the endosomal/lysosomal pathway and is facilitated by decreased MCT1 ubiquitination following LiCl treatment. Inhibition of the Notch pathway by the γ-secretase inhibitorN-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycinet-butyl ester negated the up-regulation of MCT1 by LiCl, demonstrating a cross-talk between the canonical Wnt/β-catenin and Notch pathways. Our results are important because they show, for the first time, the regulation of MCT1 in cerebrovascular endothelial cells by the multifunctional canonical Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2414400803,"A widely used herbal medicine, Ixeris sonchifolia (Bge.) Hance Injectable (ISHI) was investigated for quality consistency. Characteristic fingerprints of 23 batches of the ISHI samples were generated at five wavelengths and evaluated by the systematic quantitative fingerprint method (SQFM) as well as simultaneous analysis of the content of seven marker compounds. Chemometric methods, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to assist in fingerprint evaluation of the ISHI samples. Qualitative classification of the ISHI samples by SVM was consistent with PCA, and in agreement with the quantitative evaluation by SQFM. In addition, the antioxidant activities of the ISHI samples were determined by both the off-line and on-line DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryldrazyl) radical scavenging assays. A fingerprint–efficacy relationship linking the chemical components and in vitro antioxidant activity was established and validated using the partial least squares (PLS) and orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) models; and the online DPPH assay further revealed those components that had position contribution to the total antioxidant activity. Therefore, the combined use of the chemometric methods, quantitative fingerprint evaluation by SQFM, and multiple marker compound analysis in conjunction with the assay of antioxidant activity provides a powerful and holistic approach to evaluate quality consistency of herbal medicines and their preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2254214692,"Significant controversy still exists about ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy (mtPI/rtv) as a simplification strategy that is used up to now to treat patients that have not experienced previous virological failure (VF) while on protease inhibitor (PI) -based regimens. We have evaluated the effectiveness of two mtPI/rtv regimens in an actual clinical practice setting, including patients that had experienced previous VF with PI-based regimens.This retrospective study analyzed 1060 HIV-infected patients with undetectable viremia that were switched to lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy. In cases in which the patient had previously experienced VF while on a PI-based regimen, the lack of major HIV protease resistance mutations to lopinavir or darunavir, respectively, was mandatory. The primary endpoint of this study was the percentage of participants with virological suppression after 96 weeks according to intention-to-treat analysis (non-complete/missing = failure).A total of 1060 patients were analyzed, including 205 with previous VF while on PI-based regimens, 90 of whom were on complex therapies due to extensive resistance. The rates of treatment effectiveness (intention-to-treat analysis) and virological efficacy (on-treatment analysis) at week 96 were 79.3% (CI95, 76.8-81.8) and 91.5% (CI95, 89.6-93.4), respectively. No relationships were found between VF and earlier VF while on PI-based regimens, the presence of major or minor protease resistance mutations, the previous time on viral suppression, CD4+ T-cell nadir, and HCV-coinfection. Genotypic resistance tests were available in 49 out of the 74 patients with VFs and only four patients presented new major protease resistance mutations.Switching to mtPI/rtv achieves sustained virological control in most patients, even in those with previous VF on PI-based regimens as long as no major resistance mutations are present for the administered drug."
https://openalex.org/W2272129348,"Dimunito/Dwarf1 (DWF1) is an oxidoreductase enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of C28- and C29-Δ24(28)-olefinic sterols to 24-methyl- and 24-ethylcholesterols. Generally, the reaction proceeds in two steps via the Δ24(25) intermediate. In this study, we characterized the ArDWF1 gene from an expression sequence tag library of Ajuga reptans var. atropurpurea hairy roots. The gene was functionally expressed in the yeast T21 strain. The in vivo and in vitro study of the transformed yeast indicated that ArDWF1 catalyzes the conversion of 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol. A labeling study followed by GC-MS analysis suggested that the reaction proceeded with retention of the C-25 hydrogen. The 25-H retention was established by the incubation of the enzyme with (23,23,25-2H3,28-13C)-24-methylenecholesterol, followed by 13C NMR analysis of the resulting campesterol. Thus, it has been concluded that ArDWF1 directly reduces 24-methylenecholesterol to produce campesterol without passing through a Δ24(25) intermediate. This is the first characterization of such a unique DWF1 enzyme. For comparison purposes, Oryza sativa DWF1 (OsDWF1) was similarly expressed in yeast. An in vivo assay of OsDWF1 supported the generally accepted two-step mechanism because the C-25 hydrogen of 24-methylenecholesterol was eliminated during its conversion to 24-methylcholesterol. As expected, the 24-methylcholesterol produced by OsDWF1 was a mixture of campesterol and dihydrobrassicasterol. Furthermore, the 24-methylcholesterol contained in the Ajuga hairy roots was determined to be solely campesterol through its analysis using chiral GC-MS.

https://openalex.org/W2257842595,"In inflammatory cells, hyperthermia inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression and protein secretion. Since hyperthermia alone stimulates IL-6 in skeletal muscle, we hypothesized that it would amplify responses to other receptor-mediated stimuli. IL-6 regulation was tested in C2C12 myotubes and in soleus during treatment with epinephrine (EPI) or LPS. In EPI-treated myotubes (100 ng/ml), 1 h exposure at 40.5°C-42°C transiently increased IL-6 mRNA compared to EPI treatment alone at 37°C. In LPS-treated myotubes (1 μg/ml), exposure to 41°C-42°C also increased IL-6 mRNA. In isolated mouse soleus, similar amplifications of IL-6 gene expression were observed in 41°C, during both low (1 ng/ml) and high dose (100 ng/ml) EPI, but only in high dose LPS (1 μg/ml). In myotubes, heat increased IL-6 secretion during EPI exposure but had no effect or inhibited secretion with LPS. In soleus there were no effects of heat on IL-6 secretion during either EPI or LPS treatment. Mechanisms for the effects of heat on IL-6 mRNA were explored using a luciferase-reporter in C2C12 myotubes. Overexpression of heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) had no impact on IL-6 promoter activity during EPI stimulation, but elevated IL-6 promoter activity during LPS stimulation. In contrast, when the activator protein-1 (AP-1) element was mutated, responses to both LPS and EPI were suppressed in heat. Using siRNA against activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3), a heat-stress-induced inhibitor of IL-6, no ATF-3-dependent effects were observed. The results demonstrate that, unlike inflammatory cells, hyperthermia in muscle fibers amplifies IL-6 gene expression to EPI and LPS. The effect appears to reflect differential engagement of HSF-1 and AP-1 sensitive elements on the IL-6 gene, with no evidence for involvement of ATF-3. The functional significance of increased IL-6 mRNA expression during heat may serve to overcome the well-known suppression of protein synthetic pathways occurring during heat shock."
https://openalex.org/W2278259264,"Approximately 100 million tons of anhydrosugars, such as levoglucosan and cellobiosan, are produced through biomass burning every year. These sugars are also produced through fast pyrolysis, the controlled thermal depolymerization of biomass. While the microbial pathways associated with levoglucosan utilization have been characterized, there is little known about cellobiosan utilization. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of six cellobiosan-utilizing microbes from soil samples. Each of these organisms is capable of using both cellobiosan and levoglucosan as sole carbon source, though both minimal and rich media cellobiosan supported significantly higher biomass production than levoglucosan. Ribosomal sequencing was used to identify the closest reported match for these organisms: Sphingobacterium multivorum, Acinetobacter oleivorans JC3-1, Enterobacter sp SJZ-6, and Microbacterium sps FXJ8.207 and 203 and a fungal species Cryptococcus sp. The commercially-acquired Enterobacter cloacae DSM 16657 showed growth on levoglucosan and cellobiosan, supporting our isolate identification. Analysis of an existing database of 16S rRNA amplicons from Iowa soil samples confirmed the representation of our five bacterial isolates and four previously-reported levoglucosan-utilizing bacterial isolates in other soil samples and provided insight into their population distributions. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA of strains previously reported to utilize levoglucosan and our newfound isolates showed that the organisms isolated in this study are distinct from previously described anhydrosugar-utilizing microbial species."
https://openalex.org/W2256107382,"Dispositional anxiety is a stable personality trait that is a key risk factor for internalizing disorders, and understanding the neural correlates of trait anxiety may help us better understand the development of these disorders. Abnormal cortical folding is thought to reflect differences in cortical connectivity occurring during brain development. Therefore, assessing gyrification may advance understanding of cortical development and organization associated with trait anxiety. Previous literature has revealed structural abnormalities in trait anxiety and related disorders, but no study to our knowledge has examined gyrification in trait anxiety. We utilized a relatively novel measure, the local gyrification index (LGI), to explore differences in gyrification as a function of trait anxiety. We obtained structural MRI scans using a 3T magnetic resonance scanner on 113 young adults. Results indicated a negative correlation between trait anxiety and LGI in the left superior parietal cortex, specifically the precuneus, reflecting less cortical complexity among those high on trait anxiety. Our findings suggest that aberrations in cortical gyrification in a key region of the default mode network is a correlate of trait anxiety and may reflect disrupted local parietal connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2287871441,"Cisplatin is an important antitumor agent, but its clinical utility is often limited by multifactorial mechanism of resistance. Loss of tumor suppressor p53 function is a major mechanism that is affected by either mutation in the DNA-binding domain or dysregulation by overexpression of p53 inhibitors MDM2 and MDM4, which destabilize p53 by increasing its proteosomal degradation. In the present study, cisplatin-resistant 2780CP/Cl-16 ovarian tumor cells expressed a heterozygous, temperature-sensitive p53(V172F) mutation, which reduced p53 half-life by two- to threefold compared with homozygous wild-type (wt) p53 in parental A2780 cells. Although reduced p53 stability in 2780CP/Cl-16 cells was associated with moderate cellular overexpression of MDM2 or MDM4 (<1.5-fold), their binding to p53 was substantially enhanced (five- to eightfold). The analogous cisplatin-resistant 2780CP/Cl-24 cells, which express loss of p53 heterozygosity, retained the p53(V172F) mutation and high p53-MDM4 binding, but demonstrated lower p53-bound MDM2 that was associated with reduced p53 ubiquitination and enhanced p53 stability. The inference that p53 was unstable as a heteromeric p53(wt)/p53(V172F) complex was confirmed in 2780CP/Cl-24 cells transfected with wt p53 or multimer-inhibiting p53(L344P) mutant, and further supported by normalization of p53 stability in both resistant cell lines grown at the permissive temperature of 32.5 °C. Surprisingly, in 2780CP/Cl-16 and 2780CP/Cl-24 models, cisplatin-induced transactivity of p53 was attenuated at 37 °C, and this correlated with cisplatin resistance. However, downregulation of MDM2 or MDM4 by small interfering RNA in either resistant cell line induced p53 and restored p21 transactivation at 37 °C, as did cisplatin-induced DNA damage at 32.5 °C that coincided with reduced p53-MDM4 binding and cisplatin resistance. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-mediated p53(V172F) mutation regulates p53 stability at the normothermic temperature, but it is the increased recruitment of MDM4 by the homomeric or heteromeric mutant p53(V172F) complex that inhibits p53-dependent transactivation. This represents a novel cellular mechanism of p53 inhibition, and, thereby, induction of cisplatin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2261542191,"The significance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for protein degradation has been highlighted in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, including retinal dystrophies. TOPORS, a dual E3 ubiquitin and SUMO1 ligase, forms a component of the UPS and selected substrates for its enzymatic activities, such as DJ-1/PARK7 and APOBEC2, are important for neuronal as well as retinal homeostasis, respectively. TOPORS is ubiquitously expressed, yet its mutations are only known to result in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. We performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen of a human retinal cDNA library in order to identify interacting protein partners of TOPORS from the retina, and thus begin delineating the putative disease mechanism(s) associated with the retina-specific phenotype resulting from mutations in TOPORS. The screen led to isolation of the 26 S protease regulatory subunit 4 (P26s4/ PSMC1), an ATPase indispensable for correct functioning of UPS-mediated proteostasis. The interaction between endogenous TOPORS and P26s4 proteins was validated by co-immuno-precipitation from mammalian cell extracts and further characterised by immunofluorescent co-localisation studies in cell lines and retinal sections. Findings from hTERT-RPE1 and 661W cells demonstrated that TOPORS and P26s4 co-localise at the centrosome in cultured cells. Immunofluorescent staining of mouse retinae revealed a strong P26s4 reactivity at the interface between retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) layer and the photoreceptors outer segments (OS). This finding leads us to speculate that P26s4, along with TOPORS, may have a role(s) in RPE phagocytosis, in addition to contributing to the overall photoreceptor and retinal homeostasis via the UPS."
https://openalex.org/W2256391853,"Background Amyloid deposition and white matter lesions (WMLs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both considered clinically significant while a larger brain volume is thought to provide greater brain reserve (BR) against these pathological effects. This study identified the topography showing BR in patients with mild AD and explored the clinical balances among BR, amyloid, and WMLs burden. Methods Thirty patients with AD were enrolled, and AV-45 positron emission tomography was conducted to measure the regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) in 8 cortical volumes-of- interests (VOIs). The quantitative WMLs burden was measured from magnetic resonance imaging while the normalized VOIs volumes represented BR in this study. The cognitive test represented major clinical correlates. Results Significant correlations between the prefrontal volume and global (r = 0.470, p = 0.024), but not regional (r = 0.264, p = 0.223) AV-45 SUVr were found. AD patients having larger regional volume in the superior- (r = 0.572, p = 0.004), superior medial- (r = 0.443, p = 0.034), and middle-prefrontal (r = 0.448, p = 0.032) regions had higher global AV-45 SUVr. For global WML loads, the prefrontal (r = -0.458, p = 0.019) and hippocampal volume (r = -0.469, p = 0.016) showed significant correlations while the prefrontal (r = -0.417, p = 0.043) or hippocampal volume (r = -0.422, p = 0.04) also predicted better composite memory scores. There were no interactions between amyloid SUVr and WML loads on the prefrontal volume. Conclusions BR of the prefrontal region might modulate the adverse global pathological burden caused by amyloid deposition. While prefrontal volume positively associated with hippocampal volume, WMLs had an adverse impact on the hippocampal volume that predicts memory performance in mild stage AD."

https://openalex.org/W2255567901,"Food consumption and preferences may be shaped by exposure to stressful environments during sensitive periods in development, and even small changes in consumption can have important effects on long term health. Adolescence is increasingly recognized as a sensitive period, in which adverse experiences can alter development, but the specific programming effects that may occur during adolescence remain incompletely understood. The current study seeks to explore the effects of stress during late adolescence on consumption of a palatable, high-fat, high-sugar food in adulthood-under basal conditions, as well following acute stress. Male Long-Evans rats were exposed to a regimen of variable stress for seven days in late adolescence (PND 45-51). During the stress regimen, stressed animals gained significantly less weight than control animals, but weight in adulthood was unaffected by adolescent stress. Palatable food consumption differed between experimental groups, and the direction of effect depended on context; stressed rats ate significantly more palatable food than controls upon first exposure, but ate less following an acute stressor. Leptin levels and exploratory behaviors did not differ between stressed and non-stressed groups, suggesting that other factors regulate preference for a palatable food. Altered food consumption following adolescent stress suggests that rats remain sensitive to stress during late adolescence, and that adult feeding behavior may be affected by previous adverse experiences. Such programming effects highlight adolescence as a period of plasticity, with the potential to shape long term food consumption patterns and preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2262717075,"Background Acculturation to the U.S. is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the etiologic pathways are not fully understood. Plasma fatty acid levels exhibit ethnic differences and are emerging as biomarkers and predictors of cardiovascular disease risk. Thus, plasma fatty acids may represent one pathway underlying the association between acculturation and cardiovascular disease. We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between acculturation and plasma phospholipid fatty acids in a diverse sample of Hispanic- and Chinese-American adults. Methods and Findings Participants included 377 Mexican, 320 non-Mexican Hispanic, and 712 Chinese adults from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, who had full plasma phospholipid assays and acculturation information. Acculturation was determined from three proxy measures: nativity, language spoken at home, and years in the U.S., with possible scores ranging from 0 (least acculturated) to 5 (most acculturated) points. α-Linolenic acid, linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and arachidonic acid were measured in fasting plasma. Linear regression models were conducted in race/ethnicity-stratified analyses, with acculturation as the predictor and plasma phospholipid fatty acids as the outcome variables. We ran secondary analyses to examine associations between acculturation and dietary fatty acids for comparison. Covariates included age, gender, education, and income. Contrary to our hypothesis, no statistically significant associations were detected between acculturation and plasma phospholipid fatty acids for Chinese, non-Mexican Hispanic, or Mexican participants. However, acculturation was related to dietary total n-6 fatty acids and dietary n-3/n-6 ratios in expected directions for Mexican, non-Mexican Hispanic, and combined Hispanic participants. In Chinese individuals, acculturation was unexpectedly associated with lower arachidonic acid intake. Conclusion Absence of associations between acculturation and plasma phospholipid fatty acids suggests that changes in the plasma phospholipid fatty acids studied do not account for the observed associations of acculturation to the U.S. and cardiovascular disease risk. Similar findings were observed for eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, when using dietary intake. However, the observed associations between dietary n-6 fatty acids and acculturation in Hispanic individuals suggest that dietary intake may be more informative than phospholipids when investigating acculturation effects. In Chinese individuals, acculturation may have a possible protective effect through decreased arachidonic acid intake. Further research on dietary fatty acids and other cardiovascular disease biomarkers is needed to identify possible etiologic mechanisms between acculturation and cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2259044614,"Renal development in rodents, unlike in humans, continues during early postnatal period. We aimed to evaluate whether the pharmacological inhibition of Endothelin system during this period affects renal development, both at structural and functional level in male and female rats. Newborn rats were treated orally from postnatal day 1 to 20 with vehicle or bosentan (Actelion, 20 mg/kg/day), a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA). The animals were divided in 4 groups: control males, control females, ERA males and ERA females. At day 21, we evaluated renal function, determined the glomerular number by a maceration method and by morphometric analysis and evaluated possible structural renal alterations by three methods: 〈alpha〉-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immunohistochemistry, Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining. The pharmacological inhibition of Endothelin system with a dual ERA during the early postnatal period of the rat did not leads to renal damage in the kidneys of male and female rats. However, ERA administration decreased the number of glomeruli, the juxtamedullary filtration surface area and the glomerular filtration rate and increased the proteinuria. These effects could predispose to hypertension or renal diseases in the adulthood. On the other hand, these effects were more pronounced in male rats, suggesting that there are sex differences that could be greater later in life. These results provide evidence that Endothelin has an important role in rat renal postnatal development. However these results do not imply that the same could happen in humans, since human renal development is complete at birth."

In clinical practice, we found that patients treated with I-131 often exhibit TAO; therefore, we aimed to establish a novel thyroid function fluctuated animal model of TAO by simulating the clinical treatment process.We treated SD rats with I-131 to damage the thyroid and then used sodium levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the thyroid hormone (TH) levels every seven days, leading to a fluctuating level of thyroid hormones that simulated the status of clinical TAO patients. Rats administered normal saline were considered as a control. The weight, intraocular pressure, and serum T3, T4, TSH and TRAb levels of the rats were measured, and the pathological changes were analyzed by H&E staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).The experimental rats (TAO group) exhibited significantly reduced weight and elevated intraocular pressure compared with the control rats. Meanwhile, the serum levels of T3 and T4 were up-regulated in the TAO group, but the TSH level decreased during the 10-week study. Moreover, increased numbers of blood vessels and inflammatory cell infiltrations were observed in the orbital tissues of the TAO rats, while no abnormal changes occurred in the control rats. The orbital myofibrils in the TAO rats appeared fractured and dissolved, with twisted structures. Mitochondrial swelling and vacuoles within the endoplasmic reticulum, swelling nerve fibers, shedding nerve myelin, and macrophages were found in the TAO group.Rats treated with I-131 and sodium levothyroxine exhibited characteristics similar to those of TAO patients in the clinic, providing an effective and simple method for the establishment of a stable animal model for research on the pathogenesis and treatment of TAO."
https://openalex.org/W2282430448,"The ability to eliminate undesired cells by apoptosis is a key mechanism to maintain organismal health and homeostasis. Failure to clear apoptotic cells efficiently can cause autoimmune diseases in mammals. Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have greatly helped to decipher the regulation of apoptotic cell clearance. In this study, we show that the loss of levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptor, but not of a typical neuronal acetylcholine receptor causes a reduction in the number of persistent cell corpses in worms suffering from an engulfment deficiency. This reduction is not caused by impaired or delayed cell death but rather by a partial restoration of the cell clearance capacity. Mutants in acetylcholine turn-over elicit a similar phenotype, implying that acetylcholine signaling is the process responsible for these observations. Surprisingly, tissue specific RNAi suggests that UNC-38, a major component of the levamisole-sensitive receptor, functions in the dying germ cell to influence engulfment efficiency. Animals with loss of acetylcholine receptor exhibit a higher fraction of cell corpses positive for the “eat-me” signal phosphatidylserine. Our results suggest that modulation by ion channels of ion flow across plasma membrane in dying cells can influence the dynamics of phosphatidylserine exposure and thus clearance efficiency."
