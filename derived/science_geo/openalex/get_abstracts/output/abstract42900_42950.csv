https://openalex.org/W2167604659,"Egr-1 is an early growth response gene that displays fos-like induction kinetics in fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and lymphocytes following mitogenic stimulation. Sequence analysis of murine Egr-1 cDNA predicts a protein with three DNA binding zinc fingers. The human EGR1 gene maps to chromosome 5 (bands 5q23-31). Egr-1 mRNA increases dramatically during cardiac and neural cell differentiation, and following membrane depolarization both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Egr-1 and c-fos are often coregulated with strikingly similar kinetics. These results, in conjunction with the Egr-1 primary structure, suggest that Egr-1 may function as a transcriptional regulator in diverse biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1980704858,The origin of living Homo sapiens has once again been the subject of much debate. Genetic data on present human population relationships and data from the Pleistocene fossil hominid record are used to compare two contrasting models for the origin of modern humans. Both genetics and paleontology support a recent African origin for modern humans rather than a long period of multiregional evolution accompanied by gene flow.
https://openalex.org/W2020358132,"A yeast GTP-binding protein, the YPT1 gene product, has been found to function early in the secretion pathway. The ypt1-1 mutation causes a phenotype reminiscent of early secretion-defective mutants, including accumulation of membranes and vesicles as well as a partial defect in secretion and incomplete glycosylation of invertase. Immunofluorescence localization studies using affinity-purified antibody directed against the YPT1 protein showed punctate staining of the cytoplasm of growing yeast cells and very intense staining of small buds, where membrane growth and secretion are most active. The punctate cytoplasmic staining is changed in a mutant (sec7) under conditions that cause aberrant Golgi structures to accumulate. The pattern of immunofluorescence obtained when mouse cells were stained with the antibody coincided closely with the pattern observed with wheat germ agglutinin, suggesting that a mammalian counterpart of the yeast YPT1 protein is located in the Golgi apparatus. These results are interpreted as suggesting that GTP-binding proteins may act to direct intracellular vesicle traffic."
https://openalex.org/W2106628955,"The adipocyte P2 (aP2) gene contains a regulatory element, FSE2, that functions during adipocyte differentiation and binds a protein complex containing the product of the fos proto-oncogene (Fos). We show here that the quantitative and qualitative nature of the FSE2 binding complex closely reflects the status of Fos expression within a given cell type. There is a dramatic increase in the FSE2 binding complex when Fos levels are induced with serum, benzodiazepine, and nerve growth factor or are expressed from a v-fos gene. Immunoblotting analysis of DNA retardation gels indicates a comigration of FSE2 complex with the predominant Fos species. Using a combination of mutational analyses of FSE2 and competition for binding with related sequences, we show that the Fos complex recognizes DNA containing the sequence TGACTCA, previously identified as the consensus binding site for the transcription factors AP-1 in mammalian cells and GCN4 in yeast. The simultaneous presence in cell extracts of proteins related to both AP-1 and Fos with similar sequence recognition properties was demonstrated by photo-cross-linking to FSE2 DNA and immunoprecipitating with antibodies directed toward c-fos or v-jun. These results suggest a functional relationship between Fos and AP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2036429346,"When injected into the cytoplasm of Vero cells, nucleoplasmin rapidly concentrates in a narrow layer around the nuclear envelope and then accumulates within the nucleus. Transport into the nucleus can be reversibly arrested at the perinuclear stage by metabolic inhibitors or by chilling. Nucleoplasmin-coated colloidal gold particles concentrate around the nuclear envelope of Vero cells or Xenopus oocytes, and by electron microscopy of oocytes appear to be associated with fibrils attached to nuclear pore complexes. Perinuclear accumulation is not observed for the nonmigrating nucleoplasmin core fragment or nonnuclear proteins. We propose two steps in nuclear migration of proteins: rapid binding around the nuclear envelope, possibly to pore-associated fibrils, followed by slower, energy-dependent translocation through nuclear pores."
https://openalex.org/W2012015460,"The heat-shock consensus element (HSE), CTNGAANNTTCNAG, is found in multiple copies upstream of all heat-shock genes. Here, the sequence requirements for heat-shock induction are tested by Drosophila germline transformation with an hsp70-lacZ gene fused to a pair of synthetic HSEs. Certain single-base substitutions in either HSE cause a dramatic reduction (forty-fold) in expression. Surprisingly, variations in sequences immediately flanking the HSEs also reduced levels of induction. One such variant that contains two perfect 14-base pair HSEs, which are correctly spaced relative to each other and the TATA box, retained only 7% of wild type-induced expression. These and additional analyses indicate that the heat-shock regulatory element includes sequences beyond the 14-base pair HSE and may be better described as a dimer of a 10-base pair sequence, NTTCNNGAAN."
https://openalex.org/W2089433978,"Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis is a primitive example of coupling between morphological changes and timing of gene expression during development. A major early control of transcriptional activity is dependent on a new sigma factor, sigma E, which is encoded by the sigE gene and synthesized as an inactive precursor, pro-sigma E. We show that mutations in the spoIIGA gene block the processing of pro-sigma E. Moreover, synthesis of both spoIIGA and sigE products in vegetative cells leads to expression of a sigma E-controlled promoter during growth, suggesting that SpoIIGA has pro-sigma E processing activity. The SpoIIGA polypeptide, which contains five potential transmembrane domains, is synthesized during sporulation 1 hr before processing activity can be detected. We propose that SpoIIGA processing activity is triggered by the presence of the sporulation septum, which is itself dependent on the spoIIAA and spoIIE products. These proteins are normally needed for pro-sigma E processing during sporulation but can be bypassed in vegetative cells. According to this model, a morphological structure would directly control the synthesis of a developmental sigma factor and would modify gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1590259662,"We have prepared polyclonal antiserum against sheep seminal vesicle prostaglandin H synthase (also termed cyclooxygenase) which cross-reacted with human cyclooxygenase, thereby enabling us to directly determine the synthetic rate of cyclooxygenase protein and its modulation by the monokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). Cultured human dermal fibroblast cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and the membrane-bound cyclooxygenase was solubilized and immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled fibroblast cyclooxygenase migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular size of approximately 73,000 daltons, similar to that of native sheep cyclooxygenase and of cyclooxygenase covalently labeled by [3H]aspirin, i.e. [3H]acetylcyclooxygenase. Additional validation of the immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled cyclooxygenase band indicated that it was specifically displaced by unlabeled sheep cyclooxygenase. N-terminal amino acid radiosequence analysis of [3H]proline-labeled cyclooxygenase revealed [3H]proline residues in positions 3, 6, and 8, consistent with the previously reported N-terminal sequence of sheep cyclooxygenase. Endoglycosidase H treatment of 35S-labeled fibroblast cyclooxygenase caused a decline in apparent molecular size (due to removal of mannose residues) which was similar to that seen with the native sheep cyclooxygenase. [35S]Methionine pulse-chase experiments indicated a half-life of 1 h for fibroblast cyclooxygenase. The monokine interleukin-1 stimulated fibroblast cyclooxygenase synthesis in a time- and dose-dependent fashion; as little as 0.03 unit/ml of IL-1 produced significant stimulation of 35S-labeled cyclooxygenase synthesis. Maximum stimulation was 3-10-fold after preincubation of the cells with 0.3 unit/ml of IL-1 for 12-16 h. IL-1 treatment of cells yielded parallel dose-response curves for stimulation of prostaglandin E2 formation, increased cellular cyclooxygenase activity, and increased synthetic rate of newly formed cyclooxygenase, suggesting that the IL-1 effect is mediated mainly, if not solely, via induction of cyclooxygenase synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1608611896,"The effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on the function of the insulin receptor was examined in intact hepatoma cells (Fao) and in solubilized extracts purified by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography. Incubation of ortho[32P]phosphate-labeled Fao cells with TPA increased the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor 2-fold after 30 min. Analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides from the beta-subunit of the receptor by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and determination of their phosphoamino acid composition suggested that TPA predominantly stimulated phosphorylation of serine residues in a single tryptic peptide. Incubation of the Fao cells with insulin (100 nM) for 1 min stimulated 4-fold the phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor. Prior treatment of the cells with TPA inhibited the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation by 50%. The receptors extracted with Triton X-100 from TPA-treated Fao cells and purified on immobilized wheat germ agglutinin retained the alteration in kinase activity and exhibited a 50% decrease in insulin-stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation and phosphotransferase activity toward exogenous substrates. This was due primarily to a decrease in the Vmax for these reactions. TPA treatment also decreased the Km of the insulin receptor for ATP. Incubation of the insulin receptor purified from TPA-treated cells with alkaline phosphatase decreased the phosphate content of the beta-subunit to the control level and reversed the inhibition, suggesting that the serine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit was responsible for the decreased tyrosine kinase activity. Our results support the notion that the insulin receptor is a substrate for protein kinase C in the Fao cell and that the increase in serine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the receptor produced by TPA treatment inhibited tyrosine kinase activity in vivo and in vitro. These data suggest that protein kinase C may regulate the function of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2100778705,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) is a growth modulator which stimulates the growth of fibroblasts but acts as a strong growth inhibitor for cells of epithelial origin. TGF beta also influences the production of extracellular matrix proteins and of proteases and protease inhibitors by cultured cells. One important protease inhibitor whose production is affected rapidly by TGF beta is the type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). To investigate the relationships between PAI-1 and the extracellular matrix, we analyzed the regulation by TGF beta of PAI-1, fibronectin, and type I procollagen in malignant human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and in human lung fibroblasts (WI-38). The expression of the respective genes was examined by polypeptide analyses and by measurements of the steady-state levels of the corresponding mRNAs by Northern hybridization. The mRNA levels for PAI-1 were elevated rapidly by TGF beta in both cell lines. This induction occurred in the presence of cycloheximide and thus was not dependent on protein synthesis. In fact, the effects of TGF beta and cycloheximide on PAI-1 mRNA were additive. In contrast, the induction of fibronectin, beta-actin, and type I procollagen (synthesized only in WI-38 cells) was abrogated by cycloheximide. In general, the effects of TGF beta on the steady-state levels of mRNAs for fibronectin, actin, and type I procollagen mRNA were similar in the two cell types. However, the production of PAI-1 mRNA in response to TGF beta differed in the two cell types, being transient (peak within 5 h) in the carcinoma cells and more persistent in fibroblasts. Thus, the major difference in TGF beta regulation of PAI-1 mRNA between lung fibroblasts and carcinoma cells was the duration of the effect. These results, together with previous data, suggest that PAI-1 and plasminogen activators may be regulated oppositely by TGF beta. We therefore propose a model for TGF beta in the regulation of extracellular proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1974308772,"The alterations in morphology and function of the ovarian follicle as it matures, ovulates, and becomes a corpus luteum are dramatic. A variety of steroid and polypeptide hormones influence these processes, and the ovary in turn produces specific hormonal signals for endocrine regulation. One such signal is inhibin, a heterodimeric protein that suppresses the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from pituitary gonadotrophs. Rat inhibin complementary DNA probes have been used to examine the levels and distribution of inhibin α- and βA-subunit messenger RNAs in the ovaries of cycling animals. Striking, dynamic changes have been found in inhibin messenger RNA accumulation during the developmental maturation of the ovarian follicle."
https://openalex.org/W2123903336,"The α2 protein of S. cerevisiae, the product of the MATα2 gene, represses a set of cell-type-specific genes (the a-specific genes) by binding to an operator sequence upstream of each gene. We demonstrate that a second yeast regulatory protein, at, the product of the MATαl gene, can alter the binding specificity of α2 so that it no longer recognizes the a-specific gene operator, but instead acquires the ability to recognize a different operator sequence found upstream of haploid-specific genes. Thus, under the influence of a1, α2 can repress haploid-specific genes. An α cell expresses a2 but not at, so that a2 turns off only the a-specific genes. An a/α cell makes both a1 and α2, in a ratio that ensures that α2 is distributed between two distinct binding modes: the α2 binding mode and the a1-α2 binding mode. Thus in an a/α cell, α2 represses two distinct classes of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1561770236,"At least six GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) with Mr values between 20,000 and 25,000 were extracted from the crude membrane fraction of bovine brain by sodium cholate and purified by successive column chromatographies of Ultrogel AcA-44, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q HR5/5. One G protein with a Mr of about 24,000 (24K G) was purified to near homogeneity and characterized. 24K G bound maximally about 0.7 mol of [35S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)/mol of protein with a Kd value of about 46 nM. [35S]GTP gamma S binding to this protein was inhibited by GTP and GDP, but not by other nucleotides such as ATP, UTP, and CTP. 24K G hydrolyzed GTP to liberate Pi with a rate of about 40 mmol of Pi/mol of protein/min. 24K G did not associate with the beta gamma subunit of Go. 24K G was distinguishable on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from the ras protein (ras p21) and ADP-ribosylation factor, the G protein with a Mr of about 21,000 serving as a cofactor for the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of Gs. 24K G was not recognized by the antibody against ras p21, ADP-ribosylation factor, the alpha subunit each of Gs, Gi, and Go, or tubulin. These results indicate that 24K G is a novel G protein and suggest that there are multiple forms of G proteins with small Mr values as is the case with the G proteins which have the alpha subunits with Mr values of about 40,000."
https://openalex.org/W1999757767,"We have previously shown that inhibition of uPA activity of a human tumor- HEp3-results in a drastic reduction of its metastasis in the chick embryo. Using 125IUdR-labeled tumor cells, we have now studied the role of uPA in individual steps of tumor metastasis. We found that, 48 hr after inoculation of tumor cells on the CAM, the organs of the embryos, inoculated with cells in which uPA was inhibited, contained 4-fold less cells than the controls. Neither the initial advance of the tumor mass into the CAM nor the process of extravasation was affected by the inhibition of tumor uPA. However, the infiltration of the CAM mesenchyme by individual tumor cells was blocked when tumor uPA activity or production was inhibited. In addition, indirect evidence implicated uPA as an essential factor in the tumor cell intravasation."
https://openalex.org/W2006931948,The magnitude of the response to interferons and the requirement for individual elements in the promoter of the H-2Dd gene were shown to be cell-specific and dependent on the type of interferon used. Three DNA sequences in the promoter were found to bind murine nuclear factors. Two of these sequences are in functionally defined enhancer regions and also bind to the transcription factor AP-1. The third sequence is part of the region involved in interferon regulation and is homologous to the enhancer element of the interferon beta gene. A model for interferon regulation of H-2 promoters is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1585197668,"In an attempt to identify features of an oxygen-regulated promoter, we have determined the location of transcription initiation for the puf operon. The position for the oxygen-regulated promoter was demonstrated by several independent means to be located 699 base pairs (bp) upstream from the pufB structural gene. DNA sequence analysis of the promoter region demonstrates the presence of a 26-base pair region of dyad symmetry followed by a sequence containing homology to promoters which use the RNA polymerase sigma 60 subunit (ntrA) for recognition of DNA. In addition to the oxygen-regulated promoter, a region responsible for low-level constitutive expression of the puf operon was shown to initiate transcription 511 bp upstream from the pufB gene. In contrast to the oxygen-regulated promoter, this second promoter contains no obvious secondary structure nor sequence homology to ntrA-dependent promoters. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates the existence of an additional open reading frame (designated as pufQ) that is located between the promoters and the pufB structural gene. A translational fusion of pufQ to lacZ was used to demonstrate that pufQ is efficiently translated and regulated in a manner analogous to a translational fusion of pufM to lacZ. Finally, we also demonstrate that puf operon transcription initiation and regulation does not involve any puf-encoded gene products."
https://openalex.org/W2019480030,"Cell surface beta-1,4 galactosyltransferase (GalTase) is shown to mediate intercellular adhesions between embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and specifically during late morula compaction in the preimplantation mouse embryo. Monospecific anti-GalTase IgG raised against affinity-purified bovine beta-1,4 GalTase recognizes F9 EC cell GalTase as judged by immunoprecipitation and inhibition of GalTase activity, as well as by immunoprecipitation of a single 52 kd metabolically labeled membrane protein. Anti-GalTase IgG inhibits cell adhesions between EC cells, dissociates compacted mouse morulae, and inhibits blastocyst formation. Anti-GalTase IgG specifically inhibits cell adhesions during late morula compaction, coincident with a peak of surface GalTase activity as determined by direct enzyme assay. On EC cells, GalTase activity can be proteolytically released from intact cells, and is localized by indirect immunofluorescence to areas of intercellular contact, consistent with its proposed role in cell adhesion. Beta-1,4 GalTase is the first cell adhesion molecule identified that participates during late morula compaction, subsequent to uvomorulin function."
https://openalex.org/W1547060957,"Specific, high affinity sulfonylurea receptors were characterized on membranes of an insulin-secreting hamster beta cell line (HIT cells). Saturable binding of the sulfonylurea, [3H]glyburide, was linear up to 0.8 mg/ml membrane protein. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data at room temperature indicated the presence of a single class of saturable, high affinity binding sites with a Kd of 0.76 +/- 0.04 nM and a Bmax of 1.09 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg protein, n = 9. The insulin secretory potency of glyburide, glipizide, tolbutamide, tolazamide, and carboxytolbutamide was compared to the ability of these ligands to displace [3H]glyburide from the sulfonylurea receptor. Tolbutamide, tolazamide, and glipizide demonstrated reasonable agreement with ED50 values of 15 microM, 3 microM, and 30 nM and Ki values of 25.3 microM, 7.2 microM, and 45 nM, respectively. The inactive tolbutamide metabolite, carboxytolbutamide, at the highest concentration tested, only partially displaced [3H]glyburide from the receptor and was a very poor secretagogue. At 37 degrees C the affinity of [3H]glyburide binding, Kd = 2.0 nM, was similar to the ED50 of 5.5 nM when the free glyburide concentrations were corrected for binding of the drug to albumin. These studies suggest that sulfonylureas initiate their biologic effect through a high affinity, specific interaction with sulfonylurea receptors on the beta cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2129059884,"The addition of poly(ADP-ribose) chains to nuclear proteins has been reported to affect DNA repair and DNA synthesis in mammalian cells. The enzyme that mediates this reaction, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, requires DNA for catalytic activity and is activated by DNA with strand breaks. Because the catalytic activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase does not necessarily reflect enzyme quantity, little is known about the total cellular poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase content and the rate of its synthesis and degradation. In the present experiments, specific human autoantibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and a sensitive immunoblotting technique were used to determine the cellular content of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in human lymphocytes. Resting peripheral blood lymphocytes contained 0.5 X 10(6) enzyme copies per cell. After stimulation of the cells by phytohemagglutinin, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase content increased before DNA synthesis. During balanced growth, the T lymphoblastoid cell line CEM contained approximately 2 X 10(6) poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase molecules per cell. This value did not vary by more than 2-fold during the cell growth cycle. Similarly, mRNA encoding poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was detectable throughout S phase. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase turned over at a rate equivalent to the average of total cellular proteins. Neither the cellular content nor the turnover rate of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase changed after the introduction of DNA strand breaks by gamma irradiation. These results show that in lymphoblasts poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is an abundant nuclear protein that turns over relatively slowly and suggest that most of the enzyme may exist in a catalytically inactive state."
https://openalex.org/W1528118032,"beta-D-Galactosidase activity has been detected previously in the cotyledons of germinated nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) seeds and has been linked to the hydrolysis in vivo of storage xyloglucan (amyloid) (Edwards, M., Dea, I. C. M., Bulpin, P. V., and Reid, J. S. G. (1985) Planta (Berl.) 163, 133-140). The major beta-D-galactosidase present in extracts from the cotyledons of 9-day seedlings has now been purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme (Mr 97,000, no subunits) comprised a range of closely related molecular species ranging in isoelectric point from pH 6.6 to 7.1. Further purification to give a single protein band on isoelectric focusing (pI = 7.1) was achieved by chromatofocusing. The pH optimum of the enzyme (mixed molecular species) was 4.0-5.0 (stable from pH 3-10), and the temperature optimum was 50 degrees C (stable to 50 degrees C). It hydrolyzed lactose and beta-D-galactopyranosides but not melibiose and alpha-D-galactopyranosides. It did not release the terminal nonreducing alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residues from seed galactomannans, but catalyzed the rapid removal of terminal nonreducing beta-D-galactopyranosyl residues from xyloglucans. On the basis of the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze xyloglucans, the kinetics of xyloglucan hydrolysis, and an experimental demonstration of a clear correlation between xyloglucan depletion and the activity in vitro of this enzyme, it is argued that the cell-wall storage xyloglucan of the nasturtium seed is its natural substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1579360091,"The translational control of ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase) by polyamines has been studied using a cellular as well as a cell-free system. A mutant L1210 cell line, in which ODCase represents 4-5% of all soluble protein synthesized, was isolated by stepwise selection for resistance to the ODCase inhibitor 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). The exceptionally high expression of ODCase in these cells was due to amplification of the ODCase gene. When the cells were grown in the absence of DFMO, dramatic increases in cellular putrescine and spermidine levels occurred. These increases were accompanied by a rapid decrease in ODCase synthesis. The change in ODCase synthesis was not associated with an alteration in the amount of ODCase mRNA, demonstrating a translational control in these cells. The effects of polyamines on ODCase mRNA translation were also studied in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using mRNA isolated from the DFMO-resistant cells. Low concentrations of spermidine stimulated synthesis of ODCase and that of total protein, when added to gel-filtered lysates. Notably, optimal stimulation of ODCase synthesis was achieved at a spermidine concentration lower than that required for an optimal rate of total protein synthesis. Higher concentrations of spermidine were inhibitory, and their effects of ODCase synthesis were stronger than on protein synthesis in general, resulting in a decrease in the fraction of protein synthesis accounted for by ODCase. The present results demonstrate that at least part of the feedback regulation of ODCase exerted by the polyamines is due to direct inhibition of ODCase mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W1573267684,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates plasmin generation by inhibiting urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator. The primary structure of PAI-2 suggests that it may be secreted without cleavage of a single peptide. To confirm this hypothesis we have studied the glycosylation and secretion of PAI-2 in human monocytic U-937 cells by metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation, glycosidase digestion, and protein sequencing. PAI-2 is variably glycosylated on asparagine residues to yield intracellular intermediates with zero, one, two, or three high mannose-type oligosaccharide units. Secretion of the N-glycosylated species began by 1 h of chase and the secreted molecules contained both complex-type N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides. Enzymatically deglycosylated PAI-2 had an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the nonglycosylated precursor and also to that of PAI-2 synthesized in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate from synthetic mRNA derived from full length PAI-2 cDNA. The amino-terminal protein sequence of secreted PAI-2 began with the initiator methionine residue. These results indicate that PAI-2 is glycosylated and secreted efficiently without the cleavage of a signal peptide. PAI-2 shares this property with its nearest homologue in the serine protease inhibitor family, chicken ovalbumin, and appears to be the first well characterized example of this phenomenon among natural mammalian proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2084886773,"The DNA sequences at the ends of the linear mtDNAof 6 species of Tetrahymena encompassing 13 strains were determined. All the strains have variable numbers of a tandemly repeated DNA sequence, 31 bp to 53 bp in size, at their mtDNA termini. Based upon the size and nucleotide sequence of the terminal repeats, the telomeres can be separated into four classes. T. pigmentosa, hyperangularis, and hegewischi have different telomeric repeats on the two ends of their mtDNAs. The only conserved feature of the mtDNA termini is the presence of tandem repeats. The function of the repeats might be to promote unequal crossing over during recombination, thereby overcoming the problem of telomere replication for these linear DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1501259224,"Heat shock or arsenite treatment alter the pattern of histone methylation in Drosophila cells. Both types of stress induce a rapid increase in the methylation level of histone H2B. The methylated amino acid residue of H2B has been identified by thin layer chromatography and electrophoresis as methylproline and is located at the N-terminal end of H2B. Heat shock also induces a decrease in the level of methylation of histone H3. Under normal growth temperature conditions, histone H3 is shown to be methylated on lysine residues. However under heat shock conditions, there is a decrease in the extent of methylation of lysine residues and the appearance of new methylation on arginine residues in H3. These new heat shock-induced methylated residues have been identified as the symmetrical and asymmetrical forms of dimethylarginine. The methylated amino acid residue of histone H4 is lysine with mono-, di-, and trimethyl forms found in both control and heat or chemically stressed cells. These stress-induced changes in the methylation level of the N-terminal proline residue of histone H2B and shift in the methylation sites of histone H3 may be involved in the restructuration of chromatin accompanying the inactivation of normal genes in response to stress. Moreover, we suggest that the hypermethylation of H2B may also be involved in its protection from increased ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic activity under these conditions of cellular stress."
https://openalex.org/W1523552510,"Substitutions for active-site lysyl residues at positions 166 and 329 in ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum have been shown to abolish catalytic activity. Treatment of the Cys-166 and Cys-329 mutant proteins with 2-bromoethylamine partially restores enzyme activity, presumably as a consequence of selective aminoethylation of the thiol group unique to each protein. Amino acid analyses, slow inactivation of the wild-type carboxylase by bromoethylamine, and the failure of bromoethylamine to restore activity to the corresponding glycyl mutant proteins support this interpretation. The observed facile, selective aminoethylations may reflect an active site microenvironment not dissimilar to that of the native enzyme. Catalytic constants of these novel carboxylases, which contain a sulfur atom in place of a specific lysyl gamma-methylene group, are significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the aminoethylated mutant proteins form isolable complexes with a transition state analogue, but with compromised stabilities. These detrimental effects by such a modest structural change underscore the stringent requirement for lysyl side chains at positions 166 and 329. In contrast, the aminoethylated mutant proteins exhibit carboxylase/oxygenase activity ratios and Km values that are unperturbed relative to those for the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1514759831,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a mosaic protein containing several distinct structural domains attached to the serine protease catalytic unit present at its COOH terminus. To investigate structure-function relationships in t-PA, we deleted the NH2-terminal domains, finger and epidermal growth factor, by genetic engineering. The genes for the parent and mutant t-PA were expressed in a bovine papilloma virus-dependent mammalian cell system. The secreted proteins were purified to homogeneity. The mutant protein was processed to the expected size of about 60 kDa compared to approximately 68 kDa for the parent t-PA, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fibrin autography. While the mutant t-PA had amidolytic activity comparable to native t-PA, it did not bind appreciably to fibrin. Consequently, fibrin-dependent enzymic activity, i.e. plasminogen activation in the presence of soluble fibrin and fibrinolysis were lower than with native recombinant t-PA. The effect of deletion of NH2-terminal domains on the plasma half-life (t1/2) was investigated by injecting native and mutant t-PA into mice. While the majority of the t-PA disappeared initially with a t1/2 of about 2 min, mutant t-PA cleared at a much slower rate with t1/2 of about 50 min. These findings suggest that the NH2-terminal domains of t-PA not only determine its specificity for binding to fibrin but also mediate its clearance from plasma in vivo. Furthermore, the catalytic unit in t-PA seems to function autonomously."
https://openalex.org/W1493393899,"Fluorescent probes have been used to obtain dissociation constants for the fluid-phase interaction of human plasma fibronectin and several of its gelatin-binding fragments with purified alpha chains of type I rat tail collagen, as well as with a cyanogen bromide fragment (CB7) of the alpha 1 chain in 0.02 M Tris buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl at pH 7.4. Addition of fibronectin to fluorescein-labeled collagen chains caused a dose-dependent increase in the fluorescence anisotropy which continued over several logs of titrant concentration. Scatchard-type plots of the anisotropy response were biphasic indicating the presence of one or more weak sites (Kd greater than microM) along the collagen chain in addition to a strong site characterized by Kd = 1.3 X 10(-8) M at 25 degrees C. Gelatin-binding fragments with Mr = 42,000, 60,000, and 72,000 also produced a biphasic response with Kd values for the high affinity site being 10- to 20-fold greater than for intact fibronectin. Binding of fibronectin and its fragments to fluorescent-labeled CB7 was essentially the same as to the whole alpha 1 chain. In all cases, the anisotropy response could be reversed or prevented by addition of excess unlabeled gelatin or CB7, but not by synthetic peptides spanning the collagenase cleavage site of alpha 1 (I). Studies of the temperature dependence of Kd for binding of fibronectin to the high affinity site on alpha 1 produced a value of +16 kcal/mol for the enthalpy of dissociation below 30 degrees C. Above this temperature, fibronectin appeared to undergo a subtle conformational transition characterization by a reduced affinity for collagen. This transition occurred in whole fibronectin but not in the gelatin-binding fragments and may involve disruption of intramolecular interactions between different domains."
https://openalex.org/W1606224998,"The MDA-468 human breast cancer cell line has an amplified epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene (20 x) and correspondingly overexpresses the EGF receptor. Since this cell line is growth inhibited by supra-physiological levels of EGF in tissue culture, it has been possible to select variant cells which have lost the chromosome bearing the amplified EGF receptor domain and which are capable of growing in high levels of EGF. One such cell line (MDA-468-S4) shows an absolute requirement for EGF for growth in anchorage-independent tissue culture conditions. We have utilized MDA-468 and MDA-468-S4 to examine the intracellular transduction of EGF signals leading to growth inhibition and proliferation, respectively. We report that in anchorage-independent conditions, pertussis toxin can abrogate both the EGF-dependent growth inhibition in MDA-468 cells and the EGF-dependent cell proliferation in MDA-468-S4 cells. This inhibition is paralleled by the ADP-ribosylation of an endogenous 41,000-dalton membrane protein in both MDA-468 and MDA-468-S4 cells. In contrast, the toxin does not prevent the transient, augmented expression of c-myc and c-fos mRNA seen in response to EGF in both cell types. These data suggest 1) the notion of more than one simultaneous, parallel, intracellular EGF-dependent signal transduction pathway and 2) G-protein involvement in at least one pathway mandatory for the growth modulating responses to EGF in anchorage-independent conditions, but distinct from that inducing c-myc and c-fos mRNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W1562228716,"Mononuclear phagocytes release interleukin-1 (IL-1), a 17-kDa polypeptide with diverse biological activities. IL-1 is synthesized as a precursor (31 kDa) which lacks a signal sequence or hydrophobic domains that could facilitate transmembrane translocation. Possible postsynthetic modifications of IL-1 that might account for its cellular transport were examined. We found that lipopolysaccharide stimulated, but not unstimulated, murine macrophages incorporated 32PO4 into the IL-1 alpha precursor (31 kDa) predominantly at residue serine 90. Released IL-1 alpha (17 kDa) is not phosphorylated in agreement with peptide sequence data that the site of 32P incorporation is in the amino-terminal one-third of the precursor. Approximately 10% of the phosphorylated IL-1 alpha precursor is membrane bound and associated with a fraction enriched in lysosomal vesicles. Together these data suggest mechanisms by which the postsynthetic proteolysis of the IL-1 alpha precursor may be modified and cellular transport of IL-1 alpha is accomplished."
https://openalex.org/W1547503414,"To investigate the mechanism of control of intestinal apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion, we studied the effects of fatty acids and calcium ionophores on the human intestinal model cell line Caco-2. Although treatment with various fatty acids (18:1w9, 18:2w6, and 20:5w3) complexed to bovine serum albumin resulted in a dramatic redistribution of apoB-100 from the low density and high density lipoproteins to the very low density lipoprotein fraction, there was no effect of any of the fatty acids on the overall rate of total apoB (apoB-100 and apoB-48) secretion. Treatment of differentiated monolayers with calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin caused dose-specific increases (125% at 1 microM) in the accumulation of total apoB, but not apoA-I, in conditioned medium as measured by specific immunoassays. Incubation studies with 35S-labeled Caco-2 apoB,E-containing low density lipoprotein particles revealed that treatment with ionomycin over a broad concentration range had no effect on the reuptake of secreted apoB-100. The effect on A23187 on total apoB secretion was blocked by prior chelation of medium calcium and was significantly enhanced by the addition of calcium (up to 50 mM) to the medium. The effect of A23187 was significantly blunted by treatment with the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine (10 microM). The time course of A23187 action on Caco-2 apoB secretion required at least 6 h to occur. In contrast to the concentration of apoB in the medium, cellular apoB content was not influenced by treatment with ionophore. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated a significant reduction in the synthesis-secretion interval for apoB-100 and apoB-48 after 24 h of exposure to ionomycin. Neither fatty acid treatment nor stimulation with ionophore affected the ratio of apoB-100 to apoB-48 produced by the cells. These findings with calcium ionophores implicate the involvement of calcium ion in the mechanism of intestinal apoB secretion. A role for calcium-dependent processes in apoB production raises the possibility that, rather than fatty acid flux, calcium-evoked or calcium-dependent hormones may be important regulators of apoB secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1568220920,"Recent data from several studies have suggested that the non-protease domains in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) determine their biological specificities, including binding to fibrin clots and survival in the circulatory system (Van Zonneveld, A.-J., Veerman, H., and Pannekoek, H. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 4670-4674; Rijken, D. C., and Emeis, J. J. (1986) Biochem. J. 238, 643-646). Structural manipulations (e.g. deletions, additions, or substitutions) in these domains can thus be utilized to maximize the desired biological effects. Using recombinant DNA technology, we constructed a number of hybrid molecules from the t-PA and u-PA genes. In hybrid A, the epidermal growth factor and finger domains of t-PA (residues 1-91) were replaced by the epidermal growth factor and kringle of u-PA (residues 1-131). In hybrids B and C, the u-PA kringle (residues 50-131) was inserted either before (residue 92) or after (residue 261) the double-kringle region of t-PA. All these hybrid PAs containing three kringles were expressed in mouse fibroblast cells (C-127). The hybrid proteins were synthesized in predominantly a single-chain form with molecular weights of 70,000-80,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were enzymatically active as assayed by the fibrin-agar plate method. In vitro studies on the binding of hybrid PAs to fibrin showed that hybrid B, like t-PA, possesses affinity toward fibrin, while hybrid A shows lower binding. This suggests that the finger domain, which is not present in hybrid A, plays a role in conferring fibrin affinity to the hybrid PAs. The enzymatic activities of the hybrids were compared with that of recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) expressed in the same vector/host system and found to be similar in activity toward a chromogenic peptide substrate. In addition, plasminogen activation with all the hybrid-PAs, as with rt-PA, was stimulated by fibrin, with the order of activity being rt-PA greater than or equal to hybrid B greater than hybrid C greater than hybrid A. This study shows the feasibility of shuffling functional domain(s) of known specificity in plasminogen activators which may lead to the design of a superior thrombolytic agent."
https://openalex.org/W1569233325,"Resonance Raman scattering by the carotenoid, spirilloxanthin (Spx), in a suspension of chromatophores (cytoplasmic side out) isolated from the photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum, is greatly enhanced when the membranes are adsorbed onto the surface of an anodized Ag electrode. The phenomenon is the basis for surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) spectroscopy. The Spx SERRS peaks observed were at 1505-1510, 1150-1155, and 1000-1005 cm-1 with laser excitation wavelengths ranging between 457.9 and 568.2 nm. Similar peaks were not observed with spheroplasts (periplasmic side out) isolated from the same species. The difference in signal detected in chromatophores and spheroplasts is not due to differences in membrane surface charge, presence of residual cell wall on the spheroplast surface, lack of adhesion of spheroplasts to metals, or large differences in pigment content per unit membrane area. Instead, the results indicate an asymmetric distribution of Spx in vivo across the membrane (i.e., it is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane). The results also demonstrate that the SERRS effect is extremely distance sensitive, and the thickness of a single bacterial membrane (separating the Ag electrode from the carotenoid) is sufficient to prevent detection of Spx spectra. Studies of chromatophores from the F24 strain (a reaction centerless mutant) have pin-pointed B880 antenna complex as the source of the Spx SERRS spectra, and a schematic model of the minimal structural unit of B880 is presented. This work demonstrates the potential of the SERRS technique as a probe for surface topology of pigmented membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1567120193,"Early following mitogenic activation, normal human T cells express elevated levels of steady-state mRNAs encoding the nuclear-localized protooncogenes, c-fos, c-myc, and c-myb. Although the mechanisms responsible for increases in these specific mRNAs are not known, recent evidence suggests that up-regulation of c-myc could result from the release of a nascent chain elongation block. Run-on transcription analyses of c-myc show here that increased initiation and not modulation of elongation efficiency is largely responsible for elevated c-myc mRNA levels in activated T cells. Transcriptional stimulation of c-myc commences from a chromatin state that appears poised for activation. As determined by DNase I hypersensitive site analyses, the chromatin structure of c-myc in resting T cells resembles that of other cell types expressing high levels of c-myc, and furthermore, no changes in hypersensitive sites can be correlated with mitogenic stimulation of c-myc transcription. Because mitogen-induced up-regulation and terminal differentiation-associated down-regulation of c-myc are mechanistically different, it appears that c-myc is subject to a variety of distinct transcriptional controls. In addition to c-myc, c-fos and c-myb are shown to be induced via a transcriptional mechanism in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606994419,"Microsomal preparations from chondroitin 6-sulfate-producing chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage, and from chondroitin 4-sulfate-producing mouse mastocytoma cells, were incubated with UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine to form non-sulfated proteo[14C]chondroitin. Aliquots of the incubations were then incubated with 3'-phosphoadenylylphosphosulfate (PAPS) in the presence or absence of various detergents. In the absence of detergents, there was good sulfation of this endogenous proteo[14C]chondroitin by the original microsomes from both sources. Detergents, with the exception of Triton X-100, markedly inhibited sulfation in the mast cell system but not in the chick cartilage system. These results indicate that sulfation and polymerization are closely linked on cell membranes and that in some cases this organization can be disrupted by detergents. When aliquots of the original incubation were heat inactivated, and then reincubated with new microsomes from chick cartilage and/or mouse mastocytoma cells plus PAPS, there was no significant sulfation of this exogenous proteo[14C] chondroitin with either system unless Triton X-100 was added. Sulfation of exogenous chondroitin and chondroitin hexasaccharide was compared with sulfation of endogenous and exogenous proteo[14C]chondroitin. Sulfate incorporation into hexasaccharide and chondroitin decreased as their concentrations (based on uronic acid) approached that of the proteo[14C]chondroitin. At the same time, the degree of sulfation in percent of substituted hexosamine increased. However, the degree of sulfation did not reach that of the endogenous proteo[14C]chondroitin. Hexasaccharide and chondroitin sulfation were stimulated by the presence of Triton X-100. However, in contrast to the exogenous proteo[14C]chondroitin, there was some sulfation of hexasaccharide and chondroitin in the absence of this detergent. These results indicate that the intact microsomal system was not accessible to the larger substrates, and that even with detergents exogenous substrates were not sulfated as effectively as newly formed proteo[14C]chondroitin in an intact microsomal system. When the proteo[14C]chondroitin formed by the chick cartilage microsomal system was incubated together with the mast cell microsomal system and PAPS, sulfation only occurred at the 4-position. When the proteo[14C]chondroitin formed by the mouse mast cell microsomal system was incubated together with the chick cartilage microsomal system and PAPS, sulfation only occurred at the 6-position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1531627414,"The molting hormones of insects, the ecdysteroids, are steroids whose action is mediated by an intracellular receptor. The Kc cell line of Drosophila melanogaster possesses ecdysteroid receptors and exhibits characteristic, receptor-dependent morphological and biochemical responses to the application of ecdysteroids. This paper describes the interaction of muristerone A (2 beta, 3 beta, 5 beta, 11 alpha, 14 alpha(20R,22R)- heptahydroxycholest-7-en-6-one), a phytoecdysteroid, with the Kc cell ecdysteroid receptor. Muristerone A-receptor complexes are not as sensitive to dissociation in high salt buffers as other ecdysteroid-receptor complexes we have examined. This has enabled us to use [3H]muristerone A to follow the Kc cell ecdysteroid receptor during heparin-agarose, DNA-cellulose, and hydroxylapatite chromatography, as well as gel filtration and ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography. The Drosophila Kc cell ecdysteroid receptor has a Stokes radius of 4.6 nm, a frictional coefficient of 1.4, and a molecular weight of 120,000. A procedure is presented that results in a 750-fold enrichment of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1557450649,"Cytoskeletons were prepared from the growth cones of neonatal rat forebrains and were utilized to explore several aspects of growth cone function. The cytoskeletal fraction retained about 50% of total growth cone protein, was highly enriched in tubulin, and constituted an interconnected lattice of 10-25 nm homogeneous particles. The cytoskeleton appeared to be a target for Ca2+ signaling since it contained the majority of growth cone calmodulin-binding polypeptides which featured prominently an Mr 135,000 component. Most of the growth cone glycoproteins were at least partially associated with the cytoskeleton, thus suggesting the possibility of a transmembrane coupling mechanism which allows for communication between the cytoskeleton and the external surface of the growth cone. The cytoskeleton was also endowed with one or more protein kinases which phosphorylated endogenous and exogenous tubulin achieving a stoichiometry of 9-13 mol of phosphate/mol of substrate dimer. Interestingly, the site of tubulin phosphorylation included tyrosine as well as serine residues providing a possible target for the action of neuronal tyrosine kinases such as growth factor receptors or oncogene products. Finally, a comparison between cytoskeletal preparations from growth cones and from mature synaptosomes revealed several differences in glycoprotein association, calmodulin binding, and protein phosphorylation, evidently reflecting maturational events which might underlie relevant aspects of synaptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1526317001,"Kluyveromyces bulgaricus is a yeast which, upon culture in a calcium-enriched glucose-peptone medium, flocculates. Its flocculation can be reversed by the addition of galactose. In this paper, it is shown that two lectins can be isolated either from the concentrated culture broth or from the supernatant of deflocculated cells suspended in galactose solution. The N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectin, at pH 7.4, agglutinates untreated sheep red blood cells, but agglutinates neither untreated rabbit red blood cells nor glutaraldehyde-fixed sheep or rabbit red blood cells. Conversely, at pH 4.5, this lectin agglutinates glutaraldehyde-fixed sheep red blood cells. The galactose-specific lectin, at pH 7.4, agglutinates both untreated and glutaraldehyde-fixed rabbit red blood cells but does not agglutinate untreated or glutaraldehyde-fixed sheep red blood cells. At pH 4.5, this lectin agglutinates both glutaraldehyde-fixed sheep and rabbit red blood cells and induces flocculation of deflocculated K. bulgaricus cells. In all cases, the agglutination and the flocculation induced by one of these two lectins were inhibited by free or conjugated N-acetyl-D-glucosamine or by free or conjugated D-galactose, respectively. No glycosylhydrolase activity could be detected in the purified lectins."

A 1600-fold purification of M-BsuE was achieved by column chromatography on phosphocellulose, heparin-Sepharose, and DEAE-Sepharose. DNA methyltransferase activity was monitored in the column eluants radiochemically by the transfer of tritiated methyl groups from radiolabeled S-adenosylmethionine to poly(dGdC)-poly(dGdC) DNA, a sensitive and specific substrate for M-BsuE activity. The DNA sequence specificity of this methyltransferase activity was confirmed enzymatically by demonstrating that M-BsuE-methylated DNA was selectively protected from cleavage by the restriction enzyme isoschizomers, ThaI and FnuDII. Purified M-BsuE has an apparent molecular size of 41,000-43,000 as determined by gel filtration and migrates as a 41-kDa protein in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. DNA methylation by M-BsuE is dependent upon the presence of S-adenosylmethionine and 2-mercaptoethanol. M-BsuE methyltransferase activity is optimal at 37 degrees C in the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mM KCl, 6 microM S-adenosylmethionine, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM EDTA. M-BsuE methylates the external cytidine in its recognition sequence in both linear and supercoiled DNA. A unique property of M-BsuE is its ability to methylate 5'-CGCG-3' in Z-DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1582531628,"Several human interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutant proteins have been produced previously by site-directed mutagenesis and found to have different capacities to induce T-cell proliferative activity. In this study, the abilities of these IL-2 mutant proteins to activate natural killer cells and to induce interferon-gamma production have been evaluated, and the binding of these proteins to IL-2 receptors analyzed. Natural killer cell activation and interferon-gamma induction assays showed that the relative activities of IL-2 mutant proteins were consistent with their relative activities in T-cell proliferation assay. Receptor-binding studies showed that the activities of most proteins correlated well with their respective affinities for high-affinity IL-2 receptors on CTLL-2 cells. Interestingly, although the mutant protein with deletion of cysteine 125 (des-Cys125) was biologically less active than the protein with substitution of alanine for cysteine 105 (Ala105), both proteins exhibited similar affinity. Des-Cys125, like IL-2 and Ala105, also caused down-regulation of high-affinity IL-2 receptors. Binding studies on MLA-144, a cell line expressing mainly intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2R beta), however, showed that des-Cys125 had much lower affinity than Ala105. These results suggest that binding of IL-2 and mutant proteins to the IL-2R beta component of the high-affinity receptor is essential for the induction of biological effects."

The enzyme appears to be a monomeric protein with Mr = 56,000-58,000. Enzymatic activity requires the presence of MnCl2, is stimulated by detergent, and exhibits a pH optimum at 6.9. The Km values for GlcNAc and UDP-Gal are 1.89 and 0.046 mM, respectively. The Ehrlich cell beta-galactosyltransferase acts efficiently on glycoproteins and glycolipids terminating in GlcNAc, but is inactive toward glycoconjugates possessing terminal GalNAc units. The oligosaccharides beta-D-GlcNAc(1,3)-D-Gal and beta-D-GlcNAc(1,3)[beta-D-GlcNAc(1,6)]-D-Gal are good acceptors for the beta-galactosyltransferase from Ehrlich cells, suggesting that the enzyme may participate in the biosynthesis of i/I structures. In addition, other linear and branched sugars presenting GlcNAc residues at their nonreducing termini also act as acceptors for the enzyme. The activity of Ehrlich cell beta-galactosyltransferase both in the presence and absence of alpha-lactalbumin has been studied using a series of derivatives of Glc and GlcNAc which were substituted at various positions of the pyranose ring. This study has provided a map of the molecular contacts necessary for enzymatic activity in the presence and in the absence of alpha-lactalbumin."

No effect of the inhibitor on the relative rates of synthesis of the precursor form of either enzyme was observed. On the other hand, carbohydrate processing of beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase was markedly altered by swainsonine, consistent with a blockage by the inhibitor of the removal of the alpha-1,3- and alpha-1,6-linked mannose residues which occurs in normal processing. In homogenates of both normal and swainsonine-treated cells, the precursor forms of the enzymes were found exclusively in the light membrane fraction on Percoll gradients and the mature forms exclusively in the lysosomal fractions indicating that translocation from Golgi to lysosomes and proteolytic processing in the lysosome were not impaired by the presence of abnormal oligosaccharide side chains. There was no detectable effect of swainsonine during a 4-day chase period on the total cellular turnover of these enzymes which involves two processes, secretion and degradation. In the absence of swainsonine, secretion represented about 40% of the total turnover of beta-galactosidase and about 50% with beta-glucuronidase. The presence of swainsonine increased these proportions to about 60 and 70%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1508885876,"We labeled cobra-alpha-toxin (Naja naja siamensis 3) with near stoichiometric quantities of fluorescein isothiocyanate. To reduce labeling of the hyperreactive N epsilon-lysine 23, the alpha-toxin was modified reversibly with citraconic anhydride before fluorescein labeling. The citraconic anhydride was later removed with strong acid, and four of the six possible monofluorescein alpha-toxin derivatives were isolated by isoelectric focusing on an immobilized pH gradient. Thermolysin digestion and subsequent high pressure liquid chromatography of the peptides yielded one dominant fluorescent peak from three of the isolated monofluorescein derivatives. Sequence analyses of these three fluorescent peaks indicated monofluorescein labeling at Lys-69, Lys-35, and Lys-49. Since one derivative (not identified by sequence analysis) displayed essentially identical chromatographic, spectroscopic, and binding properties as our previously identified monofluorescein-Lys-23 toxin (Johnson, D. A., and Taylor, P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5632-5636), we identified the site of labeling of this fourth derivative to be Lys-23. While only small differences were observed in the extinction maxima and molar extinction coefficients, the quantum yields of the isolated derivatives varied markedly and ranged between 0.18 and 0.41. Binding of monofluorescein-Lys-69, -Lys-35, -Lys-49, and -Lys-23 derivatives to the membrane-associated acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica was associated with -39, -26, -9, and +96% changes in fluorescence emission intensity, respectively. Based on analyses of the kinetics of fluorescence changes associated with receptor binding, the association and dissociation rate constants were measured. Relative to native cobra alpha-toxin, monofluorescein conjugation reduced the bimolecular association rate constants for binding to the receptor 13-33-fold. The dissociation rate binding rate constants were less affected and were reduced 0-5-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1503938215,"The nature of the interaction between progesterone or testosterone and human albumin as well as the interaction between progesterone and partially purified human transcortin has been studied. Modification of lysine residues of albumin with maleic anhydride resulted in a decreased binding of the steroid as judged from equilibrium dialysis experiments. This suggested that lysine residues in albumin interact with the oxosteroids. In order to check this hypothesis, steroids labeled with 18O in their oxo function (testosterone and progesterone) were synthesized for use as probes of the interactions. However, no loss of label was noted when testosterone or progesterone specifically 18O-labeled in their oxo functions were incubated with albumin. This suggested that no covalent interaction between the steroidal oxo group and albumin took place. This was in contrast to the results obtained with 3,20-18O-labeled progesterone and partially purified transcortin, where a complete loss of 18O label in the protein-bound steroid was found. The nonbound steroid showed an almost complete retention of label. These results indicate a participation of steroid oxo groups in the binding of progesterone to transcortin. Of the possible mechanisms discussed, imine bonds between the steroid and transcortin seem most likely although other types of interactions cannot be ruled out."
