https://openalex.org/W3163533628,"Effect sizes are commonly interpreted using heuristics established by Cohen (e.g., small: r = .1, medium r = .3, large r = .5), despite mounting evidence that these guidelines are mis-calibrated to the effects typically found in psychological research. This study’s aims were to 1) describe the distribution of effect sizes across multiple instruments, 2) consider factors qualifying the effect size distribution, and 3) identify examples as benchmarks for various effect sizes. For aim one, effect size distributions were illustrated from a large, diverse sample of 9/10-year-old children. This was done by conducting Pearson’s correlations among 161 variables representing constructs from all questionnaires and tasks from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study® baseline data. To achieve aim two, factors qualifying this distribution were tested by comparing the distributions of effect size among various modifications of the aim one analyses. These modified analytic strategies included comparisons of effect size distributions for different types of variables, for analyses using statistical thresholds, and for analyses using several covariate strategies. In aim one analyses, the median in-sample effect size was .03, and values at the first and third quartiles were .01 and .07. In aim two analyses, effects were smaller for associations across instruments, content domains, and reporters, as well as when covarying for sociodemographic factors. Effect sizes were larger when thresholding for statistical significance. In analyses intended to mimic conditions used in “real-world” analysis of ABCD data, the median in-sample effect size was .05, and values at the first and third quartiles were .03 and .09. To achieve aim three, examples for varying effect sizes are reported from the ABCD dataset as benchmarks for future work in the dataset. In summary, this report finds that empirically determined effect sizes from a notably large dataset are smaller than would be expected based on existing heuristics."
https://openalex.org/W3200003072,"Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are ectopic aggregates of lymphoid cells in inflamed, infected, or tumoral tissues that are easily recognized on an H&E histology slide as discrete entities, distinct from lymphocytes. TLS are associated with improved cancer prognosis but there is no standardised method available to quantify their presence. Previous studies have used immunohistochemistry to determine the presence of specific cells as a marker of the TLS. This has now been proven to be an underestimate of the true number of TLS. Thus, we propose a methodology for the automated identification and quantification of TLS, based on H&E slides. We subsequently determined the mathematical criteria defining a TLS. TLS regions were identified through a deep convolutional neural network and segmentation of lymphocytes was performed through an ellipsoidal model. This methodology had a 92.87% specificity at 95% sensitivity, 88.79% specificity at 98% sensitivity and 84.32% specificity at 99% sensitivity level based on 144 TLS annotated H&E slides implying that the automated approach was able to reproduce the histopathologists' assessment with great accuracy. We showed that the minimum number of lymphocytes within TLS is 45 and the minimum TLS area is 6,245μm2. Furthermore, we have shown that the density of the lymphocytes is more than 3 times those outside of the TLS. The mean density and standard deviation of lymphocytes within a TLS area are 0.0128/μm2 and 0.0026/μm2 respectively compared to 0.004/μm2 and 0.001/μm2 in non-TLS regions. The proposed methodology shows great potential for automated identification and quantification of the TLS density on digital H&E slides."
https://openalex.org/W3200806172,"Purpose This study aims to assess the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) combined with endurance training (ET) on balance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods We studied 32 male patients (62 ± 6 years) with moderate to very severe COPD. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group (IMT+ET) n = 16 or a control group (ET) n = 16 with similar characteristics. The evaluations were carried out at inclusion and after eight weeks of the training period. Functional balance was assessed by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed-up and Go (TUG), the Single Leg Stance test (SLS), and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. The strength of the inspiratory muscles (PI max ) was assessed by maximal inspiratory mouth pressure. Functional exercise performance was assessed by the 6 minutes walking test (6MWT). IMT program consists in performing two daily sets of 30 inspirations with 50% of PI max increased by 10% every two weeks. ET program consists in performing 30 min treadmill exercise at 60% to 80% of the average speed achieved during the 6MWT three days per week. Results After the training period, the experimental group demonstrated greater improvements in BBS (IMT+ET vs. ET; p = 0.019), and in ABC (IMT+ET vs. ET; p = 0.014). However, no significant differences between groups were observed for TUG, SLS, and 6MWT. There was a significant difference between groups in PI max (IMT+ET vs. ET; p = 0.030). Significant moderate correlations were obtained between ΔPI max and ΔBBS for both groups (IMT+ET: r = 0.624, p = 0.010; ET r = 0.550, p = 0.027) as well as for ΔABC but only in the experimental group (IMT+ET: r = 0.550, p = 0.027). Conclusion Compared to ET alone, the results suggest that IMT combined with ET enhances inspiratory muscle function and functional balance according to BBS and ABC in patients with COPD. We suggest that inspiratory muscle training might be introduced as additional training to pulmonary rehabilitation programs aimed at improving balance in COPD patients.

https://openalex.org/W3200824632,"Introduction Twitter represents a mainstream news source for the American public, offering a valuable vehicle for learning how citizens make sense of pandemic health threats like Covid-19. Masking as a risk mitigation measure became controversial in the US. The social amplification risk framework offers insight into how a risk event interacts with psychological, social, institutional, and cultural communication processes to shape Covid-19 risk perception. Methods Qualitative content analysis was conducted on 7,024 mask tweets reflecting 6,286 users between January 24 and July 7, 2020, to identify how citizens expressed Covid-19 risk perception over time. Descriptive statistics were computed for (a) proportion of tweets using hyperlinks, (b) mentions, (c) hashtags, (d) questions, and (e) location. Results Six themes emerged regarding how mask tweets amplified and attenuated Covid-19 risk: (a) severity perceptions (18.0%) steadily increased across 5 months; (b) mask effectiveness debates (10.7%) persisted; (c) who is at risk (26.4%) peaked in April and May 2020; (d) mask guidelines (15.6%) peaked April 3, 2020, with federal guidelines; (e) political legitimizing of Covid-19 risk (18.3%) steadily increased; and (f) mask behavior of others (31.6%) composed the largest discussion category and increased over time. Of tweets, 45% contained a hyperlink, 40% contained mentions, 33% contained hashtags, and 16.5% were expressed as a question. Conclusions Users ascribed many meanings to mask wearing in the social media information environment revealing that COVID-19 risk was expressed in a more expanded range than objective risk. The simultaneous amplification and attenuation of COVID-19 risk perception on social media complicates public health messaging about mask wearing."
https://openalex.org/W3199151450,"The following protocol describes our workflow for processing wastewater with the goal of detecting the genetic signal of SARS-CoV-2. The steps include pasteurization, virus concentration, RNA extraction, and quantification by RT-qPCR. We include auxiliary steps that provide new users with tools and strategies that will help troubleshoot key steps in the process. This protocol is one of the safest, cheapest, and most reproducible approaches for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Owing to a pasteurization step, it is safe for use in a BSL2 facility. In addition to making the protocol safe for the personnel involved, pasteurization had the added benefit of increasing the SARS-CoV-2 genetic signal. Furthermore, the RNA obtained using this protocol can be sequenced using both Sanger and Illumina sequencing technologies. The protocol was adopted by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in August 2020 to monitor SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater in all five boroughs of the city. In the future, this protocol could be used to detect a variety of other clinically relevant viruses in wastewater and serve as a foundation of a wastewater surveillance strategy for monitoring community spread of known and emerging viral pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3199099752,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence studies bridge the gap left from case detection, to estimate the true burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. While multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays are available, no gold standard exists. Methods This serial cross-sectional study was conducted using plasma samples from 8999 healthy blood donors between April-September 2020. Each sample was tested by four assays: Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG assay, targeting nucleocapsid (Abbott-NP) and three in-house IgG ELISA assays (targeting spike glycoprotein, receptor binding domain, and nucleocapsid). Seroprevalence rates were compared using multiple composite reference standards and by a series of Bayesian Latent Class Models. Result We found 13 unique diagnostic phenotypes; only 32 samples (0.4%) were positive by all assays. None of the individual assays resulted in seroprevalence increasing monotonically over time. In contrast, by using the results from all assays, the Bayesian Latent Class Model with informative priors predicted seroprevalence increased from 0.7% (95% credible interval (95% CrI); 0.4, 1.0%) in April/May to 0.7% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.1%) in June/July to 0.9% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.3) in August/September. Assay characteristics varied over time. Overall Spike had the highest sensitivity (93.5% (95% CrI 88.7, 97.3%), while the sensitivity of the Abbott-NP assay waned from 77.3% (95% CrI 58.7, 92.5%) in April/May to 64.4% (95% CrI 45.6, 83.0) by August/September. Discussion Our results confirmed very low seroprevalence after the first wave in Canada. Given the dynamic nature of this pandemic, Bayesian Latent Class Models can be used to correct for imperfect test characteristics and waning IgG antibody signals."
https://openalex.org/W3201446276,"Background Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia is frequent during open surgeries; however, few studies on hypothermia during laparoscopic abdominal surgery have been reported. We aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors for hypothermia in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Methods This single-center prospective cohort observational study involved patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery between October 2018 and June 2019. Data on core body temperature and potential variables were collected. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with hypothermia. A Cox regression analysis was used to verify the sensitivity of the results. Results In total, 690 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 200 (29.0%, 95% CI: 26%−32%) had a core temperature &lt; 36°C. The core temperature decreased over time, and the incident hypothermia increased gradually. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.000–1.034, P = 0.050), BMI (OR = 0.938, 95% CI: 0.880–1.000; P = 0.049), baseline body temperature (OR = 0.025, 95% CI: 0.010–0.060; P &lt; 0.001), volume of irrigation fluids (OR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.000–1.001, P = 0.001), volume of urine (OR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.000–1.003, P = 0.070), and duration of surgery (OR = 1.010, 95% CI: 1.006–1.015, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with hypothermia. In the Cox analysis, variables in the final model were age, BMI, baseline body temperature, volume of irrigation fluids, blood loss, and duration of surgery. Conclusions Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia is evident in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. Age, BMI, baseline body temperature, volume of irrigation fluids, and duration of surgery are significantly associated with intraoperative hypothermia."
https://openalex.org/W3200741263,"To investigate a specificity of spiders as a prototypical fear- and disgust-eliciting stimuli, we conducted an online experiment. The respondents rated images of 25 spiders, 12 non-spider chelicerates, and 10 other arthropods on a fear and disgust 7-point scale. The evaluation of 968 Central European respondents confirmed the specificity of spiders among fear- and disgust-eliciting arthropods and supported the notion of spiders as a cognitive category. We delineated this category as covering extant spider species as well as some other chelicerates bearing a physical resemblance to spiders, mainly whip spiders and camel spiders. We suggested calling this category the spider-like cognitive category. We discussed evolutionary roots of the spider-like category and concluded that its roots should be sought in fear, with disgust being secondary of the two emotions. We suggested other chelicerates, e.g., scorpions, might have been important in formation and fixation of the spider-like category. Further, we investigated an effect of respondent’s sensitivity to a specific fear of spiders on evaluation of the stimuli. We found that suspected phobic respondents were in their rating nearly identical to those with only high fear of spiders and similar to those with only moderate fear of spiders. We concluded that results based on healthy respondents with elevated fear should also be considered relevant for arachnophobia research."
https://openalex.org/W3200494946,"In this study, High throughput sequencing was used to analyze the effects of different vegetable rotations on the rhizosphere bacterial diversity and community structure in a substrate that was used for continuous tomato cropping (CK). The vegetable rotations tested were cabbage/tomato (B), kidney bean/tomato (D), and celery/tomato (Q). The results revealed that the substrate bacterial diversity and richness of each crop rotation were higher than those of CK. The highest bacterial diversity was found in the B substrate, followed by the Q and D substrates. Further comparison showed that the rhizosphere bacterial community structure of Q substrate was significantly different to that of CK. Compared with the CK, the Q substrate had a significantly higher relative abundance of several dominant microflora, such as Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. Additionally, the Q rotation significantly increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Actinobacteria_unclassified and Anaerolineaceae_unclassified . A redundancy analysis showed that Most dominant bacteria correlated positively with the substrate pH, total N, and alkali-hydrolyzable N but negatively with the available P, available K, total P, total K, and organic matter contents and substrate EC. The substrates after crop rotation improved the growth and physiological condition of the subsequent tomato plants, among which those from the Q rotation performed the best. Therefore, celery rotation not only increased the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the substrate but also significantly increased the richness of the beneficial bacterial communities, allowing better maintenance of the substrate microenvironment for the healthy growth of crops."
https://openalex.org/W3200628485,"The tomato had nutritional, economic and health benefits to the societies, however, its production and productivity were low in developing countries and particularly in Ethiopia. This might be due to technical inefficiency caused by institutional, governmental, and farmers related factors. Therefore this study tried to investigate the factors that affecting technical efficiency and estimating the mean level of technical efficiency of tomato producers in Asaita district, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary data sources were used; the primary data was collected from 267 tomato producers from the study area cross-sectional by using a multistage sampling technique. The single-stage stochastic frontier model and Cobb Douglas production function were applied and statistical significance was declared at 0.05. The maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic frontier model showed that land, labor, tomato seed, and oxen have a significant effect on tomato output; and education, extension contact, training, and access to credit have a positive and significant effect on technical efficiency, whereas household size, off-farm income, livestock ownership, distance to market, and pesticides have a worthy and significant effect on technical efficiency; and also estimated mean technical efficiency of tomato producer in a study area was 80.9%. In a line with this, the responsible body should prioritize rural infrastructure development in areas such as education, marketplace, and farmer training centers; demonstrate access to credit and extension services; use the recommended amount of pesticides per hectare, and give more intension to mixed farming rather than animal husbandry exclusively."
https://openalex.org/W3199305097,"Purpose To quantitatively evaluate outcomes after small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) combined with allogeneic intrastromal lenticule inlay for hyperopia with astigmatism. Methods It’s a retrospective cohort study. Twenty-four eyes of 15 patients with more than 0.75 diopters (D) of astigmatism in hyperopic eyes were enrolled in this study. The hyperopic eye with astigmatism was first treated with SMILE to correct astigmatism; then a lenticule was extracted from a donor myopic eye and subsequently implanted into the hyperopic eye with astigmatism. Patients were examined preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, 1,3 months and 1 year after surgery. The main outcome measures were the uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity (UDVA and CDVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA), spherical equivalent (SE), corneal topography, anterior segment optical coherence topography (OCT) and ocular response analyzer (ORA) parameters: corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF). Repeated–measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc tests were used to analyze data of different follow-up visits. Results The mean preoperative cylinder was 1.95±1.04(D). The UDVA (from 0.37±0.23 to 0.09±0.09), UNVA (from 0.49±0.21 to 0.08±0.06), SE (from +7.42±3.12 to -0.75±0.79) and astigmatism (+1.95±1.04 to -0.65±0.63) postoperatively were obviously better than those before surgery. Five eyes (26.3%) gained one line of CDVA, and 3 eyes (15.8%) gained two lines of CDVA one year after surgery compared with preoperative levels. The average corneal curvature was changed from (43.19±4.37) D to (49.19±3.87) D one year after surgery. The anterior segment OCT images of corneas with lenticule inlays at each follow-up visit showed that the implanted lenticule was shaped like a crescent in the corneal stroma. The CH and CRF didn’t change significantly after surgery (p = 0.189 and p = 0.107respectively). Conclusions SMILE combined with intrastromal lenticule inlay can be used to correct high hyperopia with astigmatism with good safety, efficacy and reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W3199436805,"Introduction Nursing students are confronted with bullies in the classroom and during clinical placement. Acquisition of the necessary psychomotor skills intended during clinical placements may be impeded when workplace bullies intimidate students. This study aimed to describe the various bullying behaviours experienced by nursing students and their effects during clinical placement in the Central Region of Ghana. Methods A qualitative phenomenological descriptive approach using a semi-structured interview guide was employed to collect data from nursing students in focus groups. Overall, six (6) focus groups were used, with five (5) students in each group comprising males and females. The sample size was based on data saturation and was saturated on the six focus group discussions giving a sample size of 30. Purposive sampling was used to select students who had been on the ward at least three clinical placements and had experienced bullying in the clinical setting. In-depth interviews were conducted, recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. Results The study revealed that nursing students had experienced bullying practices such as shouting, isolation, humiliation and being assigned tasks below their competency level. In addition, findings showed that bullying led to a loss of confidence and caused stress and anxiety in nursing students. Conclusion Therefore, it is recommended that nursing students are mentored holistically in a caring and accepting environment where they will be supported to achieve their learning goals, build their confidence, and develop their personal and professional identity."
https://openalex.org/W3200483242,"Prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, discussions about online learning referred to the use of e-learning platforms and social networks as auxiliary tools in the educational process. Due to the pandemic, universities were forced to adopt an exclusive online teaching process and most universities today use platforms dedicated to online learning such as Moodle platforms. In this context, we were interested in analyzing the attitude of students regarding the way social networks could be integrated into the educational process, and if the positive attitude of students towards social networks and their use for academic purposes, proven in previous studies, remains positive under the conditions generated by the pandemic. In this regard, the present study aimed at identifying the attitude of Romanian students towards the use of Facebook and Instagram as educational tools and the circumstances in which students believe these platforms could be used by them and their teachers. An online survey was conducted on 872 students from public higher education institutions in Romania. Based on the exploratory factor analysis and the parametric test, the empirical results show that students have a slightly positive attitude towards using Facebook in the educational process, but they have a more reticent, less positive attitude towards using Instagram. Thus, the most appropriate contexts in which these platforms could be used are represented by extracurricular activities. A higher preference for the use of Facebook rather than Instagram, was identified among master and PhD students. No major differences were revealed in student subgroups sorted by gender or study domain."

This study investigates potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of smoking-related postmenopausal osteoporosis (SRPO).The GSE13850 microarray dataset was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Gene modules associated with SRPO were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and pathway and functional enrichment analyses. Feature genes were selected using two machine learning methods: support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest (RF). The diagnostic efficiency of the selected genes was assessed by gene expression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve.Eight highly conserved modules were detected in the WGCNA network, and the genes in the module that was strongly correlated with SRPO were used for constructing the PPI network. A total of 113 hub genes were identified in the core network using topological network analysis. Enrichment analysis results showed that hub genes were closely associated with the regulation of RNA transcription and translation, ATPase activity, and immune-related signaling. Six genes (HNRNPC, PFDN2, PSMC5, RPS16, TCEB2, and UBE2V2) were selected as genetic biomarkers for SRPO by integrating the feature selection of SVM-RFE and RF.The present study identified potential genetic biomarkers and provided a novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of SRPO."
https://openalex.org/W3200351973,"Microplastics are a global challenge and a frequently studied environmental issue. Hence, the knowledge body about microplastics within the scientific community is growing fast and challenges an elaborated knowledge transfer from science to the general public. Just as well-informed people are the basis for reducing microplastics’ impact on the environment, knowledge of the audience’s conceptions is the basis for an accurate and successful dissemination of scientific findings. However, insights into the publics’ perceptions of microplastics are still rare. The present study aimed to capture students’ conceptions about microplastics based on their individual experiences following qualitative inductive, exploratory research. Therefore, 267 students of a state university in Germany responded to a paper-and-pencil questionnaire containing open and closed questions on microplastic-related conceptual understanding, risk perception, information behavior, sources, and sinks. The inductive classifying of all responses by a qualitative content analysis revealed six basic concepts: 1) Microplastics are mainly understood as small plastic particles. 2) Microplastics are closely associated with its negative consequences. 3) The most labeled source in households is plastic packaging. 4) Compared to other water bodies, microplastics are rarely suspected in groundwater. 5) A high threat awareness exists in classifying microplastics as very dangerous and dangerous. 6) Media such as TV or the Internet are the most crucial information sources while the school has less importance in acquiring information. It is precisely this pattern that indicates the need for profound science communication to establish a joint and scientifically sound knowledge base in society. Knowledge about conceptions of potential “customers” allows tailor-made scientific knowledge transfers to shape public awareness, initiate changes in thoughts and prepare the field for collaborative behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3201206534,"The association between body image and eating behaviors or weight control strategies has been demonstrated in the scientific literature, but there is a lack of evidence on the association between weight misperception and food consumption indicators in adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate the association between weight misperception and dietary patterns (DPs) in the Brazilian Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (ERICA). It was a national school-based cross-sectional study conducted among students aged 12–17 years. Data were collected in the form of anthropometric measurements, responses in self-answered questionnaires, and 24-h dietary recall. The following variables were assessed: weight underestimation and overestimation (independent variables), which were defined as the presence of a disagreement between nutritional status and self-perceived weight; dietary patterns (dependent variables), defined by a posteriori method using principal component factor analysis; and individual and demographic variables (covariates). Data analysis was performed using the Poisson regression models method, stratified by sex. A total of 52,038 adolescents with normal weights were evaluated. The weight misperception prevalence was 34.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33.0, 35.0). Three DPs were identified: “Traditional Brazilian,” “Processed meat sandwiches and coffee,” and “Ultra-processed and sweet foods.” In girls, weight underestimation was directly associated with the “Traditional Brazilian” (1.24; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.43) and “Ultra-processed and sweet foods” DPs (1.29; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.54), and overestimation was inversely associated with all the DPs. In boys, a direct association between underestimation and the “Ultra-processed and sweet foods” DP (1.29; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.51) was found. Overestimation was inversely associated with the “Traditional Brazilian” DP (0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.99). The inverse association between overestimation and the “Traditional Brazilian” DP, and the direct association between underestimation and the “Ultra-processed and sweet foods” DP indicated that weight misperception was related to unhealthy eating habits in Brazilian adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3201256255,"Background We have recently reported reduced physical activity (PA) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) with and without lung transplantation (LTX) during a 6-week stringent lockdown in Switzerland. This follow-up study explores the impact of coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) related pandemic restrictions on individuals’ therapy regimens and health-related aspects in pwCF. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional web-based national survey in Spring 2021. The survey included questions on daily PA, airway clearance and inhalation therapy, questions on COVID-19-compatible symptoms, diagnostic tests and vaccination status, and enquired health-related aspects covering the pandemic period between March 2020 to April 2021. Results 193 individuals with CF (53% female; 25% LTX recipients) participated. Among pwCF, 10 reported COVID-19 (n = 2 LTX recipients), two subjects were hospitalized, no invasive ventilation required, no deaths. The clinical course was generally mild. Overall, 46% reported less PA during the pandemic, mostly due to closed fitness facilities (85%), lack of motivation (34%), and changes in daily structures (21%). In contrast, 32/193 (17%) pwCF were able to increase their PA levels: 12 (38%) and 11 (34%) reported undertaking home-based training and outdoor activities more frequently; 6 (19%) reported an increase in routine PA, and another 3 (9%) started new activities. Among pwCF without LTX, 5% and 4% reported to undertake less airway clearance and inhalation therapy, respectively. Conclusions Our study reveals unfavorable consequences of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on PA of pwCF with unknown long-term consequences for their overall physical fitness and lung health. Strategies to overcome this undesirable situation are needed; increased uptake of telehealth PA programs and virtual exercise classes to promote PA participation might be one promising approach along with vaccination of pwCF and their close contacts."
https://openalex.org/W3201533371,"Despite the apparent importance of matrix proteins in calcium oxalate kidney stone formation, the complexity of the protein mixture continues to elude explanation. Based on a series of experiments, we have proposed a model where protein aggregates formed from a mixture containing both strongly charged polyanions and strongly charged polycations could initiate calcium oxalate crystal formation and crystal aggregation to create a stone. These protein aggregates also preferentially adsorb many weakly charged proteins from the urine to create a complex protein mixture that mimics the protein distributions observed in patient samples. To verify essential details of this model and identify an explanation for phase selectivity observed in weakly charged proteins, we have examined primary structures of major proteins preferring either the matrix phase or the urine phase for their contents of aspartate, glutamate, lysine and arginine; amino acids that would represent fixed charges at normal urine pH of 6-7. We verified enrichment in stone matrix of proteins with a large number of charged residues exhibiting extreme isoelectric points, both low (pI<5) and high (pI>9). We found that the many proteins with intermediate isoelectric points exhibiting preference for stone matrix contained a smaller number of charge residues, though still more total charges than the intermediate isoelectric point proteins preferring the urine phase. While other sources of charge have yet to be considered, protein preference for stone matrix appears to correlate with high total charge content."

https://openalex.org/W3199150289,"Pet owners are increasingly concerned about the links between health status, animal welfare, environmental impacts, climate change and consumption of animal products. Accordingly, many owners are increasingly interested in vegetarian diets for themselves and their companion animals. However, such diets should be investigated nutritionally regards digestibility as well as on fecal quality and nitrogen output. In light of this trend, six Beagle dogs were included in a cross-over experimental design and offered a vegetarian diet containing wheat gluten (8.81%), rice protein (8.81%) and sunflower oil (6.84%) or an meat-based diet containing poultry meal (19.5%) and poultry fat (5.23%). The dogs received extruded complete diets for 12 days (adaptation and collection period, each 6 days). The dogs fed both diets showed a high and identical palatability (scoring of food intake) of the experimental diets. No significant differences occurred regarding digestibility of organic matter, crude protein and crude fat between vegetarian and meat-based diets. However, dogs fed the meat-based diet had higher (p < 0.05) nitrogen-free extract digestibility (89.5%) compared to those fed the vegetarian diet (88.6%). The amount of nitrogen excreted in feces (g)/kg BW0.75 was slightly, but not significantly, higher for dogs fed the vegetarian diet compared to those fed the meat-based diet (0.88 vs 0.79). The fecal consistency scores were considered to be within an acceptable range (well formed and firm). The mass of the feces between both groups were similar (62.9 g wet feces/100 g dry matter food) for vegetarian and meat-based diets. Additionally, the fecal dry matter content was comparable between both groups (29.0% and 29.6% for vegetarian and meat-based diets, respectively). In conclusion, the results of this study appear to indicate that virtually the only significant difference between the two diets was lower nitrogen-free extract digestibility in the vegetarian diet. However, the vegetarian diet did not result in a significant difference in amount of nitrogen excreted in feces."
https://openalex.org/W3199347950,"The slowdown of China’s economic growth in the middle-income stage has caused widespread concerns. Based on the analysis of economic structures to explain the downward trend of economic growth, this study expanded the Solow-Swan model to investigate the structural imbalances and evaluated their impacts during the structural transformation in different stages and regions on the economic downturn. Considering the processes of production, distribution, and consumption, six structures were chosen for national and prefecture-levels in China from 1997 to 2017, including sectoral structure, population structure, investment and consumption structure, import-export structure, urban-rural income structure, and financial structure. The study found that China’s comprehensive economic structure was significantly different before and after the middle-income stage, and structural bonus tended to decline. Structural imbalance presented a U-shaped pattern of decreasing first and then increasing, and the impact on economic growth underwent stages of suppression-promotion-suppression. There was a significant difference in the imbalance of six sub-structures and their impacts; furthermore, in the four regions of east, center, west, and northeast the observations were very different. Taken together, the imbalance of economic structure and economic transformation coexisted, and the economic growth slowed down. Based on the experiences from China, this paper provided some evidence for promoting structural optimization and transformation."
https://openalex.org/W3199846199,"Climate change is causing larger wildfires and more extreme precipitation events in many regions. As these ecological disturbances increasingly coincide, they alter lateral fluxes of sediment, organic matter, and nutrients. Here, we report the stream chemistry response of watersheds in a semiarid region of Utah (USA) that were affected by a megafire followed by an extreme precipitation event in October 2018. We analyzed daily to hourly water samples at 10 stream locations from before the storm event until three weeks after its conclusion for suspended sediment, solute and nutrient concentrations, water isotopes, and dissolved organic matter concentration, optical properties, and reactivity. The megafire caused a ~2,000-fold increase in sediment flux and a ~6,000-fold increase in particulate carbon and nitrogen flux over the course of the storm. Unexpectedly, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was 2.1-fold higher in burned watersheds, despite the decreased organic matter from the fire. DOC from burned watersheds was 1.3-fold more biodegradable and 2.0-fold more photodegradable than in unburned watersheds based on 28-day dark and light incubations. Regardless of burn status, nutrient concentrations were higher in watersheds with greater urban and agricultural land use. Likewise, human land use had a greater effect than megafire on apparent hydrological residence time, with rapid stormwater signals in urban and agricultural areas but a gradual stormwater pulse in areas without direct human influence. These findings highlight how megafires and intense rainfall increase short-term particulate flux and alter organic matter concentration and characteristics. However, in contrast with previous research, which has largely focused on burned-unburned comparisons in pristine watersheds, we found that direct human influence exerted a primary control on nutrient status. Reducing anthropogenic nutrient sources could therefore increase socioecological resilience of surface water networks to changing wildfire regimes."
https://openalex.org/W3200459141,"Bhutan is facing an epidemic of noncommunicable diseases; they are responsible for 53% of all deaths. Four main modifiable risk factors, including tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet, are the causes of most noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This study aimed to assess 1) the prevalence of NCDs modifiable risk factors in Bhutan's adult population and 2) associations between the sociodemographic factors and the NCDs modifiable risk factors with overweight or obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.We used the 2014 Bhutan WHO Stepwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) Survey dataset in this study. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regressions, constructed with overweight or obesity, hypertension, and diabetes as outcome variables and modifiable risk factors as independent variables.The prevalence of tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet (low fruits and vegetables intake) and physically inactive was 24.8% (95% CI: 21.5, 28.5), 42.4% (95% CI: 39.4, 45.5), 66.9% (95% CI: 61.5, 71.8), and 6.2% (95% CI: 4.9, 7.8), respectively. The prevalence of overweight or obesity, hypertension and diabetes was 32.9% (95%CI: 30.0, 36.0), 35.7% (95% CI: 32.8, 38.7) and 6.4% (95% CI: 5.1, 7.9), respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed that older age groups were more likely to be overweight or obese, hypertensive, and diabetic. Our analysis also found that tobacco users were less likely to be overweight or obese (aOR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52, 0.96), and to be hypertensive (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56, 0.97); but they were more likely to be diabetic (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.05, 2.56). Alcohol users were more likely to be hypertensive aOR 1.41 (95% CI 1.15, 1.74). Furthermore, vigorous physical activity could protect people from being overweight or obese, aOR 0.47 (95% CI 0.31, 0.70), and those consuming more than five serves of fruits and vegetables per day were more likely to be overweight or obese, aOR 1.46 (95% CI 1.17, 1.82).The prevalence of NCDs modifiable risk factors and overweight or obesity and hypertension was high in Bhutan. We found strong associations between tobacco use and diabetes, alcohol use, hypertension, physically inactive, and overweight or obesity. The results suggest that the government should prioritize NCDs prevention and control programs, focusing on reducing modifiable risk factors. The health sector alone cannot address the NCDs epidemic in Bhutan, and we recommend the whole of government approach to tackle NCDs through the Bhutan Gross National Happiness framework."
https://openalex.org/W3200797717,"The formation of neuron networks is a complex phenomenon of fundamental importance for understanding the development of the nervous system, and for creating novel bioinspired materials for tissue engineering and neuronal repair. The basic process underlying the network formation is axonal growth, a process involving the extension of axons from the cell body towards target neurons. Axonal growth is guided by environmental stimuli that include intercellular interactions, biochemical cues, and the mechanical and geometrical features of the growth substrate. The dynamics of the growing axon and its biomechanical interactions with the growing substrate remains poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a model of axonal motility which incorporates mechanical interactions between the axon and the growth substrate. We combine experimental data with theoretical analysis to measure the parameters that describe axonal growth on surfaces with micropatterned periodic geometrical features: diffusion (cell motility) coefficients, speed and angular distributions, and axon bending rigidities. Experiments performed on neurons treated Taxol (inhibitor of microtubule dynamics) and Blebbistatin (disruptor of actin filaments) show that the dynamics of the cytoskeleton plays a critical role in the axon steering mechanism. Our results demonstrate that axons follow geometrical patterns through a contact-guidance mechanism, in which high-curvature geometrical features impart high traction forces to the growth cone. These results have important implications for our fundamental understanding of axonal growth as well as for bioengineering novel substrates that promote neuronal growth and nerve repair."
https://openalex.org/W3200801784,"Background In this study, we aimed to investigate whether FIB-4 index is useful in predicting mortality in patients with concurrent hematological malignancies and COVID-19. We also aimed to determine the optimal cut-off point for the prediction. Methods This is a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted in Dharmais National Cancer Hospital, Indonesia. Consecutive sampling of adults with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 was performed between May 2020 and January 2021. COVID-19 screening test using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal samples were performed prior to hospitalization for chemotherapy. FIB-4 index is derived from [age (years) × AST (IU/L)]/[platelet count (10 9 /L) × √ALT (U/L)]. The primary outcome of this study is mortality, defined as clinically validated death/non-survivor during a 3-months (90 days) follow-up. Results There were a total of 70 patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 in this study. Median FIB-4 Index was higher in non-survivors (13.1 vs 1.02, p&lt;0.001). FIB-4 index above 3.85 has a sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 84%, PLR of 5.27, and NLR of 0.32. The AUC was 0.849 95% CI 0.735–0.962, p&lt;0.001. This cut-off point was associated with OR of 16.70 95% CI 4.07–66.67, p&lt;0.001. In this study, a FIB-4 &gt;3.85 confers to 80% posterior probability of mortality and FIB-4 &lt;3.85 to 19% probability. FIB-4 &gt;3.85 was associated with shorter time-to-mortality (HR 9.10 95% CI 2.99–27.65, p&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that FIB-4 &gt;3.85 (HR 4.09 95% CI 1.32–12.70, p = 0.015) and CRP&gt; 71.57 mg/L (HR 3.36 95% CI 1.08–10.50, p = 0.037) were independently associated with shorter time-to-mortality. Conclusion This study indicates that a FIB-4 index &gt;3.85 was independent predictor of mortality in patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 infection."

Genes related to the progression and prognosis of epilepsy are particularly needed to be identified.In our study, we downloaded the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray expression profiling dataset GSE143272. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a fold change (FC) >1.2 and a P-value <0.05 were identified by GEO2R and grouped in male, female and overlapping DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed.In total, 183 DEGs overlapped (77 ups and 106 downs), 302 DEGs (185 ups and 117 downs) in the male dataset, and 750 DEGs (464 ups and 286 downs) in the female dataset were obtained from the GSE143272 dataset. These DEGs were markedly enriched under various Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms. 16 following hub genes were identified based on PPI network analysis: ADCY7, C3AR1, DEGS1, CXCL1 in male-specific DEGs, TOLLIP, ORM1, ELANE, QPCT in female-specific DEGs and FCAR, CD3G, CLEC12A, MOSPD2, CD3D, ALDH3B1, GPR97, PLAUR in overlapping DEGs.This discovery-driven study may be useful to provide a novel insight into the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. However, more experiments are needed in the future to study the functional roles of these genes in epilepsy."

In this regard, pharmacists are expected to play a pivotal function in the revitalization of primary health care (PHC) during this transition by the expansion of their practice roles.To assess the readiness and perceptions of pharmacists to expand their roles in an integrated health care system. To determine the availability and pricing of primary health care services currently provided within a community pharmacy environment and to evaluate suitable reimbursement for the provision of such services by a community pharmacist.Community pharmacists' across SA were invited to participate in an online survey-based study. The survey consisted of both open- and closed-ended questions. Descriptive statistics for closed-ended questions were generated and analysed using Microsoft Excel® and Survey Monkey®. Responses for the open-ended questions were transcribed, analysed, and reported as emerging themes.Six hundred and sixty-four pharmacists' responded to the online survey. Seventy-five percent of pharmacists' reported that with appropriate training, a transition into a more patient-centered role might be beneficial in the re-engineering of the PHC system. However, in order to adopt these new roles, appropriate reimbursement structures are required. The current fee levied by pharmacists in community pharmacies that offered these PHC services was found to be lower to that recommended by the South African Pharmacy Council; this disparity is primarily due to a lack of information and policy standardisation. Therefore, in order to ensure that fees levied are fair, comprehensive service package guidelines are required.This study provides baseline data for policy makers on pharmacists' readiness to transition into expanded roles. Furthermore, it can be used as a foundation to establish appropriate reimbursement frameworks for pharmacists providing PHC services."
https://openalex.org/W3201177433,"Biomaterial-driven modulation of cell adhesion and migration is a challenging aspect of tissue engineering. Here, we investigated the impact of surface-bound microgel arrays with variable geometry and adjustable cross-linking properties on cell adhesion and migration. We show that cell migration is inversely correlated with microgel array spacing, whereas directionality increases as array spacing increases. Focal adhesion dynamics is also modulated by microgel topography resulting in less dynamic focal adhesions on surface-bound microgels. Microgels also modulate the motility and adhesion of Sertoli cells used as a model for cell migration and adhesion. Both focal adhesion dynamics and speed are reduced on microgels. Interestingly, Gas2L1, a component of the cytoskeleton that mediates the interaction between microtubules and microfilaments, is dispensable for the regulation of cell adhesion and migration on microgels. Finally, increasing microgel cross-linking causes a clear reduction of focal adhesion turnover in Sertoli cells. These findings not only show that spacing and rigidity of surface-grafted microgels arrays can be effectively used to modulate cell adhesion and motility of diverse cellular systems, but they also form the basis for future developments in the fields of medicine and tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3201611899,"Introduction Sepsis impairs gastrointestinal microcirculation and it is hypothesized that this might increase patient’s mortality. Sub-therapeutic vasopressin improves gastric microcirculation under physiologic conditions whereas a therapeutic dosing regimen seems to be rather detrimental. However, the effects of sub-therapeutic vasopressin on gastrointestinal microcirculation in sepsis are largely unknown. Therefore, we conducted this trial to investigate the effect of sub-therapeutic as well as therapeutic vasopressin on gastrointestinal microcirculation in sepsis. Methods 40 male Wistar rats were randomized into 4 groups. Colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP)-surgery was performed to establish mild or moderate sepsis. 24 hours after surgery, animals received either vasopressin with increasing dosages every 30 min (6.75, 13.5 (sub-therapeutic), 27 mU · kg -1 · h -1 (therapeutic)) or vehicle. Microcirculatory oxygenation (μHBO 2 ) of the colon was recorded for 90 min using tissue reflectance spectrophotometry. Intestinal microcirculatory perfusion (total vessel density (TVD; mm/mm 2 ) and perfused vessel density (PVD; mm/mm 2 )) were measured using incident dark field-Imaging at baseline and after 60 min. Results In mild as well as in moderate septic animals with vehicle-infusion intestinal μHbO 2 , TVD and PVD remained constant. In contrast, in moderate sepsis, sub-therapeutic vasopressin with 13.5 mU · kg -1 · h -1 elevated intestinal μHBO 2 (+ 6.1 ± 5.3%; p &lt; 0.05 vs. baseline) and TVD (+ 5.2 ± 3.0 mm/mm 2 ; p &lt; 0.05 vs. baseline). μHBO 2 , TVD and PVD were significantly increased compared to moderate sepsis alone. However, therapeutic vasopressin did not change intestinal microcirculation. In mild septic animals sub-therapeutic as well as therapeutic vasopressin had no relevant effect on gastrointestinal microcirculation. Systemic blood pressure remained constant in all groups. Conclusion Sub-therapeutic vasopressin improves gastrointestinal microcirculatory oxygenation in moderate sepsis without altering systemic blood pressure. This protective effect seems to be mediated by an enhanced microcirculatory perfusion and thereby increased oxygen supply. In contrast, therapeutic vasopressin did not show this beneficial effect."
https://openalex.org/W3199009469,"Background Community health workers and volunteers are vital for the achievement of Universal Health Coverage also in low-income countries. Ethiopia introduced community volunteers called women’s development group leaders in 2011. These women have responsibilities in multiple sectors, including promoting health and healthcare seeking. Objective We aimed to explore women’s development group leaders’ and health workers’ perceptions on these volunteers’ role in maternal, neonatal and child healthcare. Methods A qualitative study was conducted with in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with women’s development group leaders, health extension workers, health center staff, and woreda and regional health extension experts. We adapted a framework of community health worker performance, and explored perceptions of the women’s development group program: inputs, processes and performance. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded prior to translation and thematic analysis. Results The women’s development group leaders were committed to their health-related work. However, many were illiterate, recruited in a sub-optimal process, had weak supervision and feedback, lacked training and incentives and had weak knowledge on danger signs and care of neonates. These problems demotivated these volunteers from engaging in maternal, neonatal and child health promotion activities. Health extension workers faced difficulties in managing the numerous women’s development group leaders in the catchment area. Conclusion The women’s development group leaders showed a willingness to contribute to maternal and child healthcare but lacked support and incentives. The program requires some redesign, effective management, and should offer enhanced recruitment, training, supervision, and incentives. The program should also consider continued training to develop the leaders’ knowledge, factor contextual influences, and be open for local variations."
https://openalex.org/W3199253546,"Background In Thailand, individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who develop portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) have a restricted treatment option because to the extent of the disease, poor underlying liver function, and non-coverage of immuno/targeted therapy. Radiotherapy (RT) plays an increasingly important function in these patients. To investigate the feasibility, efficacy, and adverse event rates, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients with HCC with PVTT who underwent 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiation (IMRT), volumetric-modulated radiotherapy (VMAT), and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in a single—institution. Objectives To examine clinical results in terms of overall survival (OS), local control (LC), response of primary tumor and PVTT, hepatic and gastrointestinal adverse reaction, and prognosis variables for OS and LC. Materials and methods Between July 2007 and August 2019, non-metastatic HCC with PVTT patients treated with RT were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated. Results The analysis included data from 160 patients. The mean age of the patients was 60.8 years ((95% CI 58.2–62.0). The median diameter of the tumor was 7.7 cm (range: 1–24.5). 85 (54.5%) individuals had PVTT in the main or first branch. At 1.8–10 Gy per fraction, the mean biologically effective dose (BED) as α/β ratio of 10 was 49.6 (95% CI 46.7–52.5) Gy 10 . The median survival time was 8.3 (95% CI 6.1–10.3) months. Survival rates at one and two years were 39.6% and 17.1%, respectively. Estimated incidence of local failure using competing risk analysis were 24% and 60% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The overall response rate was 74%, with an 18.5 percent complete response rate. In multivariate analysis, tumor size, overall response, and radiation dose were all significant prognostic variables for OS. Hepatic unfavorable events of grade 3 and 4 were for 14.1% of the total. There was no occurrences of grade 3–4 gastrointestinal toxicity, either acute or late. Additionally, there were no treatment-related mortality. Conclusions Advanced RT is regarded as a safe and effective therapeutic option for HCC with PVTT. Overall survival was clearly related to tumor size, radiation dose, and tumor/PVTT response. Individuals with BED 56 Gy 10 had significantly better overall survival than patients with BED 56 Gy 10 . A prospective randomized trial is required to validate these outcomes in order to corroborate these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3199366659,"Celiac disease (CD) is triggered by ingestion of gluten-containing cereals such as wheat, barley, rye and in some cases oat. The only way for affected individuals to avoid symptoms of this condition is to adopt a gluten-free diet. Thus, gluten-free foodstuffs need to be monitored in order to ensure their innocuity. For this purpose, commercial immunoassays based on recognition of defined linear gluten sequences are currently used. These immunoassays are designed to detect or quantify total gluten regardless of the cereal, and often result in over or underestimation of the exact gluten content. In addition, Canadian regulations require a declaration of the source of gluten on the label of prepackaged foods, which cannot be done due to the limitations of existing methods. In this study, the development of new antibodies targeting discrimination of gluten sources was conducted using synthetic peptides as immunization strategy. Fourteen synthetic peptides selected from unique linear amino acid sequences of gluten were bioconjugated to Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin (CCH) as protein carrier, to elicit antibodies in rabbit. The resulting polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) successfully discriminated wheat, barley and oat prolamins during indirect ELISA assessments. pAbs raised against rye synthetic peptides cross-reacted evenly with wheat and rye prolamins but could still be useful to successfully discriminate gluten sources in combination with the other pAbs. Discrimination of gluten sources can be further refined and enhanced by raising monoclonal antibodies using a similar immunization strategy. A methodology capable of discriminating gluten sources, such as the one proposed in this study, could facilitate compliance with Canadian regulations on this matter. This type of discrimination could also complement current immunoassays by settling the issue of over and underestimation of gluten content, thus improving the safety of food intended to CD and wheat-allergic patients."

This study aimed to develop, standardize, optimize, and validate conventional RT-PCR targeting the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 in naso-oropharyngeal swab samples compared to qPCR. Using bioinformatics tools, specific primers were determined, with a product expected to be 519 bp. The reaction conditions were optimized using a commercial positive control, and the detection limit was determined to be 100 fragments. To validate conventional RT-PCR, we determined a representative sampling of 346 samples from patients with suspected infection whose diagnosis was made in parallel with qPCR. A sensitivity of 92.1% and specificity of 100% were verified, with an accuracy of 95.66% and correlation coefficient of 0.913. Under current Brazilian conditions, this method generates approximately 60% savings compared to qPCR costs.

https://openalex.org/W3200637020,"GPR40 (FFAR1) is a promising target for the managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). The most advanced GPR40 agonist TAK-875 exhibited satisfactory glucose-lowering effects in phase II and III studies. However, the phase III studies of TAK-875 revealed drug-induced liver injury (DILI). It is unknown whether DILI is a consequence of a specific GPR40 agonist or is an inherent feature of all GPR40 agonists. CPL207280 is a novel GPR40 agonist that improves diabetes in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats and db/db mice. In this report, the DILI-related toxicity of CPL207280 was compared directly with that of TAK-875. In vitro studies evaluating hepatic biliary transporter inhibition, mitochondrial function, and metabolic profiling were performed in hepatocytes from different species. The long term toxicity of CPL207280 was studied in vivo in rats and monkeys. Activity of CPL207280 was one order of magnitude lesser than that of TAK-875 for the inhibition of bile acid transporters. CPL207280 had a negligible effect on the hepatic mitochondria. In contrast to TAK-875, which was metabolized through toxic glucuronidation, CPL207280 was metabolized mainly through oxidation. No deleterious hepatic effects were observed in chronically treated healthy and diabetic animals. The study presents promising data on the feasibility of creating a liver-safe GPR40 agonist. Additionally, it can be concluded that DILI is not a hallmark of GPR40 agonists; it is linked to the intrinsic properties of an individual agonist."
https://openalex.org/W3200863831,"Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a method that can provide quantitative information about perfusion in the human body, in vivo, and without contrast agent. Unfortunately, the IVIM perfusion parameter maps are known to be relatively noisy in the brain, in particular for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient, which might hinder its potential broader use in clinical applications. Therefore, we studied the conditions to produce optimal IVIM perfusion images in the brain. IVIM imaging was performed on a 3-Tesla clinical system in four healthy volunteers, with 16 b values 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 110, 140, 170, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 s/mm2, repeated 20 times. We analyzed the noise characteristics of the trace images as a function of b-value, and the homogeneity of the IVIM parameter maps across number of averages and sub-sets of the acquired b values. We found two peaks of noise of the trace images as function of b value, one due to thermal noise at high b-value, and one due to physiological noise at low b-value. The selection of b value distribution was found to have higher impact on the homogeneity of the IVIM parameter maps than the number of averages. Based on evaluations, we suggest an optimal b value acquisition scheme for a 12 min scan as 0 (7), 20 (4), 140 (19), 300 (9), 500 (19), 700 (1), 800 (4), 900 (1) s/mm2."

Inattentional blindness is demonstrated to happen not only in naïve observers engaged in an unfamiliar task but also in field experts with years of training. Anaesthesia is the perfect example of a discipline which requires a high level of attention and our aim was to evaluate if inattentional blindness can affect anesthesiologists during their daily activities. Materials and methods An online survey was distributed on Facebook between May 1, 2021 and May 31, 2021. The survey consisted of five simulated cases with questions investigating the anesthetic management of day-case surgeries. Each case had an introduction, a chest radiography, an electrocardiogram, preoperative blood testing and the last case had a gorilla embedded in the chest radiography. Results In total 699 respondents from 17 different countries were finally included in the analysis. The main outcome was to assess the incidence of inattentional blindness. Only 34 (4.9%) respondents were able to spot the gorilla. No differences were found between anesthesiologists or residents, private or public hospitals, or between medical doctors with different experience. Discussion Our findings assess that inattentional blindness is common in anesthesia, and ever-growing attention is deemed necessary to improve patient safety; to achieve this objective several strategies should be adopted such as an increased use of standardized protocols, promoting automation based strategies to reduce human error when performing repetitive tasks and discouraging evaluation of multiple consecutive patients in the same work shifts independently of the associated complexity."

The initial spermatozoa motility showed increased average values at all experimental concentrations compared to the control group (culture medium without FeSO 4 .7H 2 O). After 2 h, FeSO 4 .7H 2 O stimulated the overall percentage of spermatozoa motility at the concentrations of ≤ 125 μM. However, experimental administration of 250 μM of FeSO 4 .7H 2 O significantly (P &lt; 0.001) decreased the spermatozoa motility but had no negative effect on the cell viability (P &lt; 0.05) (Time 2 h). The lowest viability was noted after the addition of ≥ 500 μM of FeSO 4 .7H 2 O (P &lt; 0.001). The concentrations of ≤ 62.50 μM of FeSO 4 .7H 2 O markedly stimulated (P &lt; 0.001) spermatozoa activity after 24 h of exposure, while at high concentrations of ≥ 500 μM of FeSO 4 .7H 2 O the overall percentage of spermatozoa motility was significantly inhibited (P &lt; 0.001) and it elicited cytotoxic action. Fluorescence analysis confirmed that spermatozoa incubated with higher concentrations (≥ 500 μM) of FeSO 4 .7H 2 O displayed apoptotic changes, as detected in head membrane (acrosomal part) and mitochondrial portion of spermatozoa. Moreover, the highest concentration and the longest time of exposure (1000 μM of FeSO 4 .7H 2 O; Time 6 h) induced even necrotic alterations to spermatozoa. These results suggest that high concentrations of FeSO 4 .7H 2 O are able to induce toxic effects on the structure and function of spermatozoa, while low concentrations may have the positive effect on the fertilization potential of spermatozoa."
https://openalex.org/W3199307081,"This study explored the reflections of college students at different stages of their service provided to preschoolers and proposed recommendations on service-learning curricula according to the research findings. Thirty-six college juniors enrolled in an academic service-learning course were asked to complete a service-learning project, to undertake service activities in the form of eight storytelling sessions at preschools. This storytelling plan was 1.5-hour-long each, twice per month, for 16-weeks. Qualitative case study approach was employed in this study. Data consisted of documentation of the participants’ reflections, focus group interviews, and research logs. The thematic analysis was employed to analyze data and data were analyzed using the constant comparative technique. The study revealed that the contents of participants’ reflections took on a qualitative change as their service experience accumulated. Before their service experience, their reflections focused on personal expectations. This shifted professional learning and personal growth during the service experience. After their service experiences, their reflections were extended to include social concern. Also, the participants were inspired to actively acquire professional knowledge from their service experiences. Various reflection activities triggered different levels and functions of reflection by the participants. Writing activities caused the participants to focus on personal reflection, providing the opportunity for them to examine and adjust their ideas; group discussion activities allowed the participants to focus on group dialogue, with which they achieved learning and gained identity. Finally, students experienced emotional highs and lows during their experience of service, describing tension and fear initially, then joy or disquietude subsequently. Recommendations based on the research results were provided to facilitate planning of the service-learning curriculum by college educators."
https://openalex.org/W3199432810,"Ultrasound can be used to assess injury and structural changes to the soft-tissue structure of the foot. It may be useful to assess the feet of people with diabetes who are at increased risk of plantar soft-tissue pathological changes. The aim of this study was to determine if ultrasound measurements of plantar soft-tissue thickness and assessments of tissue acoustic characteristics are reliable in people with and without diabetes mellitus. A repeated measures design was used to determine intra-observer reliability for ultrasound measurements of plantar skin and fat pad thickness and intra- and inter-observer reliability of plantar skin and fat pad tissue characterisation assessments made at foot sites which are at risk of tissue injury in people with diabetes. Thickness measurements and tissue characterisation assessments were obtained at the heel and forefoot in both the unloaded and compressed states and included discrete layers of the plantar tissues: skin, microchamber, horizontal fibrous band, macrochamber and total soft-tissue depth. At each site, relative intra-observer reliability was achieved for the measurement of at least one plantar tissue layer. The total soft-tissue thickness measured in the unloaded state (ICC 0.925–0.976) demonstrated intra-observer reliability and is the most sensitive for detecting small change on repeated measures. Intra-observer agreement was demonstrated for tissue characteristic assessments of the skin at the heel (k = 0.70), fat pad at the lateral sesamoid region (k = 0.70) and both skin and fat pad at the second (k = 0.80, k = 0.70 respectively) and third metatarsal heads (k = 0.90, k = 0.79 respectively). However, acceptable inter-observer agreement was not demonstrated for any tissue characteristic assessment, therefore the use of multiple observers should be avoided when making these assessments."
https://openalex.org/W3200409651,"Livestock manure emits reduced sulfur compounds and methane, which affect nature and the climate. These gases are efficiently mitigated by addition of a tannic acid-sodium fluoride combination inhibitor (TA-NaF), and to some extent by acidification. In this paper, TA-NaF treatment was performed on swine manure to study the treatment influence on methanogenic pathways and sulfur transformation pathways in various laboratory experiments. Stable carbon isotope labeling revealed that both untreated and TA-NaF treated swine manures were dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. However, in supplementary experiments in wastewater sludge, TA-NaF clearly inhibited acetoclastic methanogenesis, whereas acidification inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. In swine manure, TA-NaF inhibited s-amino acid catabolism to a larger extent than sulfate reduction. Conversely, acidification reduced sulfate reduction activity more than s-amino acid degradation. TA-NaF treatment had no significant effect on methanogenic community structure, which was surprising considering clear effects on isotope ratios of methane and carbon dioxide. Halophile sulfate reducers adapted well to TA-NaF treatment, but the community change also depended on temperature. The combined experimental work resulted in a proposed inhibition scheme for sulfur transformations and methanogenic pathways as affected by TA-NaF and acidification in swine manure and in other inocula."
https://openalex.org/W3200467858,"Background Sarcopenia is defined as decreased skeletal muscle mass and muscle functions (strength and physical performance). Muscle mass is measured by specific methods, such as bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. However, the devices used for these methods are costly and are usually not portable. A simple tool to screen for sarcopenia without measuring muscle mass might be practical, especially in developing countries. The aim of this study was to design a simple screening tool and to validate its performance in screening for sarcopenia in older adult cancer patients scheduled for elective surgery. Methods Cancer surgical patients aged &gt;60 years were enrolled. Their nutritional statuses were evaluated using the Mini Nutrition Assessment-Short Form. Sarcopenia was assessed using Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Four screening formulas with differing combinations of factors (muscle strength, physical performance, and nutritional status) were assessed. The validities of the formulas, compared with the AWGS definition, are presented as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under a receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Of 251 enrolled surgical patients, 84 (34%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Malnutrition (odds ratio [OR]: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.40–5.93); underweight status (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.06–7.43); and age increments of 5 years (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.41–2.24) were independent predictors of preoperative sarcopenia. The combination of low muscle strength and/or abnormal physical performance, plus malnutrition/risk of malnutrition had the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (81.0%, 78.4%, and 79.3%, respectively). This screening formula estimated the probability of sarcopenia with a positive predictive value of 65.4% and a negative predictive value of 89.1%. Conclusion Sarcopenia screening can be performed using a simple tool. The combination of low muscle strength and/or abnormal physical performance, plus malnutrition/risk of malnutrition, has the highest screening performance."

Then this article is based on the embedded soft PLC hardware platform, according to the international standard of industrial control programming, writes the embedded soft PLC low-level driver software. Secondly, this article analyzes the factors that affect the warp tension during the operation of the rapier loom, and proposes the use of genetic algorithm to optimize the warp tension control method of the traditional PID algorithm. Finally, we conducted verification tests and on-site application debugging for the entire set of rapier loom embedded soft PLC control system. We controlled the warp tension as the main experimental object. The results show that this control system effectively improves the control accuracy of the warp tension of the rapier loom and meets the actual needs of industrial applications. The whole system has a good application prospect in the warp tension control of rapier looms."
https://openalex.org/W3201532419,"Integrating Multibeam Echosounder (MBES) data (bathymetry and backscatter) and underwater video technology allows scientists to study marine habitats. However, use of such data in modeling suitable seagrass habitats in Malaysian coastal waters is still limited. This study tested multiple spatial resolutions (1 and 50 m) and analysis window sizes (3 × 3, 9 × 9, and 21 × 21 cells) probably suitable for seagrass-habitat relationships in Redang Marine Park, Terengganu, Malaysia. A maximum entropy algorithm was applied, using 12 bathymetric and backscatter predictors to develop a total of 6 seagrass habitat suitability models. The results indicated that both fine and coarse spatial resolution datasets could produce models with high accuracy (&gt;90%). However, the models derived from the coarser resolution dataset displayed inconsistent habitat suitability maps for different analysis window sizes. In contrast, habitat models derived from the fine resolution dataset exhibited similar habitat distribution patterns for three different analysis window sizes. Bathymetry was found to be the most influential predictor in all the models. The backscatter predictors, such as angular range analysis inversion parameters (characterization and grain size), gray-level co-occurrence texture predictors, and backscatter intensity levels, were more important for coarse resolution models. Areas of highest habitat suitability for seagrass were predicted to be in shallower (&lt;20 m) waters and scattered between fringing reefs (east to south). Some fragmented, highly suitable habitats were also identified in the shallower (&lt;20 m) areas in the northwest of the prediction models and scattered between fringing reefs. This study highlighted the importance of investigating the suitable spatial resolution and analysis window size of predictors from MBES for modeling suitable seagrass habitats. The findings provide important insight on the use of remote acoustic sonar data to study and map seagrass distribution in Malaysia coastal water."
https://openalex.org/W3199622007,"Nicrophorus is a genus of beetles that bury and transform small vertebrate carcasses into a brood ball coated with their oral and anal secretions to prevent decay and that will serve as a food source for their young. Nicrophorus pustulatus is an unusual species with the ability to overtake brood of other burying beetles and whose secretions, unlike other Nicrophorus species, has been reported not to exhibit antimicrobial properties. This work aims to better understand how the presence or absence of a food source influences the expression of genes involved in the feeding process of N. pustulatus. To achieve that, total RNA was extracted from pooled samples of salivary gland tissue from N. pustulatus and sequenced using an Illumina platform. The resulting reads were used to assemble a de novo transcriptome using Trinity. Duplicates with more than 95% similarity were removed to obtain a ""unigene"" set. Annotation of the unigene set was done using the Trinotate pipeline. Transcript abundance was determined using Kallisto and differential gene expression analysis was performed using edgeR. A total of 651 genes were found to be differentially expressed, including 390 upregulated and 261 downregulated genes in fed insects compared to starved. Several genes upregulated in fed beetles are associated with the insect immune response and detoxification processes with only one transcript encoding for the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) defensin. These results confirm that N. pustulatus does not upregulate the production of genes encoding AMPs during feeding. This study provides a snapshot of the changes in gene expression in the salivary glands of N. pustulatus following feeding while providing a well described transcriptome for the further analysis of this unique burying beetle."
https://openalex.org/W3201083939,"Purpose While initial overcorrection after exotropia-correcting surgery is widely accepted for a favorable long-term outcome, some have not advocated such overcorrection in younger children owing to concerns regarding rapid deterioration of bifixation ability. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between initial overcorrection after intermittent exotropia surgery and the surgical outcome in patients aged &lt;4 years. Methods In this retrospective study, 391 patients who had undergone surgery for intermittent exotropia were classified into two groups according to the age at surgery: &lt;4 years old (group Y [young], 130 patients) and 4–16 years old (group O [old], 261). The patients were subdivided into three groups according to the angle of deviation at postoperative 1 week: esophoria-tropia (ET) ≥10 prism diopters (PD) (subgroup I), ET 1–9 PD (II), and orthotropia or exophoria-tropia (XT) (III). We compared the surgical outcomes between the two groups and among subgroups; then, we analyzed consecutive esotropia patients. Results The mean exodeviation was smaller in the order of subgroup I, II, and III at every postoperative visit (p&lt;0.05) in group Y but showed no difference among subgroups after 2 years in group O. Consecutive esotropia occurred at 1 month, postoperatively, in 6.9% and 2.6% of the patients in groups Y and O (p = 0.133), respectively. However, it persisted in two and one patient in groups Y and O, respectively, until the last visit. Conclusion Early overcorrection after intermittent exotropia surgery was a safe and desirable result in terms of motor outcome in children aged under 4 years, as well as for children aged between 4–16 years."
https://openalex.org/W3201314087,"Underrepresentation of women in politics is a matter of great concern to social scientists, citizens, and policymakers alike. Despite effort over the past decade to ameliorate it with gender quotas of different types, scientific research provides a mixed picture on the extent to which quotas can close these gender gaps under different conditions. We approach this puzzle by focusing on the orientation of electoral systems— candidate -centered vs. platform -centered—as a context that conditions the effect of quotas on representation. Our analyses of 76 countries’ electoral rules and legislatures show that contrary to expectations, it is in candidate -oriented systems that quotas facilitate stronger effect on women’s representation. Even after considering proportional representation, district magnitude, human development, or labor-force participation as alternative explanations, we show that quotas foster greater increases in gender representation in candidate-oriented systems. The broader implications are that in electoral systems that tend to have larger gender gaps, quotas have a substantial contribution to equal representation."
