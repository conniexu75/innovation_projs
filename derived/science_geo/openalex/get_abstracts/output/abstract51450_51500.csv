https://openalex.org/W1985921964,Variation and conservation in the primary structure of human lambda light chains is revealed by complete amino acid sequence of three Bence Jones proteins. These proteins differ in amino acid sequence in from 38 to 48 positions; they are of unequal length in the amino-terminal half of the chain but have identical sequence in the last 105 amino acids.

https://openalex.org/W1982895969,"Electron microscopy of purified Waldenström macroglobulins and normal human and rabbit gammaM immunoglobulins revealed spider-like structures with five legs varying in length and often joining a central ring. Usually only the central more rigid part of this structure (about 150 by 170 angstroms) was clearly visible, but occasionally particles were seen with longer very flexible legs having a total span of about 350 angstroms. Molecules of gammaM antibody retained antibody activity during preparation for electron microscopy. Human and rabbit alpha macroglobulins revealed more rigid symmetric structures (100 by 200 angstroms) which resembled the Russian letter ."

https://openalex.org/W2125751438,"Residues of chlorinated organic pesticide chemicals were commonly found in all diet samples and all food classes within samples except beverages at a daily intake of 0.0014 mg per kilogram of body weight. Meat, fish, and poultry were the major source of pesticide residues and, when combined with dairy products, account for more than half of the intake of chlorinated organic pesticide chemicals. Fruits, garden fruits, and grain foods each accounted for about 10 percent of the intake of chlorinated pesticides. The DDT, its two analogs, dieldrin, lindane, and heptachlor epoxide account for 85 percent of the total intake of chlorinated pesticides. A single pesticide, DDT, accounts for one-third of the total. There was no statistically significant change in frequency or quantities of these compounds during this study. Frequency and quantities of the 14 additional chlorinated pesticides were too low to be meaningful."
https://openalex.org/W2015293426,"An alpha macroglobulin fraction (19S) was isolated from the serum of rats and BC(3)F(1) mice by zonal ultracentrifugation. Both the isologous and heterologous macroglobulin fractions increased survival among BC(3)F(1) mice x-irradiated with 750 roentgens. The mouse macroglobulin fraction also enhanced radiation recovery of hematopoietic tissue as measured by colony-forming assay and iron-59 incorporation into erythropoietic cells. The overall difference in hematopoietic activity in the irradiated (400 roentgens) mice treated with the macroglobulin fraction, in comparison with this activity in the controls, was three- to fivefold in the bone marrow and nine- to tenfold in the spleen between days 4 and 7 after irradiation. This effect was not obtained with the isologous serum protein fraction containing proteins of smaller molecular weight."

https://openalex.org/W2042172022,A group of nerve cells in the rostellum become progressively more fuchsinophilic during the first 16 days of development; they then release their secretion into their axons at about the time that the first proglottid is released.

https://openalex.org/W2022952888,"When minced mammary tissue from lactating rabbits was incubated in vitro with C(14)-labeled lysine and isoleucine, it incorporated radio-activity into colostral immunoglobulin A. The only portion of this colostral molecule with significant labeling was T-chain, with little or no labeling of light or heavy chains. It was thus demonstrated that T-chains are synthesized by mammary gland. Because the remainder of the molecule was derived from unlabeled material, in vivo it was probably derived from serum."

https://openalex.org/W1993624102,Measurement of the abundance of atmospheric carbon dioxide as an indicator of air pollution has been of very limited value because of variations in urban areas in the substantial concentration of natural carbon dioxide produced from combustion and noncombustion (natural) sources. A solution to this problem is the use of precise isotopic assay of ratios of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in atmospheric carbon dioxide. There is very little variation of carbon isotopic composition in samples taken over rural or urban areas where rapid mixing and diffusion of gaseous combustion products is possible. Significant differences in this composition in samples taken at centrally located points at street level in the lower Manhattan business district show an increase in concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide of roughly 20 percent produced primarily by automobile exhaust.

https://openalex.org/W2035329996,"MICROSOMAL membranes of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma can be separated into membrane classes of high and low density, which on the basis of enzyme, physiochemical and immunological criteria1–4 are considered to be derived from endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, respectively. Because the membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum lack the antigens involved in the agglutination and/or immune lysis of intact Ehrlich ascites carcinoma by rabbit and horse antisera directed against microsomal membranes of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma1,2, we wished to test, by means of antibody-binding, whether there are not some antigens which the two membrane classes have in common."
https://openalex.org/W2074430378,"IT is well known that after immunological stimulation, animals produce non-specific gamma globulins as well as specific antibody1. Quantitative studies have shown that injection into guinea-pigs of an antigen mixed with Freund's adjuvant causes a marked increase in the serum concentrations of γ1 and γ2 globulins, only part of which can precipitate with the antigen2. On the other hand, the induction of immune paralysis in adult guinea-pigs is accompanied by a transient immunological unresponsiveness to unrelated antigens3. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be that immunological paralysis may start by a defective commitment of immunologically competent cells, which does not result in the production of specific antibody. The aim of the present work was to find out whether the induction of paralysis also results in an increase of γ1 and γ2 globulins which might account for some kind of commitment of the competent cells."
