https://openalex.org/W2062663664,"Cooperation in organisms, whether bacteria or primates, has been a difficulty for evolutionary theory since Darwin. On the assumption that interactions between pairs of individuals occur on a probabilistic basis, a model is developed based on the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Deductions from the model, and the results of a computer tournament show how cooperation based on reciprocity can get started in an asocial world, can thrive while interacting with a wide range of other strategies, and can resist invasion once fully established. Potential applications include specific aspects of territoriality, mating, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2072220895,"We propose that the initial event in the secretion of proteins across membranes and their insertion into membranes is the spontaneous penetration of the hydrophobic portion of the bilayer by a helical hairpin. Energetic considerations of polypeptide structures in a nonpolar, lipid environment compared with an aqueous environment suggest that only alpha and 3(10) helices will be observed in the hydrophobic interior of membranes. Insertion of a polypeptide is accomplished by a hairpin structure composed of two helices, which will partition into membranes if the free energy arising from burying hydrophobic helical surfaces exceeds the free energy ""cost"" of burying potentially charged and hydrogen-bonding groups. We suggest, for example, that the hydrophobic leader peptide found in secreted proteins and in many membrane proteins forms one of these helices and is oriented in the membrane with its N terminus inside. In secreted proteins, the leader functions by pulling polar portions of a protein into the membrane as the second helix of the hairpin. The occurrence of all categories of membrane proteins can be rationalized by the hydrophobic or hydrophilic character of the two helices of the inserted hairpin and, for some integral membrane proteins, by events in which a single terminal helix is inserted. We propose that, because of the distribution of polar and nonpolar sequences in the polypeptide sequence, secretion and the insertion of membrane proteins are spontaneous processes that do not require the participation of additional specific membrane receptors or transport proteins."

In the eye ipsilateral to the section, the pattern-reversal ERG remained unaltered for a few days after the section, the progressively decreased in amplitude, first at low and then at high spatial frequencies, to disappear completely about 4 months after the section, when ganglion cell degeneration was practically complete. The flash ERG remained unaltered. No alteration was observed in the contralateral eye."
https://openalex.org/W2060655597,"Unanesthetized decorticate cats walked or ran normally on a treadmill either spontaneously or during electrical stimulation of the subthalamic ""locomotor"" region. The respiratory response usually preceded the locomotor response and increased in proportion to locomotor activity despite control or ablation of respiratory feedback mechanisms. Respiration increased similarly in paralyzed animals during fictive locomotion despite the absence of muscular contraction or movement. Hypothalamic command signals are thus primarily responsible for the proportional driving of locomotion and respiration during exercise."

Rats treated with hypertonic saline after 3 days of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia had demyelinative lesions in the corpus striatum, lateral hemispheric white matter, cerebral cortex, hippocampal fimbria, anterior commissure, thalamus, brainstem tegmentum, and cerebellum. Thus, rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to demyelinative lesions and may be the cause of central pontine myelinolysis in man."
https://openalex.org/W1970396054,Rats exposed to ethanol throughout their gestation were found to have abnormally distributed mossy fibers in temporal regions of the hippocampus. This demonstrates that prenatal exposure to ethanol causes alterations in neuronal circuitry that persist to maturity. Such defects may play a role in the mental retardation often observed in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.
https://openalex.org/W2015058101,"When prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are fed a diet containing cholesterol, a marked increase in gallbladder mucin secretion parallels the evolution of cholesterol supersaturated bile. Gelation of mucin precedes the precipitation of cholesterol liquid and solid crystals and the development of gallstones. Aspirin given to prairie dogs inhibited mucin hypersecretion and gel accumulation and prevented gallstone formation without influencing the cholesterol content of supersaturated bile. This suggests that gallbladder mucin is a nucleation matrix for cholesterol gallstones."
https://openalex.org/W1967813034,"The precursor of the 55K adenovirus terminal protein is an 87K protein that is covalently linked to viral DNA. This protein is likely to be identical to the 80,000 dalton protein described by Challberg et al. (1980). The mRNA for the 87K terminal protein precursor, like that for the E2-72K DNA binding protein, is detectable at both early and late times of infection, and its production is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition (Lewis and Mathews, 1980). The 87K protein, together with proteins of 105,000 and 75,000 daltons, are translated from leftward transcribed (1-strand) messenger RNAs that are complementary to the viral genome between positions 11.2 and 31.5. Additional hybridization to the region between coordinates 37.3 and 41 suggests that the RNA body is spliced to sequences mapping farther right in the genome. Electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis has revealed a family of 1-strand RNAs that probably encode these proteins. The RNA bodies extend from coordinated 30, 26 and 23 to 11.1, with leaders at 39, 68.5 and 75 map units, defining a new adenovirus early region. These RNAs and region E2 RNAs share the first leader and presumably the same promoter, and may be coordinately expressed. Virions of the protease-deficient adenovirus 2 mutant ts1 grown at the restrictive temperature contain only the 87K form; when grown at the permissive temperature they contain both the 87K and 55K forms, and an additional 62K form; wild-type virions contain only the 55K form. Peptide analysis shows all these proteins to be related. The DNA-protein complex containing the 87K form is active as a template for viral DNA replication in vitro. This data supports a model of adenovirus DNA replication in which the 87K terminal protein precursor is the primary translation product and primes DNA synthesis. The 87K precursor is processed curing virus maturation to the 55K terminal protein, possibly via a 62K intermediate form, by the virus-specified Ad2ts1 protease."
https://openalex.org/W2002149575,"The ovalbumin gene family is composed of three genes, X, Y and ovalbumin, which are expressed in laying hen oviduct. We have analyzed the in vivo transcription products of X and Y genes and the effect of steroid hormones on their synthesis and accumulation. As in the case of ovalbumin, the complete gene transcripts and processing intermediates are present in the poly(A)+ RNA fraction. The mature RNAs are found in polysomes and are translated into proteins. The expression of X and Y genes is controlled by steroid hormones: X and Y RNAs are not detectable in oviducts from chicks withdrawn from estrogen stimulation, whereas in chicks stimulated with estrogen for 7 days, X RNA represents 0.3% and Y RNA 0.8% of ovalbumin mRNA. In laying hen, however, the levels of X and Y RNAs are about 2% of ovalbumin mRNA. After stimulation with other steroid hormones, alone or in combination, the level of X and Y RNA does not achieve that detected in laying hen. Progesterone has a much weaker effect on X RNA accumulation than on that of Y and ovalbumin mRNAs. Studies with isolated nuclei show that X and Y gene expression is regulated by hormones at the level of transcription. However, the differences observed between the transcription rates and the accumulation of X and Y mRNAs suggest that the expression of X and Y genes could also be controlled at the levels of RNA processing and/or mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1977475600,Distress vocalizations were produced in adult guinea pigs by electrical stimulation of the dorsomedial thalamus or the septum-preoptic area. Both of these forebrain-derived vocalizations were increased by systemic administration of naloxone and were inhibited by analgesic periventricular gray stimulation. Naloxone blocked the inhibitory effects of the analgesic stimulation on thalamic vocalizations. Stimulation of nonanalgesic mesencephalic sites in close proximity to the periventricular gray increased the anterior-elicited vocalizations. These data provide evidence for ascending endorphin-mediated inhibition of excitatory forebrain sites for distress vocalizations.
https://openalex.org/W1967534860,"Most magnocellular neurosecretory cells that terminate in the posterior pituitary secrete either vasopressin, oxytocin, or enkephalin. Intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow into single magnocellular neurons in slices of rat hypothalamus resulted in dye transfer between these cells. Freeze-fracture replicas of these cells occasionally revealed gap junctions, which presumably contain channels that mediate the dye coupling. These two independent techniques strongly suggest that some mammalian neuropeptidergic cells are electrotonically coupled, providing a possible means for recruitment and synchronization of their electrical activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972974371,Seventeen females and eight males exposed during gestation to synthetic progestins showed a significantly higher potential for physical aggression than their sex-matched unexposed siblings. Exposure to androgen-based compounds appeared to be most closely associated with aggressive responses. There were no differences in verbal aggression or IQ between exposed and unexposed siblings.
https://openalex.org/W1966097345,"Auditory brainstem potentials were recorded from abstinent chronic alcoholics and control subjects. The latencies of peaks II, III, IV, and V were significantly delayed in the alcoholic patients compared to control subjects. Brainstem transmission time was longer in alcoholics than in controls. This study provides systematic evidence that chronic alcohol abuse results in brainstem deficits suggesting possible demyelination of auditory tracts."

https://openalex.org/W2012123796,"Averaged sensory-evoked potentials were recorded from the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in naïve rats and in rats conditioned to respond in the presence of an auditory stimulus. Two components (negative peaks) of the potentials were functionally distinguished in terms of responsiveness to unique or conditioned auditory stimuli. Each component was independently generated by a separate input pathway to the dentate gyrus: The perforant path provided an ""insignificance"" or ""unexpected"" feature of the sensory stimulus when appropriate, and the septum controlled the development of a second component as a function of the behavioral significance of the stimulus during the acquisition of auditory discrimination behavior. A reciprocal relationship between the peak amplitudes of both components of the average evoked potentials dependent on the relative behavioral significance of the sensory stimulus was observed in all animals during extinction and reconditioning of the sensory discrimination task. The findings indicate that the entorhinal and septal projections to the dentate granule cells are activated differentially by sensory stimuli as a function of their acquired behavioral significance to the animal."

After undergoing 6 hours of coronary occlusion, animals bled and treated with fluorocarbons developed smaller infarctions than those receiving Ringer solution or no treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1987766990,"N-acetylimidazole (NAI) was used to O-acetylate the plant seed toxin ricin. O-acetylation of one to two tyrosine residues per molecule of ricin inhibited ricin binding to Sepharose 4B and decreased toxicity by 90% in a protein synthesis inhibition assay in HeLa cells. Lactose, known to block the binding site on the ricin B subunit, protected ricin from NAI modification of binding or toxicity. Thus NAI, under these conditions, can be a lactose site-specific inhibitor. The lactose site-specific modification of the hybrid toxin, Man6P-ricin, performed under the same conditions, exhibited the same 90% inhibition of Man6P receptor-mediated toxicity as the galactose-containing receptor-mediated toxicity of either Man6P-ricin or ricin. Thus the ricin B chain lactose-binding site appears to be essential for the high potency of Man6P-ricin via the new cell type-specific Man6P receptor. Treatment of fibroblasts with neuraminidase exposes galactose residues, thus increasing the sensitivity to ricin eight fold. The Man6P receptor-mediated toxicity of Man6P-ricin is not affected by this treatment, although the galactose-inhibited route is potentiated eight fold. The Man6P-ricin hybrid appears to require the ricin B chain galactose-binding site to enter the cytosol after initially binding to the Man6P receptor. These data provide some insights into the proper design of hybrid toxins. We discuss a number of possible models for hybrid toxin entry."

https://openalex.org/W2059604653,"Vaginocervical stimulation affects progesterone secretion, sperm transport, sexual receptivity, locomotion, and perception of pain in female rats. In this experiment, vaginocervical stimulation produced statistically significant increases in the metabolic uptake of carbon-14-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose in the following brain areas (ordered by magnitude of uptake): medial preoptic, mesencephalic reticular formation, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, dorsal raphe, and globus pallidus. The results provide information about the concurrent processing of sensory stimulation by several neural areas and indicate that the medial preoptic area is a receiving area for copulatory stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2024370620,"A novel form of extrachromosomal rDNA has been identified in conjugating Tetrahymena cells. This rDNA consists of 11 kb linear double-stranded DNA molecules, each containing a single rRNA gene copy. The DNA sequence, tandemly repeated CCCCAA (Blackburn and Gall, 1978) found at the termini of extrachromosomal palindromic rDNA (the macronuclear form found in vegetatively growing cells), is also present at the corresponding terminus of the 11 kb rDNA. The other end of this molecule has an extra 0.3 kb segment of DNA covalently attached to the DNA region corresponding to the center of the palindromic rDNA. The kinetics of appearance and synthesis of the 11 kb rDNA early in macronuclear development are consistent with its being an intermediate in rDNA amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2051316079,"Throughout development, Mongolian gerbils engage in conspicuous naso-oral investigations of their social partners' mouth areas. The behavioral contribution of saliva-related stimuli in regulating oral-directed responses was studied during several important phases of the gerbil's social life. Weanlings were preferentially attracted to their mother's saliva, subadults at puberty preferred saliva of littermates to that of nonlittermates, and sexually experienced males preferred the saliva of estrous females to that of nonestrous females. The use of saliva as a discriminative cue during various developmental periods suggests that oral chemostimuli have a perennial role in regulating social interchanges."
https://openalex.org/W1971584152,"Larvae of the air-breathing teleost fish Monopterus are frequently exposed to periods of critical hypoxia, which they can survive because they have (i) dense capillary networks in the skin, (ii) a small blood-water barrier, (iii) an active pectoral fin mechanism that generates a posteriorly directed respiratory water current originating from the oxygen-rich surface layer, and (iv) a principal flow of blood that runs countercurrent to the water stream. Experimental data show that the larva as a whole is a functional analog of a fish gill lamella and that similar adaptive mechanisms are present in larvae of ancient fishes and some modern teleosts inhabiting permanently or periodically hypoxic waters."
https://openalex.org/W1989945160,"3-Deazaadenosine, an inhibitor of methylation, increased the frequency of conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to fat cells in a dose-dependent manner. Once converted, the 3T3-L1 fat cells retained their adipose morphology and accumulated triglycerides even when 3-deazaadenosine was removed from the culture medium. 3-Deazaadenosine may perturb cellular methylation and thereby lead to an increase in the frequency of differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to fat cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087878201,"The δ(13C/12C) — values of methane produced by fistulated steers, dairy cattle, and wethers, and dairy and beef cattle herds show a bimodal distribution that appears to be correlated with the plant type (C3 or C4, that is, producing either a three- or a four-carbon acid in the first step of photosynthesis) consumed by the animals. These results indicate that cattle and sheep, on a global basis, release methane with an average δ(13C/12C) value of -60 and -63 per mil, respectively. Together they are a source of atmospheric methane whose δ(13C/12C) is similar to published values for marsh gas and cannot explain the 20 per mil higher values for atmospheric methane."

These proteins may either represent antigenic markers, the toxin (or toxins), or toxic subunits that cause the clinical manifestations of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2058029037,"The mechanisms controlling early adenovirus gene expression in vivo have been studied using inhibitors of protein synthesis. When inhibitors were added shortly before or at the onset of infection, viral mRNA from all early regions was transcribed, spliced and accumulated over a 7 hr period. After longer pretreatment, accumulation of several early mRNAs were suppressed. Addition of inhibitors 1 hr after infection enhanced the accumulation of viral mRNA in the cytoplasm. Translation of early mRNA selected on adenovirus DNA in a cell-free system reflected the amount of viral mRNA present. A viral coded product may therefore control accumulation of viral mRNA. A different pattern emerged when inhibitors of protein synthesis were removed at 5 hr postinfection and cells were removed at 5 hr postinfection and cells were pulse-labeled in vivo. If inhibitors were introduced at or before infection, early viral proteins were synthesized only after a lag of 1-3 hr. However, if treatment was introduced 1 hr postinfection, reversion of the protein synthesis block was instantaneous. It appears that protein synthesis inhibitors reveal an in vivo translational block for viral mRNA. This block could be overcome by preinfection with a related virus. Furthermore, no block was observed in a virus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line (293) which expresses early region 1 of the viral genome. Viral gene product(s) encoded in early region 1 may control translation of early adenovirus messenger RNA in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2068654541,"During myogenesis in vitro the actin-binding protein filamin is present in myoblasts and early fused cells and is associated with α-actinin-containing filament bundles, as judged by double immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for these two proteins. Approximately one day after cell fusion, yet before the development of a-actinin-containing Z line striations, filamin disappears from the cells. Later in myogenesis, several days after the appearance of α-actinin-containing Z line striations, filamin reappears and accumulates in the cells. Double immunofluorescence with antibodies to filamin and vimentin (or desmin) reveals that the newly appearing filamin localizes now to the myofibril Z line and is visible there shortly before vimentin or desmin becomes associated with the Z line. Immunofluorescent localization of filamin in isolated chicken skeletal myofibrils and Z disc sheets indicates that filamin has the same distribution as desmin and vimentin; it surrounds each myofibril Z disc and forms honeycomb-like networks within each Z plane of the muscle fiber. Filamin may thus be involved in the transition of desmin and vimentin to the Z disc. Analysis of whole-cell extracts by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by immunoautoradiography shows that filamin is present in myoblasts and in myotubes early after cell fusion. Concomitant with the absence of filamin fluorescence during the subsequent few days of myogenesis, the quantity of filamin is markedly reduced. During this time, metabolic pulse-labeling with 35S-methionine reveals that the synthetic rate of filamin is also markedly reduced. As filamin fluorescence appears at the Z line, the quantity of filamin and its synthetic rate both increase. The removal of filamin from the cells suggests that filamin either may not be required, or may actually interfere with a necessary process, during the early stages of sarcomere morphogenesis. These results also indicate that the periphery of the Z disc is assembled in at least two distinct steps during myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081276874,"Negative-chemical-ionization mass spectral screening of extracts of human seminal plasma has revealed a presence of a Cl7 ion cluster at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 463 in a significant number of the samples examined (34 out of 123). Experiments with different gases used to generate the negative-chemical-ionization plasma indicated that the ion at m/z 463 was a chloride adduca of a Cl6 molecule with a mass of 428 daltons. Negative-chemical-ionization mass measurement with ions from the iodoform mass spectrum used as reference peaks gave a mass of 427.882 daltons; C9H15O4PCl6 has a molecular weight of 427.883. Extraction of polyurethane foam with toluene produced an extract that consistently gave a negative-chemical-ionization spectrum containing an intense Cl7 ion at m/z463. The component producing this ion was isolated, and its proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum confirmed that it was tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, a mutagenic flame retardant. The negative-chemical-ionization screening evidence suggests that this flame retardant or its isomer tris(2,3-dichloro-1-propyl)phosphate, or both, are absorbed into the body from formulations in which they are used as flame retardants. Remedial action seems indicated to reduce human exposure to these compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2081339753,"We have characterized the transcripts of the beta-globin gene in RNA isolated from rabbit bone marrow using the S1 mapping procedure of Berk and Sharp (1977). The largest beta-globin-specific RNA that we have detected is a transcript, colinear with the gene, that contains the mRNA coding sequences plus both intervening sequences but does not extend into the extragenic DNA sequences. The 5' and 3' ends of this pre-mRNA maps at the same position as those of mature globin mRNA. Several partially spliced RNAs are described that are probably intermediates in the pathway from the colinear transcript to mature mRNA. The largest spliced pre-mRNA has lost only about 40 of the 126 nucleotides of the small intervening sequence and contains the entire large intervening sequence together with the coding sequences. A second major intermediate pre-mRNA lacks only the entire small intervening sequence. Finally, a pre-mRNA is described in which all but approximately 90 nucleotides of the large intervening sequence have been excised. Thus both intervening sequences appear to be able to be excised in a stepwise fashion. Removal of the small intervening sequence seems to precede the removal of the large intervening sequence."

Crosses were made between susceptibile and refractory species of the Aedes Scutellaris complex, and the hybrid and backcross progeny were tested for susceptibility to infection by Brugia malayi and Brugia pahangi.

Twenty-four hours later, the concentrations of estradiol receptor in nuclear and cytosol fractions prepared from the endometrium surrounding the blastocyst and the inter-implantation areas remained very low. This indicates that estrogen was not secreted by the blastocyst. The higher receptor content in cytosol from inter-implantation sites may reflect modifications accompanying the decidual reaction since our results show that there is no translocation of the receptor to the nuclei. The choice of the dye used to reveal the implantation sites is critical, since Trypan blue but not Evans blue binds steroids and thereby interferes with receptor measurements."
