https://openalex.org/W2053414605,Abundant seeds of high germinability are obtained when Nicotiana tabacum is pollinated by Nicotiana africana. Most of the seedlings die at the cotyledonary stage. The remaining seedlings are viable F(1) hybrids or maternal haploids that can be easily distinguished. This simple method of producing Nicotiana tabacum haploids offers an alternative to anther culture.

Three new conventions have been discovered in the dance language which are used in these circumstances to eliminate potential ambiguity in the dance message."

The isostructural compound MgSiO(3) should behave similarly under conditions obtaining in the earth's lower mantle, and so it is expected that the electrical conductivity in that region is ionic rather than electronic."

https://openalex.org/W2013353727,"Proportional faunal representations in excavated fossil occurrences (Shungura Formation, Omo, Ethiopia) are very similar to modern sub-Saharan mammalian faunal proportions in a variety of environments. Early hominids comprise between 0.6 and 1.6 percent of the excavated assemblage, corrected to reflect numbers of individuals. With allochthonous faunal localities for comparison, direct analogies to modern fauna suggest early hominid population densities of between 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per square kilometer. Calculations based on population densities of modern large mammals indicate that population densities of early hominids were between 0.001 and 2.48 individuals per square kilometer."

https://openalex.org/W1966041057,"Enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, are active during the germination of spores of the fern Dryopteris filix-mas. Increases in activity of both enzymes are correlated with the breakdown of lipid reserves. The occurrence of these enzymes suggests that the microbodies previously described in these spores are glyoxysomes."

https://openalex.org/W2003658281,Palladium dichloride whiskers can be prepared by reacting palladium with chlorine at temperatures above 500 degrees C. The crystals measure 1 x 100 micrometers and are strong (5 percent elastic deformation). They may be a morphological form of one of the high-temperature polymorphs of PdCl(2).

In the sweep of time most men are merged in the on-going human tide. It wise, therefore, to look beneath the formal and the personal; to ask what this occasion really means or what it ought to mean. Of one thing there can be no doubt. This day sees the passing of a personal leadership, although happily not the waning of that personal influence. Not all mortals are destined to be engulfed in the nameless millions of mankind. A few outstanding men can not be forgotten. An institution, said Emerson, is but the lengthening shadow of one man. Minnesota, in this sense, will be the lengthening shadow of Cyrus Northrop. Such unity as the university has found due almost wholly to the fusing power of his winning and guiding personality. The university stands a living tribute to the quick sympathy, humorous tolerance, harmonizing tact, alert intelligence and moral earnestness of its president emeritus. He had to convince an often skeptical outside public; he had to moderate and adjust keen rivalries within the institution. Colleges and departments sought their own ends with ly a fain glimpse of the university as a whole. As he lays down the burden of twenty-seven years he leaves the institution firmly grounded in the good will of the people, and unified by the loyalty of faculty, alumni and students. We should"
