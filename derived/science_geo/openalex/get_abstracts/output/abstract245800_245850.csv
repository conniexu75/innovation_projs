https://openalex.org/W2103302926,"Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into nucleosomes whose position and chemical modification state can profoundly influence regulation of gene expression. We profiled nucleosome modifications across the yeast genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA microarrays to produce high-resolution genome-wide maps of histone acetylation and methylation. These maps take into account changes in nucleosome occupancy at actively transcribed genes and, in doing so, revise previous assessments of the modifications associated with gene expression. Both acetylation and methylation of histones are associated with transcriptional activity, but the former occurs predominantly at the beginning of genes, whereas the latter can occur throughout transcribed regions. Most notably, specific methylation events are associated with the beginning, middle, and end of actively transcribed genes. These maps provide the foundation for further understanding the roles of chromatin in gene expression and genome maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2095125813,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22 nucleotide RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes. In a present model of miRNA function in animals, miRNAs that form imperfect duplexes with their targets inhibit protein expression without affecting mRNA levels. Here, we report that in C. elegans, regulation by the let-7 miRNA results in degradation of its lin-41 target mRNA, despite the fact that its 3'UTR regulatory sequences can only partially base-pair with the miRNA. Furthermore, lin-14 and lin-28 are targets of the lin-4 miRNA, and we show that the mRNA levels for these protein-coding genes significantly decrease in response to lin-4 expression. This study reveals that mRNAs containing partial miRNA complementary sites can be targeted for degradation in vivo, raising the possibility that regulation at the level of mRNA stability may be more common than previously appreciated for the miRNA pathway."

Here we create such a system, in which a non-ionic liquid (an alcohol and an amine base) converts to an ionic liquid (a salt in liquid form) upon exposure to an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and then reverts back to its non-ionic form when exposed to nitrogen or argon gas. Such switchable solvents should facilitate organic syntheses and separations by eliminating the need to remove and replace solvents after each reaction step."

https://openalex.org/W2142359311,"Pitch perception is critical for identifying and segregating auditory objects, especially in the context of music and speech. The perception of pitch is not unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal species. Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency (f(0)) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same pitch if they share a common f(0). Even when the acoustic energy at f(0) is removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived. Despite its importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds with the same f(0), providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy. These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent imaging studies in humans."

The five core COPII proteins (Sar1p, Sec23/24p, and Sec13/31p) act in concert to capture cargo proteins and sculpt the ER membrane into vesicles of defined geometry. The molecular details of how the coat proteins deform the lipid bilayer into vesicles are not known. Here we show that the small GTPase Sar1p directly initiates membrane curvature during vesicle biogenesis. Upon GTP binding by Sar1p, membrane insertion of the N-terminal amphipathic alpha helix deforms synthetic liposomes into narrow tubules. Replacement of bulky hydrophobic residues in the alpha helix with alanine yields Sar1p mutants that are unable to generate highly curved membranes and are defective in vesicle formation from native ER membranes despite normal recruitment of coat and cargo proteins. Thus, the initiation of vesicle budding by Sar1p couples the generation of membrane curvature with coat-protein assembly and cargo capture."

https://openalex.org/W2090004442,"Wetlands are the largest natural source of atmospheric methane, the second most important greenhouse gas. Methane flux to the atmosphere depends strongly on the climate; however, by far the largest part of the methane formed in wetland ecosystems is recycled and does not reach the atmosphere. The biogeochemical controls on the efficient oxidation of methane are still poorly understood. Here we show that submerged Sphagnum mosses, the dominant plants in some of these habitats, consume methane through symbiosis with partly endophytic methanotrophic bacteria, leading to highly effective in situ methane recycling. Molecular probes revealed the presence of the bacteria in the hyaline cells of the plant and on stem leaves. Incubation with (13)C-methane showed rapid in situ oxidation by these bacteria to carbon dioxide, which was subsequently fixed by Sphagnum, as shown by incorporation of (13)C-methane into plant sterols. In this way, methane acts as a significant (10-15%) carbon source for Sphagnum. The symbiosis explains both the efficient recycling of methane and the high organic carbon burial in these wetland ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2050733310,"Studies on various forms of synaptic plasticity have shown a link between messenger RNA translation, learning and memory. Like memory, synaptic plasticity includes an early phase that depends on modification of pre-existing proteins, and a late phase that requires transcription and synthesis of new proteins. Activation of postsynaptic targets seems to trigger the transcription of plasticity-related genes. The new mRNAs are either translated in the soma or transported to synapses before translation. GCN2, a key protein kinase, regulates the initiation of translation. Here we report a unique feature of hippocampal slices from GCN2(-/-) mice: in CA1, a single 100-Hz train induces a strong and sustained long-term potentiation (late LTP or L-LTP), which is dependent on transcription and translation. In contrast, stimulation that elicits L-LTP in wild-type slices, such as four 100-Hz trains or forskolin, fails to evoke L-LTP in GCN2(-/-) slices. This aberrant synaptic plasticity is mirrored in the behaviour of GCN2(-/-) mice in the Morris water maze: after weak training, their spatial memory is enhanced, but it is impaired after more intense training. Activated GCN2 stimulates mRNA translation of ATF4, an antagonist of cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB). Thus, in the hippocampus of GCN2(-/-) mice, the expression of ATF4 is reduced and CREB activity is increased. Our study provides genetic, physiological, behavioural and molecular evidence that GCN2 regulates synaptic plasticity, as well as learning and memory, through modulation of the ATF4/CREB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2024005016,"Inducible hepatic porphyrias are inherited genetic disorders of enzymes of heme biosynthesis. The main clinical manifestations are acute attacks of neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently precipitated by drugs, hormones, or fasting, associated with increased urinary excretion of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Acute attacks are treated by heme infusion and glucose administration, but the mechanisms underlying the precipitating effects of fasting and the beneficial effects of glucose are unknown. We show that the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic heme biosynthesis, 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-1), is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha). Elevation of PGC-1alpha in mice via adenoviral vectors increases the levels of heme precursors in vivo as observed in acute attacks. The induction of ALAS-1 by fasting is lost in liver-specific PGC-1alpha knockout animals, as is the ability of porphyrogenic drugs to dysregulate heme biosynthesis. These data show that PGC-1alpha links nutritional status to heme biosynthesis and acute hepatic porphyria."

This work also underscores the fundamental similarity of cell-cycle oscillations in embryos to repetitive action potentials in pacemaker neurons, with both systems relying on a combination of negative and positive-feedback loops. The cell cycles of Xenopus laevis embryos provide a particularly striking example of a robust biological oscillator. The cycles of Cdc2 (also termed Cdk1) activation and inactivation in an embryo are rapid and quasisynchronous, with limited embryo-to-embryo variability. In addition, the cycles persist with relatively normal timing and amplitude even when cell-cycle endpoints like DNA replication and spindle assembly are blocked or when embryos are enucleated (Hara et al., 1980Hara K.

These observations gave rise to the view that the embryonic cell cycle is driven by an autonomous, modular, clock-like regulatory circuit centered on Cdc2 and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC, also termed the cyclosome) (Morgan, 1997Morgan D.O.

It has been of great interest to try to understand the design principles of the Cdc2/APC oscillator. In broad outline, the Cdc2/APC network is fairly well understood (Figure 1A ). Entry into mitosis is driven by the synthesis and gradual accumulation of cyclin B (Evans et al., 1983Evans T. Rosenthal E.T. Youngblom J. Distel D. Hunt T.

Suppl. 1989; 12: 77-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopus embryos, the rate of cyclin synthesis establishes the period of the cycle; embryos injected with additional cyclin B mRNA cycle faster than control embryos (Hartley et al., 1996Hartley R.S.

The accumulating cyclin B binds to the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2, and, under the proper circumstances, this complex becomes activated and phosphorylates mitotic substrates, driving the transition from interphase to mitosis. The transition from mitosis back to interphase is driven by a negative-feedback loop. Active cyclin B-Cdc2 brings about the activation of the APC, which results in the polyubiquitylation and proteolysis of cyclin (Hershko et al., 1994Hershko A. Ganoth D. Sudakin V. Dahan A. Cohen L.H.

Although the presence of a negative-feedback loop does not guarantee sustained oscillations of Cdc2 and APC activity, it is difficult to imagine an oscillator that does not contain a negative-feedback loop. Indeed, when APC-resistant cyclin mutants are added to interphase Xenopus egg extracts, the extracts approach a steady state of Cdc2 activity rather than oscillating (Murray et al., 1989Murray A.W. Solomon M.J. Kirschner M.W. The role of cyclin synthesis and degradation in the control of maturation promoting factor activity.Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). This implies that the negative-feedback loop is essential for mitotic oscillations. In some circumstances, a long negative-feedback loop by itself is sufficient to produce oscillations (Goldbeter, 1991Goldbeter A.

Computational approaches to cellular rhythms.Nature. 2002; 420: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, the Cdc2/APC system contains additional circuit elements: along with the negative-feedback loop, there is a positive-feedback loop and a double-negative-feedback loop centered on cyclin B-Cdc2 (Figure 1A). Active Cdc2 brings about the phosphorylation and activation of its activator, the phosphatase Cdc25 (Hoffmann et al., 1993Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G.

A model for a bistable biochemical trigger of mitosis.Biophys. Chem. 1996; 57: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and recent experimental studies have established that the steady-state response of Cdc2 to constant concentrations of nondegradable cyclin is in fact bistable, with a hysteretic steady-state stimulus/response relationship (Cross et al., 2002Cross F.R.

USA. 2003; 100: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Bistability may ensure that the Cdc2 system cannot rest in a state of intermediate activity. Above a critical concentration of nondegradable cyclin, the system will approach a high-Cdc2-activity, mitotic state; below some other (lower) critical concentration, the system will approach a low-Cdc2-activity, interphase state; and at intermediate cyclin concentrations, the system will approach either the mitotic-like state or the interphase-like state, depending upon the initial conditions, but cannot settle in a state with a partially activated pool of Cdc2. The bistability of Cdc2 activation is believed to help establish discrete M phase and interphase states and to minimize chatter during the transition from interphase to M phase; once M phase has been attained, the system will remain in M phase even if the cyclin concentration dips below the original threshold for M phase entry. Here we explore the relationship between bistability, which is a steady-state property of the isolated positive-feedback loops, and the dynamical properties of the whole Cdc2/APC system. We begin with computational studies, using a reasonably realistic ordinary differential equation model for the Cdc2/APC system, to define the circumstances under which positive feedback is important for oscillations. We then experimentally test the importance of positive feedback through two approaches. First, we supplement cycling Xenopus egg extracts with modest concentrations of Cdc2AF. Cdc2AF is not subject to phosphorylation by Wee1 and Myt1 or dephosphorylation by Cdc25 and therefore short-circuits the normal positive-feedback system (Jin et al., 1998Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. Nuclear localization of cyclin B1 controls mitotic entry after DNA damage.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, Krek and Nigg, 1991Krek W. Nigg E.A.

Blow J. Nurse P. Regulatory phosphorylation of the p34cdc2 protein kinase in vertebrates.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Second, we block the activation of endogenous Cdc2 with a constitutively active form of Wee1 (Wee1-OP11), forcing cycles to be driven solely by Cdc2AF. Our findings support the view that the Cdc2/APC system functions as a relaxation oscillator, or “integrate-and-fire” oscillator, with positive feedback being essential for sustained oscillations. We began by examining the relationship between bistability, which is a steady-state property of one subcircuit of the Cdc2/APC network, and the dynamical properties of the complete Cdc2/APC system. We explored this issue computationally, using an ordinary differential equation model of the Cdc2/APC system. Our model is similar in many ways to the Novak-Tyson model, which was proposed more than a decade ago (Novak and Tyson, 1993Novak B. Tyson J.J. Numerical analysis of a comprehensive model of M-phase control in Xenopus oocyte extracts and intact embryos.J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1153-1168PubMed Google Scholar) and refined subsequently (Marlovits et al., 1998Marlovits G. Tyson C.J. Novak B. Tyson J.J. Modeling M-phase control in Xenopus oocyte extracts: the surveillance mechanism for unreplicated DNA.Biophys. Chem. 1998; 72: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Novak-Tyson model and the one used here differ mainly in the assumed sources of ultrasensitivity. A detailed description of the model can be found in the Supplemental Data. Our basic approach was to parameterize the model with rate constants and protein concentrations that yielded both bistability (in the modeled steady-state activity of Cdc2 as a function of cyclin concentration in the absence of cyclin degradation) and sustained oscillations (in the modeled dynamical activity of Cdc2 in response to constantly synthesized, degradable cyclin B). We then systematically varied a parameter critical for bistability. For the computations presented here, the parameter chosen was the strength of the feedback from Cdc2 to Wee1 and Cdc25 (denoted f in Figures 1B, 1G, 1L, and 1Q). From these computations, we could determine if there was a connection between the presence of a bistable steady-state response and an oscillatory dynamical response. Initially we assumed that cyclin synthesis and destruction were slow compared to the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Cdc2, Wee1, Cdc25, Plx1, and the APC. This assumption is unrealistic, but it simplifies the analysis of the system and provides a starting point for further analysis. Under this assumption, the system should always stay close to the steady-state stimulus/response curve, where the steady-state stimulus/response relationship (Figure 1B) defines the dynamical cyclin/Cdc2 phase plot of the oscillator (Figure 1C). Thus, if the system begins with no cyclin and cyclin synthesis exceeds cyclin destruction (as is true in Xenopus egg extracts that are just beginning to cycle), the activity of Cdc2 will climb along the lower curve of the steady-state stimulus/response relationship (Figures 1C and 1D, segments 0 and 1). Once the concentration of cyclin exceeds a threshold, the lower curve disappears and the system snaps to the upper curve (Figures 1C and 1D, segment 2). At this M phase level of Cdc2 activity, we assume that the APC becomes activated and the rate of cyclin destruction exceeds that of cyclin synthesis. The system will progress down the upper curve (Figures 1C and 1D, segment 3) until it reaches the lower threshold, whereupon the system snaps back to the lower curve (Figures 1C and 1D, segment 4) and the second cycle begins (Figures 1C and 1D, segment 1). Thus, in the limit of slow cyclin synthesis and destruction, the oscillations in Cdc2 activity arise because the system travels around a hysteretic stimulus/response curve. Next we considered what would happen if the positive feedback were weaker. For modest decreases in the feedback strength (f), the hysteresis loop becomes smaller (Figure 1G), and the amplitude of the oscillations decreases (Figures 1H and 1I). Once the positive feedback is weakened below some critical level, the bistable, hysteretic stimulus/response relationship collapses into a monostable relationship, and the discontinuities in the stimulus/response curve are lost (Figures 1L and 1Q). At the same critical feedback strength, the oscillations disappear (Figures 1M, 1N, 1R, and 1S). Therefore, in the limit of slow cyclin synthesis and destruction, the connection between bistability in the steady-state responses and oscillations in the dynamical responses is simple: oscillations will be present if and only if bistability is present. Thus far, we have assumed that cyclin synthesis and destruction are quite slow compared to the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions for Cdc2, Wee1, Cdc25, Plx1, and the APC. In actuality, the timescales for the various processes are comparable. As the timescale for cyclin synthesis and destruction becomes increasingly less separable from the timescale of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the phase-plane orbit becomes increasingly different from the steady-state stimulus/response curve (see Figure S2). For realistic rates of cyclin synthesis and destruction, the model predicts substantial overshoots and undershoots in the orbit of the system around the steady-state hysteresis loop (Figure 1E). These include an overshoot of segment 2 since an appreciable amount of cyclin will be synthesized while the system switches toward the upper curve, an undershoot of segment 3 since some cyclin destruction will occur as the system approaches the mitotic leg of the stimulus/response curve, and an overshoot of segment 4 because cyclin destruction will continue while Cdc2 and the APC switch off. The exact size and shape of the phase-plane orbit depend upon the particular response functions and kinetic parameters assumed in the model. However, the general prediction of overshoots and undershoots is quite robust. The overshoots and undershoots correspond to phase shifts in the relationship between Cdc2 activity and APC activity, and they add a sort of momentum that can allow the Cdc2/APC system to oscillate in the absence of bistability. This is illustrated in Figures 1L, 1O, and 1P. At this assumed level of feedback strength (f = 5), the steady-state response is monostable but still highly ultrasensitive. The system does not oscillate in the limit of slow cyclin synthesis and destruction (Figures 1M and 1N), but it does oscillate for more realistic rates of cyclin synthesis and destruction (Figures 1O and 1P). Thus, the requirement for bistability is relaxed here. Lowering the feedback strength even further (f = 2) changes the sustained oscillations into a damped approach to a stable steady state (Figures 1Q, 1T, and 1U) even at realistic rates of cyclin synthesis and destruction. Note that the exact feedback strength at which the transition from sustained to damped oscillations occurs depends upon the parameters (rate constants and concentrations) assumed for the model. Indeed, it is possible to choose parameters that permit oscillations in the absence of positive feedback (data not shown). In summary, in the limit of slow cyclin synthesis and destruction, bistability is strictly required for oscillations. At more realistic rates of cyclin synthesis and destruction, this requirement is relaxed; phase delays in the negative-feedback loop may allow the Cdc2/APC system to oscillate in the absence of a bistable steady-state response (compare Figures 1N and 1P). Conversely, positive feedback may allow the system to oscillate when the phase delays in the negative feedback alone would not (compare Figures 1P and 1U). To test these concepts and determine how important positive feedback is for oscillations in cycling Xenopus egg extracts, we experimentally determined how closely the oscillator’s orbit in the Cdc2-cyclin phase plane corresponded to the previously determined hysteretic steady-state relationship (Pomerening et al., 2003Pomerening J.R.

Hysteresis drives cell-cycle transitions in Xenopus laevis egg extracts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Cycling Xenopus egg extracts were prepared, [35S]methionine was added to label newly synthesized proteins, and aliquots were taken every 2 min to determine cyclin levels (by p13 agarose precipitation) and Cdc2 activities (by histone H1 kinase assay) over one full cell cycle. As shown in Figure 1V, cyclin levels rose through the first 80 min of the cycle and then fell by 90% over the next 10 min. Cdc2 activity rose gradually for 75 min, rose more sharply over the next 10 min, peaked just after nuclear-envelope breakdown, and then fell by 70% over the next 10 min. These data agree well with less detailed time-course studies from a number of other laboratories (Gabrielli et al., 1992Gabrielli B.G. Roy L.M. Gautier J. Philippe M. Maller J.L.

Plotting these same data in the phase-plane representation showed that the cycle of cyclin synthesis/destruction and Cdc2 activation/inactivation defines a large loop (Figure 1W). The cyclin concentration on the right side of the loop was about 6.6-fold higher than that on the left side of the loop (Figure 1W). This is substantially larger than the difference between the on threshold and off threshold in the steady-state stimulus/response relationship, which was never greater than a factor of 2 or 3 (Figure S1 and Pomerening et al., 2003Pomerening J.R.

Hysteresis drives cell-cycle transitions in Xenopus laevis egg extracts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, the orbit of the dynamic cyclin/Cdc2 system appears to be substantially wider than the steady-state hysteresis loop, with significant overshoots. The observed orbit is in reasonable agreement with modeled orbits (Figures 1E and 1J), which suggests that both positive feedback (which could ensure oscillations even at low rates of cyclin synthesis) and phase delays in the negative feedback (as evinced by the overshoots of the steady-state hysteresis loop) contribute to the robustness of the cell-cycle oscillator. However, the size of the overshoots leaves open the possibility that positive feedback is not essential for Cdc2 oscillations; the system might function as a negative-feedback oscillator (Goldbeter, 1991Goldbeter A.

Numerical analysis of a comprehensive model of M-phase control in Xenopus oocyte extracts and intact embryos.J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1153-1168PubMed Google Scholar), with the positive-feedback loops dispensable for oscillations. We next sought to determine how important positive feedback is for oscillations in cycling extracts. Our first approach was to supplement extracts with recombinant FLAG-tagged Cdc2AF, which has the two inhibitory phosphorylation sites (Thr14 and Tyr15) changed to nonphosphorylatable residues. These mutations render Cdc2AF impervious to phosphorylation by Wee1 and Myt1, breaking the Cdc2/Wee1/Myt1/Cdc25 positive-feedback loop. Control extracts were supplemented with wild-type recombinant FLAG-Cdc2 (hereafter denoted Cdc2wt). The maximum concentration of exogenous Cdc2wt or Cdc2AF that was practical to add was 200 nM, compared with an estimated concentration of 230 nM for endogenous Cdc2 (data not shown). Assuming that Cdc2wt and Cdc2AF have similar maximal specific activities, the exogenous Cdc2wt or Cdc2AF should increase the maximal level of Cdc2 activity by 87%. We checked this estimate by adding near-saturating concentrations of cyclin (400–500 nM) to control extracts or extracts supplemented with 200 nM Cdc2wt or Cdc2AF and assessing the resulting steady-state levels of Cdc2 activity. The resulting maximal Cdc2 activities were 50%–90% above those seen with no added Cdc2 (Figure S3), confirming that we were able to achieve a modest perturbation of Cdc2 activity. This modest perturbation of Cdc2 activity markedly altered the dynamics of cell-cycle progression and Cdc2 oscillations (Figure 2). Despite the inevitable variations from extract to extract (e.g., extract #4 was slower than extract #1; Figures 2A and 2E) and from cycle to cycle (e.g., the second peak of H1 kinase activity appeared to be anomalously low in the 200 nM wt sample of extract #2; Figure 2E), several clear differences between the Cdc2wt- and Cdc2AF-treated extracts were apparent. First, the Cdc2AF-treated extracts cycled more rapidly than the Cdc2wt-treated extracts. A total of 15 rounds of mitosis were observed in the four extracts treated with Cdc2AF versus a total of 10 rounds in the four Cdc2wt-treated extracts (Figure 2A). The overall shortening of the cycles in the Cdc2AF-treated extracts occurred despite a lengthening of M phase (Figure 2B), implying that the interphases were substantially shortened in the CdcAF-treated extracts, particularly the second and third interphases (Figure 2B). The shortening of interphase was dose-dependent: 50 nM and 100 nM Cdc2AF had less effect than 200 nM (Figure 2C). There were also qualitative differences in nuclear morphology in the Cdc2AF- versus Cdc2wt-treated extracts (Figure 2D). Cdc2wt-treated extracts exhibited distinct, unmistakable interphase periods during which nuclei formed and then enlarged (e.g., Figure 2D, Cdc2wt-treated, 80–120 min). The transitions out of M phase were sometimes more difficult to discern in the Cdc2AF-treated extracts; the newly forming nuclei did not get much chance to coalesce, grow, and smooth out before the next round of mitosis ensued (e.g., Figure 2D, Cdc2AF-treated, 170–195 min). Next we examined detailed time courses of histone H1 kinase activities in the Cdc2wt- and Cdc2AF-treated extracts. Cdc2 activation was more gradual and less explosive in the Cdc2AF-treated extracts (Figures 2E and 2F). Cdc2 inactivation was also more gradual and less complete (Figures 2E and 2F), suggesting that the dynamics of Cdc2 activation determines the extent of APC activation. Finally, the amplitudes of successive oscillations decreased, with the system damping toward a state of intermediate Cdc2 activity (Figures 2E and 2F). These findings indicate that positive feedback is important for normal sustained cycles of Cdc2 activation and inactivation. These findings also provide a plausible mechanism to explain the cell-cycle acceleration and morphological changes seen in the Cdc2AF-treated extracts. Given the shortened interphases in the Cdc2AF-treated extracts, we asked whether the early M phases resulted from accelerated DNA replication or whether DNA replication was being compromised by premature M phases. To address this question, we monitored DNA synthesis in Cdc2wt- and Cdc2AF-treated extracts. The Cdc2wt-treated extracts underwent four strong rounds of DNA synthesis, with each S phase promptly following the completion of the previous M phase (Figure 3A , left panel). The Cdc2AF-treated extracts also underwent four rounds of DNA synthesis, but its extent was diminished, particularly in the third and fourth cycles (Figure 3A, right panel). Thus, the accelerated interphases in the Cdc2AF-treated extracts were due to the altered dynamics of mitotic entry and exit rather than to an accelerated completion of DNA replication. To determine whether the damped Cdc2 oscillations and diminished DNA synthesis seen in Cdc2AF-treated extracts were simply due to the rapidity of the cell cycle, we set out to accelerate the cycles without compromising the positive-feedback loops.

In the case of c-Fos, the activation of ERK leads to an increased expression of c-fos mRNA. In turn, we have recently shown that ERK phosphorylates multiple residues within the carboxylterminal transactivation domain (TAD) of c-Fos, thus resulting in its increased transcriptional activity. However, how ERK-dependent phosphorylation regulates c-Fos function is still poorly understood. In this regard, it has been recently observed that the prolyl isomerase Pin1 can interact with proteins phosphorylated on serine or threonine residues that precede prolines (pS/T-P), such as the transcription factors p53 and c-Jun, thereby controlling their activity by promoting the cis-trans isomerization of these pS/T-P bonds. Here, we found that Pin1 binds c-Fos through specific pS/T-P sites within the c-Fos TAD, and that this interaction results in an enhanced transcriptional response of c-Fos to polypeptide growth factors that stimulate ERK. Our findings suggest that c-Fos represents a novel target for the isomerizing activity of Pin1 and support a role for Pin1 in the mechanism by which c-Jun and c-Fos can cooperate to regulate AP-1-dependent gene transcription upon phosphorylation by mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) family members.

(activating protein-1) is a dimer composed of Jun and Fos family members whose expression and activity is tightly regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serinethreonine kinases (reviewed in Refs. 1Karin M.

These kinases control the expression of AP-1, as well as its activity by the post-translational processing of preexisting or newly synthesized AP-1 proteins. For example, a critical step in the transcriptional activation of c-Jun is accomplished by the phosphorylation of a set of serines (Ser63 and Ser73) within its NH2-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) by the group of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), which in turn stimulate the expression of c-Jun by regulating the c-Jun promoter as part of a positive autoregulatory loop (1Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). A dual mechanism of control by MAPKs also operates over c-Fos, the prototypical member of the Fos family. Indeed, in the case of c-Fos, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) leads to the coordinated stimulation of c-fos expression by acting on transcription factors bound at the c-fos promoter (4Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 5Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), and the post-translational modification of c-Fos by the direct phosphorylation of the c-Fos TAD (6Chen R.H. Abate C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10952-10956Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 7Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which phosphorylation by MAPKs alters the function of these transcription factors remains not fully understood. For example, reversible phosphorylation may result in changes in the stability, nuclear localization, rate of binding to target DNA sequences, and/or the positive or negative modulation of the transactivating activity of these transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 9Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). In the latter case, it is possible that the phosphorylation of specific residues may favor the interaction with other transcription factors or with the transcriptional initiation complex, either directly or through the recruitment of co-activators. In this regard, it has been shown that c-Fos interacts with the TATA box-binding protein (10Metz R. Bannister A.J. Sutherland J.A. Hagemeier C. O'Rourke E.C. Cook A. Bravo R. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell.

Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) through its COOH-terminal domain. However, there is no evidence that MAPKs regulate these or other interactions. activating protein-1 mitogen-activated kinase transactivation domain extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein amino acids fetal bovine serum dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase DNA-binding domain mutant wild-type. Recently, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 has emerged as a novel phosphorylation-dependent regulator of key transcription factors, including p53, NF-κB, NFAT, and c-Jun (reviewed in Refs. 12Shaw P.E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and 13Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Pin1 interacts with its substrates through the recognition of specific phosphorylated serine or threonine residues adjacent to prolines (pS/T-P motifs). Its primary function is to promote conformational changes by facilitating the cis-trans isomerization of these peptide bonds (13Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, substrates of proline-directed protein kinases, such as the MAPK and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family members, may represent likely targets for Pin1 function. This prompted us to investigate whether Pin1 regulates AP-1-mediated transcription. We found that, along with its effects on c-Jun, Pin1 contributes to the activation of AP-1 by interacting directly with c-Fos. This interaction is dependent upon the phosphorylation of c-Fos by ERK on a set of recently identified COOH-terminal phosphoacceptor sites (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Overall, our findings suggest that c-Fos represents a relevant target for the isomerizing activity of Pin1 and support a role for Pin1 as part of the underlying molecular mechanism by which MAPKs regulate c-Jun and c-Fos thereby promoting AP-1-dependent transcription.

DNA Constructs—The full-length Pin1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned as a BamHI/NotI fragment in pGEX-4T3 in frame with the coding sequence for the GST gene to produce a GST-Pin1 fusion protein in bacteria or in the pCEFL-GFP vector to express in mammalian cells as a GFP-Pin1 fusion protein. The expression vectors for c-Fos and c-Fos-m (aa 1–380) in pCEFL-AU5, and the Gal4- and polyhistidine (His6)-tagged c-Fos TAD-wt (aa 209–380), TAD-m, and TAD mutants containing single phosphorylation sites were described previously (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The expression vectors pCEV29-MEK EE, pCEFL-HA-ERK2, pCEFL-c-Jun, and the Gal4-driven luciferase reporter, pGal4-Luc, were also described previously (16Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol.

Cell Cultures and Transient Transfections—NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Invitrogen). HEK-293T cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were transfected for 3 h in serum-free DMEM containing up to 2 μg of total plasmid DNA together with the Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at low speed. The resulting nuclei (pellet) were disrupted with extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT). Cell debris was separated by low speed centrifugation and nuclei aliquots (50 μg) were subjected to GST pull-down assays. Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with different expression vectors together with 0.1 μg of each luciferase reporter and 0.01 μg of pRL-null (a plasmid encoding the luciferase gene from Renilla reniformis) that served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was normalized with pcDNAIII-β-gal, an expression vector for the enzyme β-galactosidase. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) 24 h post-transfection. Cell lysates (50 μl/well) were transferred to a 96-well plate and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega). Light emission was quantified using a Microliter Plate luminometer as specified by the manufacturer (Dynex Tech, Chantilly, VA). GST Pull-down Assays—Cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Precleared cell lysates were incubated with fresh GST or GST-Pin beads (2 μg of protein) for1hat4°C.The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, denatured in SDS-loading buffer (400 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 500 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml bromphenol blue), and analyzed by Western blot. To prepare the GST beads, Escherichia coli BL-21 Lys cells (Promega) were transformed with the vectors pGEX-4T3 or pGEX-4T3-Pin1 encoding for GST and GST-Pin1 proteins, respectively. Protein expression and purification were performed essentially as described previously (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of His6-c-Fos TAD Fusion Proteins—His6-tagged proteins were isolated using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) as described previously (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The kinase reactions were performed in 12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 m m sodium vanadate, containing 20 μm unlabeled ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg of substrate. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of purified active ERK2 and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C before assaying the products in GST pull-down experiments. Western Blots and Immunoprecipitations—For co-immunoprecipitations, cellular lysates were incubated with for1hat4°C with the specific antibody against AU5. Immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of γ-bind Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates or lysates were combined with SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were incubated with 5% nonfat-dried milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then with dilutions of the respective primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (ICN-Cappel) in PBS-T, 1% bovine serum albumin. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL+Plus System, Amersham Biosciences). Pin1 Potentiates AP-1 Activity by Increasing the Transcriptional Response of c-Fos and c-Jun to Growth Factors: a Novel Interaction between Pin1 and c-Fos—To explore the possibility that Pin1-directed prolyl isomerization of AP-1 factors controls the response of AP-1 to mitogenic signals, we examined whether Pin1 could affect the expression of an AP-1-driven luciferase reporter plasmid in response to PDGF in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, PDGF significantly induced AP-1 transcription in these cells, and increasing concentrations of ectopically expressed Pin1 enhanced the basal AP-1 activity as well as the transcriptional response to this growth factor in a dose-dependent manner. To begin addressing the mechanism whereby Pin1 stimulates AP-1, we next examined the effect of Pin1 on the transactivating function of c-Jun and c-Fos. As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of c-Jun or c-Fos increased AP-1-dependent transcription and potentiated the AP-1 transcriptional response provoked by PDGF. This was enhanced by the co-expression of Pin1, which elevated the basal AP-1 stimulating activity of c-Jun and c-Fos, as well as increased dramatically their response to PDGF. Thus, Pin1 appears to regulate the transactivating activity of both members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors. Based on these observations, we then asked whether Pin1 may interact with c-Fos. For these experiments, we first generated a bacterial expression vector encoding a GST fusion protein of Pin1 and then used purified GST-Pin1 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to pull down c-Fos from nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 cells stimulated with PDGF. As expected, PDGF promoted the expression of c-Fos (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the results from the pull-down assays indicated that Pin1 effectively binds to newly synthesized c-Fos proteins, thus providing a molecular explanation to the ability of Pin1 to stimulate the activation of AP-1 by c-Fos. The Interaction of c-Fos and Pin1 Depends on c-Fos Phosphorylation—As the ability of Pin1 to associate to its substrates involves the recognition of specific phosphorylated motifs (14Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 15Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the interaction of c-Fos with Pin1 was dependent on the status of c-Fos phosphorylation. Of interest, in a previous study we have observed that exposure of NIH 3T3 cells to PDGF or serum leads to c-Fos phosphorylation by ERK on specific residues, Thr232, Thr325, Thr331, and Ser374, within the COOH-terminal c-Fos TAD (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we transiently overexpressed c-Fos from a constitutively active promoter, EF1, in NIH 3T3 cells and performed GST-Pin1 pull-down assays in total lysates from cells subjected to conditions that promote c-Fos phosphorylation. In fact, as shown in Fig. 2A (left lanes) Pin1 was able to strongly interact with the phosphorylated forms of c-Fos (slower migrating bands) generated by the stimulation with serum or PDGF and much weaker with c-Fos proteins from non-stimulated cells. Moreover, the interaction Fos-Pin1 was reduced dramatically when using a mutant c-Fos protein where all sites for ERK phosphorylation were replaced by alanine residues (c-Fos-m) (Fig. 2A, right lanes). To confirm that c-Fos can interact with Pin in vivo, we expressed the AU5-tagged c-Fos and c-Fos-m together with a GFP-tagged Pin in HEK-293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, low levels of GFP-Pin1 were already detected in c-Fos immunoprecipitates in these cells, reflecting a partial phosphorylated status of c-Fos when overexpressed in HEK-293T cells. A brief exposure to EGF provoked a substantial increase in the level of Pin1 co-immunoprecipiated with c-Fos. In contrast, no co-immunoprecipation of Pin1 was detectable in cells expressing c-Fos-m even after EGF stimulation. In this regard, we have previously shown that this mutant form of c-Fos cannot be phosphorylated by ERK and therefore is impaired in its transcriptional response to ERK-dependent signals (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The availability of this mutant provided an opportunity to examine whether c-Fos phosphorylation was required for the effect of Pin1 on the transcriptional response of c-Fos. Fig. 2C shows that this c-Fos-m exhibits a diminished transcriptional response to Pin1, likely reflecting their decreased interaction, and it fails to stimulate AP-1-dependent transcription as potently as the wild-type c-Fos when stimulated by PDGF. Together, these results suggest that the specific phosphorylation of a subset of residues within the c-Fos TAD is critical for the interaction between Pin1 and c-Fos and that this association may contribute to the enhanced transcriptional activity of c-Fos upon phosphorylation by ERK in response to growth factors. The COOH-terminal TAD of c-Fos Mediates c-Fos Interaction with Pin: Role for the Phosphorylation of Specific S/T-P Sites—To confirm the requirement of c-Fos phosphorylation by ERK in the interaction between Pin1 and c-Fos, we forced the accumulation of phosphorylated species of c-Fos, which are readily detectable by SDS-PAGE as electrophoretically bands of apparent higher molecular weight, by transiently overexpressing c-Fos together with ERK2 and MEK EE, a constitutively active form of MEK1 that renders ERK2 permanently active. Fig. 3A shows that Pin1 preferentially binds to c-Fos when c-Fos is phosphorylated by ERK in vivo. Moreover, the interaction of c-Fos with Pin1 was decreased to basal levels when the c-Fos-m protein was assayed for its ability to interact with Pin under similar conditions (Fig. 3A). As it is still possible that c-Fos might bind to Pin1 indirectly, for example by binding to Jun proteins, we decided to explore whether Pin1 can bind to the c-Fos TAD in vitro. To this end, we performed GST-Pin pull-down assays using a purified preparation of bacterially expressed His6-tagged forms of the c-Fos COOH-terminal TAD (Fig. 3B). Of interest, we first observed that the purified c-Fos TAD fusion protein was unable to interact with Pin1. However, a stable interaction between these two proteins was readily detectable when the c-Fos TAD was phosphorylated by activated ERK2 in vitro prior to assaying for its ability to bind Pin1 (Fig. 3C). Aligned with this finding, no detectable interaction was observed when an equivalent amount of c-Fos-TAD-m (c-Fos-m in Fig. 3B) was used as a Pin1 target, even in the presence of purified activated ERK2. These observations confirmed that Pin1 can bind directly to c-Fos and demonstrated that the COOH-terminal domain of c-Fos (aa 209–380) is itself sufficient to mediate this interaction, provided that it is first phosphorylated by ERK. To study the contribution of each potential ERK phosphorylation site on the c-Fos TAD to the interaction between Pin1 and c-Fos, we generated mutant forms of the c-Fos TAD in which all ERK phosphoacceptor sites were first mutated to alanine, and then each site was re-introduced individually (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), as depicted in Fig. 3B. Using this add-back approach, we have observed that each of these serines or threonines are independent in vitro targets for the enzymatic activity of ERK2 but that are all required for the transcriptional responsiveness of the c-Fos TAD to extracellular signals (8Monje P. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7030-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The results from Fig. 3C indicate that the phosphorylation of individual sites by ERK was not sufficient to support its binding to Pin1, suggesting that the concerted phosphorylation of multiple sites on c-Fos are required to promote its interaction with Pin1. Pin1 Stimulates c-Fos Activity through Its Actions on the Phosphorylated c-Fos TAD—Based on these observations, we set out to investigate whether the TAD of c-Fos was the direct target of Pin1 function leading to changes in c-Fos-initiated transcription. For these experiments, we examined the effect of Pin1 on a Gal4 reporter system where the TAD of c-Fos is expressed as a fusion protein in frame with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transcription factor Gal4, and the activity of this chimera is assessed by its ability to stimulate transcription from a Gal4-regulated luciferase reporter plasmid (pGal4-Luc). Pin1 did not stimulate the basal activity of the Gal4-DBD at any of the concentrations tested (data not shown) but, as shown in Fig. 4A, synergistically cooperated with PDGF to further increase the transactivating function of the c-Fos TAD. Conversely, the fusion protein Gal4-c-Fos-TAD-m, containing alanine replacements in all potential ERK sites, failed to respond to Pin1 with an increase in transactivation after PDGF stimulation (Fig. 4B), all of which support the direct function of Pin1 on the activity of the c-Fos TAD upon its phosphorylation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the prolyl isomerization of phosphorylated S/T-P peptide bonds on c-Fos by Pin1 may represent a novel regulatory step controlling c-Fos activity. In this regard, it is tempting to speculate that this process may contribute to a switch between a low and high level of transcriptional activity of the c-Fos TAD, as a change in its conformation may enable c-Fos to interact with novel molecular partners, leading to changes in its ability to promote expression from AP-1 sites. Furthermore, these observations provide also a molecular mechanism by which growth factors that stimulate ERK may ultimately control the activity of c-Fos and AP-1 dependent transcription. In this scenario, the activation of ERK by ligands acting on cell surface receptors, such as those exhibiting an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, may promote the expression of c-Fos and the concerted phosphorylation of specific S/T-P motifs within the c-Fos TAD that result in the recruitment of Pin1, which may then change their conformation thus reversibly triggering a number of subsequent protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, co-activators, or components of the transcriptional machinery. Although further work will be required to investigate the consequences of Pin1 action on phosphorylated c-Fos TAD, these findings may provide a new insight into the still poorly understood mechanisms by which activation of members of the MAPK family regulate the fate and activity of nuclear transcription factors, thereby ultimately controlling gene expression."

The BH3-only members of this family act as sentinels, interconnecting specific death signals to the core apoptotic pathway. Our previous data demonstrated a role for BH3-only BID in maintaining myeloid homeostasis and suppressing leukemogenesis. In the absence of Bid, mice accumulate chromosomal aberrations and develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Here, we describe a role for BID in preserving genomic integrity that places BID at an early point in the path to determine the fate of a cell. We show that BID plays an unexpected role in the intra-S phase checkpoint downstream of DNA damage distinct from its proapoptotic function. We further demonstrate that this role is mediated through BID phosphorylation by the DNA-damage kinase ATM. These results establish a link between proapoptotic Bid and the DNA-damage response.

We further demonstrate that this role is mediated through BID phosphorylation by the DNA-damage kinase ATM. These results establish a link between proapoptotic Bid and the DNA-damage response. The BCL-2 family of proteins is predominantly situated upstream of irreversible cellular damage in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (reviewed in Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: Critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar). Pro- as well as antiapoptotic members contribute to apoptotic susceptibility and the predisposition to cancer. The BH3-only proapoptotic members connect specific proximal death signals with the multidomain proapoptotic molecules BAX and BAK that serve as an obligate gateway to apoptotic death. The multidomain antiapoptotic members bind and sequester BH3-only molecules to protect from activation of BAX, BAK as one mechanism of preventing death. The BH3-only member BID serves the unique function of interconnecting the extrinsic death receptors for TNFα and Fas to the mitochondrial amplification loop of the intrinsic pathway. In a resting cell, BID is predominantly cytoplasmic. Following TNFα or Fas treatment, BID is cleaved by caspase 8 in an unstructured loop, exposing a new amino terminal glycine residue, which becomes myristoylated, facilitating its translocation to the mitochondria (Zha et al., 2000Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Posttranslational N-myristoylation of BID as a molecular switch for targeting mitochondria and apoptosis.Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Activated BH3-only proteins such as caspase-truncated BID (tBID) either directly or indirectly activate BAX and BAK, which are required for the release of cytochrome c and the downstream apoptotic program. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) doubly deficient in BAX and BAK are resistant to apoptosis induced by treatment with DNA-damaging agents, such as etoposide and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (Wei et al., 2001Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death.Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). Several BH3-only proteins, namely Noxa and Puma have been implicated as upstream regulators of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Noxa responds to p53-dependent apoptosis following etoposide and UV-induced DNA damage. Noxa-deficient intestinal crypt cells but not thymocytes are resistant to high doses of ionizing radiation (IR; Shibue et al., 2003Shibue T. Takeda K. Oda E. Tanaka H. Murasawa H. Takaoka A. Morishita Y. Akira S. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Integral role of Noxa in p53-mediated apoptotic response.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2233-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Puma plays a role in thymocyte apoptosis following IR and etoposide treatments (Villunger et al., 2003Villunger A. Michalak E.M. Coultas L. Mullauer F. Bock G. Ausserlechner M.J. Adams J.M. Strasser A. p53- and drug-induced apoptotic responses mediated by BH3-only proteins puma and noxa.Science. 2003; 302: 1036-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The role of BID in normal development and cellular homeostasis has been characterized using mice in which Bid has been disrupted. When challenged with lethal doses of agonistic anti-Fas antibody, mice without BID are resistant to the ensuing Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis, indicating a critical role for a BID-dependent mitochondrial amplification loop in this liver cell death (Yin et al., 1999Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Bid-deficient mice are resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis.Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Despite this dramatic phenotype, Bid−/− mice successfully complete embryonic development and their livers appear grossly normal. However, as they age, Bid−/− mice spontaneously develop a myeloproliferative disorder that progresses to a fatal disease resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). This indicates an essential role for BID in maintaining myeloid homeostasis and suppressing leukemogenesis (Zinkel et al., 2003Zinkel S.S. Ong C.C. Ferguson D.O. Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Bronson R.T. Kutok J.L. Alt F.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BID is required for myeloid homeostasis and tumor suppression.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A critical question is how BID is involved in suppressing oncogenesis. While the loss of BID could theoretically reset death susceptibility in both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, it is less obvious why the absence of BID should prove so oncogenic. A striking feature of the BID-deficient CMML is the frequent presence of genomic instability as evidenced by chromosomal translocation (Zinkel et al., 2003Zinkel S.S. Ong C.C. Ferguson D.O. Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Bronson R.T. Kutok J.L. Alt F.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BID is required for myeloid homeostasis and tumor suppression.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This suggests that BID might also serve a role in preserving genomic integrity. Progression to malignancy is a multistep process in which a succession of genetic changes culminates in phenotypic changes (Jacks and Weinberg, 2002Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Taking the study of cancer cell survival to a new dimension.Cell. 2002; 111: 923-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Maintenance of genomic integrity is of fundamental importance to the survival and health of an organism. DNA is highly reactive and subject to damage by multiple reagents including reactive oxygen species, methylating agents, both UV and IR as well as stochastic errors that can arise during DNA replication and recombination. Cells respond to the presence of DNA damage by activating cell cycle checkpoints and repair mechanisms, and ultimately the damaged cell is eliminated through apoptosis. The cellular response to DNA damage varies by cell type. For example, fibroblasts are relatively resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis; they prevent proliferation of mutations by entering into long-term G1 or G2 arrest (Baus et al., 2003Baus F. Gire V. Fisher D. Piette J. Dulic V. Permanent cell cycle exit in G2 phase after DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3992-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Di Leonardo et al., 1994Di Leonardo A. Linke S.P. Clarkin K. Wahl G.M. DNA damage triggers a prolonged p53-dependent G1 arrest and long-term induction of Cip1 in normal human fibroblasts.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2540-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cells are primed to undergo apoptosis following treatment with DNA-damaging agents. The signals that govern whether a cell initiates DNA repair, enters cell cycle arrest, or undergoes apoptosis and the means by which the cell integrates information from these pathways are not yet understood. Three DNA repair kinases have been identified. ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ATM and RAD3-related) and DNA-PK (reviewed in Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaccmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). The specific DNA-damage signals that activate ATM or ATR are not well defined in part due to the multiple distinct DNA lesions generated by signals such as IR, UV, and alkylating agents (Nyberg et al., 2002Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Toward maintaining the genome: DNA damage and replication checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). ATM has been reported to respond primarily to agents such as IR that generate double-strand breaks, while ATR appears to respond to agents inducing multiple types of DNA damage (Zhou and Elledge, 2000Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response: putting checkpoints in perspective.Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts deficient in ATM demonstrate increased sensitivity to IR but not to UV, alkylating agents, or inhibitors of DNA replication (Banin et al., 1998Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y.

The DNA damage response: putting checkpoints in perspective.Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). Cells expressing kinase-inactive ATR demonstrate increased sensitivity to IR, UV, cisplatin, and methyl methane sulfonate (Cliby et al., 1998Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive ATR protein causes sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and defects in cell cycle checkpoints.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). ATR is required for cell cycle regulation and phosphorylation of downstream kinases such as Chk1 in response to replication blocks and UV irradiation (Guo et al., 2000Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

Both ATM and ATR relocalize to nuclear foci following DNA damage (Andegeko et al., 2001Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mittelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22719-22727Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Bid−/− primary MEFs have been shown to be somewhat resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and adriamycin (Sax et al., 2002Sax J.K. Fei P. Murphy M.E. Bernhard E. Korsmeyer S.J. El-Deiry W.S. BID regulation by p53 contributes to chemosensitivity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), but not to UVC or etoposide (Wei et al., 2001Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death.Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). Thus, BID does not appear to play a prominent role in the apoptotic response downstream of DNA damage in fibroblasts. However, Bid−/− mice progress to a high incidence of myeloid malignancy with considerable genomic instability in that cell type. Wild-type hematopoietic cells have a marked propensity for apoptosis in response to DNA damage; yet in the absence of BID, myeloid cells accumulate mutations, resist apoptosis, and display aspects of unchecked proliferation. This suggests that BID may itself play a role in DNA repair, in cell cycle checkpoint response, or in integrating apoptosis and the DNA repair response. In this study, we describe a novel role for BID in preserving genomic integrity that places BID at an early point in the path to determine the fate of a cell. We show that BID plays an unexpected role in the intra-S phase checkpoint downstream of DNA damage. We further demonstrate that this role is mediated through BID phosphorylation by the DNA-damage kinase ATM. Bid-deficient CMMLs are clonal and display chromosomal aberrations. SKY analysis of the Bid−/− leukemia revealed chromosomal translocations and duplications (Zinkel et al., 2003Zinkel S.S. Ong C.C. Ferguson D.O. Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Bronson R.T. Kutok J.L. Alt F.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BID is required for myeloid homeostasis and tumor suppression.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, array CGH studies of multiple tumors revealed recurrent sites of chromosomal amplification (data not shown). Absence of proapoptotic BID may enable the accumulation of cells with genetic lesions and foster their survival. Alternatively, genomic instability may be intrinsic to Bid−/− cells, implicating a role for BID in a DNA-damage pathway. To investigate the function of BID in myeloid cells, we generated Hox11-immortalized premalignant myeloid progenitor cell lines (MPCs) from Bid+/+ and Bid−/− genotypes. Doses of mitomycin c that had little effect on Bid+/+ MPCs displayed a marked increase in chromosomal instability in Bid−/− MPCs. Of note, metaphase spreads from mitomycin c-treated Bid−/− MPCs displayed tri- and quadriradial chromosomal figures (Figure 1A ), quantifiable by an increase in the number of breaks per cell (Figure 1B). These abnormal chromosomal structures represent “chromatid type” errors resulting from improperly repaired DNA damage accrued during S phase of the cell cycle (Scully et al., 2000Scully R. Puget N. Vlasakova K. DNA polymerase stalling, sister chromatid recombination and the BRCA genes.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6176-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and are characteristic of cells with a defect in DNA repair, such as those in Fanconi anemia (D’Andrea, 2003D’Andrea A.D. The Fanconi road to cancer.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Bloom’s syndrome (Langland et al., 2002Langland G. Elliott J. Li Y. Creaney J. Dixon K. Groden J.

In search of the tumour-suppressor functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2.Nature. 2000; 408: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Activated peripheral T cells isolated from Bid−/− mice also display increased chromosomal instability following mitomycin c treatment (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that this increased chromosomal instability is a general feature of Bid deficiency, although it is more pronounced in myeloid cells. Cells defective in DNA repair exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (D’Andrea, 2003D’Andrea A.D. The Fanconi road to cancer.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Frei and Gasser, 2000Frei C. Gasser S.M.

Following treatment with hydroxyurea or mitomycin c, agents that induce DNA damage through replicative stress, Hox11-immortalized Bid−/− MPCs, display increased cell death (Figure 2A ). Bid−/− primary MPCs (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) and Bid−/− primary activated T cells (Figures 2B and 2C) display similarly increased mitomycin c sensitivity, confirming that the increased death response to replicative stress is not due to Hox11 immortalization and is a general feature of Bid deficiency. In contrast, there was no significant difference in viability in response to treatment with UV or IR; treatment with etoposide, an inhibitor of topoisomerase 2, resulted in a modest protection of Bid−/− MPCs from apoptosis (Figure 2A). Hydroxyurea washout experiments also revealed decreased viability of Bid−/− MPCs relative to Bid+/+ MPCs (Figure 2B). Interestingly, we find a small but significant decrease in cell viability of Bid−/− primary activated T cells in response to IR (data not shown), a cell type that is less dependent upon the BID-mediated mitochondrial amplification loop for death (Scaffidi et al., 1998Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Two CD95 (APO-1/Fas) signaling pathways.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The above data demonstrate a surprising sensitivity of cells deficient for proapoptotic BID in response to agents inducing DNA damage through replicative stress, suggesting a possible role for BID in this pathway that is distinct from its proapoptotic role. We next examined the cell cycle status of MPCs to characterize the role of Bid following replicative stress. As evidenced by propidium iodide staining, untreated Bid+/+ and Bid−/− MPCs display an identical cell cycle profile. Following treatment with aphidicolin, Bid+/+ MPCs but not Bid−/− MPCs arrest and accumulate in S phase (Figures 3A a and 3Ab), suggesting either a defect in an S phase checkpoint, a failure of Bid−/− MPCs to progress from G1 to S phase, or death of Bid−/− MPCs in S phase. The increase in Bid−/− cells possessing <2N DNA content following aphidicolin treatment (Figure 3A) suggests that these Bid−/− cells undergo increased apoptosis. The percentage of cells in S phase from multiple independent experiments is presented in Figure S3. To further investigate the fate of S phase cells following replicative stress, we labeled S phase cells with BrDU immediately prior to treatment with hydroxyurea, (see Figure S4 for a schematic of the experimental design). After 2 hr of hydroxyurea treatment, cells were washed, and cell cycle progression of BrDU-positive cells was monitored by flow cytometry. The data point at time T0 was taken at the time of hydroxyurea washout, and the gates indicate early S phase and late S/G2 as cells initially in G1 are not labeled with BrDU and thus are not included in the analysis. Immediately following hydroxyurea treatment, BrDU+ cells from Bid+/+ and Bid−/− display a similar cell cycle distribution (Figure 3B). By contrast, while at 6 hr Bid+/+ cells display some progression from early to late S phase, Bid−/− cells display a significant decrease in the number of cells in late S phase, along with an increase in cells with <2N DNA content. These data are consistent either with increased progression of Bid−/− cells through S phase relative to Bid+/+ cells, or increased death of Bid−/− cells in S phase. Taken together with the increased death seen in Bid−/− primary T cells at 6 hr after hydroxyurea treatment (Figure 2B), these data are consistent with death of Bid−/− cells progressing through S phase. To verify that this S phase phenotype is attributable to the absence of BID, we stably transduced Bid−/− MPCs with recombinant retrovirus (Figure 3D). When wild-type BID is reexpressed at the endogenous level, cells accumulate at S phase following aphidicolin treatment (Figure 3C), confirming that the absence of BID is the cause of the S phase defect in Bid−/− MPCs. The death function of proapoptotic BCL-2 family members is localized to the BH3 domain. To determine whether an intact BH3 domain is required for the BID-deficient S phase defect, Bid−/− MPCs were transduced with BID harboring various apoptosis-inactivating mutations in the BH3 domain. (Wang et al., 1996Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. BID: a novel BH3 domain-only death agonist.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) Surprisingly, expression of endogenous levels of BID with mutant BH3 domains restores S phase accumulation of Bid−/− MPCs following aphidicolin treatment (Figures 4A and 4C ). Furthermore, expression of either wild-type BID or BID with mutant BH3 domains protects Bid−/− MPCs from death in response to mitomycin c treatment, at a level comparable to that seen in Bid+/+ MPCs (Figure 4B). Therefore, a region of BID distinct from its proapoptotic BH3 domain mediates the BID’s role downstream of DNA damage induced by replicative stress. Since signaling proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints or DNA-damage response often function in the nucleus, we evaluated the subcellular localization of BID. Following treatment of wild-type MEFs with hydroxyurea or etoposide, BID localizes to the nuclei in the majority of cells (Figure 5A ). Following IR treatment, BID is seen both in the nuclei and in the mitochondria (Figure 5A). Interestingly, nuclear BID is seen in approximately 14% of untreated cells, perhaps suggesting a role for Bid in the normal cell cycle. Although the level of tagged BID protein seen by Western blot analysis is modestly increased relative to endogenous BID levels in MEFs, there is no increase following treatment with DNA-damaging agents (Figure S5), suggesting that BID’s change in subcellular localization cannot be accounted for by a change in protein level. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation of endogenous levels of BID in MPCs demonstrates an increase in BID primarily in the chromatin fraction of the nucleus following hydroxyurea treatment (Figure 5C). The apparent discrepancy in the percentage of nuclear BID after damage observed in subcellular fractionation versus immunofluorescence may be due to suboptimal recovery of BID from chromatin or loss of nuclear BID to the cytosolic fraction during fractionation. The distinct subcellular localization of BID following DNA damage suggests that the distinct functions for BID may be regulated at least in part by BID’s location in the cell. ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase) are known to be involved in the DNA repair pathway (Reviewed in Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaccmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). All three kinases display a substrate preference for serine or threonine followed by glutamine in a +1 position (Kim et al., 1999Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B.

BID has at least two ATM/ATR/DNA-PKcs consensus phosphorylation sites at residues S61 and S78 (Figure 6A ), with S78 conserved between mouse and human BID. BID is phosphorylated in a dose-dependent manner at serines 61/64 and 78 as well as serine 61 following treatment with hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and mitomycin c, all of which cause DNA damage via replicative stress (Figure 6B and Figure S6). BID is also phosphorylated following treatments with agents inducing DNA strand breaks such as etoposide, UV, and IR (Figure 6C). We used antibodies raised against phosphopeptides of the regions surrounding residues 61/64 (Desagher et al., 1999Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K.

Lerenthal Y. Marcellus R.C. Gross A.

The above data is consistent with constitutive phosphorylation of Bid on serine 64, with stimulation of phosphorylation on serine 61 in response to DNA damage. Thus, in response to DNA damage, BID is phosphorylated at the ATM/ATR/DNA-PKcs consensus sites, suggesting that its role in this pathway may be regulated by these DNA repair kinases. Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that inhibits the kinase activities of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs (Sarkaria et al., 1998Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinases by the radiosensitizing agent wortmannin.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). BID phosphorylation in response to hydroxyurea treatment is decreased in the presence of levels of wortmannin known to inhibit ATM and DNA-PKcs, but only partially inhibit ATR (Figure 6D, lane 4 versus lane 6). Hydroxyurea-induced BID phosphorylation is not decreased in the presence of the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Figure 6D, lane 5). Although LY294002 has been reported to inhibit DNA-PKcs, but not ATM or ATR (Stiff et al., 2004Stiff T. O’Driscoll M. Rief N. Iwabuchi K. Lobrich M. Jeggo P.A. ATM and DNA-PK function redundantly to phosphorylate H2AX after exposure to ionizing radiation.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), significantly higher doses (200 μM) are required to produce minimal inhibition of hydroxyurea-induced Bid phosphorylation (Figure S7B). The above data are consistent with a minimal role for PI3 kinases in BID phosphorylation downstream of DNA damage and suggest that BID may be a substrate of one of the DNA-damage kinases. Since the casein kinase family has been reported to phosphorylate BID, (Desagher et al., 1999Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Bid-induced conformational change of Bax is responsible for mitochondrial cytochrome c release during apoptosis.J.

Inhibitors of either casein kinase 1 (CKI-7) or casein kinase 2 (TBB) do not abolish hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of BID at ser"

Here, we demonstrated that the BH3-only BID protein partially localizes to the nucleus in healthy cells, is important for apoptosis induced by DNA damage, and is phosphorylated following induction of double-strand breaks in DNA. We also found that BID phosphorylation is mediated by the ATM kinase and occurs in mouse BID on two ATM consensus sites. Interestingly, BID−/− cells failed to accumulate in the S phase of the cell cycle following treatment with the topoisomerase II poison etoposide; reintroducing wild-type BID restored accumulation. In contrast, introducing a nonphosphorylatable BID mutant did not restore accumulation in the S phase and resulted in an increase in cellular sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis. These results implicate BID as an ATM effector and raise the possibility that proapoptotic BID may also play a prosurvival role important for S phase arrest.

These results implicate BID as an ATM effector and raise the possibility that proapoptotic BID may also play a prosurvival role important for S phase arrest. The BH3-only proteins are sentinels of intracellular damage (Puthalakath and Strasser, 2002Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Keeping killers on a tight leash: transcriptional and post-translational control of the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins.Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). These proteins are held in check by diverse mechanisms, seemingly at cellular locations at which they can sense specific damage. BID is believed to be relatively inactive in the cytosol until proteolytically cleaved by caspase-8. Cleavage of cytosolic BID at Asp59 yields a p15 C-terminal truncated fragment (tBID) that translocates to the mitochondria, where it induces the activation of BAX and BAK, resulting in the release of cytochrome c (Wang, 2001Wang X. The expanding role of mitochondria in apoptosis.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation seems to regulate BID activity, since it was recently demonstrated that its phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 and/or 2 inhibits its cleavage by caspase-8 (Desagher et al., 2001Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Phosphorylation of bid by casein kinases I and II regulates its cleavage by caspase 8.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, the apoptotic pathways in which BID plays a role are not yet fully characterized. Studies with BID−/− mice have demonstrated that BID is required for Fas-induced apoptosis (Yin et al., 1999Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Bid-deficient mice are resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis.Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). On the other hand, BID−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were found to be as susceptible as BID+/+ MEFs to a wide range of intrinsic damage signals (Wei et al., 2001Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death.Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). More recently, however, it was demonstrated that BID−/− MEFs are less susceptible than BID+/+ MEFs to the DNA-damage reagent adriamycin, as well as to the nucleotide analog 5-fluorouracil (Sax et al., 2002Sax J.K. Fei P. Murphy M.E. Bernhard E. Korsmeyer S.J. El-Deiry W.S. BID regulation by p53 contributes to chemosensitivity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, BID may contribute to the DNA-damage response. In eukaryotes, each cell’s genetic material is constantly subjected to DNA damage. While a double-strand break (DSB) is not the major DNA lesion, it is certainly among the most harmful. Following DSBs, the cell may activate a survival system that enables repair and continuation of its normal life cycle, or it may activate its apoptotic machinery in the face of extensive or irreparable damage (Kaina, 2003Kaina B. DNA damage-triggered apoptosis: critical role of DNA repair, double-strand breaks, cell proliferation and signaling.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). One of the major responses associated with the cell-survival network is the temporary arrest of cell cycle progression, which reflects the activation of cell cycle checkpoints (Iliakis et al., 2003Iliakis G. Wang Y. Guan J. Wang H. DNA damage checkpoint control in cells exposed to ionizing radiation.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5834-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The best-documented, damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints operate in the G1/S boundary and at the S and G2 phases. The very early events that take place at the site of a DNA double-strand break and precede activation of the response network involve several proteins that are rapidly recruited to the damaged site; there, they act as DSB sensors. They then convey a damage signal to transducers, which in turn deliver it to numerous downstream effectors. A prototype transducer of the DSB response is ATM, a nuclear serine-threonine protein kinase which is absent or inactivated in patients with the genomic instability syndrome ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) (Shiloh, 2003Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). Cells from A-T patients exhibit genomic instability, radiosensitivity, and defective activation of the entire DSB response, most notably, the cell cycle checkpoints. ATM is a member of a group of conserved large proteins, several of which are protein kinases involved in mediating DNA-damage responses. These proteins (including ATR [ATM and RAD3-related]) share several motifs, among them a domain containing a PI3-kinase signature, which gives this group the title, “PI3-kinase-related protein kinases” (PIKKs). Activated ATM phosphorylates a wide spectrum of substrates, many of them at the sites of damage. The functional consequences of some of ATM phosphorylation events have been associated with the activation of the cell cycle checkpoints. However, not all of the phenotypic abnormalities in A-T patients and their cells can be explained by a lack of these phosphorylation events, implying that additional ATM targets exist, which have not yet been identified. Previously, we suggested that full-length BID is a player in the DNA-damage pathway, since a caspase-8 noncleavable BID mutant sensitized BID−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Sarig et al., 2003Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Marcellus R.C. Flavell R. Mak T.W. Gross A. BID-D59A is a potent inducer of apoptosis in primary embryonic fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10707-10715Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our current findings demonstrate that BID is partially localized to the nucleus in healthy MEFs and is important for apoptosis induced by a variety of DNA-damaging reagents. Moreover, we show that etoposide and ionizing radiation, both of which are known to induce double-strand breaks in DNA, lead to the phosphorylation of BID. Our findings indicate that BID phosphorylation is mediated by the ATM kinase, and occurs in mouse BID on two ATM consensus sites (S61Q and S78Q). We also found that etoposide induced accumulation of BID+/+ MEFs in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, whereas such an accumulation was not observed in the BID−/− MEFs. Reintroducing wild-type BID into BID−/− cells restored their ability to accumulate in the S and G2 phases, whereas introducing a nonphosphorylatable BID mutant (S61A/S78A) restored accumulation in the G2 phase but not in the S phase. Moreover, in response to etoposide, the mutant BID cells entered apoptosis more readily than did the wild-type BID cells. These results implicate BID as an ATM effector and raise the novel possibility that BID, a molecule that was previously considered to be active only as a proapoptotic factor, may also play a prosurvival role important for S phase arrest. To determine whether BID is required for DNA damage-induced apoptosis, we generated hTERT-immortalized BID+/+ and BID−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts and analyzed their response to a variety of DNA-damaging reagents: etoposide (Etop; a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase II), cisplatin (Cis; forms covalent adducts with the DNA), ultraviolet radiation (UV; induces thymine dimers), and ionizing radiation (IR). We found that BID−/− MEFs were less susceptible than BID+/+ MEFs to all four treatments (Figure 1A ). These DNA-damaging reagents also induced less cell death in primary BID−/− MEFs than in primary BID+/+ MEFs (data not shown), confirming that this decreased sensitivity is not due to hTERT immortalization. Splenocytes from BID−/− mice also display less susceptibility to Etop treatment (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), indicating that the decreased death response to DNA damage is a general feature of BID deficiency, although it is more pronounced in MEFs. To confirm that BID−/− MEFs are indeed less sensitive than BID+/+ MEFs to DNA damage-induced cell death, we performed clonogenic survival assays with MEFs following DNA damage. Our studies show that BID−/− MEFs have increased clonogenic survival following IR and Etop treatment (Figure 1B and data not shown). We have also created MEFs that are more sensitive to DNA damage-induced cell death by transforming primary BID+/+ and BID−/− MEFs with the SV40 whole genome. Cell death assays with these cells using much lower levels of DNA-damaging reagents confirmed that BID loss reduces sensitivity to DNA damage-induced cell death (Figure S1B). Finally, to confirm that the reduced susceptibility of BID−/− MEFs to DNA-damaging reagents was due to the absence of BID, BID−/− MEFs were infected with recombinant adenoviruses carrying the BID vector prior to treatment with Etop or IR. The results show that reintroduction of BID did not induce cell death on its own but fully restored susceptibility to Etop- (and partially to IR)-induced cell death (Figure 1C). Next, we explored whether BID was modified in response to DNA damage. Western blot analysis using anti-BID antibodies on lysates of hTERT-immortalized BID+/+ MEFs treated with the DNA-damaging reagents mentioned above revealed that Etop and IR, which are known to induce DSBs in DNA, unlike Cis or UV, induced a double electrophoretic mobility shift in BID (Figure 2A , note that the lower of the two shifted bands does not separate well from the regular BID band). We also treated MEFs with several other apoptotic reagents: thapsigargin (Thaps; stress signaling from the ER, which inhibits the Ca2+ adenosine triphosphate pump); TNFα together with actinomycin D; or with staurosporine (STS; a kinase inhibitor) and found that none of them affected the electrophoretic mobility of BID (Figure 2A). Etop and IR induced a similar double electrophoretic mobility shift in BID also in primary BID+/+ MEFs (data not shown), confirming that this shift is not due to hTERT immortalization. Similar mobility shifts have been associated with covalent modifications of proteins, for example, as a consequence of phosphorylation. To define whether the double electrophoretic mobility shift in BID was due to phosphorylation, BID+/+ MEFs were treated with Etop for 30 min, lysed, and either left untreated or incubated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37°C. Western blot analysis using anti-BID antibodies demonstrated that treatment with alkaline phosphatase abolished the electrophoretic mobility shifts in BID (Figure 2B), indicating that these shifts are most likely due to phosphorylation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that BID is rapidly phosphorylated in response to reagents that induce double-strand breaks in DNA. To confirm that BID was phosphorylated, human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells were transfected with mouse BID, labeled with 32P-orthophosphate, either left untreated or treated with Etop, and BID-immunoprecipitated. Exposure to Etop resulted in a marked increase in 32P-labeling of BID, which appeared as a doublet (Figure 2C, left). Western blot analysis of the same samples with anti-BID antibodies indicated that the two 32P-labeled bands correspond to the two slower-migrating forms of BID (Figure 2C, right). The ATM kinase plays a pivotal role in the immediate response of cells to double-strand breaks. To determine whether ATM is involved in the phosphorylation of BID, we utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in both ATM and the p19ARF tumor-suppressor gene, since loss of ARF has been shown to reverse premature replicative arrest of ATM-deficient MEFs (Kamijo et al., 1999Kamijo T. van de Kamp E. Chong M.J. Zindy F. Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. McKinnon P.J. Loss of the ARF tumor suppressor reverses premature replicative arrest but not radiation hypersensitivity arising from disabled atm function.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, ATM/ARF double-knockout MEFs, as well as Atm+/+Arf−/− MEFs, were treated with Etop or IR and Western blot analyzed using anti-BID antibodies. Figure 2D shows that following Etop or IR treatment, the slower migrating bands of BID do not appear in the ATM-deficient cells. Thus, the presence of the ATM kinase appears to play an essential role in the process by which etoposide and ionizing radiation induce phosphorylation of BID. To corroborate these findings, we took advantage of a stable HeLa cell line in which ATM was knocked down by siRNA (in these cells, the level of ATM was reduced by ∼95% [Elkon et al., 2005Elkon R. Rashi-Elkeles S. Lerenthal Y. Linhart C. Tenne T. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Shamir R. Shiloh Y. Dissection of a DNA-damage-induced transcriptional network using a combination of microarrays, RNA interference and computational promoter analysis.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]). Both these cells and the control cells, which carried a siRNA against LacZ, were transfected with mouse BID, exposed to Etop, and Western blot analyzed using anti-BID antibodies. Exposure of control HeLa cells to Etop induced a double electrophoretic mobility shift in BID that was absent in the ATM knocked-down cells (Figure 2E, left and middle panels). BID−/− MEFs were used as a specificity control (Figure 2E, right panel). These results further confirm that the presence of ATM is essential for BID phosphorylation. As mentioned in the Introduction, ATM is a member of the PIKK family. The common phosphorylation sites for PIKKs are serines or threonines followed by glutamine residues, a motif commonly dubbed “SQ/TQ” (Kim et al., 1999Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Substrate specificities and identification of putative substrates of ATM kinase family members.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Mouse BID carries two such motifs (S61Q and S78Q), whereas human and rat BID carry only one (S78Q; Figure 3A ). To determine whether mouse BID is phosphorylated on one or both of these sites, we mutated each of these serines to alanines. Our initial analysis was performed in HeLa cells transfected with either wild-type (wt) BID or transfected with one or the other of the BID mutants. Western blot analysis using anti-BID antibodies indicated that treatment of the aforementioned cells with Etop resulted in a double electrophoretic mobility shift, which was abolished in the S61A mutant (Figure 3B). In contrast, mutating the S78 site had no effect on the appearance of the two slower-migrating bands. Thus, BID phosphorylation on S61 is likely the cause for the electrophoretic mobility shift. To confirm the results presented above and to establish whether serine 78 is also phosphorylated in mouse BID in response to Etop, we generated phosphospecific antibodies to serine 61 and serine 78 (see Experimental Procedures). We initially performed Western blot analysis with these antibodies on lysates of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. To define whether these antibodies recognize the phosphorylated form of BID, BID+/+ MEFs were either not treated or treated with Etop for 30 min, lysed, and either left untreated or incubated with potato-acid phosphatase for 30 min at 37°C. Western blot analysis demonstrated that anti-pS61 antibodies recognized a band of the expected size of BID in Etop-treated cells and that treatment with potato-acid phosphatase abolished this recognition (Figure 3C, left; note that these antibodies recognize an additional ∼30 kDa protein that shares antigenicity with pS61-BID). Western blot analysis using the anti-pS78 antibodies demonstrated that these antibodies recognized three bands (one strong band and two very faint bands) in Etop-treated cells; treatment with potato-acid phosphatase abolished all three bands (Figure 3C, right). The bands identified with both antibodies corresponded to BID, since they were not identified in BID−/− MEFs (Figure 3C). Next, we determined whether mutation of either serine 61 or serine 78 to alanine abolished recognition of mouse BID by the phosphospecific antibodies. These experiments were performed in HeLa cells transfected with either wtBID, the BID-S61A mutant, or the BID-S78A mutant. The anti-pS61 and anti-pS78 antibodies recognized BID in cells expressing wtBID and treated with Etop, but not in cells expressing the BID-S61A or BID-S78A mutant, respectively (Figure S2A). To determine if ATM (and possibly ATR) could directly phosphorylate BID, we performed in vitro kinase assays using flag-tagged human ATM and ATR (and the kinase-inactive forms) and purified recombinant mouse wtBID and the BID-S61A/S78A double mutant. Wild-type but not kinase-inactive human ATM and ATR efficiently phosphorylate recombinant wtBID in vitro, whereas mutating both S61 and S78 completely abolished BID phosphorylation (Figure S2B). Taken together, these data indicate that BID is a substrate of both ATM and ATR in vitro and that S61 and/or S78 are the sites phosphorylated by these kinases. To determine whether BID is phosphorylated in another cell type, we have examined the phosphorylation status of BID in mouse splenocytes either not treated or treated with Etop. As shown in Figure S2C, Etop induces the phosphorylation of BID on both S61 and S78 in splenocytes. As mentioned above, human BID carries only one PIKK consensus site (S78; Figure 3A). To determine whether endogenous human BID is phosphorylated on S78, we performed Western blot analysis with anti-human BID and anti-pS78 antibodies on lysates of HEK293 cells either not treated or treated with Etop. The anti-pS78 antibodies recognized a band of the size of human BID only in cells treated with Etop (Figure S2D). To confirm these results, we cloned human BID, generated a human BID-S78A mutant, and expressed either the wild-type or the mutant BID in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis using anti-pS78 antibodies showed an increase in the intensity of the band that represents phosphorylated BID in cells transfected with wild-type human BID but not in cells transfected with the BID-S78A mutant (Figure S2E). Thus, human BID is phosphorylated on S78 in response to Etop. To determine the time course of endogenous mouse BID phosphorylation, BID+/+ MEFs were treated with Etop and Western blot analyzed with the anti-BID, the anti-pS61, or the anti-pS78 antibodies. Phosphorylation of S61 was detected by 15 min (the first time point analyzed), reached a peak at 1 hr, and was reduced by 3 hr post-Etop treatment (Figure 3D). Phosphorylation of S78 was also transient (peak at 2–3 hr), though was somewhat delayed, compared to phosphorylation of the S61 site. Next, we determined when apoptosis began in MEFs treated with Etop and found that the onset of apoptosis occurred between 8 and 12 hr following Etop treatment (Figure 3E). Thus, BID phosphorylation occurs many hours prior to the onset of apoptosis. To determine whether endogenous mouse BID is phosphorylated on S61 and S78 in an ATM-dependent manner, we utilized the phosphospecific antibodies for Western blot analysis of ATM/ARF double-knockout and Atm+/+Arf−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts either not treated or treated with Etop. This analysis demonstrated that endogenous mouse BID is phosphorylated on S61 and S78 only in Atm+/+Arf−/− MEFs treated with Etop (Figure S3A). To show that phosphorylation of mouse BID was specific for reagents inducing double-strand breaks, we treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts with several DNA-damaging and other apoptotic reagents (previously described in Figure 2). Posttreatment, cells were lysed, and the phosphorylation of endogenous mouse BID was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-pS61 antibodies. The results demonstrated that mouse BID is phosphorylated on S61 only in response to reagents that induce double-strand breaks (Figure 3F). Finally, to define whether phosphorylation of human BID was also ATM-dependent and occurred only in response to reagents that induce double-strand breaks, we took advantage of a stable HEK293 cell line in which ATM was knocked down by siRNA (these cells were generated like the HeLa ATM knocked-down cells [Elkon et al., 2005Elkon R. Rashi-Elkeles S. Lerenthal Y. Linhart C. Tenne T. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Shamir R. Shiloh Y. Dissection of a DNA-damage-induced transcriptional network using a combination of microarrays, RNA interference and computational promoter analysis.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]). These cells and the control cells, which carried a siRNA against LacZ, were exposed to Etop, IR, UV, or STS, and Western blot analyzed using anti-pS78 antibodies. Exposure of LacZ knocked down cells to Etop or IR, but not to UV or STS, induced phosphorylation of endogenous human BID on serine 78, which did not occur in the ATM knocked-down cells (Figure S3B). Next, we analyzed the cellular location of BID and its phosphorylated form. To determine the location of BID in healthy cells, we performed immunofluoresence studies with BID+/+ and BID−/− MEFs using anti-BID antibodies. Surprisingly, in these studies we obtained positive staining of BID in the nucleus (Figure 4A , left top panels). These antibodies specifically recognized BID, since we obtained very low staining in BID−/− MEFs (Figure 4A, right top panels). To determine whether Etop treatment leads to a change in the staining pattern of BID, BID+/+ and BID−/− MEFs were treated with Etop for 3 hr prior to fixation. These studies have indicated that Etop did not change the staining pattern of BID (Figure 4A, bottom panels). To assess whether BID indeed localizes to the nucleus in healthy MEFs, we have performed subcellular fractionations followed by Western blotting using anti-BID antibodies. In these experiments, cellular BID was detected only in the soluble/cytoplasmic fraction (Figure 4B, left top panel). MEK and BAX (cytosolic proteins) and lamin B (a nuclear protein) were used as markers to confirm the purity of the nuclear/cytoplasmic fractions (Figure 4B, left bottom panels). These results, together with the immunofluoresence results, suggested that BID might be loosely associated with the nuclear fraction and that cellular disruption leads to its dissociation from this fraction. To examine this possibility, cells were treated with formaldehyde as a crosslinker prior to cellular disruption. These experiments demonstrated that a small fraction of cellular BID was localized to the nuclear fraction (Figure 4B, right panels). These results suggest that BID is loosely associated with the nuclear fraction by interaction with another protein(s) and that crosslinking is required to preserve this interaction. To determine whether Etop treatment leads to a change in the levels of nuclear BID, cells were treated with Etop for 1 and 3 hr and then treated with formaldehyde followed by subcellular fractionation. We found that Etop did not change the levels of BID associated with the nuclear fraction (data not shown). To determine the cellular location of the phosphorylated forms of BID, we performed immunofluoresence studies with the phosphospecific antibodies using BID+/+ and BID−/− MEFs either not treated or treated with Etop for 30 min. These antibodies detected an increase in nuclear fluorescence in BID+/+ MEFs treated with Etop; however, a similar increase was detected in BID−/− MEFs (data not shown). Thus, these antibodies crossreact with other phospho-S/T-Q proteins. Nonetheless, the fact that BID partially localizes to the nucleus and that all currently identified substrates of ATM are nuclear proteins, suggests that BID is phosphorylated in the nucleus. To assess whether BID might be involved in the immediate cellular response to DNA damage, we next determined the earliest point at which BID in mouse embryonic fibroblasts was phosphorylated, following exposure to ionizing radiation. Phosphorylation of serine 61 was detectable immediately after exposing cells to 50 Gy IR (Figure 4C). We previously determined that phosphorylation of BID on both serine 61 and serine 78 occurs several hours prior to the onset of apoptosis (Figure 3). We therefore speculated that phosphorylation might also occur in response to extremely low levels of ionizing radiation which do not result in apoptosis. Indeed, we determined that a 25-fold lower dose of IR (0.2 Gy) was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of BID (Figure 4D). The functional consequences of certain ATM phosphorylation events include activation of cell cycle checkpoints, which result in temporary arrest of cell cycle progression to enable DNA repair (Iliakis et al., 2003Iliakis G. Wang Y. Guan J. Wang H. DNA damage checkpoint control in cells exposed to ionizing radiation.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5834-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The best-documented, damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints operate in the G1/S boundary and at the S and G2 phases. To examine the possible involvement of BID in cell cycle arrest following DNA double-strand breaks, we performed cell cycle analyses on BID+/+ and BID−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts either not treated or treated with etoposide. Etop induced accumulation of BID+/+ MEFs in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (as measured 8 hr after release into drug-free medium), whereas such an accumulation was not observed in the BID−/− MEFs (Figure 5A ). These results suggest that BID is important for the accumulation of cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle following double-strand break DNA damage. To determine whether BID is required for S phase arrest following DNA damage, we performed double-labeling experiments with BrdU and PI to determine the level of DNA synthesis and to follow the progress of cells through S phase after Etop treatment. The results demonstrate that BID+/+ MEFs show a decrease in DNA synthesis (less BrdU-positive cells), whereas BID−/− MEFs fail to show a decrease in DNA synthesis (Figure 5B). Moreover, BID−/− MEFs are not delayed in their progression form S to G2/M (Figure 5C). Taken together, these experiments prove that BID−/− MEFs fail to arrest in S phase following Etop treatment. To assess whether ATM-mediated phosphorylation is regulating BID’s function in this process, we generated BID−/− single stable clones expressing either wtBID or a nonphosphorylatable BID mutant (S61A/S78A). We initially confirmed that wtBID (in the wtBID clones) was phosphorylated on S61 and S78 in response to Etop and that BID-S61A/S78A (in the mutant BID clones) was not (Figure 6A ). Next, we performed cell cycle analysis on two of the wtBID and two of the BID-S61A/S78A stable clones. As shown in Figure 6B, Etop induced accumulation of the wtBID clones in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (as measured 8 hr after release into drug-free medium), whereas the mutant BID clones bypassed accumulation in the S phase and rapidly accumulated in the G2 phase. Thus, the mutant BID cells were found to be impaired in their ability to temporarily arrest in S phase following double-strand break DNA damage. To explore a possible connection between BID phosphorylation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, we assessed the levels of apoptosis in the two wtBID and in the two BID-S61A/S78A clones either not treated or treated with Etop. Our results indicated that Etop induced a significantly higher rate of apoptosis in BID−/− clones expressing BID-S61A/S78A than in the BID−/− clones expressing wtBID (Figure 7A ). It is interesting that UV or TNFα treatment did not induce increased apoptosis in the mutant BID clones (Figure 7A). Western blot analysis using anti-BID antibodies indicated that the increase in apoptosis seen in the mutant BID clones in response to Etop was not due to either higher levels of expression of mutant BID or to its enhanced cleavage to tBID (Figure 7B). Thus, the mutant BID clones were found to be more susceptible to apoptotsis induced solely by a reagent that leads to DNA double-strand breaks. In the present study, we demonstrated that double-strand break DNA-damaging reagents induced an immediate and transient phosphorylation of BID. In addition, we showed that this phosphorylation was mediated by the ATM kinase. Most importantly, we demonstrated that BID−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed to delay the cell cycle in response to etoposide and that introduction of a nonphosphorylatable BID mutant restored delay in the G2 but not in the S phase. Moreover, in response to etoposide, the mutant BID cells entered apoptosis more readily than did the wild-type BID cells. Previously, we suggested that full-length BID is a player in the DNA-damage pathway, since a caspase-8 noncleavable BID mutant sensitized BID−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Sarig et al., 2003Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Marcellus R.C. Flavell R. Mak T.W. Gross A. BID-D59A is a potent inducer of apoptosis in primary embryonic fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10707-10715Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our current findings demonstrate that in MEFs, BID is important for apoptosis induced by a variety of DNA-damaging reagents (Figure 1). Splenocytes from BID−/− mice also display less susceptibility to DNA damage, indicating that the decreased death response to DNA damage is a general feature of BID deficiency. As mentioned above, BID−/− MEFs are less susceptible than BID+/+ MEFs to reagents that induce different forms of DNA damage (Figure 1). On the other hand, BID phosphorylation occurs only in response to reagents that induce double-strand breaks in DNA. Thus, phosphorylation of BID does not seem to be critical for its proapoptotic activity. However, lack of BID phosphorylation does effect the susceptibility of cells to double-strand break DNA damage since BID−/− MEFs expressing the BID-S61A/S78A mutant are more susceptible than BID−/− MEFs expressing wild-type BID to etoposide-induced apoptosis (Figure 7). Thus, ATM-mediated BID phosphorylation might serve as a mechanism to inhibit BID’s apoptotic activity or alternatively as a mechanism to activate a prosurvival activity of BID. If phosphorylation were inhibiting the apoptotic activity of BID, then what would likely be the molecular basis of such inhibition? The only known apoptotic function of BID lies in its ability to induce the release of proapoptotic factors from the mitochondria (e.g., cytochrome c). Caspase-truncated BID (tBID) is much more efficient than full-length BID in inducing cytochrome c release; it would therefore be expected that ATM-mediated BID phosphorylation inhibits the cleavage of BID, since casein kinase 1 and/or 2-mediated phosphorylation of BID was demonstrated to inhibit its cleavage (Desagher et al., 2001Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Phosphorylation of bid by casein kinases I and II regulates its cleavage by caspase 8.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, our findings suggest that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BID is not related to BID cleavage, for the following reasons: phosphorylation occurs many hours before the activation of caspases and the onset of apoptosis (Figure 3 and data not shown). A relatively small amount of BID is phosphorylated (Figure 2), and phosphorylation occurs also in response to extremely low, nonapoptotic levels of DNA damage (Figure 4). Moreover, the BID-S61A/S78A mutant was not found to be more susceptible to cleavage than was wtBID (Figure 7). Lastly, though TNFα relies on the generation of tBID to induce/enhance apoptosis (Yin et al., 1999Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Bid-deficient mice are resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis.Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2001Zhao Y. Li S. Childs E.E. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. Activation of pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins and mitochondria apoptosis pathway in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced liver injury.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27432-27440Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the BID-S61A/S78A mutant clones are not more susceptible to TNFα-induced apoptosis than are the wtBID clones (Figure 7). Thus, BID phosphorylation does not seem to serve as a mechanism to inhibit BID’s apoptotic activity. The results presented in Figure 5, Figure 6 suggest that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BID regulates a novel, prosurvival function of BID related to cell cycle arrest following DNA double-strand breaks. We first found that etoposide induced accumulation of BID+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, whereas such an accumulation was not observed in the BID−/− MEFs (Figure 5). Moreover, using BrdU labeling, we have demonstrated that BID is specifically required for S phase arrest. We then reintroduced wild-type BID into BID−/− cells and found that this addition restored the ability to accumulate in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Introducing the nonphosphorylatable BID mutant into BID−/− cells, however, restored accumulation only in the G2 phase (Figure 6). These findings imply that BID phosphorylation plays an important role in S phase arrest. To demonstrate the BID-dependent S phase checkpoint, we have used relatively high levels of etoposide, suggesting that this function of BID is associated with high levels of genotoxic stress in fibroblasts. On the other hand, in myeloid and in activated T cells, this function of BID is associated with lower levels of genotoxic stress (Zinkel et al., 2005Zinkel S.S. Hurov K.E. Ong C. Abtahi F.M. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. A role for proapoptotic BID in the DNA-damage response.Cell. 2005; 122 (this issue): 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]). Hematopoietic cells are primed to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following treatment with DNA-damaging reagents, whereas fibroblasts are relatively resistant to DNA-damaging reagents and prevent proliferation of mutations by entering into long-term G1 or G2 arrest (Baus et al., 2003Baus F. Gire V. Fisher D. Piette J. Dulic V. Permanent cell cycle exit in G2 phase after DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3992-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Di Leonardo et al., 1994Di Leonardo A. Linke S.P. Clarkin K. Wahl G.M. DNA damage triggers a prolonged p53-dependent G1 arrest and long-term induction of Cip1 in normal human fibroblasts.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2540-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation threshold and the biological impact of the BID-dependent S phase checkpoint function may vary largely among different cell types. How might the involvement of BID in S phase arrest be related to apoptosis? Following DNA double-strand breaks, the cell may decide to activate a survival system (mainly through the ATM kinase, which induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair), or in the face of extensive or irreparable damage, the cell may activate the apoptotic machinery. The results presented in Figure 7 demonstrate that BID−/− MEFs expressing the BID-S61A/S78A mutant are more susceptible than BID−/− MEFs expressing wild-type BID to etoposide-induced apoptosis, but not to UV- or to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Thus, it appears that the nonphosphorylatable BID mutant sensitizes BID−/− MEFs to apoptotsis induced only by reagents that induce double-strand breaks in DNA. These results, together with the cell cycle results (Figure 5, Figure 6) suggest that the impaired ability of the mutant BID cells to induce cell cycle arrest results in increased sensitivity to double-strand break DNA damage. If BID is indeed capable of playing a prosurvival role in the response of cells to DNA double-strand breaks, then why are the BID−/− MEFs less sensitive than BID+/+ MEFs to apoptosis induced by etoposide and ionizing radiation (Figure 1)? BID may play both a prosurvival and a proapoptotic role in this pathway. Based on our finding that the phosphorylation of BID occurs in response to extremely low levels of ionizing radiation and increases in an ionizing radiation dose-dependent manner (Figure 4), we propose that BID acts as a sentinel of DNA double-strand breaks. BID might translate the damage into either cell cycle arrest/DNA repair processes (at low levels of damage) or apoptosis (at high levels of damage). In summary, this study raises the novel possibility that the BH3-only BID protein, a molecule that was previously considered to be active only as a proapoptotic factor, may also play a prosurvival role. If BID is indeed playing both a proapoptotic and a prosurvival function in the DNA-damage pathway, then it is an excellent candidate to link DNA repair processes and apoptosis. BID−/− mice (originally kept on a mixed C57BL/6 × 129S background) had been bred to wt C57BL/6 mice 12 times in order to obtain animals that are F12 on a C57BL/6 background. BID−/− MEFs were generated from the F12 mice. BID+/+ and BID−/− primary MEFs were prepared from 11- to 13-day-old embryos and maintained in ISCOVE’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (MEF medium). ATM/ARF double-knockout and Atm+/+Arf−/− MEFs were obtained from Chuck J. Sherr (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital). Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) dye exclusion. PI (25 μg/ml) was added to the cells immediately prior to analysis by FACScan (Beckton Dickinson). MEFs were treated with 20 μM Etop for 2 hr, rinsed, and then released into drug-free medium. Eight or twenty-four hours after release, cells were collected for fixation in methanol. Following fixation, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS with 25 μg/ml PI and 50 μg/ml RNase a half-hour before FACScan analysis. Analysis of the cell cycle results was performed using the ModFit LT program (Tripathi et al., 2003Tripathi A.K. Chaturvedi R. Ahmad R. Asim M. Sawlani K.K. Singh M.K. Tripathi P. Tekwani B.L.

Briefly, immunogens were phosphorylated synthetic peptides, which represented portions of mouse BID around either serine 61 or serine 78. Antibodies that were not phosphospecific were removed by solid phase absorption. Antibodies that were specific for either BID pSer61 or BID pSer78 were affinity-purified using the phosphopeptide immobilized on solid support. I dedicate this paper to Stanley J.

The expansion stabilizes hAtx-1, leading to its accumulation. To understand how stabilized hAtx-1 induces selective neuronal degeneration, we studied Drosophila Atx-1 (dAtx-1), which has a conserved AXH domain but lacks a polyglutamine tract. Overexpression of hAtx-1 in fruit flies produces phenotypes similar to those of dAtx-1 but different from the polyglutamine peptide alone. We show that the Drosophila and mammalian transcription factors Senseless/Gfi-1 interact with Atx-1's AXH domain. In flies, overexpression of Atx-1 inhibits sensory-organ development by decreasing Senseless protein. Similarly, overexpression of wild-type and glutamine-expanded hAtx-1 reduces Gfi-1 levels in Purkinje cells. Deletion of the AXH domain abolishes the effects of glutamine-expanded hAtx-1 on Senseless/Gfi-1. Interestingly, loss of Gfi-1 mimics SCA1 phenotypes in Purkinje cells. These results indicate that the Atx-1/Gfi-1 interaction contributes to the selective Purkinje cell degeneration in SCA1."

In this study, we report another class of carrier proteins, termed Serinc1-5, that incorporates a polar amino acid serine into membranes and facilitates the synthesis of two serine-derived lipids, phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids.

Abel T. Kandel E.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify molecules that are involved in this process we, as well as others, have used differential cloning strategies to identify genes that are rapidly induced in neurons of the hippocampus by excitatory neuronal activity (2Nedivi E. Hevroni D. Naot D. Israeli D. Citri Y. Nature. 1993; 363: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 3Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A.

The set of genes identified includes transcription factors such as c-fos, c-jun, and zif268 (4Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar), as well as effector molecules that may directly modify cellular and synaptic functions. Examples of this latter class of proteins include the inducible form of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS2) and a key regulatory enzyme of polyamine metabolism (spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase) (3Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J.

These proteins are rapidly induced in neurons and interact with constitutively expressed cellular and synaptic proteins to modify neuronal properties. In the present study, a novel activity-regulated protein family has been identified that serves as an effector molecule that facilitates the biosynthesis of lipids, a major macromolecular component of the nervous system. This effector protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRFPred fluorescent proteinSPTserine palmitoyltransferase. membranes, where most of the membranes including the plasma membrane, are synthesized. Most of lipid biosynthetic enzymes are also embedded in and associated with ER membranes. Because the action of the protein is to incorporate serine into newly forming membrane lipids, it is different from a transporter that transfers amino acids across membranes. endoplasmic reticulum glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein red fluorescent protein serine palmitoyltransferase. Serine is a nonessential amino acid that can be synthesized by many cells. In the cell, serine serves as a building block for the synthesis of two major classes of membrane lipids, phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. Although it is well known that cell membranes efficiently incorporate serine into their lipid bilayer despite the hydrophilicity, the molecular mechanism remained unclear. This study has demonstrated for the first time that a protein family having 11 transmembrane domains facilitates the incorporation of serine into both phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. This is a function novel to proteins and is henceforth referred to as Serinc (serine incorporator). Because the Serinc family showed no amino acid homology to any known proteins, nothing was known about their function, although there have been several studies on this family. First, the predicted membrane topology has 11 transmembrane segments similar to amino acid transporters. Therefore, a recent report classified TMS1, a yeast member of the Serinc family, as an “uncharacterized (orphan) transporter” (6De Hertogh B. Carvajal E. Talla E. Dujon B. Baret P. Goffeau A. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 2: 154-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Secondly, two mouse homolog genes for yeast TMS1, denoted as mouse TMS-1 and TMS-2 (corresponding to Serinc3 and Serinc1, respectively), were identified by another research group, and their neuronal expression and membrane localization were shown experimentally (7Grossman T.R. Luque J.M. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 447-457PubMed Google Scholar). That group also performed experiments to detect amino acid transport activity using TMS1 homolog-expressing cells, but all attempts were unsuccessful (7Grossman T.R. Luque J.M. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 447-457PubMed Google Scholar). Thirdly, some of the family members were reported to be differentially expressed in some environments; TDE1 (corresponding to Serinc3) expression was increased in both human lung tumors and mouse testicular tumors (8Bossolasco M. Lebel M. Lemieux N. Mes-Masson A.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 26: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Lebel M. Mes-Masson A.M. DNA Seq. 1994; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); and TPO1 (corresponding to Serinc5) expression was developmentally induced in a terminal differentiation stage of cultured oligodendrocytes (10Krueger W.H. Gonye G.E. Madison D.L. Murray K.E. Kumar M. Spoerel N. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings implied the important role of this family in multiple aspects of cell physiology, but the function of this family remained unknown. In this study, yeast proteomic data and serine-incorporating experiments using Escherichia coli offered the key to an understanding of the function of Serinc in the central nervous system. The background is that serine is universally used for the synthesis of membrane lipids in a broad range of organisms. Phosphatidylserine is present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, but it is formed in different manners among diverse species. In E. coli and yeast, phosphatidylserine synthase catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylserine from serine and CDP-diacylglycerol (11Dowhan W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Carman G.M. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, phosphatidylserine is synthesized by a calcium-dependent base exchange reaction in which the head group of a preexisting phospholipid is replaced by serine (13Kanfer J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This serine base exchange enzyme (recently called mammalian phosphatidylserine synthase) is the sole mechanism available for phosphatidylserine formation by mammalian cells. On the other hand, sphingolipids are not found in most prokaryotes but are distributed in all eukaryotic cells. In various eukaryotic species, the first and committed step in de novo sphingolipid synthesis is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase, which condenses serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketodihydrosphingosine in a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent reaction (14Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Sphingolipid molecules (particularly sphingomyelin and glycolipids) are found predominantly in the noncytoplasmic half of membranes, where they self-associate into microaggregates together with cholesterol molecules. Closely packed sphingolipid-cholesterol clusters behave as rafts that move within the fluid bilayer (accordingly termed lipid rafts or microdomains) and function as platforms for the attachment of proteins when selected membranes are transported by some routes of intracellular membrane trafficking (15Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). An increasing number of recent studies indicate a functional role of the lipid raft and other microdomains during neural signaling, axonal guidance, and malignant tumorigenesis (16Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Encinas M. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 412-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Guirland C. Suzuki S. Kojima M. Lu B. Zheng J.Q.

A. 2002; 99: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that three Serinc proteins specifically enhance the synthesis of phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. Because sphingolipids are major components of lipid rafts, Serinc is likely to function as a lipid raft maker in activity-dependent neural plasticity and oncogenic transformation. Animals and Differential Screening of cDNA Library—Adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley) were used in studies of Serinc regulation. Kainate stimulation was performed as follows. Rats were injected subcutaneously with kainate (8 mg/kg of body weight). After this treatment, rats were sacrificed after 3.5 h under anesthesia with an overdose of diethyl ether. All parts of the procedures were approved by the Niigata University Committee on Animal Research. A cDNA library was construction using 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from kainate-stimulated rat hippocampus as described in the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was screened with [32P]cDNA prepared by reverse transcription of poly(A)+RNA from the hippocampus of control or kainate-stimulated rats as described previously (3Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization—Freshly dissected brain tissue was rapidly frozen in plastic molds placed on a dry ice/ethanol slurry. Control and experimental tissues were frozen in the same tissue block to assure identical conditions during storage and in situ hybridization. Frozen 10-μm thick sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides desiccated at -20 °C. Hybridization was performed using 35S-labeled riboprobes of three rat Serinc subtypes as described previously (19Ingi T. Aoki Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid Experiments—Experiments were performed as described previously (20Cagney G. Uetz P. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Transformation of pOBD2-vector into each open reading frame transformant was performed using an ScEasyComp transformation kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The yeast suspensions were plated onto synthetic plates lacking tryptophan and leucine and incubated for 7 days at 30 °C. After colonies had grown they were picked and plated onto synthetic plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine to detect two-hybrid activation. Control transformations were included in each assay, without insert and with only pOBD2-serinc1. E. coli Cultures, Preparation of Lysates and Membranes, and Western Blot Analysis—The cDNAs of rat Serinc1, Serinc2, and Serinc5 were subcloned into the E. coli expression vectors of pDEST14 and pDEST15 (Invitrogen). E. coli strain BL21-AI (Invitrogen) was transformed with these plasmids, and 100 ml of the culture was induced by 0.2% arabinose to express proteins. The cells were harvested 2 h after induction by centrifugation and resuspended at 10 ml/g wet cell weight in each assay buffer or Tris-buffered saline. 3 ml of the resuspended cells was sonicated on ice using a microprobe for 20 min. Unbroken cells were removed from the lysates by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min), and the low speed supernatant was centrifuged at 4 × 104 × g for 40 min to provide the crude membrane pellet. Western blot analysis using anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was performed at a 1:1000 dilution as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Yeast Cultures and Preparation of Microsomes—The wild-type and tms1Δ strain of yeast BY4743 were transformed with each plasmid of pYES/DEST52-rat serinc1 and its empty vector (Invitrogen). The transformants were selected on synthetic plates lacking uracil, and the culture was induced with 2% galactose to express proteins. The cells were harvested 12 h after induction and resuspended at 2 ml/g wet cell weight in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Glass beads were added to the suspension, and cells were lysed by 10 cycles (60 s each) of vortexing with cooling on ice. Unbroken cells and beads were removed by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min), and the low speed supernatant was centrifuged at 4 × 104 × g for 40 min to provide the microsomal pellet. The pellet was resuspended at 1 ml/g wet cell weight (∼10 mg/ml protein) in the same buffer containing 33% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Mammalian Cell Cultures and Preparation of Lysates—SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney (COS-7) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 1 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish were transfected with the lipoplexes containing 8 μg of each or combinatorial DNA of pcDNA/DEST47-rat serinc, pcDNA3.2/V5DEST-rat serinc, pAsRed2-N1-mouse sptlc1, and their empty vectors (Invitrogen and BD Biosciences). The cells were harvested 60 h following transfection and resuspended in 240 μl of each assay buffer. 0.25 ml of the resuspended cells was sonicated on ice using a microprobe for 1 min. [3H]Serine Uptake by Whole Cells—E. coli (0.4 mg of protein) and COS cells (0.2 mg of protein) were incubated with 3 μm [3H]serine (2 μCi) for 5 min at 37 °C in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose. After washing three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed by adding 0.1 ml of 10% SDS. Radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting using Ready Protein+. Base Exchange Enzyme Activity and E. coli Serine-incorporating Activity—The base exchange reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm [3H]serine (60 μCi), and the indicated amount of cell lysates in a total volume of 0.35 ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1/2, v/v), and phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). In screening assays of serine-incorporating activity using Serinc1-expressing E. coli, 1.4 mg of E. coli total lysates was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 30 μCi of [3H]serine in the same solution or with 8 μCi of [14C]glucose (0.3 Ci/mmol) omitting serine. Phosphatidylserine Synthase Activity of E. coli Membranes—A 0.25-ml reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm [3H]serine, 0.2 mm CDP-diacylglycerol, and 3 mm ATP. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.45 mg of membrane protein, and after 20 min at 37 °C, it was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1/2). Serine Palmitoyltransferase Activity—The reaction mixture contained 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.3, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 0.2 mm palmitoyl-CoA, 1 mm [3H]serine (60 μCi), and the indicated amount of membrane proteins or cell lysates in a total volume of 0.3 ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1/2). After 25 μg of sphinganine was added as carrier, the lipid products were extracted by the method described previously (22Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thin-layer Chromatography and Fluorography—Lipid extracts from assays were dried under N2, redissolved in chloroform/methanol (2/1), and spotted on a silica gel 60 HPTLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). In assays of phosphatidylserine synthesis, the plates were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid (50/30/4.5/6.5 or 65/25/10/0). In assays of serine palmitoyltransferase, the plates were developed with chloroform/methanol/2 n NH4OH (80/20/1). To visualize radioactive bands, the plates were treated with 2-methylnaphthalene containing 0.4% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and exposed to X-OMAT film at -80 °C for 1-4 days. To quantitate the radioactivity in each band, the silica gel was scraped off and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting using Econofluor. Expression and Activity-dependent Induction of Serinc1 mRNA in the Hippocampus—Adult rats were injected subcutaneously with the glutamate analogue kainate (8 mg/kg of body weight), which induce seizures and long-term synaptic enhancement in the brain (2Nedivi E. Hevroni D. Naot D. Israeli D. Citri Y. Nature. 1993; 363: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 5Ingi T. Worley P.F. Lanahan A.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1459-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then sacrificed 3 h after the kainate-induced seizures. A cDNA library was prepared from the hippocampus and differentially screened using radiolabeled cDNA prepared from untreated control and kainate-stimulated rat hippocampus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of one of the differentially expressed cDNAs identified it as an unknown protein (GenBank™ accession number DQ103708), and it was named Serinc1. To further investigate the neural activity-dependent regulation of Serinc1, we examined the cellular distribution of Serinc1 mRNA in control and seizure-treated rat brains by performing in situ hybridization. Expression was examined in the half-brains of naive rats (Fig. 1, C-side) and compared with expression in rats that had received kainate-induced seizures and were then sacrificed 3 h later (S-side). Serinc1 mRNA is normally expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar granule cell layer (Fig. 1, left panels, C-side), which is closely related to the localization of glutamatergic excitatory neurons (23Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). This result agrees with a recent report detailing the neuronal localization of mouse TMS-2 mRNA using in situ hybridization (7Grossman T.R. Luque J.M. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 447-457PubMed Google Scholar). Within 3 h after kainate-induced seizure, Serinc1 mRNA is significantly induced in neuronal cell layers of the hippocampal CA1-3 fields (Fig. 1, left panels, arrow). Thus, following the kainate-induced seizures, Serinc1 mRNA levels increase rapidly in discrete brain regions. The Serinc Family of Various Eukaryotic Species Exhibit Transmembrane Domains—Serinc1 mRNA encodes a protein of 453 amino acids (Fig. 2A) with 98% identity to mouse TMS-2 protein. This result, together with the identical neuronal localization, suggests that they are counterparts. Two other reported proteins, human TDE1 and rat TPO1, show homology to Serinc1 with amino acid identities of 58 and 38%, henceforth referred to as Serinc3 and Serinc5, respectively (Fig. 2A). Moreover, four novel mammalian family proteins and five Arabidopsis thaliana family proteins were identified by an NCBI data base search and were termed Serinc2, Serinc3B, Serinc4, Serinc4B, and A. thaliana Serinc I-V, respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, the Serinc family is highly conserved among eukaryotes, whereas no homologs were found in prokaryotic data bases. The mammalian family members share 58-31% amino acid identity (Fig. 2C) and have similar molecular masses (Fig. 2A, 432-473 amino acids). Furthermore, hydropathy analysis revealed that these member proteins contain 58-53% hydrophobic amino acids, clustered into 11 regions of up to 30 amino acids long, suggesting membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 2A, I-XI regions). However, none of the protein functions were known. Comparative Localization and Regulation of Serinc2 and Serinc5 mRNA in Brain—We further examined the mRNA distribution of Serinc2 and Serinc5 in control and seizure-treated rat brains (Fig. 1). Overall levels of Serinc2 hybridization are less than either Serinc1 or Serinc5, although intense staining was apparent in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. Seizures strongly induced Serinc2 mRNA, which is restricted to the dentate gyrus (Fig. 1, center panels, arrow). Serinc5 is distinct from Serinc1 and Serinc2 in the dense staining pattern of the white matter such as the external capsule, corpus callosum, and arbor vitae of the cerebellum. Moreover, in contrast to the up-regulation pattern of Serinc1 and Serinc2, expression of Serinc5 is down-regulated in the hippocampal CA fields and the dentate gyrus by seizures (Fig. 1, right panels, arrow). Thus, the divergent spatial and cellular expression and their different transcriptional controls indicate that the three subtype proteins play multiple distinct roles in the activity-dependent plasticity of the central nervous system. Serinc Protein and Serine Synthetic Enzymes Form an Intracellular Protein Complex—The clue to elucidate the Serinc function came from its interacting proteins. We searched the yeast proteome data base and identified two yeast proteins (SER3 and YGP1) that directly interact with yeast TMS1 (24Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). SER3 and YGP1 function in the biosynthesis of serine (Fig. 3A). Serine is synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate in glycolysis. The first and committed step in this pathway is oxidation to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, catalyzed by the enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (SER3). This α-ketoacid is transaminated to 3-phosphoserine, which is then hydrolyzed to serine by a phosphatase. YGP1 is a glycoprotein of unknown function (25Destruelle M. Holzer H. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2740-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but has a highly conserved domain of asparaginase. The putative asparaginase activity accelerates the serine synthetic pathway through the subsequent transamination reaction to glutamate. These findings suggest the involvement of TMS1 in cellular synthesis of serine. To explore whether mammalian Serinc proteins bind to these serine synthetic enzymes, cDNAs of SER3, YGP1, and their associated proteins were screened by two-hybrid methods using rat Serinc1 as bait (Fig. 3B). Both SER3 and YGP1 were identified as strong interacting partners of rat Serinc1, and PHO12 was identified as a weak interactor. The result indicates that the specific binding to serine synthetic enzymes is conserved among distant members of the Serinc family. Serinc1 Specifically Enhances the Incorporation of Serine Molecules into the Membrane Lipid, Phosphatidylserine—To investigate the effect of Serinc proteins on cellular serine, we expressed rat Serinc1 in E. coli and mammalian COS cells, first monitoring their cellular and vesicular uptake of [3H]serine. [3H]Serine uptake into Serinc1-expressing E. coli cells was 102 ± 4% of the base rate of control cells (42 ± 0.8 pmol/min/mg of protein), and [3H]serine uptake into Serinc1-expressing COS cells was 99 ± 3% of the base rate of control cells (530 ± 13 pmol/min/mg of protein). Thus, the serine transport across these membranes was unaffected by Serinc1, which supports the idea that Serinc is not an amino acid transporter. However, when the E. coli lysate was incubated with [3H]serine, we found that expression of Serinc1 remarkably enhanced the incorporation of [3H]serine into its chloroform-soluble fraction. Examination of the radiolabeled products by thin-layer chromatography revealed that the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine increased by more than 10-fold over the base level (Fig. 4B, middle panel, left two lanes). In E. coli cells, serine is incorporated into phosphatidylserine by the catalytic action of phosphatidylserine synthase (Fig. 4A). But phosphatidylserine is found only in trace amounts in the cell because it is rapidly converted to phosphatidylethanolamine, which constitutes about 70% of the phospholipid of this organism (Fig. 4B, left panel), by the presence of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (26Dowhan W. Wickner W.T. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3079-3084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Therefore, this finding indicates that cellular expression of Serinc1 enhances phosphatidylserine synthesis from [3H]serine. Similarly, when [14C]glucose was incubated with the E. coli lysate, Serinc1 enhanced the radioactivity of phosphatidylethanolamine by more than 16-fold over the base level (Fig. 4B, middle panel, right two lanes), which reflects the functional link between a Serinc protein and serine synthetic enzymes. Overexposure of a film revealed that Serinc1 enhanced the [3H]phosphatidylserine synthesis to a detectable level (Fig. 4B, right panel, 2nd lane). To verify further that Serinc1 enhances phosphatidylserine biosynthesis, the conversion of phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine was blocked by utilizing the decarboxylase inhibitor hydroxylamine (NH4OCl) (11Dowhan W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B, right panel, 3rd and 6th lanes). Although Serinc1-dependent enhancements of phosphatidylethanolamine completely disappeared in the presence of 10 mm hydroxylamine, [3H]phosphatidylserine accumulated further (Fig. 4B, right panel, 3rd lane) through the action of Serinc1. The imbalance between levels of [3H]phosphatidylserine accumulation and [3H]phosphatidylethanolamine disappearance reflected a cellular feedback regulatory mechanism that reduces the rate of [3H]phosphatidylserine synthesis compared with the amount of accumulation in the presence of hydroxylamine. Although other E. coli lipids were faintly radiolabeled by way of other serine metabolic pathways (Fig. 4B, left two panels, asterisk), these activities were unaffected by Serinc1 (right panel, asterisk), indicating the specific action on phosphatidylserine synthesis. Membrane Localization of Serinc1 Protein and Function—Specific membrane localization of Serinc1 protein was demonstrated by immunoblotting the total, soluble, and membrane preparations from E. coli cells expressing GST-tagged Serinc1 (Fig. 4C). We incubated the membrane fraction of native Serinc1-expressing E. coli with [3H]serine and CDP-diacylglycerol and monitored the activity of phosphatidylserine synthase (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the result of the experiment using lysates, activity enhancement of phosphatidylserine synthase to 3.1-fold of the base level (190 ± 10 pmol/min/mg of protein) was detected in the membranes through the action of Serinc1. These results, together with the predicted topography of 11 transmembrane domains, indicate that a Serinc1 protein localizes in cell membranes, resulting in an acceleration of their phosphatidylserine synthesis rates. Enhancement of the Phosphatidylserine and Sphingolipid Biosynthesis by Expression of Serinc1 in Mammalian and Yeast ER Membranes—Because Serinc family proteins are found in various eukaryotes, the cellular function was reinvestigated with experiments using cultured mammalian COS cells. COS cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged and native Serinc1 plasmids to examine the subcellular distribution and func"
https://openalex.org/W2054978326,"Opioid and tachykinin systems are involved in modulation of pain transmission in the spinal cord. Regulation of surface opioid receptors on nociceptive afferents is critical for opioid analgesia. Plasma-membrane insertion of delta-opioid receptors (DORs) is induced by stimulus-triggered exocytosis of DOR-containing large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), but how DORs become sorted into the regulated secretory pathway is unknown. Here we report that direct interaction between protachykinin and DOR is responsible for sorting of DORs into LDCVs, allowing stimulus-induced surface insertion of DORs and DOR-mediated spinal analgesia. This interaction is mediated by the substance P domain of protachykinin and the third luminal domain of DOR. Furthermore, deletion of the preprotachykinin A gene reduced stimulus-induced surface insertion of DORs and abolished DOR-mediated spinal analgesia and morphine tolerance. Thus, protachykinin is essential for modulation of the sensitivity of nociceptive afferents to opioids, and the opioid and tachykinin systems are directly linked by protachykinin/DOR interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2153348212,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein whose expression is markedly up-regulated during inflammation and infection. The physiological function of SAA is unclear. In this study, we reported that SAA promotes cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by scavenger receptor B-I (SR-BI). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, SAA promoted cellular cholesterol efflux in an SR-BI-dependent manner, whereas apoA-I did not. Similarly, SAA, but not apoA-I, promoted cholesterol efflux from HepG2 cells in an SR-BI-dependent manner as shown by using the SR-BI inhibitor BLT-1. When SAA was overexpressed in HepG2 cells using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, the endogenously expressed SAA promoted SR-BI-dependent efflux. To assess the effect of SAA on SR-BI-mediated efflux to high density lipoprotein (HDL), we compared normal HDL, acute phase HDL (AP-HDL, prepared from mice injected with lipopolysaccharide), and AdSAA-HDL (HDL prepared from mice overexpressing SAA). Both AP-HDL and AdSAA-HDL promoted 2-fold greater cholesterol efflux than normal HDL. Lipid-free SAA was shown to also stimulate ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in fibroblasts, in line with an earlier report (Stonik, J. A., Remaley, A. T., Demosky, S. J., Neufeld, E. B., Bocharov, A., and Brewer, H. B. (2004) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 321, 936–941). When added to cells together, SAA and HDL exerted a synergistic effect in promoting ABCA1-dependent efflux, suggesting that SAA may remodel HDL in a manner that releases apoA-I or other efficient ABCA1 ligands from HDL. SAA also facilitated efflux by a process that was independent of SR-BI and ABCA1. We conclude that the acute phase protein SAA plays an important role in HDL cholesterol metabolism by promoting cellular cholesterol efflux through a number of different efflux pathways.

Med. 2002; 21: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SAA synthesis is induced by inflammatory stimuli mainly in the liver, although induction of SAA synthesis also occurs in adipocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, myocytes, and macrophages (2Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). During the acute phase response, SAA synthesis accounts for as much as 2.5% of total protein production in the liver, and plasma SAA levels can reach 1 mg/ml, suggesting a beneficial role for SAA in host defense. SAA is present in plasma mainly as an HDL apolipoprotein and can replace apoA-I as the major HDL protein (4Clifton P.M. Mackinnon A.M. Barter P.J. J.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). For example, various studies have suggested that SAA plays a role in inflammatory processes, probably acting via the G-protein-coupled receptor FPRL1 (7Urieli-Shoval S. Linke R.P. Matzner Y. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 8Su S.B. Gong W. Gao J.L. Shen W. Murphy P.M. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). As an HDL apolipoprotein, it is plausible that SAA influences HDL function, including the role of HDL in cholesterol transport. SAA has been reported in some (9Hayat S. Raynes J.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kisilevsky R. Tam S.P. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2257-2269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) but not all (11Banka C.L. Yuan T. de Beer M.C. Kindy M. Curtiss L.K. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studies to facilitate cholesterol efflux from macrophages to HDL. More importantly, SAA was recently shown to promote specifically both ABCA1-dependent and ABCA1-independent cholesterol and phospholipids efflux from cells (1Stonik J.A. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A. Brewer H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that SAA may promote cholesterol removal from cells and perhaps extracellular lipid deposits at sites of inflammation and tissue repair. Scavenger receptor SR-BI is an HDL receptor that mediates cellular uptake of cholesterol ester from HDL by a mechanism known as selective lipid uptake (12Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Connelly M.A. Williams D.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SR-BI-dependent selective lipid uptake in the liver plays a key role in HDL cholesterol clearance, thereby facilitating reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery to the liver. The receptor exhibits a broad ligand binding specificity and binds low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, and oxidized lipoproteins in addition to HDL (12Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). SR-BI also binds anionic phospholipids as well as the apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-III, and E, either as lipid-bound or as free apolipoproteins. In addition to mediating selective uptake, SR-BI facilitates the efflux of cellular free cholesterol to HDL. We reported recently that SAA is a high affinity ligand for SR-BI that exerts an inhibitory effect on HDL binding and selective lipid uptake (14Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that SAA, unlike apoA-I, promotes both SR-BI-dependent and SR-BI-independent cholesterol efflux from cells and that the presence of SAA on HDL is associated with increased cholesterol efflux to HDL. In addition, SAA was shown to function in a synergistic manner with HDL in promoting ABCA1-dependent efflux. Materials—Human apoA-I and recombinant human SAA (corresponding to human SAA1α except for the presence of an N-terminal methionine and substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 60 and arginine for histidine at position 71) were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ).

Animals—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mouse SAA overexpression was obtained by tail vein injection of a second generation recombinant adenovirus expressing the mouse CE/J isoform of SAA that closely resembles both SAA1 and SAA2 (16de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C.

For biochemical assays, CHO cells were grown in 12-well clusters (Corning Corp., Corning, NY). Human skin fibroblasts and Tangier disease fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. John Oram (Washington University, Seattle). Fibroblasts were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (BSA), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HepG2 cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Eagle, from ATCC) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate. Adenoviral mediated gene overexpression of SAA, apoE3, and apoA-I in HepG2 cells was performed by addition of Ad-Null, Ad-apoE3, Ad-SAA, or Ad-apoA-I at a viral dose of 6 × 103 particles per cell. The production of replication-defective adenoviruses expressing human apoA-I and apoE3 was described previously (19Tsukamoto K. Hiester K.G. Smith P. Usher D.C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1869-1876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol Efflux Determination—Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined essentially as described (20Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For cholesterol efflux experiments, cells (about 70% confluent) in 12-well plates were labeled with 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (35–50 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in medium for 48 h. Cells were then washed five times with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and equilibrated in serum-free medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA for 16 h. Thereafter, cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in media with or without lipoproteins or free apolipoproteins, as indicated in the legends to figures. Following incubation, the medium was collected, and cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and then three times with PBS only at 4 °C. Radioactivity in the media was measured directly in a Packard β liquid scintillation counter. Cellular lipid was extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2 v/v) for 30 min at room temperature and counted for radioactivity. Lipid-extracted cells were solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH for protein determination. Efflux of cellular [3H]cholesterol to media is expressed as a percentage of total radioactivity in media and cells. Efflux was calculated as the percentage of counts in the medium to the counts in the medium and cells together. SR-BI-specific values were calculated as the difference between the efflux values in CHO-SRBI cells and control CHO-A7 cells. In fibroblast experiments, ABCA1 expression was up-regulated following 3H labeling by treating cells for 48 h with 30 μg/ml free cholesterol in DMEM containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA. Efflux experiments were carried out in BSA-containing medium with or without ligands for 16 h. The ability of SAA to function as an acceptor for SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux from cells was tested using purified lipid-free SAA. Like apoA-I, SAA was shown recently to bind to SR-BI as a high affinity ligand (14Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Kurlander R. Chen Z. Kimelman M.L. Remaley A.T. Csako G.

Fig. 1A shows that lipid-free SAA (10 and 30 μg/ml) mediated cellular cholesterol efflux in an SR-BI-dependent manner from CHO cells expressing human SR-BI. SR-BI-specific values are shown for a 5-h efflux period and calculated as the difference in efflux from CHO-SRBI and control CHO-A7 cells. Values for efflux in control cells represented 20–30% of the efflux from SR-BI-expressing cells. SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux was less than that observed to human HDL, although greater than the low efflux observed to apoA-I. Efflux to SAA was concentration-dependent and tended to reach a maximum at the higher SAA concentrations used (Fig. 1B). At higher concentrations, cholesterol efflux to SAA approached the value for HDL. SAA also facilitated cholesterol efflux in a manner that was SR-BI independent, as indicated by the efflux values in the control cells not expressing SR-BI. The ability of SAA to facilitate cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes was addressed by using HepG2 cells. These cells express endogenous SR-BI that mediates selective lipid uptake from HDL. As shown for CHO-SRBI cells, SAA mediated significant cholesterol efflux from HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, efflux to apoA-I was, as for CHO-SRBI cells, considerably lower than efflux to SAA. To assess the role of SR-BI in cholesterol efflux from HepG2 cells, BLT-1, an inhibitor of SR-BI-mediated efflux (22Nieland T.J. Penman M. Dori L. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was tested. BLT-1 inhibited SAA-dependent efflux from HepG2 cells by ∼60–70%, and HDL-mediated efflux by about 30–40% (Fig. 2B). The same inhibitor reduced SR-BI-dependent cholesterol efflux in CHO cells by about 70% (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that in HepG2 cells the bulk of cellular efflux to SAA is mediated by SR-BI. To assess whether SAA produced endogenously in cells is able to facilitate cholesterol efflux from cells, SAA was overexpressed in HepG2 cells by means of adenoviral mediated gene transfer, and cholesterol efflux was then measured. For comparison, apoA-I and apoE3 were also examined. In each case, gene transfer resulted in the cellular expression and secretion of apolipoprotein into the medium. Apolipoprotein quantification by Western blotting using purified protein standards showed similar levels of each of the apolipoproteins in the cell media at the end of the efflux period (SAA, 9 μg/ml; apoA-I, 11 μg/ml; apoE3, 10 μg/ml). Overexpression of SAA increased cholesterol efflux ∼1.5-fold (Fig. 3). ApoE3 overexpression similarly increased cholesterol efflux about 1.7-fold. ApoA-I overexpression, on the other hand, had no effect on efflux, in line with the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2. To assess whether the presence of SAA on HDL influences the ability of HDL to serve as an acceptor for SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux, SAA-HDL, AP-HDL, and control mouse HDL were compared in their ability to facilitate efflux. SAA-HDL was isolated from mice overexpressing SAA through adenoviral mediated gene transfer (17Webb N.R. de Beer M.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Kindy M.S. Banka C.L. Tsukamoto K. Rader D.L. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1583-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP-HDL was isolated from mice following lipopolysaccharide injection. Compared with control normal mouse HDL, both AdSAA-HDL and AP-HDL showed significantly greater (2–3-fold) efflux from CHO-SRBI cells (Fig. 4A). Similar results showing increased cholesterol efflux to the SAA-containing HDLs were obtained when efflux to the three ligands was measured in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast to SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux, efflux-mediated by ABCA1, the well studied cholesterol transporter, was not influenced by the SAA enrichment of HDL (Fig. 5A). Most interestingly, neither SAA-HDL nor AP-HDL showed a greater ability than normal HDL to facilitate ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts. To investigate the ability of SAA to function in cellular cholesterol efflux facilitated by ABCA1, we measured cholesterol efflux to lipid-free SAA or apoA-I in normal human fibroblasts and fibroblasts lacking functional ABCA1 obtained from a patient with Tangier disease. SAA, like apoA-I, was able to function as an acceptor of cellular cholesterol (Fig. 5B). Although at higher concentrations the two apolipoproteins appeared similar in their ability to mediate efflux, at lower concentrations apoA-1 was a more efficient ligand than SAA. SAA can displace apoA-I from HDL and become the major apolipoprotein of HDL (4Clifton P.M. Mackinnon A.M. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 1389-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Coetzee G.A. Strachan A.F. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that SAA might indirectly affect ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by displacing apoA-I from HDL, cholesterol efflux to HDL was measured in the presence or absence of SAA. As shown in Fig. 6, both lipid-free apoA-I and SAA functioned as acceptors for cellular cholesterol. As expected (Fig. 5B), SAA served as a less efficient acceptor than apoA-I. The addition of apoA-I to HDL resulted in an additive increase in efflux. Most interestingly, the addition of SAA to HDL results in a synergistic type of increase in efflux so that efflux in the presence of both SAA and HDL always exceeded the sum of the efflux values for SAA and HDL when added alone. These results support the hypothesis that SAA affects ABCA1 efflux by displacing apoA-I or other apoA-I-containing fractions that are efficient ABCA1 ligands, from HDL.FIGURE 6SAA and HDL exert a synergistic effect in promoting ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux. ABCA1-dependent efflux was carried out in human skin fibroblasts as described in Fig. 5. ABCA1-dependent efflux was performed at 37 °C for 16 h by incubating cells with apoA-I, SAA, human HDL3, or SAA and HDL3 together. Values represent the average of triplicate determinations (mean ± S.D.). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we report that the acute phase protein SAA, like HDL, facilitates SR-BI-dependent efflux of cholesterol from both CHO cells and the hepatocyte cell line HepG2. The ability of lipid-free SAA to mediate cholesterol efflux was significantly greater than that of apoA-I in each cell type. Enhanced cellular cholesterol efflux was also observed in response to SAA produced within cells, as shown using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the protein. Enrichment of HDL with SAA also significantly increased SR-BI-dependent cholesterol efflux to HDL. Lipid-free SAA was shown to also stimulate ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, in line with an earlier report (1Stonik J.A. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A. Brewer H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, when added to cells together with HDL, SAA exerted a synergistic effect in increasing ABCA1-dependent efflux, suggesting that SAA may remodel HDL in a manner that releases apoA-I, an efficient ABCA1 ligand, from HDL. In addition to SR-BI- and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, SAA also facilitated a degree of efflux that was independent of these two receptors. Efflux of cholesterol from cells occurs by two main mechanisms, namely passive diffusion from the plasma membrane and an active efflux mediated mainly by ABCA1 to lipoproteins (23Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI also facilitates cellular cholesterol efflux to HDL (24Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), and evidence suggests that this receptor acts by allowing bi-directional cholesterol flux according to the cholesterol concentration gradient between the plasma membrane and phospholipid-containing acceptor particles (25Yancey P.G. de la Llera-Moya M. Swarnakar S. Monzo P. Klein S.M. Connelly M.A. Johnson W.J. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36596-36604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Phospholipid-enriched HDLs generally function as the most effective acceptors for SR-BI-dependent efflux. This is in clear contrast to ABCA1-dependent efflux, for which the best acceptors are lipid-free or lipid-depleted apolipoproteins (26Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In the case of SR-BI-dependent efflux, there is some uncertainty if efflux requires HDL binding or docking to the receptor, as suggested by some studies (27Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), or if efflux is independent of direct HDL binding and promoted rather through an ability of SR-BI to alter cellular cholesterol distribution and to increase cholesterol concentration in an accessible pool in the plasma membrane outer leaflet (28Kellner-Weibel G. de La Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Stoudt G. Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that lipid-free SAA, but not apoA-I, is an effective acceptor for SR-BI-dependent efflux. The mechanism of such efflux is not yet understood. We recently reported that SAA is a high affinity ligand for SR-BI (14Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Such binding to SR-BI might facilitate the transfer of membrane cholesterol to SAA, a protein known to bind cholesterol with a 1:1 stoichiometry (29Liang J.S. Sipe J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the calculated molar amount of cholesterol effluxed from cells exceeds that of SAA in the medium by ∼10-fold, indicating that direct binding of cholesterol to SAA could only account for a small fraction of the effluxed cholesterol in the medium. Another possibility is that SR-BI-dependent efflux does not require direct binding of SAA to SR-BI but rather is the consequence of SR-BI expanding the accessible membrane cholesterol pool (28Kellner-Weibel G. de La Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Stoudt G. Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this case, SAA may promote efflux through a detergent-like extraction process as has been suggested by Stonik et al. (1Stonik J.A. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A. Brewer H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in the case of ABCA1-independent cholesterol efflux to SAA. In the case of SR-BI-dependent efflux, SAA binding to the receptor at the cell surface may serve to promote such an extraction or microsolubilization process. In contrast to SAA, apoA-I is much less efficient in promoting both SR-BI-dependent and SR-BI-independent cholesterol efflux. This may relate to a higher affinity of cholesterol for SAA than for apoA-I and greater interfacial surface binding properties of SAA compared with apoA-I (5Coetzee G.A. Strachan A.F. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SAA can displace apoA-I from HDL, suggesting a greater lipid binding affinity of SAA than apoA-I. To test how the presence of SAA on HDL may influence SR-BI-dependent cholesterol efflux, we overexpressed SAA in C57BL/6 mice using adenoviral mediated gene transfer (17Webb N.R. de Beer M.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Kindy M.S. Banka C.L. Tsukamoto K. Rader D.L. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1583-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDL from these mice was enriched in SAA, as is typical for acute phase HDL, with SAA being the second most abundant apolipoprotein (5Coetzee G.A. Strachan A.F. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Webb N.R. de Beer M.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Kindy M.S. Banka C.L. Tsukamoto K. Rader D.L. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1583-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternative approach, we also assessed SAA-enriched HDL isolated from acute phase mice following the injection of lipopolysaccharide. For both types of HDL, SR-BI-dependent efflux in CHO cells as well as HepG2 cells was significantly increased compared with control mouse HDL. Increased efflux occurred despite increased levels of unesterified cholesterol in both types of SAA-enriched particles (14Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These results are in line with earlier reports showing that the presence of SAA on HDL increased efflux from cholesterol-loaded macrophages, although the receptors involved in those studies were not identified (30Tam S.P. Flexman A. Hulme J. Kisilevsky R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1410-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which SAA on HDL stimulates efflux is not clear but apparently does not relate to changes in HDL binding to SR-BI or changes in HDL phospholipid content, both of which are relatively unchanged in the SAA-enriched HDL (14Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, SAA-enriched particles were not more effective than control HDL in mediating ABCA1-dependent efflux, indicating that SAA influences these two efflux pathways differently. Lipid-free SAA has been shown previously to promote ABCA1-dependent as well as ABCA1-independent efflux, and our results using normal and Tangier disease fibroblasts confirm these findings (1Stonik J.A. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A. Brewer H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To assess the relative effectiveness of the two apolipoproteins more closely, we compared ABCA1-dependent efflux rates at different ligand concentrations. ApoA-I functioned more effectively at lower concentrations than SAA, but at higher concentrations the two proteins exhibited similar activity. SAA also promoted efflux from fibroblasts independently of ABCA1, whereas apoA-I was ineffective in the absence of ABCA1. In additional studies we made the interesting observation that when added to HDL, SAA, but not apoA-I, resulted in a level of efflux that was more than additive compared with efflux to the two acceptors added individually. This finding suggests that SAA may promote efflux directly through ABCA1 as well as indirectly through its interaction with HDL. SAA can displace apoA-I from HDL (11Banka C.L. Yuan T. de Beer M.C. Kindy M. Curtiss L.K. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and such lipid-free apoA-I would serve as an efficient ABCA1 ligand. Alternatively, it is possible that the addition of SAA to HDL may result in the remodeling of HDL particles with the generation of highly efficient ABCA1 ligands such as pre-β HDL. The stimulation of cholesterol efflux by SAA through ABCA1- and SR-BI-dependent mechanisms, as well as by a receptor-independent process, provides evidence that SAA plays a physiological role in promoting cholesterol efflux from cells and reverse cholesterol transport during inflammation and the acute phase response. SAA appears to be well placed for such a role. SAA synthesis is markedly induced (up to 1000-fold) during the acute phase response (2Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Although the liver is the major site of SAA synthesis, SAA is also produced in macrophages, adipocytes, enterocytes, and myocytes (2Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). SAA has also been found in atherosclerotic plaques (31Meek R.L. Urieli-Shoval S. Benditt E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The endocytosis of SAA has been proposed to explain the increased ability of acute phase HDL to promote cellular cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-laden macrophages (30Tam S.P. Flexman A. Hulme J. Kisilevsky R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1410-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although not from non-lipid-loaded macrophages (30Tam S.P. Flexman A. Hulme J. Kisilevsky R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1410-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These studies did not identify the receptor(s) responsible for SAA-induced efflux. Internalization of SAA by macrophages has been shown, and the SAA2.1 isoform or SAA2.1-derived peptides have been reported to regulate inversely the intracellular acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase and cholesterol esterase activities in a manner that elevates cellular free cholesterol and consequently cholesterol efflux (10Kisilevsky R. Tam S.P. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2257-2269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SR-BI is expressed in activated macrophages (32Hirano K. Yamashita S. Nakagawa Y. Ohya T. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Okamoto Y. Matsuyama A. Matsumoto K. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and also in atherosclerotic lesions (33Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z. Antonucci M. Poulain P. Chapman J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and we have reported that SR-BI internalizes SAA (14Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of SR-BI to SAA uptake in macrophages is not known. The liver represents the major site of SAA synthesis. The finding that SAA facilitates cholesterol efflux through ABCA1- and SR-BI-dependent pathways, as well as a nonreceptor mechanism, suggests that SAA may serve to promote cholesterol efflux also from the liver. Based on our findings, efflux to SAA-enriched HDL through SR-BI would be expected to increase. Lipid-free SAA would also increase efflux. Although the bulk of SAA in plasma is associated with lipoproteins, largely HDL, it is possible that sufficient SAA may exist in lipid-free form to promote significant efflux (7Urieli-Shoval S. Linke R.P. Matzner Y. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 34Wang L. Colon W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence suggests that newly synthesized SAA is secreted in a lipid-free form from hepatocytes (35Morrow J.F. Stearman R.S. Peltzman C.G. Potter D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and we propose that within the confines of the space of Disse in the liver, secreted SAA would serve to facilitate cholesterol efflux during the acute phase response when SAA is subject to marked induction. Infection and inflammation are associated with a general reduction in HDL and cholesterol levels (36Sammalkorpi K. Valtonen V. Kerttula Y. Nikkila E. Taskinen M.R. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 859-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and although it has been thought that SAA in HDL might be responsible for reduced HDL, recent evidence indicates that this is not the case. It is clear that the decrease in HDL is rapid and precedes the increase in SAA (37Ly H. Francone O.L. Fielding C.J. Shigenaga J.K. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1254-1263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increased expression of SAA does not decrease plasma HDL in the absence of infection or inflammation (38Hosoai H. Webb N.R. Glick J.M. Tietge U.J. Purdom M.S. de Beer F.C. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 648-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that SAA functions rather to contribute to the maintenance of HDL and cholesterol levels during the acute phase by decreasing SR-BI-mediated HDL cholesterol ester uptake (14Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2954-2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or, on the other hand, by promoting liver cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, our findings indicate that SAA promotes cellular cholesterol efflux through SR-BI- and ABCA1-dependent pathways as well as a nonreceptor process. During the acute phase response, SAA influences cellular and HDL cholesterol metabolism through its effects on HDL cholesterol ester uptake by SR-BI and its effects on cellular cholesterol efflux through different efflux pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2058702798,"Glutamate excitotoxicity is increasingly being recognized as a pathogenic mechanism in autoimmune inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes are the predominant players in clearing the extracellular space from glutamate and normally have extensive spare capacities in terms of glutamate uptake. We asked what might be the basis of glutamate accumulation in T cell triggered autoimmune inflammation. In vitro, coculture of primary rat astrocytes with activated myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells resulted in a decrease of astrocytic glutamate uptake rates (Vmax). In parallel, the amount of the Na+-dependent glutamate transporter GLAST was reduced within 48-60 h. Significant decreases of GLAST protein were observed in astrocytes harvested after incubation with T cells activated by MBP during coculture or after incubation with T cell blasts preactivated in the presence of splenocytes beforehand. Since exposure of astrocytes to cell-free supernatant of MBP-activated T cells also resulted in reduced expression of GLAST, a humoral factor appeared to be the driving agent. In blocking experiments using neutralizing antibodies and by incubation of astrocytes with recombinant cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was identified as being responsible for the down-modulation of GLAST. GLAST was also down-regulated in the CNS of autoimmune encephalomyelitic rats but not in animals suffering from systemic inflammation. Since the loss of GLAST was not confined to inflammatory infiltrates, here too, a humoral factor seemed to be causative. In conclusion, T cell derived TNF-alpha impairs glutamate clearance capacity of astrocytes in vitro and probably also in vivo providing a pathogenic link to glutamate excitotoxicity that may contribute to early axonal dysfunction remote from active autoimmune inflammatory demyelination."
https://openalex.org/W1969138776,"Drosophila MSL-2 is the limiting component of the dosage compensation complex. Female flies must inhibit msl-2 mRNA translation for survival, and this inhibition is mediated by Sex-lethal (SXL) binding to sites in both the 5' and the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Here, we uncover the mechanism by which SXL achieves tight control of translation initiation. SXL binding to the 3'UTR regulatory region inhibits the recruitment of 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes to the mRNA. Ribosomal complexes escaping this block and binding to the 5' end of the mRNA are challenged by SXL bound to the 5'UTR, which interferes with scanning to the downstream initiation codon of the mRNA. This failsafe mechanism thus forms the molecular basis of a critical step in dosage compensation. The results also elucidate a two step principle of translational control via multiple regulatory sites within an mRNA."

In the present study we have examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) exposed to oxidant stress. Hydrogen peroxide and pervanadate (PV) treatment stimulates eNOS tyrosine phosphorylation in BAECs. Phosphorylation is blocked by the Src kinase family inhibitor, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2). Moreover, eNOS and c-Src can be coimmunoprecipitated from BAEC lysates by antibodies directed against either protein. Domain mapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies in COS-7 cells transfected with either eNOS alone and then treated with PV or cotransfected with eNOS and constitutively active v-Src identified Tyr-83 (bovine sequence) as the major eNOS tyrosine phosphorylation site. Tyr-83 phosphorylation is associated with a 3-fold increase in basal NO release from cotransfected cells. Furthermore, the Y83F eNOS mutation attenuated thapsigargin-stimulated NO production. Taken together, these data indicate that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS at Tyr-83 modulates eNOS activity in endothelial cells.

Earlier it was reported that treatment of endothelial cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors attenuated NO production in response to shear stress (15Ayajiki K. Kindermann M. Hecker M. Fleming I.

Given the possibility that oxidative stress may occur in vivo under certain pathophysiological conditions including those of inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury, we sought to identify the tyrosine kinase(s) involved and the site(s) of eNOS tyrosine phosphorylation. Materials—Anti-eNOS antibody (#610297) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (#610000) were obtained form BD Biosciences. Antiphospho-Thr-497 eNOS antibody (#05-811), anti-phospho-Ser-617 eNOS antibody (#07-561), anti-phospho-Ser-635 antibody (#07-562), anti-phospho-Ser-1179 eNOS antibody (#07-428), anti-Src antibody (#05-184), and normal mouse IgG (#12-371) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Mouse IgG Trueblot™ horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was obtained from eBioscience (18-8877). Anti-V5 antibody (#R960-25) came from Invitrogen. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from VEC Technologies and used for experiments in passages 2–6. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—BAECs or COS-7 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaF, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble material and were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 2 h at 4°C with rocking. Agarose beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g. eNOS in precleared lysates was immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with rocking after the addition of either anti-eNOS antibody (10 μl) or anti-V5 antibody (3 μl). Immunoprecipitated protein was eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates or cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-eNOS antibody (1:5000 dilution), anti-V5 antibody (1:10,000 dilution), anti-Src antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-Thr-497 eNOS antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-Ser-617 eNOS antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-Ser-635 antibody (1:1000 dilution), or antiphospho-Ser-1179 eNOS antibody (1:1000 dilution). In Vitro Phosphorylation—Recombinant wild-type bovine eNOS was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (11McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Purified eNOS (1 μg) was incubated with 200 ng of active Src (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with or without 100 μm ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Peptide substrates eNOS (73–92, VKNWELGSITYDTLCAQSQQ and eNOS (73–92) VKNWELGSITFDTLCAQSQQ, Genscript Corp.) were phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant Src for 30 min at 30 °C using 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (45 cpm/pmol). Phosphorylated peptide was separated from [γ-32P]ATP by ion exchange chromatography. In brief, the kinase assay was terminated with 30% acetic acid, and the reaction mixture was applied to polypropylene columns containing 2 ml of anion exchange resin (AG1-X8 resin, Bio-Rad). The phosphopeptides were eluted with 30% acetic and quantified by scintillation counting of Cerenkov radiation (18Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in Src-transduced Endothelial Cells—A replication-deficient adenovirus encoding an active form of Src kinase (v-Src, GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number BC011566) and a dominant negative Src (K296R/Y528F) were generated using the pAdEasy system developed by He et al. (19He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Confluent BAECs were transduced with adenoviruses expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) only (negative control) or expressing GFP plus v-Src at a multiplicity of infection of 100. After 24 h cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, and eNOS was partially purified by affinity binding to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Phosphorylation in Transfected COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected with various forms of eNOS with or without v-Src cotransfection using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Varying concentrations of the empty expression vector, pcDNA3, were used to balance the amount of DNA used per transfection. After overnight transfection, cells were lysed, and eNOS was affinity-purified with 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Domain Mapping of Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites in eNOS—Fragments of bovine eNOS containing potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites were generated by PCR amplification. eNOS (1–616) was generated using the following primers: sense, 5′-CACCATGGGCAACTTGAAGAGTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCTGTTGAAGCGGATCTTG-3′. The fragment was subcloned in-frame into the TOPO cloning sites of the expression vector, pcDNA3.1/V5, which contains a C-terminal V5 epitope tag. eNOS (Δ76–615) was generated using the following primers: sense, 5′-GCGGCCGCAGGCGGCAGCAACAGCGTCTCCTGCTCAGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCTAGATTCAGGGGCCGGGGGTGTCTG-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the NotI and XbaI sites of the eNOS “targeting” vector in pcDNA3. The eNOS targeting sequence, which comprises the first 75 amino acids of eNOS, was generated using the following primers: sense, 5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGGGCAACTTGAAGAGTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCGGCCGCGTTCTTCACGCGAGGGAACTTG-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the expression vector, pcDNA3, via the Hind III and NotI sites. The eNOS (1–616) sequence was subdivided into 5 fragments of ∼100 amino acids in length corresponding to residues 75–200, 200–300, 300–400, and 500–615. These fragments were generated by PCR and subcloned into the Δ75–615 construct via the NotI and EcoRI sites. The 75–200 fragment was generated with the following primers: sense, 5′-GCGGCCGCATGGGAGCTGGGGAGCATCAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GAATTCCTGGCATCAAACACCTGCAGC-3′. Primers for the 200–300 fragment were sense, 5′-GCGGCCGCCCGGGACTGCAGCTCAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GAATTCCTCTCGTCTGGGGCCTGGAG-3′. Primers for the 300–400 fragment were sense, 5′-GCGGCCGCAGAGGCTCCAGAGCTCTTTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GAATTCCTCGCCTTGTCCTTCCACAG-3′. Primers for the 400–500 fragment were sense, 5′-GCGGCCGCAGTGGAGATCAACCTGGCTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GAATTCCTTTCCTTAAAGGTCTTCTTC-3′. Primers for the 500–616 fragment were sense, 5′-GCGGCCGCAGAAGTGGCCAACGCGGTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GAATTCCTGTTGAAGCGGATCTTGTAAC-3′. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-specific point mutations were generated by PCR as described previously (9Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). The primer for the Y83F mutant was 5′-GCTGGGGAGCATCACCTtCGACACTCTGTGCGCGC-3′. The primer for the Y136/7F mutant was 5′-GGACTTCATCAACCAGTtCTtCAGCTCCATCAAGAGGAG-3′. The primer for the Y165F mutant was 5′-GCATCCACGGGCACCTtCCACCTCCGAGAGAGCG-3′. The primer for the S1179A mutant was 5′-GCCGTATACGTACCCAGgcCTTTTCCCTGCAGGAGC-3′. All sequences of mutant eNOS constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing in the Genomics Core Facility of the Medical College of Georgia. Nitric Oxide Release—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutant (Y83F, T136/7F, Y165F, and S1179A) eNOS constructs with or without transfection with dominant negative c-Src or active v-Src, and NO release was determined as described previously (9Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 45 min and then either not stimulated or stimulated with thapsigargin (100 nm), H2O2 (10 mm), or pervanadate (200 μm) for 25 min. Basal and stimulated NO release was determined via NO-specific chemiluminescence using a Sievers 280i NO analyzer (Ionic Instruments, Boulder, CO). Confluent BAECs were transduced with adenoviruses encoding red fluorescent protein (RFP) (control), v-Src, and dominant negative (DN) Src at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Twenty-four hours later cells were analyzed for basal and stimulated NO release as described above. Measurement of eNOS Enzymatic Activity—Purified eNOS (1 μg) was phosphorylated by purified Src as described above or was subjected to identical treatment with heat-denatured Src and then assayed for eNOS activity by monitoring the rate of formation of l-[14C]citrulline from l-[14C] arginine (100 μm) in the presence of excess cofactors including Ca2+ (2 mm), calmodulin (200 units), NADPH (1 mm), FAD (4 μm), FMN (4 μm), and tetrahydrobiopterin (40 μm). Product was separated from substrate on Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange column. Ca2+ Measurements Using Fluo-3—COS-7 cells transfected with either active Src or empty vector (pcDNA3) were incubated with a loading solution consisting of physiological saline (120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm Ca2+, pH 7.3) supplemented with 2 μm Fluo-3/AM, 0.02% pluronic F-127, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h, then incubated in the loading solution without Fluo-3 for 30 min to allow de-esterification of the probe. Loading solution was then replaced with standard physiological saline, and cells were placed in a Fluorimeter (Fluostar) and subjected to the appropriate treatment protocols. Fluorescence intensity (F) was converted into intracellular Ca2+ by using the equation [Ca2+](nM)=Kd(F−FminFmax−F)(Eq. 1) where Fmax was the fluorescence intensity in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm CaCl2, Fmin was the fluorescence intensity in the presence on 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EGTA, and Kd was the dissociation constant for Fluo-3 (390 nm). Garçia-Cardeña et al. (13Garçia-Cardeña G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27237-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have shown previously that eNOS in BAECs is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to H2O2-induced oxidant stress (13Garçia-Cardeña G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27237-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To determine whether oxidant stress might stimulate eNOS phosphorylation by a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, we treated BAECs for 10 min with H2O2 (10 mm) or pervanadate (PV, 200 μm) after either no preincubation or preincubation for 30 min with the Src family-selective inhibitor, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) (1 μm) (20Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, and eNOS was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-eNOS antibody that recognizes a C-terminal epitope in eNOS. As shown in Fig. 1A,H2O2 and PV both stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS in BAECs. H2O2-induced phosphorylation was completely blocked by PP2, and PV-induced phosphorylation was almost completely blocked, implicating a Src family kinase (or kinases) in oxidant-induced eNOS tyrosine phosphorylation. Anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates were also immunoblotted with anti-eNOS antibody to confirm that the total amount of eNOS precipitated in each condition was equivalent (Fig. 1B). To further investigate whether Src tyrosine kinase might have a role in regulation of eNOS in endothelial cells, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether the two proteins form a complex in BAECs. Cells were lysed, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with non-immune, anti-Src, and anti-eNOS antibodies. Anti-IgG, anti-Src, and anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-eNOS antibody and anti-Src antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, eNOS was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-Src antibody but not by the non-immune IgG. Furthermore, the amount of eNOS immunoprecipitated with the anti-Src antibody was significant as compared with the amount of eNOS immunoprecipitated by the anti-eNOS antibody. In contrast, only a very small amount of c-Src was immunoprecipitated by the anti-eNOS antibody. To confirm that the faint band observed represented c-Src, cells were infected with adenovirus expressing either a control RFP or v-Src. In cells overexpressing v-Src, considerably more Src enzyme was immunoprecipitated by the anti-eNOS antibody (Fig. 2B), confirming the identity of the band as Src. This conclusion was further verified in additional experiments in which no signal for Src was detected in anti-IgG immunoprecipitates, and a very strong signal for Src was detected in anti-Src immunoprecipitates from v-Src overexpressing cells (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Coimmunoprecipitation of eNOS and c-Src from BAECs. BAEC lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either non-immune IgG, anti-Src, or anti-eNOS antibodies. A, anti-IgG, anti-Src, and anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-eNOS antibody. B, anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Src antibody. C, anti-IgG, anti-eNOS, and anti-Src immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Src antibody. Results are representative of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified recombinant bovine eNOS was also tested as a substrate for phosphorylation by purified recombinant human active c-Src. Incubation of eNOS and c-Src in the presence and absence of MgATP for 20 min followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed significant phosphorylation of eNOS in the presence of MgATP (Fig. 3A). A further test of the ability of Src kinase to phosphorylate eNOS in intact cells was carried out using COS-7 cells cotransfected with a plasmid construct encoding bovine eNOS together with increasing amounts of a construct encoding human constitutively active v-Src (0, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 μg). Cells were transfected overnight, and eNOS was partially purified by affinity binding to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-eNOS antibodies. Cell lysates were also blotted with anti-Src antibody. In these experiments v-Src cotransfection dose-dependently stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS (Fig. 3B). Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS was also confirmed in BAECs infected with an adenovirus encoding human v-Src. Cells were infected for 24 h with an adenovirus encoding either GFP only or with an adenovirus encoding both GFP and v-Src. eNOS was then partially purified by affinity binding to 2′, 5′-ADP-Sepharose and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-eNOS antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, v-Src expression stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS without affecting the relative levels of eNOS protein expression. We next examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS in COS-7 cells that were transfected with either eNOS alone and then treated with PV or that were cotransfected with eNOS and v-Src. In addition, we sought to determine whether Src-mediated phosphorylation might be restricted to either the oxygenase domain or reductase domain of the eNOS protein. Plasmid constructs were prepared that expressed full-length wild-type bovine eNOS (residues 1–1205), a V5 epitope-tagged eNOS oxygenase domain protein (1–616), and an eNOS reductase domain deletional mutant in which residues 76–615 were deleted (Δ76–615) (Fig. 4A). The eNOS (1–616) oxygenase domain was expressed with a V5 epitope tag to allow for immunoprecipitation of this protein with anti-V5 antibody. The wild-type and eNOS (Δ76–615) proteins, on the other hand, did not require an epitope tag because they could be immunoprecipitated by the anti-eNOS antibody that recognizes a C-terminal epitope in eNOS. All three eNOS proteins were designed to retain residues 1–75 of eNOS. This sequence does not contain any tyrosine residues (21Nishida K. Harrison D.G. Navas J.P. Fisher A.A. Dockery S.P. Uematsu M. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Murphy T.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) but does contain the Gly-2, Cys-15, and Cys-26 residues that are required for myristoylation and palmitoylation, respectively. These residues were included to ensure proper subcellular targeting of the enzyme to the plasmalemmal and Golgi membranes of transfected cells. Cells were transfected overnight with the wild-type, 1–616, and Δ76–615 forms of eNOS and subjected to either no further treatment (control), stimulated with PV (200 μm for 10 min), or cotransfected with v-Src. Cells were lysed, eNOS was immunoprecipitated with either anti-eNOS or anti-V5 antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, both PV and v-Src cotransfection induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type eNOS and 1–616 eNOS. No tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for Δ76–615 eNOS, suggesting that all of the PV-stimulated and Src phosphorylation sites are located in the eNOS oxygenase domain between amino acids 76 and 615. Immunoblotting with the same antibody used for the immunoprecipitation showed that equivalent amounts of eNOS were immunoprecipitated in each of the three conditions (Fig. 4C). To more narrowly localize the subdomain within the eNOS oxygenase domain that contains the site (or sites) of Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, we carried out the following deletional analysis. The Δ76–615 DNA construct was used as a backbone in which to subclone various fragments of the cDNA encoding bovine eNOS corresponding to amino acids 75–200, 200–300, 300–400, 400–500, and 500–616 of the bovine eNOS oxygenase domain. These constructs are illustrated in Fig. 5A and are termed Δ201–615, Δ76–199/Δ301–615, Δ76–299/Δ401–615, Δ76–399/Δ501–615, and Δ76–499, respectively. These plasmids or the full-length wild-type eNOS-expressing plasmid together with the v-Src-expressing plasmid were used to cotransfect COS-7 cells overnight. Cells were also transfected with the wild-type eNOS plasmid alone as a negative control. After transfection, cells were lysed, and eNOS was immunoprecipitated with anti-eNOS antibody. Precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B, v-Src cotransfection stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of only wild-type eNOS and the Δ201–615 eNOS protein, which when considered together with the data presented in Fig. 4 indicates that the site (or sites) of Src-mediated eNOS tyrosine phosphorylation is located exclusively within the 75–200 sequence of bovine eNOS. Anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates were also immunoblotted with anti-eNOS antibody to confirm that equal quantities of the various eNOS proteins were immunoprecipitated in each condition (Fig. 5C). The bovine eNOS sequence contains four tyrosines between amino acids 75 and 200 located at positions 83, 136, 137, and 165. To determine which site(s) among these four is phosphorylated by Src protein tyrosine kinase, we used site-directed mutagenesis to prepare mutant forms of full-length eNOS in which the various tyrosine residues were changed to phenylalanine residues. COS-7 cells were then transfected with wild-type, Y83F, Y136/7F, or Y165F forms of eNOS before stimulation of cells with PV (200 μm for 10 min). Cells were lysed, eNOS was immunoprecipitated, and immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, PV stimulated equivalent levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type, Y136/7F, and Y165F forms of eNOS but did not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Y83F. Experiments were also carried out in which COS-7 cells were transfected with either wild-type eNOS only or were cotransfected with wild-type, Y83F, Y136/7F, and Y165F forms of eNOS together with v-Src. Consistent with the results of the experiments with PV stimulation, Src transfection induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the wild-type, Y136/7F, and Y165F forms of eNOS but did not induce phosphorylation of the Y83F form of eNOS (Fig. 6B). Immunoblotting of anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates with anti-eNOS antibody confirmed that the differences observed in both"
https://openalex.org/W2003257592,"The Earth's oceanic crust crystallizes from magmatic systems generated at mid-ocean ridges. Whereas a single magma body residing within the mid-crust is thought to be responsible for the generation of the upper oceanic crust, it remains unclear if the lower crust is formed from the same magma body, or if it mainly crystallizes from magma lenses located at the base of the crust. Thermal modelling, tomography, compliance and wide-angle seismic studies, supported by geological evidence, suggest the presence of gabbroic-melt accumulations within the Moho transition zone in the vicinity of fast- to intermediate-spreading centres. Until now, however, no reflection images have been obtained of such a structure within the Moho transition zone. Here we show images of groups of Moho transition zone reflection events that resulted from the analysis of approximately 1,500 km of multichannel seismic data collected across the intermediate-spreading-rate Juan de Fuca ridge. From our observations we suggest that gabbro lenses and melt accumulations embedded within dunite or residual mantle peridotite are the most probable cause for the observed reflectivity, thus providing support for the hypothesis that the crust is generated from multiple magma bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2135570735,"Diverse functions of 14-3-3 proteins are directly coupled to their ability to interact with targeted peptide substrates. RSX(pS/pT)XP and RXΦX(pS/pT)XP are two canonical consensus binding motifs for 14-3-3 proteins representing the two common binding modes, modes I and II, between 14-3-3 and internal peptides. Using a genetic selection, we have screened a random peptide library and identified a group of C-terminal motifs, termed SWTY, capable of overriding an endoplasmic reticulum localization signal and redirecting membrane proteins to cell surface. Here we report that the C-terminal SWTY motif, although different from mode I and II consensus, binds tightly to 14-3-3 proteins with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.17 μm, comparable with that of internal canonical binding peptides. We show that all residues but proline in -SWTX-COOH are compatible for the interaction and surface expression. Because SWTY-like sequences have been found in native proteins, these results support a broad significance of 14-3-3 interaction with protein C termini. The C-terminal binding consensus, mode III, represents an expansion of the repertoire of 14-3-3-targeted sequences.

The C-terminal binding consensus, mode III, represents an expansion of the repertoire of 14-3-3-targeted sequences. The 14-3-3 proteins were initially identified from brain for their abundance and acidic properties (1Moore B.W. Perez V.J. Physiological and Biochemical Aspects of Nervous Integration. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1967: 343-359Google Scholar). They have been found in all eukaryotes and recognized for their diverse functional roles in biological processes including metabolism, cell signaling, intracellular trafficking, stress responses, cell cycle progression, and malignant transformation (see reviews in Refs. 2Fu H.

Multiple isoforms of 14-3-3 are commonly found in a given species. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two 14-3-3 isoforms, encoded by BMH1 and BMH2. Deletion of either does not cause growth defects, but the double deletion of both is lethal in most genetic backgrounds (5Roberts R.L. Mosch H.U. Fink G.R.

As the first protein module identified with preferential affinity to phosphorylated Ser/Thr substrates, 14-3-3 binding provides an inducible mechanism of translating enzymatic activity to protein-protein interaction, a molecular feature with broad significance in regulation. Structural studies and examination of the interactive sequences in human proto-oncogene Raf-1 and from random phosphopeptide libraries have established two binding consensuses, RSX(pS/pT)XP and RXΦX(pS/pT)XP, which are also known as mode I and II recognition (8Yaffe M.B.

The two binding modes have provided molecular insights into the recognition of 14-3-3 binding to a large number of interacting proteins. The vast majority of binding sites identified so far lies internally and matches either mode I or II binding consensus. In addition to phosphorylation-mediated induction of 14-3-3 binding, there is evidence for additional mechanisms of interaction. For example, a tight association between 14-3-3 and multiple regions of plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase is induced by additional binding of a fungal toxin, fusicoccin, which leads to the formation of a ternary complex (10Wurtele M. Jelich-Ottmann C. Wittinghofer A. Oecking C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Fuglsang A.T. Borch J. Bych K. Jahn T.P. Roepstorff P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42266-42272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). More recently, evidence from studying arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), 2The abbreviations used are:AANATarylalkylamine N-acetyltransferaseERendoplasmic reticulumHAinfluenza A virus hemagglutininDansyl5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonylPBSphosphate-buffered salineAbantibodyFAM5-(and 6)-carboxyfluoresceinFCMflow cytometry the penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis, has shown that AANAT has two 14-3-3 binding sites; one high affinity site resides internally, and one low affinity resides at the C terminus. The nonsaturated binary binding of 14-3-3 to these sites was suggested as a tuning mechanism for rhythmic enzyme activity that is coordinated with the daily cycle of melatonin production (12Ganguly S. Weller J.L. Ho A. Chemineau P. Malpaux B. Klein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both of the above cases involve a low affinity interaction between 14-3-3 and the C terminus: QSYTV-COOH (plant H+-ATPase) and RRNSDR-COOH (AANAT). These sequences are distinct and could not have been predicted by the consensus, RSX(pS/pT)XP and RXΦX(pS/pT)XP, in mode I and II binding. The affinity (KD) for QSYpTV is 2.5 μm, strengthened to 0.027 μm upon ternary binding with fusicoccin (10Wurtele M. Jelich-Ottmann C. Wittinghofer A. Oecking C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The affinity for RRNpSDR is considerably lower than that of the internal canonical binding sequence, and its KD value remains to be determined (12Ganguly S. Weller J.L. Ho A. Chemineau P. Malpaux B. Klein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This mode of interaction is sufficiently different and thus was recently named mode III (12Ganguly S. Weller J.L. Ho A. Chemineau P. Malpaux B. Klein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is not well understood whether the interacting C terminus could function independently and whether the reduced affinity is caused by the lack of the conserved proline residue. Information concerning their binding affinity, sequence requirements, and possible selectivity to interact with different 14-3-3 isoforms remain unknown. arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase endoplasmic reticulum influenza A virus hemagglutinin 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl phosphate-buffered saline antibody 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein flow cytometry We have performed a genetic screen of random peptides to identify C-terminal signal motifs that override endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization to confer protein expression on cell surface (13Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; DOI: 10.1038/ncbl1297PubMed Google Scholar). Among the identified motifs is a group of homologous C-terminal peptides that function through an interaction with 14-3-3. Here we report a series of studies to examine the interaction between 14-3-3 and synthetic C-terminal peptides and the ability of the interacting peptides to confer receptor surface expression. The resultant C-terminal peptide consensus expands the repertoire of 14-3-3 recognition motifs and facilitates further functional studies. Molecular Biology—The yeast expression vector for mammalian Kir2.1 was generated by cloning mouse Kir2.1 cDNA in pADNS vector at HindIII and NotI (13Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; DOI: 10.1038/ncbl1297PubMed Google Scholar). The PstI site was created at the C terminus of Kir2.1 by replacing the last residue with the PstI sequence (LQ). The DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 36 amino acids of mouse Kir6.2 (LLDALTLASSRGPLRKRSVAVAKAKPKFSISPDSLS) was generated by annealing and extending the complementary oligonucleotides with PstI and NotI overhangs and then ligating to Kir2.1. The SacI site was engineered 9 amino acids downstream of the RKR signal (this caused mutation of PK to EL) to replace SISPDSLS with the DNA fragments encoding the X8 random peptide library. The X8 library DNA fragments were generated by annealing and extending the sense strand (5′-GAGCTCTTT(NNK)8TAGGCGGCCGCTACATACA, where N indicates any of A, T, C, or G and K indicates either of G or T) and antisense strand (5′-TGTATGTAGCGGCCGCCTA) oligonucleotides that were synthesized to randomly encode 8 amino acids preceded by Phe with SacI and NotI overhangs. To clone the CD8 fusion vectors, the cDNA encoding the full-length human CD8 sequence was isolated for fusion with the HA epitope and subcloned into the HindIII-BamHI sites of pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The C-terminal 36-amino acid sequence of Kir6.2 was cloned from yeast Kir2.1 fusion vector by PCR with BamHI and EcoRI overhangs and ligated into CD8HA vector at BamHI and EcoRI. A SfiI site was engineered immediately after the SacI site in the 36-amino acid Kir6.2 sequence (LLDALTLASSRGPLRKRSVAVAKAKELFSISPDSLS), causing a substitution of ELF with ELGHLGQ. This SfiI site facilitated replacement of SISPDSLS with the DNA fragments flanking with SfiI and XhoI sites. Mutagenesis of the SWTY sequence was performed by insertion between SfiI and XhoI sites, following extension by Klenow enzyme of oligonucleotides including mutations. Transfection—The HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) and were analyzed at 24-36 h after transfection. Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells plated on polylysine-treated coverslips were transiently transfected. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 15 min and permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100, PBS for 5 min, all at room temperature. Kir2.1 was detected with mouse anti-HA Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The ER marker protein, calreticulin, was detected by rabbit anti-calreticulin Ab (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), followed by Alexa Fluo 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), and the images were captured using confocal microscopy. Spinning Nipkow disk confocal microscopy was performed with an UltraView LCI System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in conjunction with an Eclipse 200 inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Imaging through a 60× oil immersion planar apochromatic lens (numerical aperture, 1.4) was accomplished via excitation using the 488- or 568-nm lines of a krypton/argon laser. Flow cytometry—The transfected HEK293 cells were harvested by incubation with 0.5 mm EDTA, PBS for 10 min at 37 °C and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) and 2% fetal bovine serum (staining medium). All of the incubation and washing steps were performed in staining medium at 4 °C. Surface CD8 was detected with mouse anti-human CD8 monoclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The stained cells were examined for surface expression with FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Peptide Synthesis and Affinity Measurement—The Dansyl and 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled peptides, Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH, and FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH, as well as control sequences as RGRSWpTY-COOH, RGRSWTY-COOH, RGRSWpTE-COOH, RGRSWpTD-COOH, RGRSWpTP-COOH, and RGRSWpTG-COOH, were synthesized (New England Peptides, Boston, MA; Abgent, San Diego, CA). The peptide R18, with a sequence of PHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP, was purchased from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The peptides were prepared as stock solutions by dissolving in water and, if necessary, with the addition of minimal amount of acetonitrile. The working solutions for the affinity detection were prepared in the 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). For detection of both the fluorescence intensity and the fluorescence anisotropy, a multifunctional plate reader Safire2 (Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used. For fluorescence intensity-based affinity detections with Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH, the excitation was set at 335 nm and emission was set at 545 nm with 20-nm bandwidth for both excitation and emission. The integration time was set at 200 μs with 3 reads/well. The detection was performed on 96-well black microtiter plates with transparent bottoms in top measurement mode. For the fluorescence anisotropy-based affinity measurements with FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH, the detection was performed with 384-well black microtiter plates in fluorescence polarization measurement mode. The excitation was set at 470 nm and emission was set at 525 nm with 20-nm bandwidth for emission. The time between move and flash was set at 100 ms with 3 reads/well. G-Factor was determined as 1.1 by calibration of 100 nm FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH as 20 mP for florescence polarity, with buffer solution as the reference. For fluorescence intensity-based affinity detections with Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH, the KD of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH with 14-3-3ζ was determined by the titration of 1.2 μm of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH in 100 μl of total volume with different concentrations of 14-3-3ζ, with one binding site fitting with Equation 1 using Origin 7.0, with y = F - F0, where F is the fluorescence intensity of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH with the addition of 14-3-3ζ, F0 is that of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH alone, and x is the concentration of 14-3-3ζ. Competitive experiments were designed for the KD measurements of unlabeled control peptides (14Harris B. Hillier B. Lim W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5921-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The titrations with different concentrations of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH were performed with 25 μm of control sequences and 2.65 μm 14-3-3ζ in 100 μl total volume. The fitting was done using Origin 7.0, with the (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), with y = F - F0, where F is the fluorescence intensity after the addition of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH to the mixture of control sequences and 14-3-3ζ, F0 is that of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH alone in another well without 14-3-3ζ, and x is the concentration of Dansyl-RGRSWpTY. For fluorescence anisotropy-based affinity detections with FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH, the KD value of FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH with 14-3-3ζ was determined by the titration of 100 nm of FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH in 100 μl total volume with different concentrations of 14-3-3ζ, with one binding site fitting with Equation 1 using Origin 7.0. In the fitting, y = r - r0, where r is the fluorescence anisotropy of FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH with the addition of 14-3-3ζ, r0 is FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH alone, and x is the concentration of 14-3-3ζ. For the KD measurements of unlabeled peptides, competitive anisotropy experiments were performed with the mixture of different concentrations of control sequences with 80 nm FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH following the addition of 0.65 μm 14-3-3ζ in 100 μl total volume. The fitting was done using Origin 7.0, with Equation 4, and y = (r - r0)/(rmax - r0), where r is the fluorescence anisotropy of FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH with the addition of 14-3-3ζ, r0 is that of FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH alone, rmax is the maximum of fluorescence anisotropy of FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH with the addition of 14-3-3ζ, D0 is the concentration of FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH, P0 is the concentration of 14-3-3ζ, and x is the concentrations of control peptides. y=BxKDDansylSWpTY+X(Eq. 1) y=BxKDApp+x(Eq. 2) KDApp=(1+[Control]0KDControl)KDDansylSWpTY(Eq. 3) y=12[D0]{(KDFAM−SWpTYKDControlx+KDFAM−SWpTY+[D0]+[P0])−(KDFAM−SWpTYKDControlx+KDFAM−SWpTY+[D0]+[P0]2−4[D0][P0]}(Eq. 4) Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—For immunoprecipitation, transfected cells were washed with PBS once and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.50) with protease inhibitor cocktails for 20 min at 4 °C. After spinning for 20 min at 11,000 × g, the supernatant was mixed with protein A-conjugated agarose beads that were preincubated with 1 μg of anti-HA Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). After 5 h of incubation, the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and then boiled with 2× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. The samples resolved in SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with anti-14-3-3 Ab (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) or anti-HA Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immunoblots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of Recombinant 14-3-3 Proteins in Escherichia coli—Seven isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins were expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusions from a T7-driven promoter and purified from E. coli strain BL21-SI (Invitrogen). Briefly, E. coli BL21-SI cells harboring a 14-3-3 expression vector were grown overnight in salt free LB medium at 30 °C, which was used to inoculate (1%) in a fresh salt free LB medium. When the cell density reached an A600 of 0.5, NaCl was added to the final concentration of 0.3 m. The expression of 14-3-3s was induced for 5 h before harvesting. Recombinant His-tagged 14-3-3 proteins were purified using nickel-chelating ion exchange affinity chromatography essentially as previously described (15Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Before use, 14-3-3 proteins were subject to gel filtration chromatography using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.3, 130 mm NaCl). Pull-down of 14-3-3 by Peptides—Purified His-14-3-3ζ proteins (wild type, K49E, and V176D) were used for the pull-down studies. Specifically, 10 μm synthetic biotin-conjugated peptides for FRGRSWpTY, FRGRSWTY, and FRGRSWAY (Abgent, San Diego, CA) were incubated with 13 μm purified 14-3-3 for 30 min at room temperature. The bound material was mixed with streptavidin-Sepharose beads and gently agitated for 1 h. After washing four times with 5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS-T, the beads were resuspended in SDS loading buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. SWTX-bound 14-3-3 Homology Modeling—The co-crystal structure of 14-3-3 bound to ARSHpSYPA (a mode I 14-3-3 binding motif) (16Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J.

The electrostatic surface of the 14-3-3 structure (1QJB) was calculated with the program Pymol (by Warren L. DeLano), as well as the ray tracing. Using the programs O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar, 18Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and Quanta (Accelrys, Inc. San Diego, CA), we modeled the sequence of the SWTY motif, RGRSWpTY-COOH, using the mode I peptide amino acids as a template. A radius of 6 Å around the SWpTY peptide was used to manage the contacts. The position of the sequence was anchored by the location of the phosphorylated serine (or threonine) residues in the mode I and the SWTY motif. Homology modeling was repeated for the SWTX panel using the same method. Affinity Determination of C-terminal Peptides—A typical ER localization signal is capable of dominantly conferring a surface-expressed protein to ER (19Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In a Kir2.1 potassium channel, FCYENE, a cytoplasmic signal, potentiates protein surface expression (20Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Addition of the RKR ER localization signal to Kir2.1 prevents surface expression (21Shikano S. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5783-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To isolate sequences with ability of overriding the RKR signal and redirecting ER localized proteins to the cell surface, we have constructed a reporter in which constitutive surface expression of Kir2.1 potassium channel protein was abolished by the addition of an RKR ER localization signal (21Shikano S. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5783-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Selection of a random 8-mer peptide C-terminal to the RKR in a yeast genetic system has permitted the isolation of sequences capable of reconferring surface expression by a growth selection (13Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; DOI: 10.1038/ncbl1297PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Kir2.1-RKR was found in ER, co-localized with calreticulin (Fig. 1B, left panels). The weak signal on the surface may represent ER compartments in proximity to the cell surface and some Kir2.1 protein escaped from ER localization activity. In contrast, fusion of these sequences to the C terminus, such as GHGRRHSW of clone 95, confers a significant increase of surface expression (Fig. 1B, right panels). For the SWTY motif, the ratio of surface/total protein increased by 4-fold compared with that of the wild type (13Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; DOI: 10.1038/ncbl1297PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that one group of such sequences achieves their effect via interaction with 14-3-3, and their sequences have several conserved features such as threonine or serine at the -2 position amenable to phosphorylation (Fig. 1C) (13Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; DOI: 10.1038/ncbl1297PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in peptide length was caused by the introduction of a stop codon in the random 8-mer peptide library (see “Experimental Procedures”). The binding between RGRSWpTY-COOH and 14-3-3 has been detected by immunoprecipitation and affinity pull-down using biotinylated synthetic peptide (13Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; DOI: 10.1038/ncbl1297PubMed Google Scholar). However, like many studies, because of the dual binding site of dimeric 14-3-3 and involvement of immobilization of peptide ligands on solid surfaces, these binding studies are not most suitable for accurate evaluation of interaction affinity (see “Discussion”). To demonstrate direct and specific interaction with 14-3-3, we developed a fluorescence-based solution binding assay more suitable for affinity quantification with minimal contribution of avidity. Based on the known structures of 14-3-3, it appears that the binding of the mode I consensus, which SWTY more closely resembles, is no longer selective at the -4 position N-terminal to the phosphorylated residue (16Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, the shortest motif isolated from our screen has five residues (Fig. 1C, #135). We reasoned that an N-terminal attachment of a fluorophore to the -5 position should be sufficiently distant from affecting the affinity of a binding peptide. Binding of a peptide to 14-3-3 brings the fluorophore to the protein surface and likely geometrically restrains the tethered fluorophore, potentially causing changes of fluorescence intensity and/or polarization (measured as anisotropy). We synthesized and tested FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH and 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH (Fig. 2A). For the Dansyl-RGRSWpTY, binding to purified recombinant 14-3-3ζ potentiates the fluorescence at 545 nm by more than 30% (Fig. 2B). No significant fluorescence signal was detect for 14-3-3 protein alone, either wild type or point mutants (Fig. 3C and data not shown). For the FAM-RGRSWpTY peptide, we observed a more than 6-fold increase in fluorescence polarization (Fig. 2C). These parameters provide a means to monitor the 14-3-3 binding in solution and the ability to compare measurements obtained with two different fluorescence probes (see “Experimental Procedures”).FIGURE 3Characterization of SWTY motif binding to 14-3-3ζ. A, comparison of affinity for association between Dansyl-RGRSWpTY peptide and 14-3-3ζ (closed circles) or the mutant 14-3-3ζ (K49E) (open circles). The change of fluorescence intensity (ΔF, vertical axis) is plotted against concentration of 14-3-3ζ (horizontal axis). B, comparison of binding affinity among different 14-3-3 isoforms. The ΔF values for the 14-3-3 isoforms were individually normalized to their maximums to calculate the bound fraction (vertical axis) and plotted against concentration of all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms. C, competition of 14-3-3ζ binding by Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH. 14-3-3ζ was incubated with Dansyl-RGRSWpTY peptide in the presence of increasing concentrations of competitor peptides, RGRSWpTY (closed circles) and RGRSWTY (open circles). The reduction of ΔF values was individually normalized to their maximums to identify the bound fraction. D, affinity-precipitation 14-3-3ζ proteins with synthetic peptides. Biotinylated SWTY, SWpTY, and SWAY peptides were individually incubated with the wild type and K49E and V176D mutants as indicated. Input 14-3-3 proteins are shown in lanes 1, 5, and 9, respectively. The bound materials were precipitated by streptavidin protein A-Sepharose beads and visualized by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The molecular mass standards are as indicated on the left in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2B shows the dose-dependent increase of fluorescence intensity for Dansyl-RGRSWpTY-COOH binding to the purified wild type 14-3-3ζ. When such an increase is fit to a 1:1 bimolecular binding reaction, it gives rise to a KD of 0.55 ± 0.12 μm between Dansyl-RGRSWpTY and 14-3-3ζ. Using FAM-RGRSWpTY-COOH peptide and fluorescence anisotropy, we obtained a similar KD value of 0.49 ± 0.14 μm (Fig. 2C). The KD values in solution are comparable with that of canonical peptide substrates (8Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Although it is unknown whether and to what extent the conjugated fluorophores may affect the binding affinity, the similarity of dissociation constants for the two different fluorophore-conjugated peptides is consistent with the notion of little contribution of fluorophore chemistry to the KD values (see “Discussion”). C-terminal Peptide Binding Requires the Canonical Binding Groove in 14-3-3—Based on the structure of 14-3-3 with a bound canonical peptide, the Lys49 residue forms a critical part of the binding groove. A specific K49E mutation abolished the binding (15Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the change of fluorescence with increasing concentrations of purified 14-3-3ζ. Consistent with a specific association with the known 14-3-3 binding groove, an increase of fluorescence intensity was observed from wild type 14-3-3ζ but not for the mutant 14-3-3ζ (K49E). There are seven isoforms of 14-3-3 found in human with the potential for isoform-specific functions (23Aitken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S. Mitchell K. Peden A. Zemlickova E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To examine any isoform selectivity for the SWpTY-mediated interaction with 14-3-3, we expressed and purified each of the seven isoforms from E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under similar experimental conditions, the seven isoforms exhibited similar bindi"

However, the signal transduction pathways leading to mucus production are poorly understood. Here we examined the potential role of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) in mucus synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or transforming growth factor-α stimulation of human epithelial cells resulted in mucus secretion as measured by MUC5AC mRNA and protein. TNF-α stimulation induced IKKβ-dependent p65 nuclear translocation, mucus synthesis, and production of cytokines from epithelial cells. TNF-α, but not transforming growth factor-α, induced mucus production dependent on IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation. In vivo, TNF-α induced NF-κB as determined by whole mouse body bioluminescence. This activation was localized to the epithelium as revealed by LacZ staining in NF-κB-LacZ transgenic mice. TNF-α-induced mucus production in vivo could also be inhibited by administration into the epithelium of an IKKβ dominant negative adenovirus.

The airway epithelium is the first layer of cellular interaction with airborne antigens and plays a key role in initiating allergic responses. Research over the last decade has established a critical role for the epithelium not only by providing a physical boundary but also in transducing and integrating signals that help mount optimal responses to a wide variety of insults (1Jackson A.D.

Airway mucus is a highly hydrated glycoprotein exhibiting a gel state and, in combination with the ciliated cells in the airways, constitutes a mucociliary clearance system critical for protection of the respiratory tract (4Thornton D.J. Davies J.R. Carlstedt I. Sheehan J.K. Rogers D.F. Lethem M.I. Airway Mucus: Basic Mechanisms and Clinical Perspectives. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 19-39Google Scholar). The apoprotein component of mucus is the product of a family of mucin genes (generally referred to as MUC genes), of which MUC1, -2, -3, -4, -5AC, -5B, and -7 have been shown to be expressed in airway epithelium (5Rose M.C. Gendler S.J. Rogers D.F. Lethem M.I. Airway Mucus: Basic Mechanisms and Clinical Perspectives. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 41-66Google Scholar). Both MUC5AC and MUC2 expression have been shown to be highly regulated (6Alimam M.Z. Piazza F.M. Selby D.M. Letwin N. Huang L. Rose M.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is produced by diverse cell types, including macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes (7Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 8Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar). TNF-α is rapidly produced in response to inflammation, infection, and tissue injury and triggers a broad array of systemic and cellular responses. Through binding to its major receptor, TNFR1, TNF-α activates several intracellular signal transduction cascades, among which the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway is of pivotal importance. In its canonical form, NF-κBisa heterodimer composed of the p50 and p65 proteins and is held in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of cells by the inhibitor of the NF-κB protein, IκBα. Upon TNFR1 engagement, a number of docking proteins are recruited to its intracellular domain, leading to the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO). Subsequently, IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα at two critical serine residues, which leads to its proteasome-mediated degradation and release of the NF-κB complex. NF-κB then translocates to the nuclear compartment and acts as a transcription factor regulating the expression of numerous genes (9Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar, 10Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar). There is limited information linking NF-κB and mucus production. Proximal regulatory regions from MUC2 and MUC5AC genes have been cloned and characterized in detail (11Daizong L. Gallup M. Fan N.

J. 2001; 358: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses of these regions have indicated the presence of NF-κB binding sequences, and electromobility shift assays and supershift experiments with specific antibodies have demonstrated binding of p50/p65 complexes to these sequences upon stimulation of cell cultures with Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived LPS. NF-κB has been shown to play an important role in mucus production in mouse models of allergic lung inflammation (13Desmet C. Gosset P. Pajak B. Cataldo D. Bentires-Alj M. Lekeux P. Bureau F. J.

Cell lines transfected with MUC2 reporter constructs have also suggested a role for NF-κB in LPS-induced mucus production in a pathway involving Ras-MAPK-pp90rsk (15Li J.D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.H.

Along similar lines, p38 MAPK has been shown to play a role in MUC5AC up-regulation upon stimulation of normal human nasal epithelial cells and human epithelial cell lines with IL-1, TNF-α, and cytoplasmic proteins of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (16Wang B.

TGF-α-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation has also been found to play an important role in mucin elaboration in human airway epithelial cells (19Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Lee H.M. Agustí C. Lausier J.A. Ueki I.F. Grattan K.M. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3081-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 20Shao M.X.G. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2005; 102: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies where TNF-α and TGF-α were used in combination to stimulate NCI-H292 human lung epithelial cells showed an increased level of mucin protein synthesis compared with either cytokine alone, and a putative cross-talk between both signaling pathways has been hypothesized (19Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Lee H.M. Agustí C. Lausier J.A. Ueki I.F. Grattan K.M. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3081-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In the present work we have investigated the role of IKKβ in transducing the pro-inflammatory signal delivered by TNF-α and TGF-α to trigger mucus production by airway epithelial cells. Following a combination of cell culture and in vivo experiments, we show the following: first, TNF-α induces mucin and cytokine production and activates NF-κB in a human lung epithelial cell line; second, IKKβ is required for TNF-α-induced mucin and cytokine production but not for TGF-α-dependent mucus production by this human lung epithelial cell line; and third, TNF-α activates NF-κB in mouse airway epithelium in vivo and leads to goblet cell metaplasia and mucus production in an IKKβ-dependent manner. Cell Culture—NCI-H292 cells (a human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and Hepes (25 mm) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 water-jacketed incubator. When 60-80% confluent, cells were incubated with human TNF-α (PeproTech 300-01A) for 30 min to 24 h. Adenoviral Infection Studies—Adenoviral vectors were prepared as described (22He T.C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar); gene expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. NCI-H292 cells were subcultured into 4-well chamber slides overnight to adhere. Each well was seeded with 2 × 105 cells. When the cultures turned 60-80% confluent, they were washed with OPMI medium and incubated in OPMI medium for 1 h, and the following adenoviral vectors added: GFP vector alone (2 × 105 pfu/ml), IKKβ DN (2 × 106 pfu/ml), and IKKβ WT (2 × 106 pfu/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. After 1 h of infection, wells were washed with the culture medium and replaced with growth medium overnight. 16-20 h later, culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium with or without TNF-α (50 ng/ml). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min or with a 10% low odor formalin solution for 30 min, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS (20 mm Tris base, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 20 min, blocked with 10% HISS in TBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) for 15 min, and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 antibody (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or MUC5AC monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, NeoMarkers, Inc., Fremont, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:300 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG + IgM (1:200 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and stained with Hoechst nuclear dye for 3 min at room temperature, mounted with coverslips, and analyzed under the fluorescence microscope using the MetaMorph 6.0 software package (Universal Imaging Corp. Ltd., Marlow, Buckinghamshire, UK). Immunohistochemistry—Cells were fixed with a 10% low odor formalin solution for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 10 min, and peroxidase-blocked in 0.3% H2O2 containing 1% horse serum for 5 min. For color development, an AEC substrate kit for peroxides from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) (SK-4200) and ABC kit (Vector PK-6102) were used. Counter stain was Meyer's hematoxylin (Polyscientific, Bay Shore, NY, S216/160z). RNA Isolation/cDNA Preparation—Resting and activated NCI-H292 cells were lysed in 2 ml of lysis buffer containing guanidine isothiocyanate (RLT buffer) with β-mercaptoethanol (10 μl/ml). Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy™ kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was degraded using Ambion DNase I at 37 °C for 30 min followed by 75 °C heat inactivation of the enzyme for 5 min. The RNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and then reverse-transcribed by using the Qiagen Omniscript™ reverse transcriptase kit using oligo(dT) primers and random hexamers in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. After reverse transcription, any remaining RNA was digested by adding 1 μl of RNase H, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The cDNA was diluted 1:10, and 5 μl was used for real time PCR analysis. Real Time PCR—mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative PCR (TaqMan®, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit, and reverse transcription was performed as described above. An oligonucleotide probe was designed to anneal to the gene of interest between two PCR primers. The probe was then fluorescently labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (reporter dye) on the 5′ end and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (quencher dye) on the 3′ end. A similar probe and PCR primers were designed for β2-microglobulin (housekeeping internal control gene). The probe for this gene incorporated VIC as the reporter dye. PCRs were run that included the primers and probes for these two genes, as well as the input cDNA. As the polymerase moves across the gene during the reaction, it cleaves the reporter dye from one end of each probe, which causes a fluorescent emission that is measured by the ABI Prizm 7700 sequence detector. The emissions recorded for each cDNA can then be converted into the level of expression for the gene normalized to the expression of β2-microglobulin. Sequences for MUC5AC transcript were as follows: forward primer 5′-GGCAACAATGTCATCTCCTTGAG-3′, reverse primer 5′-TCAGAGGTGGGTAACCATTGG-3′, and probe 5′-TGCCCAGAGCTGAATGAACCATCTTGT-3′. Mice—All animals were treated according to protocols for animal care established and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 6-8-Week-old female C57BL/6 mice and NF-κB-LacZ transgenic mice (23Bhakar A.L. Tannis L.L. Zeindler C. Russo M.P. Jobin C. Park D.S. MacPherson S. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8466-8475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in a temperature-controlled room with standard laboratory food and water freely available. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isofluorene, and mouse TNF-α (5 μg/50 μl/mouse) was intranasally delivered on days 1-3. 24 h after the third dose, animals were euthanized, and lungs were harvested. Tissue Preparation—For frozen sections, tissues were removed, placed in dry ice, and stored at -80 °C. Tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compounds, cryostat-sectioned to 20 μm, and stored at -80 °C. For Alcian Blue/periodic acid-Schiff and hematoxylin and eosin staining, tissues were fixed in 10% low odor formalin. Fixed lungs were then mounted in paraffin, and 6-μm sections were prepared. Immunofluorescence Localization of p65 in Mouse Lung Epithelium—Frozen sections of mice lung were processed essentially as described for the in vitro studies. β-Galactosidase Staining—After cryostat cutting of frozen lungs, sections were air-dried at room temperature for 15 min, and then the slides were washed with 1× PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. After fixation, slides were washed three times with PBS, and X-gal staining solutions (5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS) were added. The counterstain was eosin Y. Bioluminescence of NF-κB in Vivo—Adenovirus (2 × 108 pfu) carrying an NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct (kind gift from Aventis Pharmaceuticals) along with either GFP or IKKβ DN adenoviruses (1 × 109 pfu) in 50 μl of PBS were intranasally delivered to isoflurane-anesthetized BALB/c female mice at 6-8 weeks of age. Three days later, mice were challenged with 0.5 μg/40 μl/mouse of TNF-α in PBS given intranasally. After 2 h of stimulation, luciferin at a dose of 150 mg/kg in 150 μl of PBS was administered intraperitoneally for 10 min. NF-κB-luciferase activity was captured as images and as emitted total photons/min using the IVIS200 imaging system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Bioluminescence of MUC5AC in Vivo—The promoter region from -1100 to -1 of the human MUC5AC gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into a vector derived from pMCS-luciferase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in which the minimal TATA sequence had been removed. To generate the MUC5AC adenoviral reporter construct, the entire promoter/luciferase/poly(A) transcription cassette was excised from this vector as a BamHI restriction fragment, blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase, and cloned into XmnI/EcoRV-digested pENTR1A (Invitrogen). The transcription cassette was then introduced into pAd/PL-DEST (Invitrogen) via an LR clonase reaction. MUC5AC-luciferase adenoviral vector plasmid was linearized by SwaI digestion and sent to ViraQuest (North Liberty, IA) for large scale growth and CsCl purification of recombinant virus. Adenoviruses (1 × 109 pfu) carrying the MUC5AC-luciferase reporter in 50 μl of PBS were intranasally delivered to isoflurane-anesthetized BALB/c female mice at 6-8 weeks of age. Three days later, mice were challenged for 3 consecutive days with 50 μl of PBS or 5 μg/50 μl/mouse of TNF-α or IL-13 in PBS given intranasally. 24 h after the last challenge, luciferin at a dose of 150 mg/kg in 150 μl of PBS was administered intraperitoneally for 10 min. MUC5AC-luciferase activity was captured as images and as emitted total photons/min using the IVIS200 imaging system (Xenogen). TNF-α Induces Mucin and Cytokine Production by NCI-H292 Human Lung Epithelial Cells—In order to investigate if mucus and/or cytokine production can be modulated by TNF-α or TGF-α in human lung epithelial cells, NCI-H292 cells were cultured in the presence of TNF-α (50 ng/ml) or TGF-α (50 ng/ml) alone or in combination for 12 or 24 h, and RNA and protein levels for MUC5AC and several cytokines were measured (Fig. 1). Real time PCR showed that both TNF-α and TGF-α induced steady-state MUC5AC transcript accumulation by 12 h (Fig. 1A), with no further increase at 24 h (data not shown). TGF-α and TNF-α stimulation exerted an additive effect on this process (Fig. 1A). Similarly, MUC5AC protein levels increased with TNF-α and TGF-α stimulation, and this response was enhanced when TGF-α was used in combination with TNF-α, as revealed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1B). TNF-α, alone or in combination with TGF-α, also induced IL-6 and IL-8 production (Fig. 1C). Most interestingly, TGF-α was much less efficient than TNF-α in inducing cytokine secretion. Indeed, TGF-α failed to induce IL-6 and modestly increased IL-8 secretion. TNF-α Activates NF-κB and MUC5AC Synthesis in NCI-H292 Cells—Because TNF-α is a potent activator of the NF-κB pathway, we used an anti-p65 antibody to follow its expression and intracellular trafficking in human lung epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated high expression of p65 in resting NCI-H292 cells (Fig. 2), with the protein homogeneously distributed throughout the cytoplasm and absent from the nucleus. However, upon TNF-α treatment, this pattern shifted, and p65 was found primarily around or within the nucleus (Fig. 2, purple dots, resulting from merging red and blue channels). Nuclear translocation was clear after 1 h (data not shown) and was maximal after 3 h (Fig. 2). From these experiments we conclude that NCI-H292 cells have a functional NF-κB signaling pathway, and this pathway can be activated by TNF-α. Moreover, expression of MUC5AC was concomitant with NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 2, at 3 h of TNF-α stimulation (maximal NF-κB activation), the MUC5AC protein starts to be detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, green channel). NF-κB Is Required for TNF-α-induced, but Not TGF-α-induced, Mucin Production in NCI-H292 Cells—In order to determine whether NF-κB is functionally required for TNF-α- and/or TGF-dependent mucin production in the lung epithelium, we undertook adenoviral mediated gene delivery experiments using mutant forms of IKKβ to block specifically the NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. Adenoviral vectors harboring dominant negative (DN, K44M) or wild type (WT) forms of IKKβ or a GFP control construct were used. Only cultures with 75-80% infected cells were used in subsequent analyses (as determined by GFP expression, not shown). The experiments were done in triplicate, and representative pictures are shown in Fig. 3A. IKKβ DN delivery almost completely abrogated MUC5AC expression in TNF-α-stimulated cells (Fig. 3A, compare panels 2 and 6). However, IKKβ DN had no effect on TGF-α-induced mucin elaboration (Fig. 3A, panels 3 and 7). Transduction of IKKβ DN to TNF- + TGF-treated cells resulted in a diminution of MUC5AC-positive cells to levels similar to those detected in TGF-only stimulated cells (Fig. 3A, panels 4 and 8). Fig. 3A, panel B, shows the quantification of the images shown in panel A (in triplicate). These data strongly suggest a role for NF-κB in TNF-α-induced but not in TGF-α-induced mucus production. Furthermore, unlike TNF-α, TGF-α fails to activate NF-κB in NCI-H292 cells, as determined by p65 nuclear translocation experiments (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4TGF-α stimulation fails to activate NF-κB in NCI-H292 cells. Cells were incubated with TNF-α or TGF-α for 30 min or 1, 3, 6, or 24 h and then fixed and stained for p65. As expected, TNF-α triggered nuclear translocation of p65 (left panel). However, after TGF-α stimulation, and at any of the time points indicated, p65 remained in the cytosol and did not relocate to the nuclear compartment. Representative images corresponding to the 1-h time point are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NF-κB Mediates Cytokine Production in TNF-α-stimulated NCI-H292 Cells—Supernatants from adenoviral transfer experiments were collected and protein levels for IL-6 and IL-8 measured (Fig. 5). Interference with NF-κB activation (IKKβ DN delivery) resulted in a decrease in IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Conversely, enhancement of NF-κB activation by overexpression of IKKβ (IKKβ WT delivery) was followed by an increase in cytokine production. TNF-α Activates NF-κB in Airway Epithelium in Vivo—In order to determine whether TNF-α was sufficient for NF-κB activation in lung epithelium, we next used bioluminescent imaging in vivo. TNF-α delivery to the lungs of animals that had been infected with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter adenovirus resulted in a 5-fold increase in bioluminescence as compared with saline-treated animals (Fig. 6, A and B). Treatment with an IKKβ DN adenovirus by intranasal delivery to the airways almost completely abrogated TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. In order to determine the cell types undergoing TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, we utilized NF-κB-LacZ transgenic mice (23Bhakar A.L. Tannis L.L. Zeindler C. Russo M.P. Jobin C. Park D.S. MacPherson S. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8466-8475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and monitored NF-κB activation by X-gal staining of frozen lung sections. Microscopic inspection of saline-challenged mice showed no staining of the lungs (Fig. 6C). In sharp contrast, lung sections from TNF-α-treated mice contained numerous airways with LacZ-positive epithelial cells (Fig. 6D). Thus, these results strongly suggest that administration of TNF-α to mouse airways induces IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation in epithelial cells. p65 Nuclear Translocation in Airway Epithelium Is Rapid and Transient—In order to confirm the integrity of the NF-κB pathway in a nontransgenic system, and its kinetics of activation in lung epithelium in vivo, we delivered TNF-α into the airways of C57BL/6 mice and analyzed p65 nuclear recruitment by immunofluorescence at different time points after challenge (Fig. 6E). Epithelial cells from saline-treated mice had p65 protein preferentially located in the cytoplasm. By 30 min after challenge, p65 nuclear localization was still minimal (not shown). However, after 1 h of TNF-α delivery, high levels of p65 were detected in the nuclear compartment, with maximal accumulation occurring around 3 h after challenge. By 6 h, p65 was again localized primarily in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus (Fig. 6E). TNF-α Induces Goblet Cell Metaplasia and Mucus Production in Mouse Airways—We next asked whether our findings of IKKβ-dependent mucus production in a cell culture system were of any relevance in vivo in airway epithelium. TNF-α delivery to the lungs of animals that had been infected with a MUC5AC-luciferase reporter adenovirus resulted in a 10-fold increase in bioluminescence as compared with PBS-treated animals (Fig. 7A). As expected, IL-13 administration led to an increase in MUC5AC-driven luciferase activity. Therefore, TNF-α is sufficient to engage MUC5AC gene expression in mouse lung epithelium. We next delivered TNF-α to mice intranasally for 3 consecutive days, and lung sections were prepared and stained for Alcian Blue/periodic acid-Schiff. Several independent experiments were carried out, with a total of 17 mice analyzed. Representative views are presented in Fig. 7, B and C. As shown in Fig. 7B, airways from saline-treated mice were Alcian Blue/periodic acid-Schiff-negative. However, epithelial cells from TNF-α-treated mice were characterized by mucin production and goblet cell metaplasia (Fig. 7C). IKKβ-dependent Mucus Production in Airway Epithelium in Vivo—The observation of TNF-α-induced p65 nuclear translocation, NF-κB activation, and mucus production by epithelial cells prompted us to determine whether NF-κB was required for mucus production in vivo. To tackle that question, we administered TNF-α intranasally for 3 consecutive days to mice treated with a control adenovirus (GFP) or an IKKβ DN adenovirus. Lungs from animals after saline treatment were periodic acid-Schiff-negative (Fig. 7D, upper panel). Airway epithelium from TNF-α-treated GFP-infected mice developed a response that included mucus production by airway epithelial cells (Fig. 7D, middle panel). However, no mucus was detected upon TNF-α provocation in IKKβ DN adenovirus-treated animals (Fig. 7D, lower panel). These results provide compelling evidence of a pivotal role for NF-κB in controlling TNF-α-induced mucus production in airway epithelium in vivo. The epithelium lining the airways has evolved to respond to viral and bacterial infections by mounting an immune response characterized by the release of cytokines and chemokines and the produ"

https://openalex.org/W2059097542,"A GABAA receptor α1 subunit epilepsy mutation (α1(A322D)) introduces a negatively charged aspartate residue into the hydrophobic M3 transmembrane domain of the α1 subunit. We reported previously that heterologous expression of α1(A322D)β2γ2 receptors in mammalian cells resulted in reduced total and surface α1 subunit protein. Here we demonstrate the mechanism of this reduction. Total α1(A322D) subunit protein was reduced relative to wild type protein by a similar amount when expressed alone (86 ± 6%) or when coexpressed with β2 and γ2S subunits (78 ± 6%), indicating an expression reduction prior to subunit oligomerization. In α1β2γ2S receptors, endoglycosidase H deglycosylated only 26 ± 5% of α1 subunits, consistent with substantial protein maturation, but in α1(A322D)β2γ2S receptors, endoglycosidase H deglycosylated 91 ± 4% of α1(A322D) subunits, consistent with failure of protein maturation. To determine the cellular localization of wild type and mutant subunits, the α1 subunit was tagged with yellow (α1-YFP) or cyan (α1-CFP) fluorescent protein. Confocal microscopic imaging demonstrated that 36 ± 4% of α1-YFPβ2γ2 but only 5 ± 1% α1(A322D)-YFPβ2γ2 colocalized with the plasma membrane, whereas the majority of the remaining receptors colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum (55 ± 4% α1-YFPβ2γ2S, 86 ± 3% α1(A322D)-YFP). Heterozygous expression of α1-CFPβ2γ2S and α1(A322D)-YFPβ2γ2S or α1-YFPβ2γ2S and α1(A322D)-CFPβ2γ2S receptors showed that membrane GABAA receptors contained primarily wild type α1 subunits. These data demonstrate that the A322D mutation reduces α1 subunit expression after translation, but before assembly, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and membrane α1 subunits that are almost exclusively wild type subunits.

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The five subunits arise from seven subunit families that contain multiple subtypes and assemble in a limited number of subunit combinations, with the most prevalent consisting of two α1 subunits, two β2 subunits, and one γ2 subunit (2McKernan R.M.

Each subunit contains four hydrophobic segments (M1-M4) that are homologous to the four membrane spanning helices of the Torpedo marmorata nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits whose three-dimensional structure has been determined to 4 Å (6Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). A nonconserved missense mutation in the GABAA receptor α1 subunit gene (GABRA1, α1(A322D)) that codes for an aspartate in place of an alanine at position 7 of the M3 transmembrane segment is present in a form of autosomal dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (7Cossette P. Liu L. Brisebois K. Dong H. Lortie A. Vanasse M. Saint-Hilaire J.M. Carmant L. Verner A. Lu W.Y. Wang Y.T. Rouleau G.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), an idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome that accounts for ∼10% of all cases of epilepsy (8Genton P. Gelisse P. Arch. Neurol. 2001; 58: 1487-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When expressed in heterologous cells, this mutation affects both the function and expression of GABAA receptors. Expression of the α1(A322D) subunit with β2 and γ2 subunits (“homozygous expression”) reduced peak currents by ∼90%, substantially altered whole cell current kinetics, and reduced mean single channel open times (7Cossette P. Liu L. Brisebois K. Dong H. Lortie A. Vanasse M. Saint-Hilaire J.M. Carmant L. Verner A. Lu W.Y. Wang Y.T. Rouleau G.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 9Fisher J.L. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Gallagher M.J. Song L. Arain F. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the α1(A322D) mutation reduced α1 subunit expression by 94%, and that it produced asymmetrical, subunit position-dependent reduction of heterozygous receptor currents and α1 subunit protein expression (10Gallagher M.J. Song L. Arain F. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Heterozygous receptors constructed from concatamers with the α1(A322D) subunit positioned between two β2 subunits had 35% of peak current amplitudes and 70% of protein expression relative to wild type receptors, whereas heterozygous receptors with α1(A322D) positioned between β2 and γ2 subunits had 1% of peak current amplitude and 51% of protein expression of wild type receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first naturally occurring missense mutation that reduces expression of a ligand-gated ion channel subunit. Because α1(A322D) substantially reduced the amount of α1 subunit, it is likely that it is this reduction in total α1 subunit expression, and not the alteration of GABAA receptor current kinetics, that is the predominant mechanism by which this mutation causes disinhibition and epilepsy. Here we determined the mechanism by which this single missense mutation reduced α1 subunit expression. Expression of recombinant GABAA Receptors—pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing cDNAs that encode human α1, β2S, and γ2S GABAA receptor subunits were a gift from Dr. Mathew Jones (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). α1-YFP and α-CFP cDNAs were constructed by first inserting HpaI and SacII restriction sites between the codons encoding amino acids four and five of the mature α1 subunit. DNA encoding the fluorescent protein (FP) from the corresponding γ2S-FP subunit (11Kang J. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8672-8677Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was removed by HpaI and SacII digestion and then ligated into the α1 subunit-containing plasmid between the codons encoding amino acids four and five of the mature subunit. Cycle 3 GFP-tagged α1 subunit was constructed by performing a blunt ligation of the α1 subunit cDNA into cycle 3 GFP-containing pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). The α1(A322D) mutation was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All cDNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were a gift from P. Connely (COR Therapeutics, San Francisco, CA). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 IU/ml streptomycin and penicillin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, 2.7 μl/μg of DNA). For the Western blot experiments, the cells were transfected in 6-cm dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) using 2:2:2 μg, α1:β2S:γ2S. Transfections were similar for the electrophysiology experiments but also included 1 μg of pHOOK (Invitrogen), which was used for immunomagnetic separation (12Greenfield L.J. Sun F. Neelands T.R. Burgard E.C. Donnelly J.L. Macdonald R.L. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36 (Jr.): 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Twenty hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged (400 × g), and incubated with hapten-coated magnetic beads for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells that bound the magnetic beads were isolated via a magnetic stand and plated on 35-mm culture dishes. For the confocal microscopy experiments, cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes using equal amounts (1 μg) of α1-FP, β2S, and γ2S subunit cDNAs. For the ER colocalization experiments, the cells were also transfected with 30 ng of a cyan fluorescent protein-tagged endoplasmic reticulum marker (CFP-ER, BD Biosciences). Immunoblots—The Western blot protocol has been described (10Gallagher M.J. Song L. Arain F. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed in modified radioimmunoassay solution (RIPA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate) that contained one pellet of Complete Mini™ protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) per 10 ml. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE at the acrylamide concentrations given in the figure legends. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were electrotransfered to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Inc.). All primary antibodies were monoclonal and were purchased from Chemicon Inc. (Temecula, CA). In experiments in which the cells were transfected with untagged α1 and α1(A322D) subunits, the membranes were first incubated with an antibody against the α1 subunit (5 μg/ml, clone BD24) in addition to an antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 0.1 μg/ml, clone 6C5), which was used to control for the amount of protein loaded on the gel. For experiments in which the cells were transfected with FP-tagged α1 subunit, the membranes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to green fluorescent protein (1:2500) as well as to an antibody to β-actin (clone C4, 1 μg/ml). After incubation with the primary antibody, all immunoblots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, 1:6000 dilution) and then visualized with a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using a digital imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The integrated density volume (IDV, pixel intensity × mm2) of each band was calculated using the Alpha Innotech software. Background IDVs were obtained from regions adjacent to the bands of interest and subtracted from the total IDV. All protein bands were normalized to the loading control (GAPDH or actin). Endoglycosidase Digestion—Protein lysates were prepared as described above and their protein concentrations were measured using the Micro BCA Protein Assay™ (Pierce). Endoglycosidase H (endo-H) and peptide N-glycosidase-F (PNGaseF) were obtained from Sigma. Endo-H and PNGaseF digestion of nicotinic AChR δ-subunit has been described (13Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both endoglycosidase digestions were performed for 3 h at 37 °C. Endo-H digestions were performed in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol with 0.2 units/ml endo-H. PNGaseF digestions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol with 0.2 units/ml PNGaseF. The reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the reaction products were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described above. Confocal Microscopy and Image Analysis—Approximately 24 h before the confocal microscopy experiments, the transfected cells were plated in collagen-coated 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek, Ash-land, MA). The dishes were then coded, and thus the microscopy experiments were performed in a single-blinded fashion. Immediately before imaging, N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide (FM 4-64, 0.3 μg/ml, Invitrogen) was added to the culture media to stain the cells' plasma membranes without staining the ER (14Bolte S. Brown S. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were chosen at random and were imaged using a Zeiss 500 META confocal microscope with a ×40, 1.3 numerical aperture Pan neofluoar objective. For all cells except those transfected with α1-CFP, the pinhole of all channels was adjusted so that the images were obtained as a single 2-μm slice through the middle of the cell. To collect more emitted light from the cells that were transfected with α1-CFP, the pinhole of all channels was adjusted so that the images were obtained as a single 3-μm slice through the middle of the cell. Excitation wavelengths were 455, 514, and 543 nm for CFP, YFP, and FM 4-64, respectively. For each excitation wavelength, the laser power was adjusted as necessary to utilize the full dynamic range of the detector for each respective fluorophore. CFP emission was detected with a 475-525-nm band pass filter, and FM 4-64 emission was detected using a 560-long pass filter. YFP emission was spectrally separated from CFP and FM 4-64 by reflecting the emitted light off a NFT545 dichroic mirror and then filtering it through a 530-600-band pass filter. The digital images were obtained with 2.8 times scanning zoom and 8 bit, 512 × 512 pixel resolution. All images presented in the figures are unprocessed. The confocal image files were coded and processed in a single-blind fashion using the ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Background FP fluorescence for each image was obtained from cells that stained with FM 4-64 but did not express FP. Background CFP-ER fluorescence was defined as the CFP fluorescence in the nucleus. The background fluorescence was subtracted from the images at the 99th percentile. For cells cotransfected with CFP-ER, membrane YFP fluorescence was defined as the YFP outside the boundary of CFP-ER and FM 4-64 staining. For cells not cotransfected with CFP-ER, membrane FP fluorescence was defined as the FP outside the inner portion of FM 4-64 staining. ER YFP fluorescence was defined as intracellular YFP that colocalized with ER fluorescence. The integrated fluorescence from each subcellular region was calculated by summing all the background-subtracted fluorescence values from each pixel in that area. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Lysates of cells expressing β2 and γ2S subunits and wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous cycle 3 GPP-tagged α1 subunit (α1-GFP) were prepared as described above. Cycle 3 GFP was used to tag the α1 subunit for fluorescence spectroscopy rather than enhanced fluorescence proteins (CFP or YFP) because of its high fluorescence efficiency (15Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar); it was not used for microscopy because its absorbance maximum is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Ali-quots (200 μl) of the lysates were placed in microtiter plates, and the fluorescence was determined in a Flexstation™ fluorescence spectrometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with an excitation of 395 nm and emission of 507 nm. Background fluorescence was defined as the fluorescence from lysates from untransfected cells; the background was subtracted from the fluorescence of the experimental lysates. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological recordings were performed 48 h after transfection. The intrapipette solution contained (in mm): 153 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 2 MgATP (pH 7.3, osmolarity = 305-310 mOsm). The external recording solution consisted of (in mm): 142 NaCl, 8 KCl, 6 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, osmolarity = 319-325 mOsm). Recording pipettes were pulled on a Sutter P-2000 micropipette electrode puller (Sutter Instrument Co., San Rafael, CA) from borosilicate capillary glass (Fisher). GABA was applied to the cells via gravity using a system consisting of pulled four-barrel square glass (200-300 μm) connected to a Perfusion Fast-Step (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). The solution exchange time was determined by stepping a 10% dilute external solution across the open electrode tip to measure a liquid junction current; the 10-90% rise times for solution exchange were consistently ≤0.4 ms. GABAA receptor currents were recorded in voltage clamp mode with cells clamped at -50 mV using a lifted whole cell patch-clamp technique (16Hinkle D.J. Bianchi M.T. Macdonald R.L. BioTechniques. 2003; 35 (476): 472-474PubMed Google Scholar) using an Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). The signals were sampled at 10 kHz and written to a computer hard drive. Homology Modeling and Secondary Structure Prediction—Multiple amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW software (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). We identified amino acids of the M3 segments of the Torpedo marmorata AChR subunits that were homologous to the Ala-322 residue of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit in two steps. First, the following amino acid sequences were aligned in four groups: 1) Torpedo marmorata nAChR α, β, γ2, and δ subunits; 2) human GABAA receptor α1-6 subunits; 3) human GABAA receptor β1-3 subunits; and 4) human γ1-3 subunits. Next, the 16 sequences in these four groups were aligned together in conjunction with the human GABAA receptor δ-subunit, and the results of the 17-sequence alignment were visually compared with the small group analyses to make certain the sequences that were most similar with one another remained in alignment. Identification and scoring of transmembrane helices were performed using the relevant ExPASY Proteomics tools (us.expasy.org/tools/) topology prediction algorithms (DAS, TopPred, TMPred, and TMHMM). The predictions were performed first on the native AChR sequences and then on the sequences in which the amino acid in the M3 domain homologous to the GABAA α1 subunit Ala-322 was changed to an aspartate. The scores from the topology prediction programs, which predicted a transmembrane helix for the 25-amino acid segments beginning at αTyr-277, βTyr-283, γTyr-291, and δTyr-286 (corresponding to the M3 transmembrane helices in the Torpedo marmorata electron diffraction data) for the sequences with or without the aspartate substitution, were compared. Data Analysis—Values are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance for the endoglycosidase, confocal, and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments were determined using the Student's unpaired t test and the significance of expression differences in the Western blot experiments and the effect of aspartate substitution on topology prediction scores were determined using the paired t test (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). α1(A322D) Subunit Expression Was Reduced With or Without Coexpression with β2 and γ2S Subunits—GABAA receptor subunits oligomerize in the ER via distinct pathways (17Connolly C.N.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6587-6596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because expression of α1(A322D)β2γ2S receptors reduced currents and protein expression in a subunit position-dependent fashion (10Gallagher M.J. Song L. Arain F. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that α1(A322D) subunit mutation inhibited subunit oligomerization, thereby leading to mutant α subunit degradation. To test this hypothesis, we transfected cells with wild type α1 or heterozygous or homozygous α1(A322D) subunits and either wild type β2 and γ2S subunits (α1β2γ2S) or an equivalent amount of empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid (α1pcDNA) and performed Western blots on whole cell lysates (Fig. 1, A and B). The ratio of α1 subunit to GAPDH expression from whole cell lysates was determined by quantification of Western blots from whole cell lysates (Fig. 1, C and D). With transfection of both α1β2γ2S and α1pcDNA subunits, heterozygous α1 subunit expression was intermediate between those of wild type and the homozygous mutant α1 subunit expression (percentage of wild type expression of α1β3γ2S: n = 10, heterozygous 66 ± 6%, p = 0.045, homozygous 22 ± 6% p = 0.011; α1pcDNA n = 10: heterozygous 49 ± 6%, p = 0.005, homozygous 14 ± 6%, p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in the reduction of α1 subunit expression between cells transfected with α1β2γ2S subunits and those transfected with α1 subunits alone (heterozygous p = 0.061, homozygous p = 0.335). These results were unexpected because they indicated that that the α1(A322D) mutation reduced α1 subunit protein levels prior to receptor assembly. α1(A322D) Was Endoglycosidase H Sensitive—A reduction in α1(A322D) subunit expression prior to receptor assembly could result from decreased efficiency of transcription or translation or from increased post-translational degradation of the mutant α1(A322D) subunit, known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). If α1(A322D) subunit transcription or translation were reduced, the post-translational processing of residual α1(A322D) subunit would be similar to that of the wild type subunit. In contrast, accelerated ERAD would result in the residual α1(A322D) subunits having ER- but not Golgi-associated processing. The α1 subunit has two sites of N-linked glycosylation that reside on its extracellular N terminus (17Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 25Buller A.L. Hastings G.A. Kirkness E.F. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 858-865PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins are N-linked glycosylated with high mannose carbohydrates co-translationally within the ER, but upon trafficking to the trans-Golgi the high mannose carbohydrates are replaced with low mannose carbohydrates (26Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Digestion with endo-H removes high mannose N-linked carbohydrates, whereas digestion with PNGaseF removes all carbohydrates. Therefore, endo-H sensitivity indicates a protein has not been trafficked at least as far as the trans-Golgi (27Matsuda S. Hannen R. Matsuda K. Yamada N. Tubbs T. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine the glycosylation state of mutant α1(A322D) subunits, we digested cell lysates with endo-H or PNGaseF from cells transfected with wild type α1β2γ2S, heterozygous α1α1(A322D)β2γ2S, and homozygous α1(A322D)β2γ2S receptor subunits. Undigested cell lysates and those digested with endo-H or PNGaseF were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2, A and B). Because the wild type α1 subunit expresses more efficiently than heterozygous and homozygous α1 subunits, protein was loaded in the ratio WT:heterozygous: homozygous, 8:15:50 μg, to balance the amount of α1 subunit detected on the blot. Undigested wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous proteins ran at 50 kDa, and those digested with PNGaseF (removal of all N-linked carbohydrates) ran at 46 kDa, a reduction in molecular weight similar to PNGaseF digestion of Torpedo AChR δ-subunit (13Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and tunicamycin inhibition of GABAA receptor 9E10-tagged α1 subunit glycosylation (17Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). With endo-H digestion, wild type and heterozygous receptors ran in two bands at 46 (endo-H sensitive) and 48.4 kDa (endo-H resistant), whereas endo-H digestion products of homozygous receptors ran in a single band at 46 kDa (Fig. 2, C and D). The 1.6-kDa shift in the endo-H-resistant band is similar to endo-H digestion of the AChR δ-subunit (13Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Quantification of the 46- and 48.8-kDa digestion products demonstrated that 74 ± 5% of wild type (n = 6), 64 ± 4% of heterozygous (n = 6, p = 0.13), and 9 ± 4% (n = 6, p < 0.0001) of homozygous receptors were endo-H resistant. This shows that essentially all the homozygous α1(A322D) subunits retained ER processing and provides evidence that the defect in α1(A322D) subunit trafficking occurs after translation. Given the results of endo-H digestion of wild type and homozygous α1 subunits, with independent processing of these subunits, 42, not 64%, of heterozygous α1 subunit should have been endo-H sensitive. This suggests that other processes (such as protein degradation) may alter the relative ratios of wild type α1 and α1(A322D) subunits. Another alternative is that this assay lacks the resolution and statistical power to detect a difference in the extent of glycosylation between wild type and heterozygous receptors. α1-YFPβ2γ2S andα1(A322D)-YFPβ2γ2S Receptors Were Functional—To further characterize the subcellular localization of wild type and mutant α1 subunits, we constructed YFP-tagged wild type (α1-YFP) and mutant (α1(A322D)-YFP) subunits. Electrophysiological analysis of N-terminal fluorescent-tagged γ2-subunit-containing GABAA receptors has been performed in fibroblasts (11Kang J. Macdonald R.L. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Depending on cell type, expression level, or expression environment, the channels can be activated through the phospholipase C pathway, or in some instances, by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (1Putney Jr., J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Aziz O. Trebak M. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The calcium-permeable cation channel, canonical transient receptor potential 7 (TRPC7) was originally shown to function as a phospholipase C-regulated channel, presumably through production of diacylglycerol (4Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, a subsequent report has provided evidence that TRPC7 could function as a store-operated channel (5Riccio A. Mattei C. Kelsell R.E. Medhurst A.D. Calver A.R. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Benham C.D. Pangalos M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been demonstrated that the different findings from the two laboratories likely result from differences in expression conditions. When TRPC7 is transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, it behaves as a diacylglycerol-activated channel; but when expressed stably, it appears to function as a capacitative or store-operated calcium entry channel (6Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1709-C1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is thus important to determine which, if either, of these two behaviors corresponds to the physiological function of TRPC7 when expressed endogenously. To date, there have been no studies of the physiological function of endogenously expressed TRPC7. Thus, in the current work, we utilized targeted homologous recombination to knock out TRPC7 in B-lymphocytes of DT40, a cell line previously shown to endogenously express both store-operated and non-store-operated pathways (7Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St.J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W.

Although knock out of TRPC7 from DT40 cells caused significant alterations in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling, it did not result in a diminution in whole-cell Icrac current. Rather, in the avian B-cell line, TRPC7 appears to function as a phospholipase C-regulated, diacylglycerol-activated channel. transient receptor potential channel guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate oleyl acetyl glycerol 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Fura-2-acetoxymethylester inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate protease-activated receptor 2 wild-type Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current. transient receptor potential channel guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate oleyl acetyl glycerol 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Fura-2-acetoxymethylester inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate protease-activated receptor 2 wild-type Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current. Reagents—Thapsigargin, methacholine, and oleyl acetyl glycerol (OAG) were purchased from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. BAPTA was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Methacholine was purchased from Sigma. Fura-2-acetoxymethylester (Fura-2) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. Ca2+ and Ba2+ Measurements—The immortalized chicken B-lymphocyte cell line DT40 (RIKEN (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) Cell Bank number RCB1464) and a mutant version with the gene for TRPC7 disrupted (see below) were maintained in suspension culture and loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, as previously described (10Broad L.M. Braun F.-J. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed and bathed in Hepes-buffered physiological saline solution at room temperature at least 20 min before Ca2+ or Ba2+ measurements were made. In some experiments, a nominally Ca2+-free medium was used, which was identical in composition, except for the omission of added CaCl2. For all cell lines, measurements of Fura-2 fluorescence ratios, indicative of changes in intracellular Ca2+ or Ba2+, were recorded and analyzed with a digital fluorescence imaging system (InCyt Im2, Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH), as described previously (11Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Birnbaumer L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16244-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted at room temperature, and data were reported as the ratio of fluorescence due to excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Transmembrane divalent cation flux, either constitutive or stimulated, was estimated by measuring the initial rate of Ba2+ entry following the addition of 10 mm Ba2+ in fluorescence ratio units/min. Electrophysiology—Macroscopic membrane ion currents were recorded using the patch clamp technique in its whole-cell configuration. The currents were acquired using pCLAMP-9.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and analyzed off-line using Origin 6 (Microcal) software. The extracellular solution (osmolarity 310 mosmol/liter) contained (in mm): NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; Hepes, 10; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2 or 10, as indicated; pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). The intracellular pipette solution (osmolarity 290 mosmol/liter) contained (in mm): cesium-methanesulfonate, 145; BAPTA, 10; Hepes, 10; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 0 or 2.2; pH 7.2 (adjusted with CsOH). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI Instruments). The resistance of the pipettes varied between 3 and 5 mΩ. Necessary supplements were added directly to the respective solutions in concentrations that would not significantly change the osmolarity. Changes in the external solutions were carried out using a multibarrel puffing micropipette with common outflow that was positioned in close proximity to the cell under investigation. During the experiment, the cell was continuously superfused with the solution via puffing pipette to reduce possible artifacts related to the switch from static to moving solution and vise versa. Generation of TRPC7-deficient DT40 Cells—The strategy is summarized in Fig. 1. The chicken genomic TRPC7 DNA was obtained by PCR using pairs of primers: chTRPC7-P1, sense, 5′-TTGAAGTTTGTAGCACACGCAGTTTC-3′ and chTRPC7-P1FR, antisense, 5′-ACGACGCCACAAAGATGGACA-3′; chTRPC7-P1F sense, 5′-TGTCCATCTTTGTGGCGTCGT-3′ and chTRPC7-P2, antisense, 5′-GGTGTTGTTTATCATGGCTATTAGC, respectively. The targeting vector of TRPC7 was constructed by replacing the genomic sequence, which encodes the hydrophobic segment H-3–H-6 of chicken TRPC7, with a histidinol (hisD) or neomycin resistance gene (neo) cassette (12Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The upstream 4.3-kb and downstream 1.6-kb genomic sequences of TRPC7 were used as a targeting vector. DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. The targeting vector was linearized and transfected sequentially into DT40 cells by electroporation (550 V, 25 microfarads). After isolation of several clones in the presence of 1 mg/ml histidinol or 2 mg/ml G418, genomic DNAs were prepared and analyzed by Southern blot analysis using the 3′-flanking probe (Fig. 1). Northern Blot Analysis—RNA blot hybridization analysis was carried out using total RNA (30 μg) from wild-type or TRPC7-/- cells. The probe used to detect TRPC7 RNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using specific primers (chTRPC7-P1F and chTRPC7-P6, 5′-GATTACTCCATAGAGTACGTATCC-3′). The Random Primer DNA labeling kit, version 2 (Takara Shuzo) was used to 32P label the probe. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA, as described previously (13Mori Y.

Transient Transfections—Transient transfections of the wild-type and TRPC7-/- DT40 cells were carried out by electroporation essentially as described previously (14Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Trebak M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), with either the human isoform of TRPC7 (10 μg/ml) into pcDNA3 vector or vector alone (pcDNA3, mock transfected cells) along with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (5 μg) as a marker for transfection. Cells were used for real-time fluorescence measurements 20–25 h post-transfection. In figures involving transient transfections, average traces from 6–10 enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-positive cells are shown for a single experiment, and these are representative of three independent experiments. Statistics—When comparisons were made between two groups, we used Student's t test; when three groups were analyzed, we used analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons as post hoc tests. In some instances, in which multiple knock-out cells gave (in every cell) no response at all, we simply provided the mean and S.E. of the wild-type cells and cited the number of knock-out cells that failed to respond. Knock Out of TRPC7 in DT40 B-lymphocytes Alters Thapsigargin-activated [Ca2+]i Signals—Initially, we sought to determine whether TRPC7 might play a role in either store-operated or non-store-operated calcium entry in a cell in which both modes of entry occur.

Two independent DT40 cell lines null for the TRPC7 message (Fig. 1) were generated, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The lines were designated TRPC7-/- clone 14.3 and TRPC7-/- clone 14.304. Fig. 2 shows initial experiments examining store-operated or capacitative calcium entry in wild-type and TRPC7-/- cells. Both knock-out lines differed from wild-type cells in two ways. First, both lines appeared to have substantially increased intracellular Ca2+ stores, based on the size of the response to thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Similar results were obtained using the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin to discharge the stores (not shown). Second, the rate of Ba2+ entry in response to store depletion by thapsigargin (a measure of store-operated divalent cation entry, (6Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J.

The diminished rate of Ba2+ entry seen in the thapsigargin-treated TRPC7-/- cells is indicative of a diminished store-operated entry and thus might imply a role for TRPC7 in this pathway. However, we also considered the possibility that the enlarged thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pool might retain Ca2+ for a longer time, resulting in less pool depletion and thus less activation of Ba2+ entry (see, for example, Ref. 22Leissring M.A. Akbari Y. Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In experiments extending the time of Ba2+ addition by 15 min (not shown), the effect of TRPC7 knock out on the rate of Ba2+ entry was diminished, although still statistically significant (wild type, 0.063 + 0.008 ratio units/min, n = 197; clone 14.3, 0.040 + 0.006 ratio units/min, n = 205; p = 0.0213). In addition, in fluorescence experiments, membrane potential is not controlled, and a partially inhibited response could result from alterations in the driving force for entry. Thus, we next turned to analysis of the store-operated current Icrac (13Mori Y. Wakamori M. Miyakawa T. Hermosura M. Hara Y. Nishida M. Hirose K. Mizushima A. Kurosaki M. Mori E. Gotoh K. Okada T.

Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar) using whole-cell patch clamp. With this technique, Ca2+ stores can be rapidly depleted by a combination of IP3 and a Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA, in the patch pipette. As shown in Fig. 3, Icrac activation in TRPC7-/- cells did not differ significantly from that in wild-type cells. Note, however, that as reported by others, the magnitude of Icrac is rather small in these cells (13Mori Y. Wakamori M. Miyakawa T. Hermosura M. Hara Y. Nishida M. Hirose K. Mizushima A. Kurosaki M.

J. 2001; 360: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), such that a small, partial inhibitory effect of TRPC7 knock out would not likely be detected. However, this would contrast sharply with the almost complete loss of a non-store-operated pathway, documented below. Non-store-operated Entry in DT40 Wild-type and TRPC7-/- Cells— We next considered that TRPC7-/- cells might be deficient in non-store-operated Ca2+ entry, which is known to occur in this cell line (8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St.J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.-G. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Gill D.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we examined agonist activation of Ba2+ entry in the presence of 500 nm Gd3+, which is known to block completely the store-operated channels in DT40 cells (24Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows responses to activation of the endogenous B-cell receptors with an anti-IgM. As reported previously, in response to B-cell receptor activation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, DT40 cells exhibit irregular oscillations that dissipate gradually. The addition of 10 mm Ba2+, in the presence of 500 nm Gd3+, reveals the presence of a Ba2+-permeable pathway activated through the B-cell receptor (0.051 + 0.006 ratio units/min, n = 161). In TRPC7-/- cells, the oscillations were larger, more frequent, and more persistent presumably because of the increased capacity of intracellular Ca2+ stores (see Fig. 2). However, the addition of 10 mm Ba2+ did not result in a detectable elevation in basal fluorescence ratio in any of the TRPC7-/- cells (n = 183), indicating that the B-cell receptor-dependent Ba2+ entry was largely absent in these cells. The irregular pattern of Ca2+ oscillations following B-cell receptor activation makes quantitative analysis of the Ba2+ entry difficult. Thus, we also examined signaling through a G-protein-activated pathway, the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), known to be expressed in this cell line (25Morita T. Tanimura A. Nezu A. Kurosaki T. Tojyo Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of DT40 cells with 200 nm trypsin, which activates PAR2s, resulted in release of intracellular stores and Gd3+-insensitive entry of Ba2+. This Ba2+ entry was absent in TRPC7-/- cells (n = 136). Interestingly, the release of Ca2+ by trypsin did not appear to be augmented in the TRPC7-/- cells; this may indicate that this receptor type recruits a very specific endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pool. We examined the ability of the G-protein pathway to activate membrane currents likely responsible for the Gd3+-insensitive Ba2+ entry that appears to depend on TRPC7. Because not all cells respond to either B-cell receptor ligation (∼55–60%) or to PAR2 (∼55–70%), we activated G-proteins directly by including GTPγS in the patch pipette solution, while examining whole cell currents in the whole-cell mode. Following break-in with a pipette solution containing 300 μm GTPγS, a current developed that reversed near 0 mV and was slightly outwardly rectifying (Fig. 6, A and B; maximum currents were: outward, 14.7 + 1.2 picoamperes/picofarads; inward, -8.7 + 0.9 picoamperes/picofarads, n = 7). This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of ectopically transfected TRPC7 (4Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The current was largely absent in TRPC7-/- cells (Fig. 6A, n = 6). In its non-store-operated mode, TRPC7 can also be activated by synthetic diacylglycerols (4Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 6Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1709-C1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the addition of the synthetic diacylglycerol OAG failed to activated any significant Ba2+ entry in wild-type or TRPC7-/- cells (Fig. 7, top). TRPC7 is known to be potently inhibited by protein kinase C (4Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which would also be activated by OAG, perhaps to a greater extent than with agonist or GTPγS activation. Thus, we utilized a combination of two protein kinase C inhibitors, Gö6976 (1 μm) and calphostin C (0.5 μm), and under these conditions, OAG activated significant Ba2+ entry in wild-type DT40 cells (Fig. 7, bottom) and activated a current similar to that seen with GTPγS (Fig. 6C). The OAG-induced Ba2+ entry was significantly reduced in TRPC7-/- cells (Fig. 7, bottom) (wild type, 0.048 + 0.005 ratio units/min, n = 170; clone 14.3, 0.012 + 0.005, n = 183; p < 0.0001). We next sought to rescue the effects of TRPC7 deletion by transiently transfecting TRPC7-/- cells with a plasmid encoding for human TRPC7 (6Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1709-C1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Initially, we used a rather high concentration of the pcDNA3 plasmid (100 μg/ml) because of the low expression levels generally obtained with the cytomegalovirus promoter (14Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Transient expression of human TRPC7 resulted in a Ba2+ entry that could be activated by either a receptor agonist or OAG, but did not reverse the increased capacity of intracellular Ca2+ stores (not shown). The appearance of receptor- and OAG-activated entry following transient overexpression of TRPC7 is perhaps not surprising, given previous reports that overexpression of the close structural relative TRPC3 leads to similar behavior (14Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Venkatachalam K. Ma H.-T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The OAG-activated entry seen in TRPC7-/- cells transiently transfected with TRPC7 differed from OAG-activated entry in wild-type cells; in the TRPC7-transfected TRPC7-/- cells, OAG could activate entry even in the absence of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (not shown). Thus, we next transfected TRPC7-/- cells with a lower concentration of TRPC7 encoding plasmid (10 μg/ml); in our previous work, this concentration of TRPC3 plasmid did not produce any additional receptoror OAG-activated entry (14Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). With this apparently lower level of expression, neither wild-type nor TRPC7-/- cells responded to OAG in the absence of PKC inhibitors, whether transfected with TRPC7 or not (Fig. 8, A and C). In the presence of PKC inhibitors, the wild-type response was slightly but not significantly potentiated (Fig. 8B) (mock-transfected, 0.050 + 0.005 ratio units/min, n = 59; TRPC7-transfected, 0.053 + 0.004 ratio units/min, n = 65; p = 0.64); more significantly, in the TRPC7-/- cells, the response to OAG was restored by transfection with human TRPC7 (Fig. 8D) (mock-transfected, 0.017 + 0.006 ratio units/min, n = 51; TRPC7 transfected, 0.049 + 0.007 ratio units/min, n = 77; p = 0.016). Knock out of TRPC7 from DT40 B-lymphocytes produced three apparent phenotypes: an increased size of the Ca2+ stores, a diminished store-operated entry, and a diminished receptor- and diacylglycerol-activated entry. Of the three, only the latter, diacylglycerol-activated entry can be confidently attributed to the function of TRPC7 in native DT40 B-cells. The apparent decrease in store-operated entry appears to be secondary to the larger Ca2+ stores and the greater difficulty in completely depleting these stores with the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum CA2+ ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin. Thus, when stores were more rapidly depleted with a combination of IP3 and calcium chelator, the development of the store-operated current Icrac was not significantly different in wild-type and TRPC7-/- cells. It has previously been argued that TRPC channels can function in some environments as either store-operated or non-store-operated channels (1Putney Jr., J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and when ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells, TRPC7 is clearly capable of functioning in both of these modes (6Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1709-C1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the simplest interpretation of our data is that TRPC7 does not play an obligatory role in forming the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel in DT40 B-cells, it remains a possibility that, following knock out of the gene, other TRPC subunits may increase and assume this role. In addition, it is also conceivable that TRPC7 may function as a store-operated channel in other cell types, for example, in instances when the store-operated channels have conduction properties more akin to TRPCs (27Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The increased size of intracellular Ca2+ stores might indicate a role for TRPC7 in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ homeostasis, perhaps by functioning as either a constitutively active or regulated Ca2+-permeable channel. This would not be the first example of a TRPC capable of gating Ca2+ fluxes in endoplasmic reticulum as well as in the plasma membrane (28Turner H. Fleig A. Stokes A. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Wisnoskey B.J. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is also not the first example of TRPC knock out affecting endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ signaling. Mori et al. (13Mori Y. Wakamori M. Miyakawa T. Hermosura M. Hara Y. Nishida M. Hirose K. Mizushima A. Kurosaki M. Mori E. Gotoh K. Okada T. Fleig A. Penner R. Iino M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) found that knock out of TRPC1 resulted in reduced sensitivity of endoplasmic reticulum stores to IP3-induced Ca2+ release. However, in that case, the thapsigargin-sensitive stores appeared unchanged. In the current study, the effects of TRPC7 knock out on calcium stores was not reversed by transient restoration of TRPC7. This may indicate that the effects on Ca2+ stores are more complex than simply loss of TRPC7 and may involve other longer term compensatory changes. On the other hand, the disappearance of a receptor- and diacylglycerol-activated Ba2+ entry and cation current was restored by transient transfection with a plasmid encoding for human TRPC7. Such an entry in DT40 cells has been reported in previous studies (8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St.J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.-G. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Gill D.L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and appears to depend in some manner on IP3 receptors. However, the precise role of IP3 receptors in this pathway is controversial. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that (i) this entry appears to involve non-selective cation channels similar to TRPCs, (ii) this entry and current can be activated by exogenously applied diacylglycerols, and (iii) this entry and current are almost completely lost in the absence of TRPC7. The latter observation ties together the Ba2+ entry and currents seen under the various conditions of B-cell receptor activation, PAR2 activation, activation by intracellular application of GTPγS, and activation by OAG, as all of these responses were lost in the TRPC7-/- cells. This represents, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a physiological function of endogenously expressed TRPC7. The broader role of non-store-operated TRPC7 channels in B-lymphocyte function cannot be determined at present. However, there is ample evidence for such channels in both T- and B-lymphocytes (31Grafton G. Thwaite L. Immunology. 2001; 104: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The identity of a candidate channel subunit participating specifically in this pathway should open the way for more detailed analyses of the physiological role of receptor-regulated TRPC channels in B-lymphocytes and other non-excitable cells. The human TRPC7 plasmid was jointly supplied by Christine Murphy and Adrian Wolstenholm of the University of Bath and John Westwick of Novartis, Horsham, UK. Drs. David Miller and David Armstrong read the manuscript and provided helpful comments."

The products of the oxidative transformation of fatty acids are raising an increasing interest in all organisms because it appears that a very broad range of such derivatives can be generated, most of them having important biological activity (1Funk C.D.

In mammals the products of the “arachidonic cascade” provide a good illustration of the diversity of structures and biological activities (1Funk C.D.

Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In plants, a large number of fatty acid oxygenations are catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes (2Blée E. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 315-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The functions of the resulting products include different aspects of plant development, as well as wound and abiotic stress response and defense against insects and pathogens. Fatty acid hydroxylases belong to the cytochrome P450 superfamily, a highly diversified set of heme-containing proteins found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals (5Werck-Reichhart D. Feyereisen R. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3003.1-3003.9Crossref Google Scholar). One can distinguish ω-hydroxylases that catalyze the hydroxylation of the terminal methyl of aliphatic acids (ω position) and sub-terminal or in-chain hydroxylases that oxidize carbon in the aliphatic chain (ω-n position). So far the majority of the work has addressed the study of ω-hydroxylases. Biochemical studies led to the characterization of cytochrome P450-dependent ω-hydroxylases in microsomal preparations from pea and Vicia sativa (6Benveniste I. Salaün J.-P. Simon A. Reichhart D. Durst F. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 122-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Salaün J.-P. Simon A. Durst F. Lipids. 1986; 21: 776-779Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Pinot F. Salaün J.-P. Bosch H. Lesot A. Mioskowski C. Durst F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A strategy based on the use of radiolabeled suicide substrates allowed us to clone CYP94A1 from V. sativa (9Tijet N. Helvig C. Pinot F. Le Bouquin R. Lesot A. Durst F. Salaün J.-P. Benveniste I. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This enzyme may play a role in plant defense events. Indeed, recombinant CYP94A1 catalyzes the in vitro formation of 9,10,18-trihydroxystearic and 18-hydroxy-9,10-epoxystearic acids (10Pinot F. Benveniste I. Salaün J.-P. Loreau O. Noël J.-P. Schreiber L. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar). These two compounds are the major C18 monomers of cutin, a part of the cuticle that protects plant against different stress (11Kolattukudy P.E. Science. 1980; 208: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Furthermore they are also potent elicitors of defense mechanisms (12Schweizer P. Jeanguenat A. Whitacre D. Métraux J.-P. Mösinger E. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1996; 49: 103-120Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Fauth M. Schweizer P. Buchala A. Markstädter C. Riederer M. Kato T. Kauss H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The hypothesis of CYP94A1 participation in a plant defense event received support from the observation that this enzyme is induced at the transcriptional level by the stress hormone methyl jasmonate (14Pinot F. Benveniste I. Salaün J.-P. Durst F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Plant fatty acid hydroxylases could also be involved in catabolism like members of the CYP4 family in animals (15Simpson A.E.C.M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 16Gibson G.G. Xenobiotica. 1989; 19: 1123-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or like CYP52A3 and CYP52A4, which enable Candida maltosa to use aliphatic hydrocarbon as a source of carbon and energy (17Scheller U. Zimmer T. Kärgel E. Schunck W.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a previous work (18Le Bouquin R. Skrabs M. Kahn R. Benveniste I.

Indeed, CYP94A5 is able to catalyze the complete set of reactions oxidizing the terminal methyl to the corresponding carboxyl. Some fatty acid derivatives hydroxylated on ω-1 position involved in plant resistance have been described. Volicitin, which is an ω-1 hydroxy of linoleic acid coupled to l-glutamine, has a key role in plant resistance against herbivores (19Lait C.G. Alborn H.T. Teal P.E.A. Tumlinson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7027-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Paré P.W. Alborn H.T. Tumlinson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13971-13975Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Sub-terminal hydroxylation of jasmonates may be fundamental for reactions in the regulation of the signaling pathway for plant defense (21Meyer A. Gross D. Vorkefeld S. Kummer M. Schmidt J. Sembdner G. Schreiber K. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 1007-1011Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Hamberg M. Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, little information is available so far concerning sub-terminal hydroxylases despite the fact that they have been shown to be present in microsomes of different plants (23Salaün J.-P. Benveniste I. Reichhart D. Durst F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Salaün J.-P. Benveniste I. Fonné R. Gabriac B. Reichhart D. Simon A. Durst F. Physiol. Veg. 1982; 20: 613-621Google Scholar). About 1 decade ago, we showed the presence in microsomes in wheat of a cytochrome P450-dependent system involved in sub-terminal hydroxylation of oleic and lauric acids (25Pinot F. Alayrac C. Mioskowski C. Durst F. Salaün J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggested the presence of at least two cytochromes P450, and one of these cytochromes P450 was responsible for the resistance of wheat to diclofop (26Zimmerlin A. Durst F. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning of a new plant cytochrome P450 classified as CYP709C1. Functional expression in an engineered yeast allowed us to show that CYP709C1 metabolizes fatty acids, and among all the fatty acids tested, cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid produced by a peroxygenase is hydroxylated at positions ω-1 and ω-2 with the highest efficiency. This is the first report of a sub-terminal hydroxylase of long chain fatty acid cloned in plant. CYP709C1 is up-regulated at the transcriptional level by a treatment of wheat seedlings with a combination of the safener naphthalic acid anhydride with phenobarbital or by the stress hormone methyl jasmonate. Its physiological meaning remains to be established, and we discuss its possible implication in the plant defense and detoxifying process. Chemicals—Radiolabeled [1-14C]lauric acid (45 Ci/mol) was from CEA (Gif sur Yvette, France). [1-14C]Myristic acid (55 Ci/mol), [1-14C]palmitic acid (54 Ci/mol), [1-14C]oleic acid (50 Ci/mol), [1-14C]linoleic acid (58 Ci/mol), and [1-14C]linolenic acid (52 Ci/mol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Racemic sample of cis-9,10-[1-14C]epoxystearic acid was synthesized from [1-14C]oleic acid using m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The silylating reagent N,O-bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide containing 1% of trimethylchlorosilane was from Pierce. NADPH was from Sigma. Thin layer plates (Silica Gel G60 F254; 0.25 mm) were from Merck. Probe Identification and Full-length cDNA Cloning—An 810-nucleotide-long P450 fragment was identified by PCR on the wheat λ-ZipLox, NotI-SalI arms (Invitrogen)-oriented library (27Morant M. Hehn A. Werck-Reichhart D. BMC Plant Biol. 2002; 2: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We used the primer RTAVGCRAAKKYTCHCCVAKRCAH, which is the reverse primer of the one described by Meijer et al. (28Meijer A.H. Souer E. Verpoorte R. Hoge J.H.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with the primer T7 of the right border of our induced library. The PCR was carried out as described in Meijer et al. (28Meijer A.H. Souer E. Verpoorte R. Hoge J.H.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the different PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. The putative P450 sequence was identified by a BLASTX of the NCBI plant sequence data base. This incomplete P450 fragment was 32P-labeled to screen 250,000 plateforming units of the induced library with the Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). A complete cDNA sequence was identified (GenBank™ accession number AY641449) and was named CYP709C1. For a better expression in yeast, the N-terminal part of this P450 was recoded according to the procedure described previously (29Hehn A. Morant M. Werck-Reichhart D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with the following megaprimer: CGGGATCCATGGGTTTGGTTTGGATGGTTGCTGCTGCTGTTGCTGCTGTTTTGGCTTCTTGGGCTTTTGATGCTTTGGTTTATTTGGTTTGGAGACCAAGAGCTATTACTAGACAATTGAGAGCTCAAGGCGTCGGCGGTCCGGGCTACA. Heterologous Expression of CYP709C1 in Yeast—CYP709C1 was heterologous expressed by using pYeDP60 and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAT11 strain (30Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was cloned BamHI-EcoRI in pYeDP60, and the sequence was verified by DNA sequencing after the cloning step in the yeast vector. Yeast cells were harvested and broken with glass beads (0.45 mm diameter) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 600 mm sorbitol. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet consisting of microsomal membranes was resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and stored at –30 °C. All procedures for microsomal preparation were carried out at 0–4 °C. The cytochrome P450 content was measured by the method of Omura and Sato (31Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plant Material and Microsomal Preparation—Wheat seeds (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Etoile de Choisy) were soaked for 6 h and grown on moist paper at 25 °C for 48 h or coated with naphthalic acid anhydride (0.25% w/w) before germination. For control, ∼100 g of etiolated seedlings were harvested and incubated in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 1.5 liters of distilled water. For treatment, seedlings grown on naphthalic acid anhydride were harvested and incubated in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 1.5 liters of distilled water with 8 mm phenobarbital. The incubation medium was bubbled for 65 h with a stream of air (5 liters/min) in the dark at 25 °C. Methyl jasmonate treatment was performed by incubating seedlings (48 h old) in methyl jasmonate solution aerated by a stream of air (5 liters/min). The time of treatment and the concentration are specified for each experiment. Approximately 10 g of wheat seedlings were harvested and homogenized with an ultra-turrax (15,000 rpm, twice for 30 s) in 100 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 40 mm sodium ascorbate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was filtered through 50-μm blutex cloth and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 30% (v/v) glycerol, with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and stored at –30 °C. For peroxygenase activity measurement, the protocol of microsomal preparation was slightly modified. Wheat seedlings were harvested and homogenized with an ultra-turrax (15,000 rpm, twice for 30s) in 90 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The homogenate was filtered through 50-μm blutex cloth and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), and stored at 4 °C. All procedures for microsomal preparation were carried out at 0–4 °C. Microsomal protein content was estimated by a microassay procedure from Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as standard. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from 1 g of root or 1 g of coleoptile. For Northern blot analysis, total RNAs (5 or 10 μg/lane) were denatured, subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA corresponding to the coding region of CYP709C1 at 65 °C for 1 6 h in 5× SSC. After hybridization, the blot was washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, and twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. The 25 S and 18 S ribosomic RNA from wheat were used as an internal control. Enzyme Activities—All radiolabeled substrates were dissolved in ethanol that was evaporated before the addition of microsomes into the glass tube. Resolubilization of the substrates was confirmed by measuring the radioactivity of the incubation media. Enzymatic activities of CYP709C1 or wheat microsomes were determined by following the formation rate of metabolites. The standard assay (0.1 ml) contained 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm NADPH, plus a regenerating system (consisting of a final concentration of 6.7 mm Glc-6-P and 0.4 units of Glc-6-P-dehydrogenase) and radiolabeled substrate (100 μm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH and was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of acetonitrile (0.2% acetic acid). The reaction products were resolved by HPLC 4The abbreviations used are:HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRP-HPLCreverse phase-HPLCGC/MSgas chromatography/mass spectrometryTMSitrimethylsilyl or TLC as described below. Kinetic studies were performed for 7 min at 27 °C with 0.7 and 0.1 pmol of CYP709C1 for lauric acid and 9,10-epoxystearic acid, respectively. Determination of Km and Vmax values was based on six data points ranging from 3 to 150 μm for lauric acid and from 3 to 30 μm for 9,10-epoxystearic acid. Peroxygenase activity of wheat microsomes was measured as described previously using 100 μm of cumene hydroperoxide as cofactor (32Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). high pressure liquid chromatography reverse phase-HPLC gas chromatography/mass spectrometry trimethylsilyl Chromatographic Methods—Incubation media were directly spotted on TLC plates. For separation of hydroxy fatty acids from residual substrate (lauric and 9,10-epoxystearic acids), TLC were developed with a mixture of diethyl ether/light petroleum (boiling point, 40–60 °C)/formic acid (70:30:1 or 50:50:1 v/v/v, for lauric and 9,10-epoxystearic acids, respectively). For separation of 9,10-epoxystearic acid from residual oleic acid in peroxygenase measurement, TLC were developed with a mixture of diethyl ether/hexane/formic acid (50:50:1 v/v/v). The plates were scanned with a thin layer scanner (Berthold LB 2723). The area corresponding to the metabolites was scraped into counting vials and quantified by liquid scintillation, or they were eluted from the silica with 10 ml of the mixture diethyl ether/hexane (50:50, v/v), which was removed by evaporation. They were then subjected to GC/MS analysis. For HPLC analysis reaction products were directly injected after incubations. The metabolites were resolved by RP-HPLC (Waters, equipped with two 600 pumps and a Packard 500 TR series radiodetector) on a 5-μm Ultrasphere C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, Beckman Instruments, France) using isocratic solvent at a flow of 1 ml/min. A mixture of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (40:60:0.2, v/v/v) was used to elute 18-, 17-, and 16-hydroxy-9,10-epoxystearic acids. A linear gradient (0–100%) of 80% acetonitrile in aqueous acetic acid was used to elute residual 9,10-epoxystearic acid. Chiral Analysis—Chiral analyses were performed as described previously by using optically pure synthetic (9R,10S)-epoxystearate methyl ester as a standard (33Pinot F. Bosch H. Salaün J.-P. Durst F. Mioskowski C. Hammock B.D. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 35: 103-110Google Scholar). To determine the chirality of the residual epoxide after incubation with CYP709C1, the epoxide and the hydroxylated product were separated on TLC. The area corresponding to the epoxide was scraped, and the epoxide was eluted from the silica. The residual epoxide was dissolved in hexane (40 μl) after methylation with diazomethane and analyzed by HPLC (Waters equipped with two 600 pumps and a Packard 500 TR series radiodetector). Both enantiomers were resolved using a chiral column (Chiracel OB (4.6 × 250 mm) J. T. Baker Inc.) with an isocratic solvent hexane/propan-2-ol/acetic acid (99.7:0.2:0.1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Under the present conditions of analysis, methyl esters of (9S,10R)- and (9R,10S)-epoxystearic acids have retention times of 31 and 40 min, respectively. GC/MS Analysis—Metabolites generated during the incubations of lauric, oleic, and 9,10-epoxystearic acids with CYP709C1 or with wheat microsomes were eluted from silica with 10 ml of diethyl ether/hexane (50:50, v/v), methylated with diazomethane, and silylated with a mixture of pyridine and N,O-bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide containing 1% (v/v) trimethylchlorosilane (1:1, v/v). GC/MS analysis was carried out on a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 Series) equipped with a 30-m capillary column with an internal diameter of 0.25 mm and a film thickness of 0.25 μm (HP-5MS). The gas chromatograph was combined with a quadrupole mass selective detector (Agilent 5973N). Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV and analyzed as in Eglinton et al. (34Eglinton G. Hunneman D.H. McCormick A. Org. Mass Spectrom. 1968; 1: 593-611Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Yeast has only three cytochromes P450; they are expressed at a negligible rate under the growth conditions used, and none of these is able to oxidize fatty acids (30Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed by GC/MS analysis of incubations performed with microsomes of yeast transformed with void plasmid, which did not show any formation of metabolite. Cloning of CYP709C1—In an attempt to clone all cytochromes P450 from wheat involved in xenobiotic metabolism, the screening of a cDNA library from wheat treated with cloquintocet-mexyl and phenobarbital led us to isolate and sequence a full-length cDNA of 1975 bp containing an open reading frame of 1545 bp. Sequence alignment and data base searching showed that the deduced protein was a new member of the CYP709 family of cytochromes P450. The peptide (514 amino acids) has a calculated mass of 57,484 Da and pI of 9.01. This new cytochrome P450 enzyme was classified as CYP709C1 by the cytochrome P450 nomenclature committee. For a better expression in yeast, the N-terminal part of CYP709C1 was recoded according to the procedure already described (29Hehn A. Morant M. Werck-Reichhart D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For our study we used microsomes from yeast strain WAT11 transformed with the recoded CYP709C1. Yeast has only three cytochromes P450; they are expressed at a negligible rate under our growth conditions (30Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of these is able to oxidize fatty acids, ensuring us that the metabolism studied in this work is because of the recombinant enzyme. Furthermore, WAT11 overexpresses a plant P450 reductase that allows excellent electron transfer and probably increases the stability of the plant P450 in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. Metabolism of Lauric Acid by CYP709C1—After incubation of lauric acid (C12:0) with microsomes of yeast expressing CYP709C1, incubation media were directly analyzed by TLC. Fig. 1 shows radiochromatograms obtained after incubation in the absence (Fig. 1A) or in the presence (Fig. 1B) of NADPH. Two polar metabolites were formed in the presence of NADPH (Fig. 1B, peaks 1 and 2). They were not produced in the incubation of boiled microsomes or in the incubation with microsomes of yeast transformed with a void plasmid (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results demonstrate the involvement of CYP709C1 in their formation. We determined an optimum pH of 7.2. Metabolites of peaks 1 and 2 were purified, derivatized, and analyzed by GC/MS. Mass spectrum of the metabolite 1 of lauric acid after derivatization (Fig. 2A) showed ions at m/z (relative intensity %) 73 (43%) ((CH3)3Si+), 75 (25%) ((CH3)2Si+=O), 117 (base peak 100%), 146 (4%) (CH2=C+ (OSi(CH3)3–OCH3), 159 (10%) (CH3–O+=C+(OSi(CH3)3)CH=CH2), 201 (0.5%), 215 (2%), 255 (11%) (M – 47) (loss of methanol from the (M – 15) fragment), 271 (3%) (M – 31) (loss of OCH3 from the methyl ester), 287 (5%) (M – 15) (loss of a methyl from the TMSi group). This fragmentation pattern is characteristic of the derivative of 11-hydroxylauric acid (M = 302 g/mol) (Fig. 2A). Mass spectrum of the second metabolite of lauric acid after derivatization (Fig. 2B) showed ions at m/z (relative intensity %) 73 (75%) ((CH3)3Si+), 75 (33%) ((CH3)2Si+ =O), 131 (base peak 100%), 146 (5%) (CH2=C+(OSi(CH3)3–OCH3), 159 (8%) (CH3–O+=C+(OSi(CH3)3)CH=CH2), 201 (0.5%), 215 (1%), 255 (10%) (M – 47) (loss of methanol from the (M – 15) fragment), 271 (4%) (M – 31) (loss of OCH3 from the methyl ester), 273 (43%), 287 (2%) (M – 15) (loss of a methyl from the TMSi group). This fragmentation pattern is characteristic of the derivative of 10-hydroxylauric acid (Fig. 2B). These metabolites were not formed in incubation with boiled microsomes (not shown) or in incubation with microsomes of yeast transformed with a void plasmid (Fig. 1C). We performed kinetic studies to determine Km(app) and Vmax(app) values of 158 ± 6 μm and 132 ± 3 nmol/min/nmol P450, respectively.FIGURE 2CYP709C1 metabolizes lauric acid to 11- and 10-hydroxylauric acids.

Durst F. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, we incubated this herbicide with microsomes of transformed yeast, but we did not observe any metabolism of diclofop in these incubations. Epoxidation of Oleic Acid in Wheat Microsomes—We incubated oleic acid (C18:1) with wheat microsomes in the presence of cumene hydroperoxide, and the incubation medium was directly analyzed by TLC. Radiochromatogram of Fig. 3 shows that one metabolite was formed (Fig. 3A, peak 1). It was not formed in incubation with boiled microsomes (Fig. 3B). After purification, this product was methylated with diazomethane and subjected to GC/MS analysis. We also methylated and analyzed by GC/MS authentic 9,10-epoxystearic acid. The mass spectrum obtained for the metabolite purified from peak 1 was identical to that of authentic 9,10-epoxystearate methyl ester (M = 312 g/mol) showing ions at m/z (relative intensity %) 155 (100%) (base peak, loss of (CH2)7COOCH3), 199 (14%) (loss of (CH2)7CH3), 281 (2%) (M – 31, loss of OCH3), and 294 (1%) (M – 18, loss of H2O). This mass spectrum is also identical to mass spectrum of methylated 9,10-epoxystearic acid produced by partially purified peroxygenase from soybean (32Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This shows that wheat possesses a microsomal peroxygenase able to synthesize 9,10-epoxystearic acid using oleic acid as substrate. Metabolism of cis-9,10-Epoxystearic Acid by CYP709C1—We incubated 9,10-epoxystearic acid with microsomes expressing CYP709C1 to test if it was substrate. No metabolite were formed in absence of NADPH (Fig. 4A). Addition of this cofactor to the incubation medium led to the formation of two metabolites (Fig. 4B, peaks 1 and 2). They were purified and analyzed by GC/MS. Mass spectrum of the metabolite 1 of cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid after derivatization (Fig. 5A) showed ions at m/z(relative intensity %) 73 (58%) ((CH3)3Si+), 75 (38%) ((CH3)2Si+ =O), 117 (base peak 100%), 146 (3%) (CH2=C+(OSi(CH3)3–OCH3), 159 (5%) (CH3–O+=C+(OSi(CH3)3)CH=CH2), 199 (8%), 213 (5%), 243 (3%), and 353 (0.5%) (M – 47) (loss of methanol from the (M – 15) fragment), 369 (0.5%) (M – 31) (loss of OCH3 from the methyl ester), and 385 (1%) (M – 15) (loss of a methyl from the TMSi group) (M = 400 g/mol). Holloway (35Holloway P.J. Cutler D.F. Alvin K.L. Price C.E. The Plant Cuticle. Academic Press, London1982: 45-85Google Scholar) performed fragmentation of the same derivative of synthetic 18-hydroxy-9,10-epoxystearic acid. As expected, Holloway (35Holloway P.J. Cutler D.F.

The IM is a phospholipid (PL) bilayer, whereas the OM is asymmetrical, with PL and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules located in the inner and outer leaflet, respectively. Escherichia coli has three major PL species, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin (CL), and their synthesis takes place at the cytoplasmic side of the IM (1Cronan J.E.

The mechanism of transport of these amphiphilic molecules from their site of synthesis across the aqueous periplasm to the OM is only poorly understood.Recently, a role for the MsbA protein in PL transport was suggested (2Doerrler W.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and that it was not accessible to periplasmic modifications under those conditions (3Doerrler W.T. Gibbons H.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45102-45109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), demonstrating that MsbA catalyzes the trans-bilayer movement of LPS. Interestingly, it was observed that in the temperature-sensitive msbA mutant, newly synthesized PL also accumulated in the IM at the restrictive temperature (2Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and that they were poorly accessible to membrane-impermeable reagents under those conditions (3Doerrler W.T. Gibbons H.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45102-45109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that MsbA is involved not only in LPS transport but also in PL transport. However, as indicated (3Doerrler W.T. Gibbons H.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45102-45109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the possibility that LPS accumulation on the inner surface of the IM interferes with PL transport by some other mechanism cannot be excluded. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the flip-flop of PL in bilayers is strongly induced by the introduction of either model trans-membrane α-helical peptides or IM proteins (7Kol M.A. van Dalen A. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24586-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was postulated that a subset of proteins, characterized by a small number of trans-membrane helices, facilitates lipid translocation via the protein-lipid interface, thereby eliminating the need for a dedicated PL flippase (8Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I.P.M. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to several other integral IM proteins, MsbA reconstituted in proteoliposomes did not stimulate PL flip-flop (7Kol M.A. van Dalen A. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24586-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, it remained a possibility that MsbA was not functionally reconstituted in these experiments.Since a role for MsbA in PL transport is not entirely clear, we decided to study this issue in vivo in Neisseria meningitidis. In contrast to E. coli, this bacterium is not dependent on LPS synthesis since an lpxA mutant, lacking the first enzyme required for LPS biosynthesis, was viable and still produced an OM (9Steeghs L. den Hartog R. den Boer A. Zomer B. Roholl P. van der Ley P. Nature. 1998; 392: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Recently, we already exploited this property of N. meningitidis to demonstrate that the OM protein designated Imp, which is essential in E. coli (10Braun M. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), has a role in LPS transport (11Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, we anticipated that it would be possible to inactivate the msbA gene in N. meningitidis if the corresponding protein had a role in LPS transport only and not in PL transport. In this report, we have described an msbA mutant in N. meningitidis.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—N. meningitides H44/76 is a serogroup B strain from our laboratory collection. The imp (11Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and lpxA mutant strains (9Steeghs L. den Hartog R. den Boer A. Zomer B. Roholl P. van der Ley P. Nature. 1998; 392: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) are derivatives of this strain. HB-1 is a capsule-deficient mutant of H44/76 (12Bos M.P. Tommassen J. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6194-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The N. meningitidis strains were grown in candle jars at 37 °C on GC agar (BD Biosciences) plates containing 2% Vitox (Oxoid) and antibiotics (kanamycin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 5 μg/ml) when appropriate. Liquid cultures were grown in tryptic soy broth in plastic flasks at 37 °C with aeration. E. coli strains DH5α (13Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8124) Google Scholar) and Top 10 F′ (Invitrogen) were used for routine cloning procedures. The temperature-sensitive msbA mutant strain WD2 (2Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of the Raetz laboratory. E. coli strains were grown on LB agar plates or in liquid LB medium (14Tommassen J. van Tol H. Lugtenberg B. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Kanamycin (50 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) was added when appropriate. Experiments with genetically modified organisms were performed under license number GGO 99-139.Construction of Plasmids and msbA Mutant Strains—We made use of the available genome sequence of N. meningitidis strain MC58 (15Tettelin H. Saunders N.J. Heidelberg J. Jeffries A.C. Nelson K.E. Eisen J.A. Ketchum K.A. Hood D.W. Peden J.F. Dodson R.J. Nelson W.C. Gwinn M.L. DeBoy R. Peterson J.D. Hickey E.K. Haft D.H. Salzberg S.L. White O. Fleischmann R.D. Dougherty B.A. Mason T. Ciecko A. Parksey D.S. Blair E. Cittone H. Clark E.B. Cotton M.D. Utterback T.R. Khouri H. Qin H. Vamathevan J. Gill J. Scarlato V. Masignani V.

For complementation experiments, we amplified the msbA gene from H44/76 genomic DNA by PCR with primers E and F (Fig. 1) with sequences 5′-TTCATATGATAGAAAAACTGACTTTCGG-3′ (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GACGTCCCATTTCGGACGGCATTTTGT-3′ (AatII restriction site is underlined), respectively, using the High Fidelity kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen), and after NdeI and AatII restriction, ligated into pEN11 (11Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pEN11-msbA. pEN11 is derived from pEN10 by introduction of a NotI cassette, containing an erythromycin-resistance gene, the lac repressor, and a tandem lac operator/promoter segment (erm lacIOP) (16Seifert H.S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The msbA mutant derivative of H44/76 (see below) was transformed with pEN11-msbA by co-incubation of bacteria with plasmid and 5 mm MgCl2 for 6 h on plate. Transformants were subsequently selected on plates containing chloramphenicol and repeatedly streaked on plates containing 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside before performing complementation experiments.To disrupt the msbA gene in N. meningitidis, parts of the genes upstream and downstream of msbA, designated NMB1918 and NMB1920, respectively, were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of H44/76 using Taq polymerase. Primers A and B (Fig. 1) with sequences 5′-CCCAAAGCGAAGTGGTCGAA-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTATCGGTAGGGCGGGAACTG-3′ (AccI restriction site is underlined), respectively, were used to amplify the upstream region, whereas primers C and D with sequences 5′-GTCGACGACCGCATCATCGTGATGGA-3′ (AccI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-TTCGTCGCTGCCGACCTGTT-3′, respectively, were used to amplify the downstream region. Both PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO, resulting in plasmids pCRII-NMB1918 and pCRII-NMB1920, respectively. An AccI-KpnI fragment of pCRII-NMB1918 was ligated into AccI-KpnI-digested pCRII-NMB1920. The resulting plasmid was cut with AccI to allow for the insertion of a kanamycin-resistance cassette derived from pMB25 (11Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The final construct, called pBT-msbA::kan, contained the kanamycin resistance cassette in the same orientation as originally the msbA gene and was used as the template for amplification of the disruption fragment by PCR with primer pair A/D (Fig. 1). Approximately 200 ng of this PCR product was added together with 5 mm MgCl2 to H44/76 or HB-1 bacteria that were subsequently grown on plate for 6 h. Hereafter, bacteria were transferred to plates containing kanamycin. The correct gene replacement in kanamycin-resistant transformants was confirmed by PCR using primer pair A/D. All enzymes were purchased from Fermentas, except where indicated otherwise.Subcellular Localization of PL and LPS in WD2 Cells—WD2 cells containing either pEN11-msbA or the empty vector pEN10 were pregrown at 30 °C and diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of ∼0.01. After further growth at 30 °C until the A600 reached ∼1, 8 m l of the culture were diluted into 32 ml of prewarmed medium, and incubation was continued at 44 °C for 30 min. The cells were subsequently labeled for 10 min with 40 μCi of [1-14C]sodium acetate and thereafter cooled rapidly on ice, collected, turned into spheroplasts, and finally sonicated as described (2Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded on top of a sucrose gradient (17Thom J.R. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and after centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 22.5 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter), 12 fractions of 1 ml were collected from top to bottom of the gradient. PL were directly isolated (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) from 200-μl samples of each fraction, whereas lipid A was isolated (19Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43111-43121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) after precipitation of LPS with trichloroacetic acid from 500-μl samples. The amounts of the radiolabeled PL and lipid A were determined by liquid scintillation counting in a 1209 Rackbeta LSC (LKB Wallac). Lactate dehydrogenase activity (20Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as an IM marker. Total amount of LPS molecules, visualized by silver staining after SDS-PAGE (21Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar), was used as a marker for the OM.Analysis of PL Content—Cells grown overnight on plate were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of tryptic soy broth to an A550 of 0.1. The cells were labeled for 7 h with 2 μCi of [1-14C]sodium acetate at 37 °C. Phospholipids were isolated (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) from 1.4 ml of culture. Equal amounts (∼1000 counts/minute) of radioactive phospholipids were loaded onto TLC plates (silica gel 60, 20 × 10 cm, Merck). The plates were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid at a ratio of 65:25:10, subjected to autoradiography, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). Spots were subsequently quantified with a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad).For quantitative analysis of the total PL content, cells were harvested from plate and washed with a buffer containing 0.238% free acid HEPES, 0.04% KCl, 0.85% NaCl, 0.01% MgCl2. 6H2O, 0.09% anhydrous glucose, and 0.5 mm CaCl2, adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4. Phospholipids were isolated (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), and their amount was quantified by determining the phosphorus content (22Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar).LPS Analysis—For LPS analysis, ∼3.105 cells (based upon the estimation that an A550 of 1 represents 1.109 cells/ml) were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subsequently incubated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 55 °C for 1 h. After boiling for 10 min, lysates were analyzed on Tricine-SDS-PAGE gels (23Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Bittner W.E. Apicella M.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) containing 16% acrylamide and stained with silver (21Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). Cell envelopes were isolated as described previously (24Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The LPS content of cell envelopes was determined by 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) measurement as described (25van Alphen L. Verkleij A. Leunissen-Bijvelt J. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Analysis—SDS-PAGE under denaturing or semi-native conditions and immunoblotting were performed as described (24Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). For denaturing conditions, samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol prior to electrophoresis, whereas for semi-native conditions, the sample buffer contained only 0.1% SDS and no β-mercaptoethanol, and the samples were not heated prior to electrophoresis. Protein concentrations from cell envelopes were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Electron Microscopy—Cells were harvested from plate and chemically fixed, embedded in gelatin, and cryosectioned as described (26Voorhout W.F. Leunissen-Bijvelt J.J.M. Leunissen J.L.M. Verkleij A.J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1986; 141: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were observed with a Technai 10 electron microscope at 100 kV.RESULTSThe genome of N. meningitidis strain MC58 (15Tettelin H. Saunders N.J. Heidelberg J. Jeffries A.C. Nelson K.E.

Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) using the amino acid sequence of E. coli MsbA as a probe (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). The amino acid sequence of the putative MsbA protein encoded by the meningococcal gene NMB1919 displayed 32% identity and 52% similarity to that of E. coli MsbA. The NMB1919 gene was then cloned, and we investigated whether this Neisserial gene could complement an E. coli msbA mutation. The growth of the E. coli K-12 temperature-sensitive msbA mutant strain WD2 is arrested at 44 °C (2Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). When pEN11-msbA, containing the msbA gene of N. meningitidis, was introduced into WD2, growth was fully restored at 44 °C to wild-type levels (data not shown). Moreover, whereas de novo synthesized phospholipids (Fig. 2A) and LPS (Fig. 2B) accumulated at 44 °C in the IM of strain WD2 carrying the empty vector, consistent with previous results (2Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the localization of these compounds to the OM was restored when the strain was complemented with the Neisserial msbA gene (Fig. 2A, B) and did not deviate from that observed in the wild-type strain grown at 44 °C (data not shown). Thus, the Neisserial MsbA protein could functionally substitute for E. coli MsbA.FIGURE 2Localization of de novo synthesized PL and LPS in temperature-sensitive msbA mutant WD2 complemented with Neisserial msbA. WD2 cells carrying pEN11-msbA (solid line) or the empty vector (dashed line) were grown for 30 min at 44 °C and subsequently labeled with [14C]acetate. After separation of the membranes on a sucrose gradient, 12 fractions of 1 ml were taken, and PL and lipid A were isolated from each fraction. The amount of radiolabeled PL (A) and lipid A (B) in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting and is represented as the percentage of the total counts. The procedure always resulted in a clear separation of IM and OM as illustrated by the fractionation of the IM marker lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, indicated as the percentage of total activity in C) and of the OM marker LPS, detected by silver staining after SDS-PAGE (D), in a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gene replacement was used to construct msbA mutant derivatives of N. meningitidis strain H44/76 and of its capsule-deficient derivative HB-1 (Fig. 1). Kanamycin-resistant transformants were analyzed by PCR to verify the absence of an intact copy of the msbA gene and the presence of the msbA::kan allele (data not shown). Since correct transformants were obtained at high frequency, it appears that in N. meningitidis, in contrast to E. coli (28Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), MsbA is not essential for viability. The results described below were essentially the same for the msbA mutants created in both parent strains, unless stated otherwise. We have not directly analyzed the expression of the genes adjacent to msbA in the msbA::kan mutants, but the complementation studies performed revealed full complementation with no signs of side effects.The generation time of the msbA mutants was strongly increased during exponential growth, i.e. from ∼60 min for the parental strains to ∼120 min for the mutants, and the cultures did not reach the same final OD (A550 of 3.2 as opposed to 5.9 for the parental strains). After 16 h of growth at 37 °C on plates, the colonies of the msbA mutants were smaller than those of the parental strains, and they also had an opaque appearance, in contrast to those formed by the wild-type strains (data not shown). Similar phenotypes have been described also for N. meningitidis mutants defective in other LPS biogenesis genes, i.e. the lpxA and imp mutants (11Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Growth on plates at 30 and 42 °C did not reveal a temperature-sensitive phenotype of the msbA, lpxA, and imp mutants (data not shown).To investigate whether MsbA, as in E. coli, plays a role in LPS transport in N. meningitidis, proteinase K-treated cell lysates from both the wild type and the msbA mutants were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Although LPS could clearly be detected on the gels in the cell lysate from the wild-type strain (Fig. 3A, lane 1), it was not visible in that of the msbA mutant strain (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Since a putative transcriptional terminator is present immediately downstream of the msbA gene (Fig. 1), the decreased LPS content in the msbA mutant was expected to be a direct consequence of the inactivation of the msbA gene and not of any polar effect of the mutation on downstream-located genes. This supposition was confirmed in a complementation experiment. Almost normal levels of LPS were observed when the msbA mutant was complemented with pEN11-msbA, a plasmid carrying the wild-type msbA gene (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Apparently, the msbA mutation has a strong impact on LPS synthesis, possibly due to some feedback inhibition mechanism caused by LPS stalled in the transport pathway, as observed previously in the imp mutant (11Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To quantify the LPS content, we determined the amount of KDO, a structural component typical for LPS. Cell envelopes of the msbA mutant cells contained an LPS-to-protein ratio similar to that in the imp mutant and of only 7% when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 3B). When plasmid pEN11-msbA was introduced into the msbA mutant, the LPS-to-protein ratio was restored to nearly wild-type levels (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results confirmed a role of MsbA in LPS biogenesis in N. meningitidis.FIGURE 3LPS content in an msbA mutant. A, cells from strain H44/76 (parent), the complemented msbA mutant, and the msbA mutant were collected after growth on plate, and the LPS content was analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. B, KDO and protein concentrations were measured in cell envelopes isolated from the various H44/76 derivatives indicated. The ratio of the KDO concentration divided by the protein concentration in the wild-type strain (27 nmol KDO/mg of protein) was corrected for the background value measured in the lpxA mutant (1.9 nmol KDO/mg of protein) and subsequently set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the msbA mutants still possess an OM, we prepared ultrathin sections of the cells and examined them by electron microscopy (Fig. 4A). Indeed, a double membrane was clearly visible, demonstrating that both IM and OM were still present. Additionally, analysis of the cell envelope protein profiles indicated that the expression of the major OM proteins PorA and PorB is not compromised in the msbA mutant (data not shown). Analysis of cell envelopes under non-denaturing conditions revealed that the PorA protein was mostly present in its trimeric form, although, as in the imp and lpxA mutants, a small amount of monomeric PorA was detected in the msbA mutant (Fig. 4B). The results presented here are comparable with those obtained earlier with the lpxA (9Steeghs L. den Hartog R. den Boer A. Zomer B. Roholl P. van der Ley P. Nature. 1998; 392: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and imp (11Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) mutants. In conclusion, it appeared that the msbA mutant is still able to assemble an OM, demonstrating that PL transport is not compromised in the msbA mutant.FIGURE 4Morphology and cell envelope protein profile of an msbA mutant.

To investigate whether all major PL species are still produced in the msbA mutant, cells from strain HB-1 and its msbA mutant derivative were labeled with [14C]sodium acetate, and PL were extracted and analyzed by TLC (Fig. 5A). All major PL species were detected in the msbA mutant, although the relative amounts of PG and PA/CL (PA and CL are not separated on the TLC system used) appeared to be different (Fig. 5A). Quantification of the radioactive spots revealed that the relative amount of PG was decreased from 17% in the wild-type strain to 8.4–8.6% in the msbA mutant, whereas the relative amount of PA/CL was increased from 7% in the wild-type strain to 12.2–14.6% in the m"
https://openalex.org/W2126561370,"The Arabidopsis BRS1 gene encodes a serine carboxypeptidase II-like protein. Its biological role in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway was first established by its capability to specifically suppress a weak brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (bri1) allele, bri1-5, when overexpressed. To gain additional insights into the molecular mechanisms of BRS1 function, the subcellular localization and the biochemical characteristics of BRS1 were determined by using transgenic plants harboring a 35S-BRS1-GFP construct and fusion proteins purified from 35S-BRS1-FLAG transgenic plants. The BRS1-GFP protein was mainly secreted and accumulated in the extracellular space. Immunological data suggest that BRS1 is proteolytically processed by an unknown endoproteinase in planta. Affinity-purified BRS1-FLAG from transgenic plants show strong hydrolytic activity with a broad P1 substrate preference including basic and hydrophobic groups on either side of the scissile bond. The hydrolytic activity of BRS1 can be strongly inhibited by a serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The pH and temperature optima for the hydrolytic activity of BRS1 are pH 5.5 and 50 °C, respectively. These data demonstrate that BRS1 is a secreted and active serine carboxypeptidase, consistent with the hypothesis suggested by our previous genetic evidence that BRS1 may process a protein involved in an early event in the BRI1 signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis BRS1 gene encodes a serine carboxypeptidase II-like protein. Its biological role in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway was first established by its capability to specifically suppress a weak brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (bri1) allele, bri1-5, when overexpressed. To gain additional insights into the molecular mechanisms of BRS1 function, the subcellular localization and the biochemical characteristics of BRS1 were determined by using transgenic plants harboring a 35S-BRS1-GFP construct and fusion proteins purified from 35S-BRS1-FLAG transgenic plants. The BRS1-GFP protein was mainly secreted and accumulated in the extracellular space. Immunological data suggest that BRS1 is proteolytically processed by an unknown endoproteinase in planta. Affinity-purified BRS1-FLAG from transgenic plants show strong hydrolytic activity with a broad P1 substrate preference including basic and hydrophobic groups on either side of the scissile bond. The hydrolytic activity of BRS1 can be strongly inhibited by a serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The pH and temperature optima for the hydrolytic activity of BRS1 are pH 5.5 and 50 °C, respectively. These data demonstrate that BRS1 is a secreted and active serine carboxypeptidase, consistent with the hypothesis suggested by our previous genetic evidence that BRS1 may process a protein involved in an early event in the BRI1 signaling pathway.

The major structural characteristic of these proteins is that they contain a conserved amino acid triad, Ser-His-Asp, catalytically essential for enzyme activity (1Ramington S.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In mammals, Ser-CPs are largely involved in producing active peptide hormones from their inactive precursors. This process usually requires two consecutive steps. First, a larger precursor is cleaved at selective sites by an endopeptidase such as prohormone convertase 1, prohormone convertase 2, or furin. The Ser-CPs are then responsible for trimming off the exposed carboxyl-terminal amino acids and transforming the inactive intermediates into active hormones (2Fan X. Olson S.J. Blevins L.S. Allen G.S. Johnson M.D. J Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 3Wei S. Feng Y. Kalinina E. Fricker L.D.

In plants, extensive studies of Ser-CPs have been mainly focused on their functions in turnover and mobilization of storage proteins using as nitrogen and carbon resources during seed germination and senescence (4Schaller A. Planta. 2004; 220: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested that plant Ser-CPs may also be involved in various signaling events important for plant growth and development such as programmed cell death, brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, and seed development (5Dominguez F. Cejudo F.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Li J. Lease K.A. Tax F.E. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5916-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Cercos M. Urbez C. Carbonell J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By using a gain-of-function genetic screen we previously identified a putative Ser-CP gene, BRS1, as a bri1 (brassinosteroid insensitive 1) suppressor. Overexpression of BRS1 can suppress bri1 extracellular domain mutations but fails to suppress a kinase-dead bri1 mutant. These results strongly indicate that the bri1 suppression function of BRS1 is dependent on an at least partially functional BRI1 receptor kinase. Analyses of BRS1 protein structure and genetic data suggest that BRS1 is involved in an early step in BR signal transduction, possibly by processing a protein that may directly or indirectly participate in BR perception. As a first step toward testing this hypothesis, we tested whether BRS1 encodes an active and secreted Ser-CP. Although sequence analysis suggests BRS1 encodes a type II (D) Ser-CP, there are many enzymes related to the Ser-CPs that do not have proteolytic activity (8Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 9Fraser C.M. Rider L.M. Chapple C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1136-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In plants, these include several acyltransferases (10Li A.X. Steffens J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6902-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Lehfeldt C. Shirley A.M. Meyer K. Ruegger M.O. Cusumano J.C. Viitanen P.V. Strack D. Chapple C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1295-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 12Steffens J.C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and a hydroxynitrile lyase (13Wajant H. Mundry K.W. Pfizenmaier K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our previous analysis with active-site mutants of BRS1 (S181F and H438A) suggested that an active form of BRS1 is essential for its capability to suppress bri1-5, but we cannot exclude the possibility that BRS1 could be an acyltransferase rather than a Ser-CP because the proteolytic and transacylase activity of Ser-CP-like enzymes rely on the same triad of amino acids (4Schaller A. Planta. 2004; 220: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Here we report our demonstration that BRS1 is indeed an active and secreted Ser-CP. In addition, we found that BRS1 is proteolytically processed into two chains by an unknown endoproteinase in planta. Immunopurified BRS1-FLAG protein has hydrolytic activity with a broad substrate preference. Furthermore, the hydrolytic enzyme activity can be strongly inhibited by an irreversible serine protease inhibitor, PMSF. Mutation of one of the conserved catalytic triad (H438A) of BRS1 led to inefficient protease processing and loss of the enzyme activity. These data are consistent with our previous hypothesis that BRS1 may be involved in an early proteolytic step important for BR perception and provide insight toward our understanding of plant growth and development controlled by BRs. Plant Materials and Binary Plant Transformation Vectors—Full-length BRS1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and fused in-frame at its carboxyl terminus with GFP or FLAG in a pBluescript SK+-GFP and a SK+-FLAG vector. The fused BRS1-GFP and BRS1-FLAG were confirmed as in-frame and mutation-free by sequencing analyses. The inactive form of BRS1(H438A) was generated in a SK+-BRS1-FLAG construct. The fragments were removed from SK+ and cloned into pBIB-KAN and pBIB-HYG, respectively, at KpnI and SacI sites (14Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1195-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The fused fragments were driven by a dual enhanced CaMV35S promoter. The three transformation constructs used in these studies were designated as pKAN-35S-BRS1-GFP, pHYG-35S-BRS1-FLAG, and pHYG-35S-BRS1(H438A)-FLAG. For BRS1 expression pattern analysis, a 2-kb fragment upstream of the start codon of BRS1 was PCR-amplified and cloned into a binary vector pBIG-HYG (14Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1195-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was named pHYG-BRSp-GUS. Transgenic plants harboring 35S-BRS1-GFP, 35S-BRS1-FLAG, and 35S-BRS1(H438A)-FLAG were generated in a bri1-5 background. Transgenic plants harboring BRS1p-GUS were generated in wild type Arabidopsis (ecotype WS2) plants. In each case, the homozygous transgenic plants were selected from the T3 generation and used for the analyses described in this paper except as otherwise specified. All plants were grown in a 16-h light and 8-h dark growth chamber at 20 °C, whereas seedlings were grown under continuous light at 20 °C. RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plant mini kit (catalog number 74904) from Qiagen (Germantown, MD). For reverse transcription, SuperScript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen was used (catalog number 18064-014). Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to the first strand of the cDNA in a 20-μl volume. A 1-μl volume of the RT product was used as a PCR template. Thirty cycles were used for amplifying BRS1 and BRI1 cDNA, and 20 cycles were used for amplifying the quantity control, EF1-α. Twenty-one PCR cycles were used to compare the BRS1 expression level in inflorescence stems. GUS Staining of pHYG-BRS1p-GUS Transgenic Plants—T2 transgenic plants harboring BRS1p-GUS were used for histochemical GUS staining. Plant tissues were vacuum-infiltrated in X-Gluc solution (15Robatzek S. Somssich I.E. Plant J. 2001; 28: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h followed by destaining with 70% ethanol. Confocal Microscopy—Root tips from 3-5-day-old T3 transgenic bri1-5 plants harboring 35S-BRS1-GFP were used for confocal microscopy analysis. Seeds were planted vertically on semi-solid one-half Murashige and Skoog medium (0.6% agar). Plasmolysis was induced by the addition of 0.8 m mannitol solution. Homozygous transgenic bri1-5 plants harboring 35S-BAK1-GFP were used as a positive control. Non-transformed bri1-5 plants were used as a negative control. Confocal images were obtained by using an Olympus FluoView 500 laser-scanning confocal microscope with argon laser excitation at 488 nm and 505-550 emission filter set and oil-immersion 60× objective lens. The same settings were used for all samples. Scan speed was slow, the focus mode was ×2, the dye used was enhanced GFP, and the laser output was 25 megawatts. For the enhanced GFP the photomultiplier tube voltage was 783 V, the gain was 2.6%, and offset was 5%. Western Blotting—Protein samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted to a Biotrans nylon membrane (catalog number 810300; ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) to immunodetect the BRS1 fusion protein. For BRS1-GFP, crude plant proteins were extracted from leaves of bri1-5 plants harboring 35S-BRS1-GFP with 2× SDS sample buffer. The primary antibody used was an anti-GFP antibody (catalog number 1814460, Roche Diagnostics). For BRS1-FLAG, the primary antibody is the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (catalog number F3165; Sigma). The secondary antibody is goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (catalog number NEF822; PerkinElmer). Signals were detected by using the Western Lighting™ chemiluminescence regent plus kit (catalog number NEL105; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Preparation of Different Protein Fractions and Protein Immunoprecipitation—Two-week-old seedlings of homozygous bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG plants were ground to a fine powder in liquid N2. The powder was further ground in cold grinding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm E-64). The resulting solution was spun at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as the total crude protein sample. The supernatant was further spun at 100,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was saved as the soluble protein sample. The pellet was resuspended and further homogenized in membrane solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm E-64) to release membrane proteins. The solution was spun at 100,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C to separate solubilized membrane proteins (supernatant) from the insoluble membrane fraction (pellet). Protein samples from different protein fractions were mixed with 1× PBS prewashed anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel (catalog number A2220; Sigma). After overnight shaking at 4 °C, the gel was washed 5 times with cold 1× PBST (PBS and 0.1% Tween 20). Immunoprecipitated protein was eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer and run on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The presence of BRS1-FLAG in different protein fractions was demonstrated by Western blotting. Protein Affinity Purification—Two-week-old seedlings of bri1-5, bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG or bri1-5 35S-BRS(H438A)-FLAG were harvested and ground to fine powder in liquid N2, respectively. The suspension formed after the addition of membrane solubilization buffer as mentioned above was further homogenized to release the soluble and membrane proteins. After spinning at 100,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, soluble and membrane proteins were collected for affinity purification. The anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel was transferred to a column (catalog number 731-1550; Bio-Rad), and the gel was washed with at least 20× volumes of 1× PBS. Then the protein samples were loaded into the column, and the flow-through was collected. Loading of the flow-through was repeated five times. The gel was washed with at least 20× volumes of 1× PBS, and finally the BRS1-FLAG was eluted with 4× 1.5-column volumes of FLAG peptide (100 ng/μl, prepared in 1× PBS; catalog number F3290, Sigma) by competition. The protein concentration was measured with a Bradford assay kit (catalog number 500-0006, Bio-Rad). Eluted protein was used for SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) analysis and enzyme activity assay. Protein Deglycosylation and Dephosphorylation—Soluble proteins isolated from bri1-5 and bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG seedlings (5 mg) were affinity-purified with anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel and used for endoglycosidase H (catalog number 1088726; Roche Diagnostics Corporation) and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; catalog number M1821, Promega, Madison, WI) treatment experiments. The gel was resuspended with 280 μl of water, and 15-μl aliquots of the gel were used for different treatments. Endoglycosidase treatment involved 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH5.8) and 250 milliunits of endoglycosidase H incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. CIAP treatment involved 1× CIAP buffer and 10 μl of CIAP incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. In the untreated control, an equal volume of water was added instead of endoglycosidase H or CIAP. After the treatment, proteins were eluted in 2 × SDS sample buffer. Mass Spectrophotometric Assay—Affinity-purified protein with anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel was run on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was Coomassie Blue-stained and destained in 10% ethanol and 10% acetic acid in H2O. The chosen bands were excised. In-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were conducted at the proteomics and mass spectrometry facility at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, MO. Enzyme Activity Assay—Hydrolytic activities of BRS1-FLAG toward different dipeptides were determined according to a method adapted from Plummer and Kimmel (16Plummer T.H. Kimmel M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 108: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Latchinian-Sadek and Thomas (17Latchinian-Sadek L. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 534-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furylacryloyl (FA)-dipeptides were purchased from Bachem Biosciences Inc., King of Prussia, PA. For the time course of BRS1 hydrolytic activity, ∼400 ng of purified BRS1-FLAG protein was incubated in 1 ml of 25 mm MES (pH 5.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm FA-Arg-Leu at 37 °C for 1 h. The reduction of absorption at 342 nm was monitored every 10 min using a spectrophotometer (GENESYS 5, Spectronic Instruments, Inc. Rochester, NY). The PMSF treatment was performed as described by Latchinian-Sadek and Thomas (17Latchinian-Sadek L. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 534-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate, pH, and Temperature Profiles—Affinity-purified BRS1-FLAG was used for the substrate, pH, and temperature profile assays. All of the reactions except the optimal temperature experiment were done at 37 °C. The same amount of purified BRS1-FLAG and reaction buffer as described above were used for optimal substrate and temperature assays. The concentration of the substrate was 1 mm in all the reactions. The reduction of absorption at 342 nm was recorded after 1 h of incubation. One mm FA-Phe-Ala was used for the optimal pH and temperature experiments. The optimal pH for the hydrolytic activity was tested over the pH range of 4.0-7.0. The ion strength for all buffers was 25 mm. Sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0-5.0), MES buffer (pH 5.5), and Bis-Tris buffer (pH 6.0-7.0), respectively, were used for the assays. BRS1 Exhibits a Broad Expression Pattern—brs1-1D (bri1 suppressor 1-Dominant 1) is a dominant bri1-5 suppressor identified by our previous activation-tagging genetic screen (6Li J. Lease K.A. Tax F.E. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5916-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BRS1 can specifically suppress bri1 extracellular domain mutants instead of an intracellular kinase-dead mutant, suggesting that BRS1 may play a role in the early events of the BR signaling pathway. Because BRI1, the gene encoding the BR receptor, is expressed mainly in young tissues but less abundantly in mature tissues (18Friedrichsen D.M. Joazeiro C.A.P. Li J.M. Hunter T. Chory J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 19Zhou A. Wang H. Walker J.C. Li J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we predict that BRS1 may have a similar or overlapping expression pattern. RT-PCR analyses indicated that BRS1 is expressed in almost all of the tissues tested (Fig. 1A). Unlike BRI1, however, BRS1 can only be detected at lower levels in roots and stems. Consistently, transgenic plants harboring BRS1p-GUS show that BRS1 is mainly expressed in young tissues such as cotyledons, young leaves, unopened flowers, and meristems (Fig. 1, B-E). These results clearly indicate that BRS1 and BRI1 have overlapping expression domains. Interestingly, we observed that most of the bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG lines show ∼3-fold the height of the bri1-5 plants, whereas bri1-5 brs1-1D plants are only about two times the height of bri1-5. To test whether the BRS1 expression level is the cause of the plant height difference, total RNA was extracted from primary inflorescence stems of bri1-5, bri1-5 brs1-1D, and one representative line of bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG, and RT-PCR analysis was conducted. As expected, the more the BRS1 is expressed, the taller the transgenic plants grow (Fig. 1F). These results are consistent with the idea that the reduced BR perception caused by the point mutation in bri1-5 can be partially restored by the overexpression of BRS1. BRS1-GFP Is Localized to the Exterior of the Cell—It was suggested from our previous genetic data that BRS1 may be involved in an early step in BR signaling. Because the BR perception occurs extracellularly, we predict that BRS1 should be a secreted protein. Sequence analysis indicated that BRS1 contains a typical N-terminal signal peptide but failed to identify any endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi retention signals, implying that BRS1 may be secreted from cells. To confirm this hypothesis, we generated transgenic bri1-5 plants harboring a BRS1-GFP fusion protein. These transgenic plants exhibit the bri1-5 suppression phenotype similar to that of the original bri1-5 brs1-1D suppressor and the bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG transgenic plants, suggesting that the BRS1-GFP fusion protein is functionally equivalent to BRS1 in planta (Figs. 2A and 4A). Therefore, the localization revealed by BRS1-GFP should represent that of native BRS1. Using a GFP antibody to analyze the total protein extracts from the transgenic plants, several specific bands were detected. Among them, an 80-kDa band may represent the intact BRS1-GFP protein, and a 44-kDa band may represent the C-terminal BRS1 fragment attached to GFP after a predicted processing step (6Li J. Lease K.A. Tax F.E. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5916-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Other smaller bands seen in the Western assay may result from partial digestion of the BRS1-GFP. Further confirmation of BRS1-GFP processing will be discussed in the latter part of this section (“Results”).FIGURE 4BRS1 protein is proteolytically processed in vivo. A, phenotypes of 3-week-old plants. Wild type BRS1-FLAG is functional in bri1-5, whereas the mutation H438A in BRS1 abolishes its function. Bar, 1 cm. B, BRS1-FLAG protein is cleaved to two chains. Protein was immunopurified from bri1-5, bri1-5 35S-BRS1(H438A)-FLAG, and bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG plants. Left section shows Coomassie Blue-stained protein samples. About 300 ng of eluted protein was loaded for each lane. M, molecular mass marker; F1 and F2, two cleaved bands.

Arrow shows chain B; triangle shows the A and B complex. F, BRS1 is not self-processed. Immunopurified BRS1-FLAG was incubated at 37 °C in 25 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5, with 0.1% Triton X-100. For the PMSF treatment, 1 mm PMSF was added to the protein and incubated on ice for 2 h before the incubation at 37 °C. About 50 ng of protein was loaded on each lane. The gel was hybridized with anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Root tips from 3-5-day-old bri1-5 35S-BRS1-GFP seedlings (T3) were prepared for confocal microscopy assay. bri1-5 and bri1-5 35S-BAK1-GFP plants from similar developmental stages were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase1), another crucial component in BR signal transduction pathway, was demonstrated to be a plasma membrane protein (20Li J. Wen J. Lease K.A. Doke J.T. Tax F.E. Walker J.C. Cell. 2002; 110: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 21Nam K.H. Li J. Cell. 2002; 110: 203-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Without any treatment, the localization of the green fluorescence signals for both BRS1-GFP and BAK1-GFP are indistinguishable, as both are apparently localized on the cell surface; after plasmolysis was induced with 0.8 m mannitol, the green fluorescence signal of BAK1-GFP moved with the plasma membrane, indicating its plasma membrane localization. The majority of the green fluorescence signal of BRS1-GFP, however, stayed in the cell wall, and only part of the green fluorescence signal moved with the plasma membrane. These observations suggest that BRS1 protein is mainly secreted and that some of the BRS1-GFP protein may associate with yet unknown membrane proteins (Fig. 2B). BRS1 Is a Glycoprotein—To further confirm that BRS1 is mainly a secreted protein and may be partially associated with membrane proteins as seen in the confocal microscopy results, the distribution of the BRS1-FLAG protein in different protein fractions was investigated. Different protein fractions were isolated from bri1-5 and homozygous bri1-5 35S-BRS1-FLAG seedlings. BRS1-FLAG is biologically functional in planta, because bri1-5 plants harboring 35S-BRS1-FLAG show a similar suppression phenotype as that of bri1-5 brs1-1D (Fig. 4A). Equal amounts of protein samples from different protein fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel overnight at 4 °C and eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer. The eluted protein samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western analysis. Consistent with the subcellular localization of BRS1-GFP, Western results showed that BRS1-FLAG can be detected in both total crude and soluble protein fractions and that a small amount of BRS1-FLAG can be detected in the membrane protein fraction as well (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, there are two specific BRS1-FLAG bands revealed on the 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The peptide mass fingerprinting analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry demonstrated that both bands are BRS1-FLAG, with the difference in migration possibly due to different post-translational modifications. To investigate whether the upper band resulted from glycosylation or phosphorylation, the soluble protein was affinity-purified and used for endoglycosidase H and CIAP treatments. Endoglycosidase H removes asparagine-linked glycosyl chains and CIAP removes phosphate. Compared with untreated BRS1-FLAG samples, only the endoglycosidase H treatment can cause the band shift of BRS1-FLAG, suggesting that BRS1 is an N-glycosylated protein but not a phosphorylated protein (Fig. 3B). After treatment, however, the double bands could still be detected. The double bands were likely the result of insufficient signal peptide removal by the endoplasmic reticulum-localized peptidase. BRS1-FLAG Is Proteolytically Processed in Vivo—Many plant serine carboxypeptidases need to be cleaved into A and B chains for activity. For example barley carboxypeptidase I is cleaved into two polypeptide chains for a heterodimer linked by disulfides, important for catalytic activity. The linker peptide containing 55 residues is endoproteolytically excised (22Doan N.P. Fincher G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11106-11110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is one predicted cleavage linker in the BRS1 protein sequence (6Li J. Lease K.A. Tax F.E. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5916-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A Western assay suggested that BRS1 may be processed in vivo (Fig. 2A). To further confirm the in vivo processing of BRS1, large scale protein preparation and affinity purification were performed. Based on the immunological results of different protein fractions, total protein including soluble and membrane fractions was used for affinity purification. Homozygous bri1-5 35S-BRS1(H438A)FLAG transgenic plants were used as a control. To ensure the quality of the affinity purification procedure, nontransgenic bri1-5 plants were included as a negative control. In BRS1(H438A)-FLAG, one of the catalytic triad, His, was mutated to Ala. Overexpression of BRS1(H438A)-FLAG in bri1-5 failed to suppress bri1-5 defective phenotypes, which implies that BRS1(H438A)-FLAG is not biologically functional in planta (Fig. 4A). Both BRS1-FLAG and BRS1(H438A)-FLAG can be effectively purified from the transgenic plants. Typically, 9.37 μg of purified BRS1-FLAG can be recovered from 33.71 g of 2-week-old seedlings. If BRS1-FLAG is cleaved as predicted, we expect to see two bands at 34 kDa (A chain) and 19 kDa (B chain), respectively.

This checkpoint pathway plays a critical role in the resistance of cells to genotoxic stress. Here, we show that human Claspin is cleaved by caspase-7 during the initiation of apoptosis. In cells, induction of DNA damage by etoposide at first produced rapid phosphorylation of Chk1 at a site targeted by ATR. Subsequently, etoposide caused activation of caspase-7, cleavage of Claspin, and dephosphorylation of Chk1. In apoptotic cell extracts, Claspin was cleaved by caspase-7 at a single aspartate residue into a large N-terminal fragment and a smaller C-terminal fragment that contain different functional domains. The large N-terminal fragment was heavily phosphorylated in a human cell-free system in response to double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, and this fragment retained Chk1 binding activity. In contrast, the smaller C-terminal fragment did not bind Chk1, but did associate with DNA and inhibited the DNA-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 associated with its activation. These results indicate that cleavage of Claspin by caspase-7 inactivates the Chk1 signaling pathway. This mechanism may regulate the balance between cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis during the response to genotoxic stress.

This mechanism may regulate the balance between cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis during the response to genotoxic stress. Eukaryotic cells maintain genomic integrity by monitoring DNA for damage or incomplete replication. In the event of aberrant structures being detected, checkpoint mechanisms are activated that delay cell cycle progression and that allow the damage to be repaired or replication to be completed (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). DNA damage can also initiate pathways leading to apoptosis and the removal of a damaged cell from a tissue (2Norbury C.J. Zhivotovsky B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2797-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The balance between cell cycle arrest and damage repair on one hand and the initiation of apoptosis on the other determines the survival of individual cells and the maintenance of genomic stability. Defects in the balance between these responses may lead to hypersensitivity to DNA damage or, conversely, to resistance to apoptosis and maintenance of genomic defects, which characterize cancer cells. Furthermore, the response of cells to anticancer treatments that damage DNA may determine therapeutic outcomes (3Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 4Sherr C.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The Chk1 protein kinase is a central component of a conserved checkpoint pathway activated by DNA damage or replication stress (5Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Once activated, Chk1 inhibits Cdc25 phosphatases, which control inhibitory phosphorylation sites on cyclin-dependent protein kinases, critical regulators of cell cycle transitions (3Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 6Russell P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 399-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, activation of Chk1 in response to DNA damage or replication arrest induced by UV light or hydroxyurea involves the ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) kinase. ATR directly phosphorylates Chk1 at serines 317 and 345 in vitro, and phosphorylation of these sites in human cells in response to UV light and hydroxyurea is ATR-dependent (7Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 8Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Chk1 also undergoes autophosphorylation associated with its full activation (9Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Defects in the ATR/Chk1 pathway have been implicated in the loss of genomic stability and in the development of cancer (3Kastan M.B. Bartek J.

Phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 by ATR require Claspin, a protein first identified by co-purification with Chk1 from Xenopus egg extracts (18Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and subsequently shown to be involved in Chk1 activation in human cells (19Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mrc1, an apparent homolog in yeast, is instead involved in activation of the Chk2 kinase homologs, Rad53 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Cds1 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), in response to DNA replication stress (21Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, Claspin may act as a scaffolding protein that brings together ATR and Chk1 (18Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Kumagai A. Kim S.M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Claspin interacts with chromatin during S phase, indicating that it may also act as a sensor of DNA replication (24Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Dart D.A. Adams K.E. Akerman I. Lakin N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16433-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although Claspin has a DNA-binding motif in its N-terminal half (26Sar F. Lindsey-Boltz L.A.

Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53023-53027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it is not clear if this direct interaction with DNA occurs in cells. The association of Claspin with chromatin during S phase involves the pre-replication complex and Cdc45 (24Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Claspin has also been reported to associate with ATR and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex (19Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and with BRCA1 (20Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in human cells. The interaction of Claspin with Chk1 requires two phosphorylation sites in a tandem motif that lies within the Chk1-binding domain (28Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Clarke C.A.L. Clarke P.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which interacts with the kinase domain of Chk1 (30Jeong S.Y. Kumagai A. Lee J. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46782-46788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these two sites is ATR-dependent, but may not be directly catalyzed by ATR (20Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Clarke C.A.L. Clarke P.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The interaction of Claspin with chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts is inhibited by phosphorylation by the Xenopus Polo-like kinase Plx1, which inactivates the checkpoint as part of an adaptive response (31Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In cultured human cells, depletion of Claspin by small interfering RNA increases sensitivity to genotoxic stress and promotes cell death (19Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Claspin may therefore be pivotal in determining the balance between cell cycle control and induction of cell death. Here, we report that human Claspin is cleaved into two functional domains during the initiation of apoptosis by caspase-7 both in cell-free systems and in intact cells. Using a human cell-free system in which the checkpoint pathway is activated by double-stranded oligonucleotides, we show that the larger N-terminal fragment retains Chk1 binding activity, whereas the smaller C-terminal fragment associates with DNA. This smaller fragment has a dominant inhibitory effect on Chk1 phosphorylation associated with its activation. In human cells, cleavage of Claspin by caspase-7 following genotoxic stress and the subsequent loss of Chk1 phosphorylation may switch the cellular response from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis. Claspin Proteins—Human full-length Claspin and Claspin-(679–1332) were produced as described previously (29Clarke C.A.L. Clarke P.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other Claspin fragments were generated in pcDNA3.2-DEST (Invitrogen) by site-directed mutagenesis to create stop codons or restriction digestion at convenient restriction sites and subcloning into a pET vector (Novagen). Claspin mutants D841A, D1031A, D1072A, D1085A, and D1158A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. His6-tagged 35S-labeled Claspin proteins were expressed from pET vectors in reticulocyte lysate using the TnT Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The His6-tagged C-terminal fragment (amino acids 1073–1332) was expressed in Escherichia coli; purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen Inc.); desalted on a PD10 column; and stored at -70 °C in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Antibodies—Antibodies against human Chk1 used for immunoprecipitation were raised in sheep inoculated with glutathione S-transferase-Chk1 (32Hutchins J.R. Hughes M. Clarke P.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and purified against the protein coupled to Reacti-Gel beads (Pierce). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal region of human Claspin was raised against a peptide (CKESSKSQKI-PEKDSD) corresponding to amino acids 1297–1311 of Claspin with the addition of Cys for coupling the peptide. The commercial antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-Claspin (Ab73, Bethyl Laboratories); goat anti-ATR (FRP1; N-19), mouse monoclonal anti-Chk1 (for Western blotting; G4), rabbit anti-caspase-3 (for Western blotting; H-277), goat anti-caspase-3 p11 (for immunodepletions; K-19), goat anticaspase-7 p20 (N-17), and rabbit anti-caspase-9 (for depletions; H-83) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); rabbit anti-phospho-Ser345/Ser317/Ser296 Chk1 (Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP 3The abbreviations used are: PARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseZ-VAD-fmkbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketoneCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. ; AHP427, Serotec); and mouse monoclonal anticaspase-8 and rabbit anti-caspase-9 (for Western blotting) (Pharmingen). The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies used were anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences), anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Bio-Rad), and anti-goat immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. Cell Treatments—Apoptosis was induced in HeLa cells by treatment with 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3–6 h and in Jurkat cells with 50 μm etoposide for 2–6 h. Some cells were pretreated for 2 h with the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Calbiochem) or benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk; BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.) at 10 μm. Cells were collected by trypsinization and centrifugation and washed and lysed in SDS loading buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cell Extracts—Human nuclear and cytosolic S100 extracts, prepared from exponentially growing HeLa cells by the method of Dignam et al. (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar), were purchased from CilBiotech S. A. (Mons, Belgium). S100 extracts were supplied in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Nuclear extracts were supplied in HeLa nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Extracts, which were supplied frozen, were thawed on ice, aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were ∼10 mg/ml for S100 extract and 20 mg/ml for nuclear extract as determined using the DC protein assay kit. Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described previously (34Cosulich S.C. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 997-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Caspase Activation in Cell Extracts—Caspases were activated in HeLa S100, mixed S100/nuclear, and Xenopus egg extracts supplemented with 1 mm ATP, 10 ng/μl creatine kinase, and 5 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma) by incubation at 30 °C with 5 μm cytochrome c. Caspase-3/7 activation was monitored by cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide Ac-DEVD-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (35Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). When used, Ac-DEVD-CHO or Z-VAD-fmk (10 μm) was preincubated in extracts for 1 h prior to the addition of cytochrome c. 35S-Labeled Claspin proteins were added in 0.02 μl of in vitro translation product/μl of extract. Phosphorylation of Claspin and Chk1 in Cell Extracts—A mixture of equal volumes of HeLa nuclear and cytosolic S100 extracts was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 50 ng/μl (dA)70·(dT)70 (synthesized by MWG Biotech and annealed as described previously (36Guo Z. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)), 10 μm okadaic acid (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.), 1 mm ATP, 10 ng/μl creatine kinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.02 μl of in vitro translation product/μl of extract. For each sample, 75 μg of protein was run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting or autoradiography. 3′-Biotinylated (dA)70 and 5′-biotinylated (dT)70 (MWG Biotech) were annealed with untagged (dT)70 and (dA)70, respectively, as described (36Guo Z. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to generate 3′-biotinylated (dA)70·(dT)70 and 5′-biotinylated (dA)70·(dT)70. Immunoprecipitation of Chk1—Chk1 was phosphorylated in 600 μg of extract as described above with the addition of 2 μl of in vitro translated Claspin and then immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4°C using sheep anti-Chk1 or control sheep anti-Xenopus Mog1 antibody prebound in the presence of 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to protein G-Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech). Beads were isolated using a Dynal magnetic particle concentrator and washed once with HeLa nuclear extract buffer; twice with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) CHAPS, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate; and once with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. Proteins were boiled off the beads into SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with mouse monoclonal anti-Chk1 antibody or by autoradiography. DNA Precipitation Assay—Chk1 was phosphorylated in 600 μg of extract as described above using either non-biotinylated or biotinylated (dA)70·(dT)70 with the addition of 3 μl of in vitro translated Claspin (or truncated). Particulate material was removed by centrifugation for 1 min in a bench-top centrifuge, and the supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of M-280 streptavidin-Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech) for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were collected through a 1 m sucrose cushion (0.5 ml) by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 80 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate. The beads were collected using the Dynal magnetic particle concentrator. Proteins were boiled off the beads into SDS loading buffer and analyzed by autoradiography. Immunodepletion of Caspases—Approximately 1 mg of cell extract was subjected to three rounds of depletion (1 h each at 4 °C) with ∼1.5 μg of specific antibody prebound to beads coated with protein A (rabbit antibodies) or protein G (goat polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies). Samples were used to confirm depletions by Western blotting with antibodies raised in different species from the immunoprecipitating antibodies. Cleavage of Claspin by Caspase-7—Purified active recombinant human caspase-7 (Pharmingen) was diluted in 20 μl of 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm EDTA with 1 μl of in vitro translated wild-type or mutant Claspin (C terminus) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Claspin Is Cleaved by a Caspase during Apoptosis—Human Claspin has a predicted molecular mass of 151 kDa, but migrates anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gel with an apparent molecular mass of ∼250 kDa as noted previously (26Sar F. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Subramanian D. Croteau D.L. Hutsell S.Q. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39289-39295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In a human cell-free system made from a mixture of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa cells (29Clarke C.A.L. Clarke P.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in which caspases are activated by the addition of cytochrome c (35Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), Claspin was modified from the apparent 250-kDa form to a doublet with an apparent molecular mass of ∼220 kDa, suggesting that it was being proteolytically cleaved (Fig. 1A). Claspin cleavage followed processing of caspase-7 (Fig. 1A), which is associated with activation of this aspartyl protease and cleavage of PARP, a substrate for caspase-7 and caspase-3 (37Germain M. Affar E.B. D'Amours D. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Claspin, PARP, and caspase-7 in this system was completely blocked by the tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO and Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1B), confirming that cleavage of Claspin, like PARP, was due to caspase activity. In HeLa cells in which apoptosis was induced by a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α and cycloheximide, Claspin was similarly processed from the 250-kDa form to the ∼220-kDa form after 6 h of incubation, when PARP cleavage and caspase-7 activation were also apparent (Fig. 1C). An antibody raised against a peptide derived from the C-terminal region of Claspin detected a polypeptide that migrated at ∼30 kDa, consistent with the generation of a smaller C-terminal fragment. As in the cell-free system, processing of Claspin, PARP, and caspase-7 was inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO. In addition to apoptotic cleavage, the total amount of Claspin declined substantially following treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α and cycloheximide, and this loss was not prevented by Ac-DEVD-CHO. This indicates that there is also a caspase-independent pathway for the degradation of Claspin in cells. Claspin Cleavage Coincides with Inactivation of Checkpoint Signaling—When Jurkat cells were treated with the topoisomerase II poison etoposide, which induces DNA damage through generation of double-strand breaks, there was an initial strong activation of the Chk1 pathway. This activation was evident from the strong induction of phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345, a site targeted by ATR (7Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), together with the appearance of a slower migrating form of Claspin, most likely due to its phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). However, after 4–6 h of treatment with etoposide, caspase-7 was activated, PARP was cleaved, and the level of full-length Claspin was greatly reduced. Although the appearance of a large fragment of Claspin was not observed in these cells, the loss of Claspin was prevented by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, confirming that it was due to caspase activity. It was notable that the caspase-dependent loss of Claspin after prolonged incubation coincided with dephosphorylation of Chk1. In contrast, the level of Chk1 was only slightly diminished after 6 h of treatment with etoposide, and the level of ATR, which is not cleaved by caspases (38Smith G.C. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6076-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was stable. Dephosphorylation of Chk1 was also inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk. These results suggest that caspase-mediated cleavage of Claspin inactivates cell cycle checkpoint signaling from damaged DNA via ATR to Chk1. Claspin Is Cleaved by a Caspase at a Single Site—Because cleavage of Claspin produced a large fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 220 kDa and a smaller C-terminal fragment of 30 kDa, a major site of cleavage is likely to reside within the C-terminal half of the protein. Indeed, in vitro transcribed and translated human Claspin-(679–1332), which migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 120 kDa, was cleaved to produce one fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa and a second of 30 kDa in apoptotic extracts of HeLa cells (S100) and Xenopus eggs. In both extracts, Claspin-(679–1332) cleavage was completely inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 2A). Examination of the amino acid sequence of Claspin-(679–1332) revealed five DXXD motifs that might be recognized by the effectors caspase-3 and caspase-7, which are inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO. Similar motifs are present in other substrates for these caspases (Fig. 2B). In these substrates, cleavage occurs after the second Asp residue, which is essential for recognition by the caspase. We therefore mutated the five Asp residues in Claspin-(679–1332) at which cleavage might occur to Ala and found that mutation of only Asp1072 prevented caspase cleavage (Fig. 2C). Comparison of Claspin- (679–1332) with full-length Claspin and Claspin-(1–678) demonstrated that Asp1072 was the only site at which cleavage occurred. Indeed, the fragments predicted to be generated by caspase cleavage of the full-length protein, Claspin-(1–1072) and Claspin-(1073–1332), were stable against caspase activity in apoptotic cell extracts (Fig. 2D). The doublet formed during cleavage of the endogenous protein in cell extracts (Fig. 1A) may therefore be due to another post-translational modification of a fraction of Claspin molecules. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of Claspin from different species indicated that the site of cleavage in human Claspin is conserved in mouse, but not in Xenopus, although a number of Asp residues are present within this region of the Xenopus protein. In Drosophila Claspin, there is a DEYD motif within this region of the protein that is a potential caspase cleavage site (Fig. 2E). Claspin Is Cleaved Specifically by Caspase-7—Cleavage of human Claspin after a DEYD motif suggests that it is a substrate for caspase-3 or caspase-7, both of which show a strong preference for sites with aspartate at the P4 position and glutamate at the P3 position (39Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). To determine whether one or the other of these caspases is required for Claspin cleavage, we depleted them from HeLa cell extracts using specific antibodies (Fig. 3A). Depletion of caspase-3 only slightly reduced cleavage of Claspin-(679–1332) in response to cytochrome c, whereas depletion of caspase-7 strongly inhibited cleavage. Depletion of caspase-9, which is required for activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in response to cytochrome c (40Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar), completely inhibited Claspin-(679–1332) cleavage. In contrast, depletion of caspase-8 had no effect on Claspin-(679–1332) cleavage. This indicates that Claspin is cleaved at Asp1072 predominantly by caspase-7 downstream of caspase-9. Claspin-(679–1332) was indeed cleaved into two fragments by active caspase-7 (Fig. 3B), and this processing was completely inhibited by mutation of Asp1072 to Ala (D1072A). Active caspase-3 was also capable of cleaving Claspin directly at this site (data not shown), although caspase-3 was clearly less important than caspase-7 in cell extracts (Fig. 3A).

FoxH1, a member of the Forkhead-box (FOX) gene family of transcription factors, takes part in mediating transforming growth factor-β/activin signaling through its interaction with the Smad2·Smad4 complex. Using a series of experiments, we found that FoxH1 repressed both ligand-dependent and -independent transactivation of the AR on androgen-induced promoters. This action of FoxH1 was independent of its transactivation capacity and activin A but relieved by Smad2·Smad4. In addition, the repression of the AR by FoxH1 did not require deacetylase activity. A protein-protein interaction was identified between the AR and FoxH1 independently of dihydrotestosterone. Furthermore, a confocal microscopic analysis of LNCaP cells revealed that the interaction between the AR and FoxH1 occurred in the nucleus and that FoxH1 specifically blocked the foci formation of dihydrotestosterone-activated AR, which has been shown to be correlated with the AR transactivation potential. Taken together, our results indicate that FoxH1 functions as a new corepressor of the AR. Our observations not only strengthen the role of FoxH1 in AR-mediated transactivation but also suggest that therapeutic interventions based on AR-coregulator interactions could be designed to block both androgen-dependent and -independent growth of prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Androgens play major roles in promoting the development and progression of prostate cancer (1Santos A.F. Huang H.

However, although such relapsed tumors are androgen-independent, they are still dependent on the AR for their growth and survival (4Navarro D. Luzardo O.P. Fernandez L. Chesa N. Diaz-Chico B.N. J.

AF-1 functions in a ligand-independent manner, whereas the activity of AF-2 requires cognate ligand binding (9Lee H.J. Chang C. Cell. Mol.

Upon activation by ligands, the AR translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to androgen response elements and regulates the transcription of target genes. Moreover, it has become clear that the transactivity of nuclear receptors, including the AR, is regulated by coregulator proteins that enhance (coactivators) or reduce (corepressors) the target gene transcription by various mechanisms (10Haendler B. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2002; 56: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 14Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Although most of the AR coregulators identified to date have been coactivators, it is conceivable that AR corepressors are also required for precise and efficient regulation of the AR activity in cells (13Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 15Wang L. Hsu C.L. Chang C. Prostate. 2005; 63: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, further characterization of AR corepressors may provide insights into the signaling events that occur within prostate cancer and pave the way to the development of individualized therapies. Activins, which are members of the TGF-β superfamily, are composed of two β subunits, βA and βB, which form activin A (βAβA), activin B (βBβB), and activin AB (βAβB) (16Ying S.Y. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to their stimulatory effects on pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone synthesis, activins have also been implicated in the control of many other cellular processes, including growth and tumorigenesis (17Ying S.Y.

Moreover, activin A has been shown to induce the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase, and the AR (26Zhang Z. Zhao Y. Batres Y. Lin M.F. Ying S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), genes that are also induced by androgen. Although the molecular mechanism through which activin A regulates gene expression and growth in the prostate has not yet been fully elucidated, cross-talk between activin A and androgen-mediated signaling pathways may play critical roles in these processes (27Carey J.L.

Smads are a family of proteins that function as effectors of the TGF-β/activin-signaling pathway. Ligand addition induces the phosphorylation of specific receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), which then oligomerize with the common mediator Smad4 and move into the nucleus. Once there, the R-Smad·Smad4 complex interacts with a variety of transcription factors and coregulators and becomes targeted to a diverse array of gene promoters (28Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Abe Y. Minegishi T. Leung P.C. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).

We hypothesized that FoxH1 may also function as a coregulator to regulate the AR transactivation potential and, therefore, be involved in the cross-talk between activin A and androgen-mediated signaling. In the present study we found that FoxH1 could repress ligand-dependent and -independent transactivation of the AR on androgen-induced promoters. However, the repression of the AR by FoxH1 was not alleviated by activin A, indicating that FoxH1 was dispensable for the stimulatory effect of activin A on PSA expression (26Zhang Z. Zhao Y.

The human ER expression vectors pSG5-ERα and pSG5-ERβ as well as a reporter plasmid for ER (pERE2-tk109-LUC) were kind gifts from Dr. Shigeaki Kato (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The reporter plasmid pPSA-LUC, containing the luciferase gene under the control of a 6.1-kilobase promoter fragment of the human PSA gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Jer-Tsong Hsieh (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The human PR expression vectors pSG5-PRA and pSG5-PRB were kind gifts from Dr. Pierre Chambon (INSERM, Illkirch, France). pRL-SV40, pG5-LUC, pBIND, and pACT expression vectors were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). AR and FoxH1 expression vectors for mammalian two-hybrid assays were subcloned into the pBIND and pACT expression vectors, respectively. pFoxH1-Myc and pFoxH1H83R-Myc were constructed by sub-cloning the FoxH1 and FoxH1H83R cDNAs into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His, respectively. pFoxH1-GFP was constructed by inserting the FoxH1 cDNA into pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The validity of the structure of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing and Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells. RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using ISOGENE (Wako, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of the RNA were determined spectrophotometrically. Next, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using a SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl. To analyze the expression of FoxH1 in prostate cancer cell lines, a sensitive RT-PCR was performed using previously described primers (39Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The PCR was carried out in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) under the following conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Aliquots of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide and then photographed under UV light using a positive/negative instant film (Polaroid 665; Nippon-Polaroid, Tokyo, Japan). The authenticity of each PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. Transactivation Assays—The human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sera Laboratories Ltd., Sussex, UK). COS-7 monkey kidney cells and ALVA41 human prostate cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were cotransfected with the indicated expression vectors in 24-well plates using an Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen K. K., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were then incubated in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or ligands as indicated. After 24 h, the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a Minilumat LB9507 (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The results were normalized for the internal Renilla control and presented as the relative luciferase activity. All transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate wells and repeated at least three times using two sets of plasmids prepared separately. Data were calculated as the mean ± S.D. Stable Transfection of LNCaP Cells with pFoxH1-Myc, Semiquantitative RT-PCR, and Western Blotting—LNCaP cells were cultured in six-well plates and then transfected with pFoxH1-Myc using an Effectene transfection kit. After 4 weeks of culturing and selection with 400 μg/ml of Geneticin (Invitrogen), 6 colonies were harvested. After limited dilution, 2 independent FoxH1-Myc-expressing clones (designated LNCaP/FoxH1-1 and LNCaP/FoxH1-2) were identified by Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody (1:1000; sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and further maintained as stable cell lines in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 200 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells stably transfected with the empty vector (LNCaP/Vector) served as a control. The effect of stably expressing FoxH1 on the endogenous PSA level in the absence or presence of 100 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was investigated by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed as described above. Preliminary experiments were conducted to ensure linearity for the semiquantitative procedures. Hot-start PCR was performed by heat-activating AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 95 °C for 10 min. Optimized cycling condition was 30 cycles (for PSA) or 26 cycles (for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The primer sequences specific for PSA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were described previously (48Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G.

For Western blotting, the cells were harvested, and the protein concentration of each sample was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots containing 20 μg of protein were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Next, the membranes were probed with the anti-human PSA antibody A67-B/E3 (1:200; sc-7316; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or an anti-β-actin antibody (1:500; AC-74; Sigma). Bands were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase system. Microscopy and Imaging Analyses—Microscopy and imaging analyses were performed essentially as described previously (44Tomura A. Goto K.

The cells were imaged for green fluorescence by excitation with the 488-nm line from an argon laser, and the emission was viewed through a 496-505-nm band pass filter. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—COS-7 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of pFoxH1-Myc or pFoxH1H83R-Myc together with 2 μg of the pCMVhAR or pCMV parent vector in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nm DHT for 24 h and then harvested in celLytic™-M (Sigma) containing 1× Complete Mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration of each sample was measured and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Next, an aliquot (160 μg) of each lysate was incubated with 3 μg of the anti-AR antibody C-19 (sc-815; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or normal rabbit IgG as a control in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1× Complete Mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture and then further incubated with 25 μl of protein G magnetic beads (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating platform. The beads were collected using a magnet, and the bound proteins were eluted in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. A Western blot analysis was performed using the anti-Myc antibody (1:500) as described above, and the positive bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and a VersaDoc™ imaging system (Bio-Rad). Mammalian Two-hybrid Assays—Mammalian two-hybrid assays (Promega) were mainly performed according the manufacturer's protocol, with some modifications. NIH3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with the indicated vectors in 24-well plates using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen K. K.) in the presence or absence of 10 nm DHT. Luciferase activities were assayed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by one-factor analysis of variance followed by a post hoc test (Fisher's protected least significant difference test). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Expression of FoxH1 in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines—A previous study (39Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported that human FoxH1 gene expression was ubiquitous and could be detected in all normal human tissues tested as well as in several cancer cell lines. However, whether FoxH1 is expressed in LNCaP cells as well as in other prostate cancer lines has yet not been elucidated. Therefore, to investigate the role of FoxH1 in the cross-talk between activin A- and androgen-mediated signaling in prostate cancer, we initially used the primers described in the above-mentioned study (39Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) to investigate FoxH1 expression in the prostate cancer lines ALVA41, DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3 by RT-PCR. These primers spanned a 100-bp intron and discriminated between the spliced (423 bp) and unspliced (523 bp) products. As shown in Fig. 1A, a 423-bp band was detected in all 4 prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, three of the cell lines also contained the unspliced product, which may arise from either genomic DNA or unprocessed transcripts. FoxH1 Represses Both Ligand-dependent and -independent Transactivation of the AR in LNCaP Cells—Next, we examined the possible roles of FoxH1 expression in ligand-dependent and -independent transcription of the PSA promoter induced by endogenous AR by cotransfecting LNCaP cells, the most commonly used androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, with a FoxH1 expression plasmid and a PSA-luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 1B, DHT activated the AR in a concentration-dependent manner, and an ∼10-fold higher induction was observed in the presence of 1 μm DHT compared with vehicle treatment. Cotransfection of the FoxH1 expression plasmid brought about a marked repression of the DHT-induced AR activation at all concentrations of DHT tested (Fig. 1B), and the repression was dose-dependent (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, FoxH1 completely blocked the stimulatory effects of progesterone and the anti-androgens cyproterone acetate and hydroxyflutamide on the AR in LNCaP cells, which contains a mutation (T877A) that results in alterations of the specificity and sensitivity of the receptor to these molecules (50Kokontis J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). In these and subsequent experiments, the inhibitory effect of FoxH1 on the AR transactivity was not due to a reduced AR expression level, since immunoblot analyses of extracts from the transfected cells revealed comparable amounts of immunoreactive protein (Fig. 1E). Together, these results demonstrate that FoxH1 represses both ligand-dependent and -independent transactivation of endogenous AR in LNCaP cells. To further explore the relevance of FoxH1 in AR-mediated transactivation, we examined the relationship between FoxH1 expression and endogenous PSA expression in LNCaP cells. pFoxH1-Myc was stably transfected into LNCaP cells, and 2 isolated clones expressing similar protein levels of FoxH1-Myc, LNCaP/FoxH1-1, and LNCaP/FoxH1-2 were established (Fig. 1F, top panel) to inv"
https://openalex.org/W2025894970,"Exoenzyme T (ExoT) is a bifunctional type III cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that possesses both Rho GTPase-activating protein and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoT stimulated depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton independent of Rho GTPase-activating protein function, and ExoT was subsequently shown to ADP-ribosylate Crk (CT10 regulator of kinase)-I and Crk-II. Crk proteins are eukaryotic adaptor proteins comprising SH2 and SH3 domains that are components of the integrin signaling pathway leading to Rac1 and Rap1 functions. Mass spectroscopic analysis identified Arg20 as the site of ADP-ribosylation by ExoT. Arg20 is a conserved residue located within the SH2 domain that is required for interactions with upstream signaling molecules such as paxillin and p130cas. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and far Western assays showed that ADP-ribosylated Crk-I or Crk-I(R20K) failed to bind p130cas or paxillin. This indicates that ADP-ribosylation inhibited the direct interaction of Crk with these focal adhesion proteins. Overexpression of wild-type Crk-I reduced cell rounding by ExoT, whereas expression of dominant-active Rac1 interfered with the ability of ExoT to round cells. Thus, the ADP-ribosylation of Crk uncouples integrin signaling by direct inhibition of the binding of Crk to focal adhesion proteins.

Both ExoS and ExoT are bifunctional cytotoxins, possessing an N-terminal Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain and a C-terminal ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (5Barbieri J.T. Sun J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The RhoGAP domains of ExoS and ExoT are essentially identical (6Goehring U.M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36369-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). RhoGAP activity stabilizes the transition state of the GTPase reaction and inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, leading to actin reorganization and cell rounding. Expression of the RhoGAP domain has been proposed to inhibit phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by polarized epithelial cells and phagocytes (7Garrity-Ryan L. Kazmierczak B. Kowal R. Comolli J. Hauser A. Engel J.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7100-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Expression of ADP-ribosyltransferase activities by ExoS and ExoT is dependent on direct binding to the mammalian 14-3-3 protein termed FAS (factor activating exoenzyme S) (8Coburn J. Kane A.V.

Expression of the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of ExoT is not cytotoxic for mammalian cells. ExoT ADP-ribosylates a restricted subset of cellular proteins, including Crk (CT10 regulator of kinase) proteins (12Sun J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32794-32800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Crk proteins and their downstream effectors are conserved throughout evolution, from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. c-Crk is expressed as two distinct proteins of 28 and 40 kDa due to alternative splicing: Crk-I and Crk-II, respectively (13Matsuda M. Reichman C.T. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crk-I and Crk-II have identical SH2 and SH3 domains, with Crk-II possessing an additional SH3 domain separated by 60 amino acids. Both Crk-I and Crk-II are adaptor proteins involved in eukaryotic signal transduction pathways (13Matsuda M. Reichman C.T. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SH2 domain recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine, and the SH3 domain recognizes proline-rich sequences. Specifically, the Crk SH2 domain prefers the pYXXP binding motif (14Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

The integrin receptor-activated p130cas (Crk-associated substrate)-Crk-DOCK180 pathway is involved in cell mobility and phagocytosis (18Albert M.L. Kim J.I. Birge R.B. Nat.

Integrins compose a large family of transmembrane adhesion receptors. Once activated by ligands, integrin receptor α- and β-subunits dimerize, recruiting focal adhesion complex proteins, including focal adhesion kinase and Src family kinases, as well as the scaffolding proteins paxillin and p130cas to the site of activation. Tyr31 and Tyr118 of paxillin are phosphorylated by either focal adhesion kinase or Src (20Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Valles A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), whereas some of the 15 tyrosine residues within the substrate domain of p130cas are phosphorylated by Src kinase (21Shin N.Y.

Crk is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin and p130cas via SH2 domain interaction, which brings SH3 domain-associated proteins such as DOCK180 to the site of activation. Activation of Rac1 by DOCK180 stimulates actin reorganization and eventually leads to cell migration and phagocytosis.An early correlation between ExoT anti-internalization activity and Src-mediated phagocytosis showed that the deletion of Csk, a negative regulator of Src kinase in fibroblasts, attenuates ExoT-mediated anti-internalization activity (24Evans D.J. Kuo T.C. Kwong M. Van R. Fleiszig S.M. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 33: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of ExoT contributes to the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (7Garrity-Ryan L. Kazmierczak B. Kowal R. Comolli J. Hauser A. Engel J.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7100-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This, together with the identification of Crk-I and Crk-II as the targets of ExoT ADP-ribosylation (12Sun J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32794-32800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggests that the ADP-ribosylation of Crk proteins contributes to the actin depolymerization activity of ExoT. In this study, the molecular basis for uncoupling the Crk signal transduction pathway by ExoT is investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Goat polyclonal anti-Crk-I/II antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-p130cas antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) was from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody was from Balco (Berkeley, CA). Sodium orthovanadate was purchase from Sigma.Cell Culture and Bacterial Stains—HeLa cells were cultured in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. P. aeruginosa strain PA103 (ΔexoU exoT::Tc) was transformed with pUCP encoding ExoT(R149K,E383D,E383D)-hemagglutinin (HA) or ExoT(R149K)-HA. The ability of P. aeruginosa to secrete these mutated forms of ExoT was verified as described previously (12Sun J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32794-32800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).In Vitro ADP-ribosylation of Crk-I—GST-Crk-I and ExoT proteins were purified as described previously (12Sun J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32794-32800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-Crk-I (10 μg) or Crk-I (5 μg) was incubated with 100 μm [32P]NAD (3 μCi), 0.5 mm FAS, and 5 nm ExoT in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in a final volume of 20 μl at room temperature for 2–4 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of either SDS sample buffer or 90% (v/v) acetone (final concentration). Samples treated with SDS sample buffer were subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography of dried gels, whereas acetone-precipitated samples were subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Efficiency of ADP-ribosylation was calculated based on separation by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF)/SDS-PAGE.Two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE—Wild-type or ADP-ribosylated GST-Crk-I or Crk-I was mixed with 10 μg of two-dimensional marker (Bio-Rad) and 130 μl of IEF rehydration buffer (9 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 2% IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 1% protease inhibitor (Sigma), and a trace amount of bromphenol blue) and loaded onto Immobiline DryStrip gels (7 cm, pH 4–7; Amersham Biosciences). After 12 h of passive rehydration, proteins were focused in a PROTEAN IEF cell (Bio-Rad) with the following program: step 1, 500 V for 1 V-h; step 2, 3500 V for 2800 V-h (slow voltage ramping); step 3, 3500 V for 16,000 V-h; and step 4, holding at 500 V.Cleavage of GST-Crk-I—GST-Crk-I (1 mg) was incubated with thrombin (0.25 units/μl) in thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 330 μm CaCl2, and 14 μg/μl dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 400 μl at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Cleaved GST, uncleaved GST-Crk-I, and thrombin were removed by incubating the reaction mixture with 250 μl of a 75% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and 100 μl of a 50% slurry of p-aminobenzamidineagarose (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The soluble fraction (Crk-I) was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Identification of the ADP-ribosylation Site—Crk-I protein was ADP-ribosylated in vitro as described above and then precipitated with 90% (v/v) acetone (final concentration) at –20 °C. Precipitated proteins were suspended in IEF rehydration buffer and separated by two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE. One protein spot containing ADP-ribosylated Crk-I (Crk-I-ADPr; 28 kDa, pI 5.3) was excised and digested with trypsin (1 unit/reaction) in 50 μl of 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0). Peptides were extracted for analysis by liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Reactions were performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pGEX-Crk-I as a template. The following Crk-I(R20K) primers were utilized: 5′-gg tac tgg ggg agg ttg agt aag cag gag gcg gtg gcg ctg-3′ and 5′-cag cgc cac cgc ctc ctg ctt act caa cct ccc cca gta cc-3′. Mutated DNA was verified by sequencing. DNAs encoding Crk-I and Crk-I(R20K) in the pGEX4T vector were subcloned into the pEGFPC1 vector at BamHI and SalI sites, which allowed expression in eukaryotic cells.GST Pull-down Assay—Confluent lawns of HeLa cells (15-cm dishes) were pretreated with 1 mm Na3VO4 for 3 h to increase the phosphate content of proteins. Dishes were placed on ice and washed twice with 15 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4. Cells were lysed in 0.8 ml of cold Triton X-100 lysate buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% protease inhibitor) for 30 min on ice with occasional shaking. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the cleared cell lysate was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Equivalent amounts of cell lysate (4 mg) were precleared with 50 μl of a 75% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and then incubated with 100 μl of fresh glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (75% slurry) and 10 μg of GST-Crk-I, GST-Crk-I-ADPr, or GST-Crk-I(R20K) for 2 h at 4°C. The sample was centrifuged at 850 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of Triton X-100 lysate buffer, and the final pellet was suspended in 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min to dissociate the complex. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblotting was performed using primary antibodies (anti-p130cas (1:1000), anti-paxillin (1:5000), anti-GST (0.2 μg/ml), and 4G10 (1:1000)) and an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) with enhanced chemiluminescence detection (SuperSignal, Pierce). From the cell lysate, ∼43% of total GST-Crk-I was bound by the GST beads, whereas 1% of total paxillin and 1% of total p130cas were bound by the GST-Crk-I beads.Far Western Assay—p130cas protein was immunoprecipitated from the HeLa cell lysate as described previously (25Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold Src reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 μm Na3VO4), suspended in 100 μl of Src reaction buffer with or without 0.15 units of active Src (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Reactions were then boiled in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer, subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin-containing phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min and then incubated for 3 h with 0.05 μg/ml GST-Crk-I, GST-Crk-I-ADPr, or GST-Crk-I(R20K); 2 μg/ml mouse anti-GST antibody; and 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin-containing phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C in a final volume of 3 ml. Membranes were washed five times for 4 min each with 1% bovine serum albumin-containing phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence.ADP-ribosylation of Host Proteins in HeLa Cells by Type III-delivered ExoT—HeLa cells (6-well plates) were transfected with 300 ng of the indicated green fluorescent plasmid (pGFP)-Crk-I constructs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) (26Krall R. Zhang Y. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2747-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with the indicated strain of P. aeruginosa at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 8:1 bacteria/host cells for the indicated times and then permeabilized with tetanolysin (0.8 μg) in HG1 buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 2 mm sodium ATP, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 150 mm potassium glutamate, and 2 mm EDTA; 1.0-ml final volume) and incubated with 20 nm [32P]NAD (1.5 μCi) at 37 °C (12Sun J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32794-32800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography or immunoblotting using the anti-GFP, anti-HA, or anti-actin primary antibody and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody with enhanced chemiluminescence detection.RESULTSExoT ADP-ribosylates Crk at Arg20—Although an early study identified Crk as a high affinity substrate for ADP-ribosylation by ExoT (12Sun J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32794-32800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), neither the site(s) of ADP-ribosylation nor the effect of ADP-ribosylation of Crk on host signaling had been determined. As a first step in this characterization, the site that ExoT ADP-ribosylates in Crk was determined. Because it was difficult to resolve a shift in apparent molecular mass by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the electrophoretic properties of Crk and ADP-ribosylated Crk were measured by two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE. Using the migration of marker proteins as reference, GST-Crk-I focused as a single spot at pH 5.9 (Fig. 1A), whereas GST-Crk-I-ADPr focused as a single spot at pH 5.7 (Fig. 1B). The acidic 0.2-unit pI shift of GST-Crk-I upon ADP-ribosylation suggests that Crk-I was ADP-ribosylated at a single site. Greater than 80% of total GST-Crk-I was ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 1B). Other experiments showed the incorporation of [32P]NAD into GST-Crk-I-ADPr, supporting that the acidic 0.2-unit pH shift represents the ADP-ribosylation of Crk (data not shown).To resolve the effect of ADP-ribosylation on Crk function, the site of ADP-ribosylation in Crk-I protein was determined. To simplify the LC-MS/MS characterization, the GST tag was cleaved from GST-Crk-I with thrombin, and Crk-I was used as a substrate for ADP-ribosylation by ExoT. ADP-ribosylated Crk-I was determined to have a mass of 23,968 Da, which is 541 Da greater than the determined mass for Crk-I (TABLE ONE). This indicates that ExoT ADP-ribosylated Crk-I at a single amino acid. Crk-I-ADPr was subjected to two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE, and the focused protein was digested with trypsin. LC-electrospray ionization MS/MS identified a single peptide (residues 18–31) with a 541-Da mass increase. Peptide sequencing showed that Arg20 contained a 541-Da mass addition, indicating this residue as the site of ADP-ribosylation (TABLES TWO and THREE).TABLE ONEExoT ADP-ribosylates Crk-I protein at a single siteTheoretic massLC-MSkDakDaCrk-I23.38823.427Crk-I-ADPr23.92923.968 Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOSequence of Crk-I proteinPositionCrk-I sequence1MAGNFDSEER SSWYWGRLSR* QEAVALLQGQ31RHGVFLVRDS STSPGDYVLS VSENSRVSHY61IINSSGPRPP VPPSPAQPPP GVSPSRLRIG91DQEFDSLPAL LEFYKIHYLD TTTLIEPVSR121SRQGSGVILR QEEAEYVRAL FDFNGNDEED151LPFKKGDILR IRDKPEEQWW NAEDSEGKRG181MIPVPYVEKY RPASASVSAL IGGRKL Open table in a new tab TABLE THREEExoT ADP-ribosylates Crk-I protein at Arg20Positionaab ionsy ions1Leu114.092Ser201.121996.783Arg*898.231909.754Gln1026.281212.655Glu1155.331084.596Ala1226.36955.557Val1325.43884.518Ala1396.47785.449Ler1509.55714.4110Ler1622.64601.3211Gln1750.70488.2412Gly1807.72360.1813Gln1935.78303.1614Arg175.10 Open table in a new tab ExoT Does Not ADP-ribosylate Crk-I(R20K)—GST-Crk-I(R20K) was engineered and tested as a substrate for ADP-ribosylation by ExoT. Although ExoT efficiently ADP-ribosylated Crk-I, Crk-I(R20K) was not ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 2), indicating that Arg20 is the primary site for ADP-ribosylation and that there are no alternative sites for ADP-ribosylation within Crk-I. Next, the ability of type III-delivered (injected into host cells directly by the type III secretion system of P. aeruginosa) ExoT to ADP-ribosylate Crk-I(R20K) was tested. To analyze the effects of only the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, experiments were performed with ExoT(R149K), which does not express RhoGAP activity. A time course showed that type III-delivered ExoT ADP-ribosylated transfected GFP-Crk-I and endogenous Crk-I at 3.5–4.5 h post-infection, with less GFP-Crk-I and endogenous Crk ADP-ribosylated 5 h post-infection (Fig. 3A). Thus, a 4-h post-infection time point was used in subsequent experiments to measure the ADP-ribosylation of Crk by ExoT. Under these conditions, type III-delivered ExoT(R149K) failed to ADP-ribosylate Crk-I(R20K) (Fig. 3B). Controls showed that ExoT(R149K,E383D,E383D) (defective in both RhoGAP and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities) did not ADP-ribosylate GFP-Crk-I or endogenous Crk-I or undergo auto-ADP-ribosylation. Actin was used as a loading control to ensure comparable loading of each sample. Measurement of GFP-Crk-I showed the presence of comparable amounts of GFP-Crk-I and GFP-Crk-I(R20K), whereas HA expression showed a similar delivery of ExoT(R149K) and ExoT(R149K,E383D,E383D). Both ExoT proteins had C-terminal HA epitopes for the detection of protein expression.FIGURE 2The ExoT ADP-ribosylation domain does not modify Crk-I(R20K) in vitro.

Under identical conditions, Crk-I coprecipitated both paxillin and p130cas, whereas neither Crk-I-ADPr nor Crk-I(R20K) coprecipitated either of these focal adhesion proteins (Fig. 4). In addition to the preferred binding of GST-Crk-I to these specific focal adhesion proteins, analysis of the antibody 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine)-probed blot showed that GST-Crk-I coprecipitated more phosphorylated proteins than either Crk-I-ADPr or Crk-I(R20K) (Fig. 4). This suggests that either the ADP-ribosylation of Crk-I at Arg20 or the introduction of R20K reduced the general phosphotyrosine-binding capacity of Crk-I. Measurement of the GST fusion component showed the presence of comparable amounts of GST-Crk-I, GST-Crk-I-ADPr, and GST-Crk-I(R20K) in the coprecipitate. A control wi"

Such oncogenic RET mutations induce its ligand-independent constitutive activation, but whether it spreads identical signaling to ligand-induced signaling is uncertain. To address this question, we designed a cellular model in which RET can be activated either by its natural ligand, or alternatively, by controlled dimerization of the protein that mimics MEN2A dimerization. We have shown that controlled dimerization leaves proximal RET signaling intact but impacts substantially on the tuning of the distal AKT kinase activation (delayed and sustained). In marked contrast, distal activation of ERK remained unaffected. We further demonstrated that specific temporal adjustment of ligand-induced AKT activation is dependent upon a lipid-based cholesterol-sensitive environment, and this control step is bypassed by MEN2A RET mutants. Therefore, these studies revealed that MEN2A mutations propagate previously unappreciated subtle differences in signaling pathways and unravel a role for lipid rafts in the temporal regulation of AKT activation.

Saarma M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). It associates with ligand-specific co-receptors known as GFRαs (GDNF, glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor, family receptors α), to form functional receptors for the GFL (GDNF family ligands). In the current view, homodimeric GFL binding induces a GFL2-GFRα2-RET2 complex (2Leppanen V.M. Bespalov M.M. Runeberg-Roos P. Puurand U. Merits A. Saarma M. Goldman A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RET dimerization leads to increased receptor kinase activity and autophosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, which serve as docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2)- and phospho-tyrosine-binding domain-containing proteins, such as Shc or phospholipase Cγ (3Ichihara M. Murakumo Y. Takahashi M. Cancer Lett. 2004; 204: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These proteins then recruit additional effector molecules, resulting in the assembly of signaling complexes and the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, including the Ras/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. GFL-mediated signaling pathways are involved in the development and maintenance of a broad spectrum of neuronal subpopulations (1Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Nat. Rev.

Recently, membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts, have been shown to profoundly influence the functional impact of GDNF-stimulated RET downstream signaling (4Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J.

Lipid rafts are suggested to be lateral microdomains in membranes of living cells, enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific membrane proteins. They are characterized by higher order and by having a lower buoyant density than bulk plasma membranes (6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Although uncertainties about the precise molecular nature of rafts remain (8Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 9Munro S.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), compelling evidence indicates that lipid rafts can coalesce into larger and more stable structures where proteins can segregate to perform functions (12Golub T. Wacha S. Caroni P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Rajendran L. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1099-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). With regard to GDNF-stimulated RET signaling, it has been shown that at steady state, GFRα1, but not RET, is a resident of lipid raft-related detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). GDNF stimulation was demonstrated to trigger RET recruitment and activation into DRMs. This was strongly correlated with downstream signaling, cell survival, and differentiation (4Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Paratcha et al. (5Paratcha G. Ledda F. Baars L. Coulpier M. Besset V. Anders J. Scott R. Ibanez C.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 171-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) showed that RET association with DRMs may influence the nature of the intracellular signaling. Together, these studies demonstrate a connection between RET association with DRMs and RET signaling and support a role for lipid rafts in controlling GDNF-stimulated RET signaling. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been identified as causative for human papillary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A and 2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (14Hansford J.R. Mulligan L.M. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). MEN2A is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome, characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. MEN2A mutations were identified in the cysteine-rich region, and ∼90% of those mutations affect codon 634 (most frequently a cysteine to arginine change) (15Eng C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 380-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They result in a constitutive activation of RET through formation of covalently linked dimers of the receptor, independent of GFL (16Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Dimerization occurs early during the maturation process and results in additional activation of incompletely glycosylated intracellular RET precursors (18Cosma M.P. Cardone M. Carlomagno F. Colantuoni V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whether MEN2A signaling is identical to GFL-triggered signaling is difficult to answer because activation of the constitutive MEN2A protein cannot be triggered in resting cells, thus precluding a qualitative and quantitative comparison with the GFL-inducible signaling pathways. Consequently, the current model to explain how MEN2A RET mutants promote tumorigenesis only considers the permanent nature of MEN2A signaling. To address this issue, we have generated a chimeric RET-Fv protein that can be alternatively activated in the same cell, either with the natural ligand GDNF or with a synthetic bivalent dimerizing ligand (19Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli Jr., F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The latter mimicked ligand-independent RET dimerization by MEN2A mutants. This induced activation of RET specifically resulted in altered AKT activation but not ERK activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a lipid-based cholesterol-sensitive environment regulates the tuning of GDNF-induced AKT activation, suggesting a role of lipid rafts. Finally, we showed that MEN2A mutants escape from this control step. Therefore, these studies revealed complex alterations in oncogenic signaling by MEN2A RET mutants.

Stably transfected cells were selected in complete medium with G418 (1 mg/ml) and/or puromycin (2 μg/ml) (both from Sigma). Rat-1 cell clones transformed by RET MEN2A mutants (24Segouffin-Cariou C. Billaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3568-3576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) were maintained in complete medium with puromycin (2 μg/ml). MEN2A cells were further transfected with GFRα1, and stable clones (termed Mα) were selected with G418 (1 mg/ml) and puromycin (2 μg/ml). Stimulations and Immunoblotting—Equal numbers of cells were seeded in plates to achieve ∼60% confluence in 24 h and serum-starved for 4 h prior to stimulation. Cells were stimulated for the indicated period of time with either 10 ng/ml GDNF or 100 nm AP20187 in serum-free medium and lysed at 4 °C for 20 min in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, 1% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 4 mm NaVO4, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors). Precleared lysates (10 min at 13,000 rpm) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the relevant antibody as described previously (25Vidalain P.O. Azocar O. Servet-Delprat C. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. Manie S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3304-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Densitometry of the blots was assessed using a Fluor-S multi-imager system (Bio-Rad). DRM Assay—Cells were scrapped, rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed at 3 mg of protein/ml in a final volume of 0.5 ml of ice-cold TNE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 4 mm NaVO4, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Lysates were homogenized five times through a 23-gauge needle and incubated with constant agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. They were then mixed with 1 ml of 60% saccharose in TNE buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes. The samples were overlaid by a saccharose gradient (2 ml of 30% saccharose followed by 1 ml of 25, 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, and 5% saccharose in TNE buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100) and centrifuged for 16 h at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C. The gradient was fractionated into 1-ml fractions (see Fig. 6B, 1.15-ml fractions) from the top of the tube, except for the last one that contained 1.5 ml. Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cellular Cholesterol Depletion and Brefeldin A/Monensin Treatment—Cells prepared as described above were incubated in serum-free medium containing MBC (10 mm) and 50 mm Hepes for 20 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. Cells were then rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, stimulated, and lysed to isolate DRMs. To abrogate RET protein maturation, cells were treated or not with 2.5 μg/ml brefeldin A and 0.66 μl/ml monensin (Golgi stop) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 6 h and further stimulated with AP for the indicated period of time, before being processed for immunoblotting analysis. Cell Growth and TUNEL Assays—Cells were plated at 500 cells/well in 96-well plates in complete medium with GDNF (10 ng/ml) or AP (100 nm), the growth medium being changed every 3 days. Every 2 days, cells were harvested, and an MTT test was realized for each condition of stimulation; 30 μl of MTT (7.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The medium was then replaced with 100 μl of Me2SO with 0.04 n HCl. OD was read at 492 nm. The measured absorbance is proportional to the number of live cells present. For TUNEL assay, Mα cells were plated on coverslips at 7 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, overnight, and stimulated with 50 ng/ml GDNF for 1 h in the same medium before being incubated with anisomycin (1 μg/ml) for 5 h. A TUNEL assay was performed according to the supplier's instructions (in situ cell death detection kit, Roche Diagnostics). Controlled Homodimerization and Activation of RET—The inducible GDNF/GFRα1-independent activation system of RET is controlled by the synthetic bivalent dimerizing ligand AP. It is based on the ability of a fusion protein (RET-Fv), containing RET linked to an AP-binding domain (Fv), to be induced to homodimerize in the presence of AP, leading to RET activation (Fig. 1A). Both RET-Fv and GFRα1 were stably expressed in Rat-1 fibroblastic cells so that RET-Fv can be activated alternatively with GDNF or AP treatment. Fig. 1A shows the expression of RET-Fv and GFRα1 in representative Rat-1 fibroblast clones. The two RET species correspond to the incompletely glycosylated protein present in the endoplasmic reticulum (162 kDa, major form in Rat-1 cells) and to the fully glycosylated protein expressed at the plasma membrane (182 kDa) (26van Weering D.H. Moen T.C. Braakman I. Baas P.D. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12077-12081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 65-kDa form of GFRα1 was expressed on the cellular surface, whereas the 55-kDa form was not (not shown) and was assumed to correspond to an immature GFRα1 product. Stimulation of RET-Fv/GFRα1-expressing cells with an optimal concentration of AP or GDNF for 15 min induced a comparable activation of mature 182-kDa RET proteins, as detected with an antibody specific to phosphorylated autocatalytic residue Y905RET (Fig. 1B, upper panel). However, in contrast to GDNF, AP diffused into the cytoplasm and then bound to and activated the immature 162-kDa Ret protein. This is similar to what is typically observed with MEN2A RET mutants in which both the mature and the immature forms of RET are activated. Despite the additional activation of the immature form of RET, a comparable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was detected after either GDNF or AP stimulation (Fig. 1B, lower panel). It would appear that the addition of the Fv module to the cytoplasmic tail of RET does not obviously alter RET activation and signaling since a similar pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when cells were transfected with wild type RET instead of RET-Fv and stimulated with GDNF (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicated that homodimerization of RET can lead to its efficient activation without the requirement for GDNF/GFRα1 complex. They also suggested that activation of the intracellular immature 162-kDa Ret protein does not contribute much to the RET-dependent pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation. GDNF/GFRα1-independent RET Activation Leads to an Altered Cellular Outcome—Next, we investigated whether activation of RET by AP or GDNF can differently affect biological outcomes. RET-Fv/GFRα1-expressing cells were chronically stimulated with either GDNF or AP, and the growth rate was monitored. Neither AP nor GDNF stimulated growth rate during the first 6 days of culture (Fig. 2). After 8 days of culture, both non-stimulated and GDNF-stimulated cells grew in an even monolayer and displayed normal contact inhibition, as shown on representative May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining of cells after 10 days of culture. As a consequence, these cells stopped growing. In contrast, AP-stimulated cells began to overgrow one another, indicating that they had lost the ability to be contact inhibited. These results indicated the existence of specific AP-mediated cellular outcome(s), suggesting that GDNF/GFRα1-independent RET activation leads to alterations of intracellular signaling pathways. GDNF/GFRα1-independent RET Activation Impacts on AKT Regulation—We next tested whether activation of RET by AP or GDNF can translate into different, or differently regulated, RET-mediated signaling pathways. We first monitored the extent of RET autophosphorylation using two other antibodies specific to phosphorylated Y1015RET and Y1062RET. Fig. 3A shows that phosphorylation over a time course of these autocatalytic residues was comparably achieved by GDNF or AP stimulation. Together with the comparable phosphorylation of Y905RET depicted in Fig. 1, these results indicate that AP or GDNF stimulation leads to similar activation of RET tyrosine kinase. It is of note that RET phosphorylation in Rat-1 cells remained high after 2 h of stimulation and that it could last for 6 h before declining (see Fig. 6A). Similar results were obtained with wild type RET instead of RET-Fv (not shown), indicating that the Fv-binding module is not involved in the long lasting phosphorylation of RET in Rat-1 cells. Y1015RET and Y1062RET are binding sites for PLCγ and Shc/Dok4–5/IRS-1/FRS-2, respectively. The bound molecular partners are in turn phosphorylated by RET (3Ichihara M. Murakumo Y. Takahashi M. Cancer Lett. 2004; 204: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that both Shc and PLCγ were phosphorylated in a comparable manner following GDNF or AP stimulation and that their kinetics of phosphorylation paralleled those of RET. These results implied that RET activation by AP or GDNF does not influence proximal RET signaling, i.e. autophosphorylation of RET and the resulting phosphorylation of the molecular partners Shc and PLCγ. We next examined the activation of downstream pathways by looking at ERK and AKT phosphorylation. GDNF induced a transient phosphorylation of ERK and AKT (Fig. 3). Therefore, both Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways can be attenuated even with the prolonged phosphorylation of RET observed in Rat-1 cells. As compared with GDNF, AP stimulated ERK phosphorylation to a similar amplitude and duration. However, in marked contrast, the kinetics of AP-stimulated AKT phosphorylation was delayed and sustained for several hours (Fig. 3, A and B). Kinetic alteration of AKT phosphorylation was detected on both serine 473 and threonine 308, which additively activate AKT (28Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that AP does not directly affect AKT activation since no alteration of AKT phosphorylation could be detected following GDNF treatment of cells expressing RET (instead of RET-Fv) in the presence of AP (not shown). These results indicated that GDNF/GFRα1-independent RET activation translates into differently regulated AKT activation, without really affecting ERK activation. Neither Signaling from GFRα1 Alone nor from Immature Forms of RET Contributes to AKT Phosphorylation—Since GDNF has been reported to signal independently of RET via GFRα1 (29Trupp M. Scott R. Whittemore S.R. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20885-20894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 30Poteryaev D. Titievsky A. Sun Y.F. Thomas-Crusells J. Lindahl M. Billaud M. Arumae U. Saarma M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it was important to evaluate whether signaling originating from GFRα1 alone could contribute to AKT and ERK phosphorylation in Rat-1 cells. We thus made use of Rat-1 clones expressing GFRα1 only and have been unable to detect any phosphorylation of AKT and ERK following GDNF stimulation of these clones (Fig. 4A). Next, we evaluated whether AP-activated immature 162-kDa forms of RET-Fv were involved in the differential phosphorylation of AKT. To address this issue, cells were treated with brefeldin A and monensin to abrogate RET maturation and delivery to the plasma membrane (31Jung T. Schauer U. Heusser C. Neumann C. Rieger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 159: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The combined use of the two protein maturation blocking drugs was favored because under our experimental conditions, each drug alone was not efficient enough to fully prevent apparition of mature RET proteins (not shown). Cellular treatment for 6 h with the two drugs efficiently blocked the expression of the plasma membrane-localized mature forms of RET while increasing the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated immature 162-kDa form of RET (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions, AP stimulation of cells could still induce phosphorylation of the immature form. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Shc was also detectable, indicating that activated endoplasmic reticulum-associated immature 162-kDa forms of RET can recruit molecular partners. However, these activated forms of RET made no detectable contribution to AKT and ERK activation. These data, together with the observation that additional activation of immature forms of RET did not modify the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 1B), strongly suggest that immature forms of RET do not contribute to the signaling pathways monitored here. GDNF/GFRα1-independent RET Activation Does Not Associate with DRMs—GDNF/GFRα1-stimulated RET associates with the raft-related DRMs, and this association has been correlated with the control of downstream signaling (4Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Paratcha G. Ledda F. Baars L. Coulpier M. Besset V. Anders J. Scott R. Ibanez C.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 171-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, to gain an insight into the mechanism(s) responsible for the differential regulation of AKT activation, we asked whether AP stimulation could also induce the association of RET with DRMs. As expected, GDNF stimulation induced an association of mature forms of RET-Fv with DRMs (Fig. 5A). Flotillin and transferrin receptor were used as positive and negative markers, respectively, of DRM-associated proteins. Although RET must associate with GFRα1to be activated by GDNF, more than 60% of phosphorylated RET-Fv was recovered in soluble fractions (Fig. 5B). This does not seem to reflect a large movement of RET out of DRMs after recruitment and activation since RET remained associated with DRMs for several hours after the beginning of the stimulation in Rat-1 cells (Fig. 5B, and see also Fig. 6A). These results suggested that RET association with DRMs is weaker than GFRα1 association and that it can be partly disrupted by non-ionic detergents. In marked contrast to these results, RET association with DRMs was not evident upon AP stimulation. Similarly, RET proteins carrying a representative MEN2A mutation at Cys-634 (24Segouffin-Cariou C. Billaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3568-3576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) were not recovered in the DRM fractions (Fig. 5A). These results clearly demonstrated a difference in the association (or the strength of association) of RET with DRMs between GDNF-dependent and GDNF/GFRα1-independent RET activation. RET Association with DRMs Correlates with Specific Regulation of AKT—The above results raised the possibility that tight regulation of AKT, but not ERK, phosphorylation is linked to DRM association of RET. This hypothesis was tested in two different ways. First, association of proteins with DRMs has been shown to be sensitive to the cholesterol-depleting drug MBC (32Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Preincubation of Rat-1 cells for 20 min with 10 mm MBC before stimulation did not affect RET phosphorylation and its"

This process involves coordinated resorption of pathologically deposited extracellular matrix, including elastin, and occurs in the presence of serine elastase and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. Here, we show that apoptotic smooth muscle cells exhibit extensive degradation of elastin coincident with cell surface immunolocalization and release of caspases. We further document that recombinant caspase-2, -3, and -7 are potently elastolytic. These enzymes are present in an active form on apoptotic cell surfaces and caspase inhibitors attenuate their elastolytic activity.

Genes regulated by sterol availability include those encoding HMG-CoA reductase (HMG1), squalene synthase (ERG9), sterol C-5 desaturase (ERG3), and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (ERG10) (10Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The ERG10 promoter contains an active SRE-like element that has seven of the eight nucleotides that are found in the core mammalian SRE-1 consensus sequence (22Dimster-Denk D. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, the ERG3 promoter contains a 22-bp region that is involved in the sterol regulation of transcription (23Arthington-Skaggs B.A. Crowell D.N. Yang H. Sturley S.L. Bard M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Vik and Rine (24Vik A. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6395-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have uncovered a 7-bp SRE that regulates ERG2 (sterol C-8 isomerase) and ERG3, which is shared among several ERG genes, as well as other genes needed for lipid metabolism, including the LCB1/2 serine palmitoyltransferase genes, which are required for the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis (10Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The Upc2p and Ecm22p transcription factors bind to this SRE and most likely regulate sterol responsive gene transcription (24Vik A. Rine J. Mol. Cell.

Multiple studies in mammalian cell systems strongly suggest cross-talk regulation between sterol and sphingolipid pathways in higher eukaryotes (29Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D.

To further explore whether yeast have transcriptional and post-translational coordinate regulatory pathways governing sterol and sphingolipid homeostasis, we isolated and characterized recessive mutations that would rescue the inviability of erg26-1ts cells at high temperature. Four complementation groups were isolated, designated ets1-4. Our data demonstrate that ets1-1 and ets2-1 gene groups harbor recessive mutations in the ERG1 squalene epoxidase and ERG7 oxidosqualene cyclase genes, respectively. Using these mutant strains, we present evidence of a novel transcriptional signaling pathway, which coordinately regulates the transcription of several ERG genes at multiple points in the sterol pathway. Strains, Media, and Miscellaneous Microbial Techniques—The parental yeast strains used in this study are W303 (MATa leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 can1-100) or BY4741 (MATa his3 leu2 met15 ura3). Yeast strains were grown in either YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic minimal medium containing 0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids, adenine, and uracil. Antifungal drugs were either added directly to liquid YEPD medium or added to YEPD plates at the indicated concentrations. Lovastatin treatment was for 16 h, fluconazole, amphotericin B, and nystatin treatment was for 3 h. Yeast transformation was performed using the procedure described by Ito et al. (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For routine propagation of plasmids, Escherichia coli XL1Blue cells were used and grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (150 μg/ml). Bacterial transformations were carried out by electroporation methods. Strain Construction and Plasmids—Haploid strains harboring the erg1::kanr, erg7::kanr, erg2::kanr, erg6::kanr, and erg24::kanr deletion alleles were constructed using heterozygous null diploid strains obtained from the Research Genetics Deletion Collection and PCR. pRS416-ERG1 and pRS416-ERG7 were transformed into heterozygous diploids, and these cells were sporulated to obtain the necessary haploid strains. pRS416-ERG1, pRS416-ERG7, pRS416-erg1-1, and pRS416-erg7-1 were constructed using the URA3 containing centromeric plasmid, pRS416 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains harboring individual deletions were verified by PCR analysis. All genomic sequences that were subcloned into vectors were obtained by PCR amplification using the high fidelity pfu polymerase. Mutations in erg1-1 (G-A, nucleotide 740) and erg7-1 (G-A and T-A, nucleotides 1588 and 1844, respectively) were determined by DNA sequencing of multiple overlapping pfu polymerase-generated fragments. The recombinant erg1-1 and erg7-1 alleles were constructed using the QuikChange® Multisite-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were verified by DNA sequencing. All DNA sequences that were generated by PCR were sequenced and compared with the yeast genome data base. The yeast-integrating vector, YIp353, was used to construct all promoter-LacZ plasmids. YIp-ERG1, YIp-ERG7, YIp353-ERG25, YIp353-ERG26, and YIp353-ERG27 were integrated at the URA3 locus of each strain by digestion with StuI. The following promoter sequences were used: ERG1, –650 to +2; ERG7 –500 to +2; ERG25 and ERG27, –1500 to +2; ERG26, –450 to +2. Isolation of erg26-1ts ts Suppressors—To obtain recessive ts suppressors, MATa and MATα haploid erg26-1ts cells were streaked onto pre-warmed YEPD plates and grown for 3–6 days at 37 °C. 29 MATa and 30 MATa ts revertants were obtained. All individual MATa revertants were mated to each MATa and diploids were tested for growth at 27 °C and 37 °C. MATa/MATα diploids that grew at 37 °C were considered homozygous for a single mutation suppressing the ts phenotype. Complementation groups were then assigned based on the results of the diploid growth assays. To obtain haploid strains harboring only the erg1-1/ets1-1 or erg7-1/ets2-1 allele, first a single haploid from each complementation group was selected, and the erg26-1ts allele was replaced with erg26-1ts::erg26-1ts::URA3 in order to be able to track the ts allele through genetic crosses. Second, the resulting haploid strain was backcrossed to the opposite wild-type mating partner, the diploid was then induced to sporulate and haploid spores were selected based on their harboring the erg26-1ts::erg26-1ts::URA3 allele and showing growth at 37 °C. This selection process was repeated five times. Spores harboring erg1-1/ets1-1 or erg7-1/ets2-1 alleles were then obtained from asci-containing tetratype spores. Metabolic Radiolabeling and Analysis of Sterols and Neutral Lipids—For steady state labeling of sterols, cultures were incubated at 30 °C with 5mCi/ml [14C]acetate (51 mCi/mmol) for 3 h. Radiolabeled sterols were extracted using chloroform, methanol (2:1) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using hexane, diethyl ether, acetic acid (80:20:2). Neutral lipid radiolabeling and TLC analysis using petroleum ether, diethyl ether, acetic acid (70:30:1) were performed as described previously (25Baudry K. Swain E. Rahier A. Germann M. Batta A. Rondet S. Mandala S. Henry K. Tint G.S. Edlind T. Kurtz M. Nickels J.T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12702-12711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sterol intermediates were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR5 film. GC/MS Analysis of Sterols—Sterols were extracted as part of the nonsaponifiable fraction essentially as described (36Zweytick D. Hrastnik C. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Washed cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of methanol, 1.0 ml of 60% potassium hydroxide, 1.0 ml 0.5% pyrogallol, and heated for 2 h at 85°C. The nonsaponified material was extracted two times with petroleum ether, hexane (1:1). Cholesterol (20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml stock) was added to each sample for use as an internal standard. Samples were dried down under nitrogen and resuspended in 200 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of pyridine, bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, 1% trimethylchlorosilane for trimethylsilylation (TMS) of free hydroxyl groups (37Phillips K.M. Ruggio D.M. Bailey J.A. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1999; 732: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38Chambaz E. Horning E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 30: 7-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each TMS treatment extract was diluted by addition of 0.5 ml of petroleum ether, hexane (1:1) and passed over a silica gel minicolumn that was pretreated with hexane, petroleum ether (1:1, v/v) (39Lechner M. Reiter B. Lorbeer E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 857: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sterols were eluted with hexane, ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v). The pooled flow-through and eluant fractions were dried down under nitrogen and resuspended in 200 μlof cyclohexane, dichloromethane (1:1, v/v). Sterol samples were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph using a 30-m HP-5 column. Standard instrument conditions were as follows: injection port temperature 250 °C, detector temperature 300 °C, initial oven temperature at 250 °C. After a 30-min hold at 250 °C, the oven temperature was increased at 2 °C/minute up to 280 °C, held for 15 min, and then increased at 5 °C/min to 310 °C and held for 5 min. Cellular sterol species were identified by comparison of peak position retention times to those of standard compounds (ergosterol, lanosterol, cholesterol (internal standard), and squalene) and/or relative to the cholesterol internal standard peak position (40Patterson G.W. Anal. Chem. 1971; 43: 1165-1170Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 41Nes W.D. Xu S.H. Haddon W.F. Steroids. 1989; 53: 533-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 42Xu S.H. Norton R.A. Crumley F.G. Nes W.D. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 452: 377-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and by GC/MS analysis using data base files of sterol spectra. GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column and Hewlett-Packard model 5973 Mass Selective Detector. GC/MS run conditions were essentially the same as that described above for analysis of sterols by gas liquid chromatography. Squalene Epoxidase Assays—Yeast strains were grown aerobically in YEPD medium at 25 °C to late-log phase (A600 between 1.5 and 2). Cells were harvested, washed with 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and disrupted in a glass bead mill. Cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard. 3 mg of total protein were incubated with the cofactor-substrate mix (5 mm NADPH, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.04 mm FAD, 2 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm mevalonic acid lactone, and 0.5 μCi of [14C]mevalonic acid) at 30 °C for 2 h. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 15% (v/v) KOH in methanol and incubation at 60 °C for 15 min. Lipids were extracted with hexane and analyzed by TLC on silica gel 60 plates using CHCl3 as developing solvent. TLC plates were scanned in a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed with Image Quant 5.1. Lipid species were identified by using respective standards on the same silica plates. Values of each lipid species represent percent of the total intensity/lane. The values represent the average of three independent experiments. [2-14C]Acetate Incorporation into Sterols for Oxidosqualene Cyclase Activity—Sterol biosynthesis in whole yeast cells was followed by incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into nonsaponifiable lipids as previously described (43Balliano G. Viola F. Ceruti M. Cattel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed cells (2–4 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of YPD, containing 0.1 mg/ml Tween 80, incubated with 0.2 μCi of [2-14C]acetate (50 mCi/mm) and shaken for 30 min or 3 h at 30°C. Then, cells were harvested by centrifugation and saponified in 50% ethanol containing 15% KOH for2hat80°C.Nonsaponifiable lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml of light petroleum and separated on silica gel plates (Merck) using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (85:15, v/v) as developing solvent. Authentic standards of ergosterol, lanosterol, dioxidosqualene, oxidosqualene, and squalene were run with each sample. Radioactivity in separated bands was measured using a System Imaging Scanner (Packard). Oxidosqualene Cyclase Assays—3S-2,3-[14C]Oxidosqualene was prepared by incubating a pig liver S10 preparation with [14C]mevalonate as described (44Popjak G. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 15: 393-454Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in the presence of 0.1 mm of the oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) inhibitor U14266A (U14, 3β-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)-androst-5-on-17-one) (45Field R.B. Holmlund C.E. Whittaker N.F. Lipids. 1979; 14: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After 3 h of incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of 15% KOH in methanol, and lipids were saponified at 80 °C for 30 min. The nonsaponifiable lipids were extracted three times with two volumes of light petroleum and separated by TLC on silica gel plates. The plates were first developed in light petroleum to a height of ∼10 cm above the origin. After drying, the plates were developed to 15 cm above the origin with n-hexane/ethyl acetate (90:10, v/v). Radioactive bands corresponding to 2,3-oxidosqualene were scraped off and eluted with dichloromethane. The extract was brought to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and 3S-2,3-[14C]oxidosqualene was dissolved in benzene. OSC activity in total yeast homogenate (6 mg of protein/ml) was determined as described elsewhere (43Balliano G. Viola F. Ceruti M. Cattel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C to early stationary phase in YPD medium. Cells were then pelleted at 3000 × g for 10, resuspended (0.15 g of wet cells/ml) in 0.02 m KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4 containing 1.2 m sorbitol, and treated with lyticase (1 mg/g wet cells) for 60 min at 30 °C. The spheroplasts obtained after lysis were pelleted at 3000 × g for 10 min, washed twice in 0.02 m KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4 containing 1.2 m sorbitol, and homogenized with a Potter device in 10 mm MES/Tris buffer, pH 6.9 containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 0.5 ml of the homogenate were incubated with 3S-2,3-[14C]oxidosqualene (5000 cpm, 25 μm) in the presence of Tween 80 (0.2 mg/ml) and Triton X-100 (1 mg/ml) in 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.9, and 0.2 mm EDTA for 30 min at 30 °C under vigorous shaking in a water bath. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 15% KOH in methanol, and lipids were saponified at 80 °C for 30 min. The nonsaponifiable lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml of light petroleum and separated on silica gel plates using dichloromethane as developing solvent. Radioactivity in 2,3-oxidosqualene and lanosterol was counted using a System Scanner (Packard). The amount of product formed was used for the calculation of the enzyme activity. Liquid β-Galactosidase Assays—LacZ assays were performed as described in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (BD Biosciences Clontech) using the substrate, CPRG. Briefly, five independent colonies from a single strain were inoculated in minimal medium containing the appropriate amino acids and grown to exponential phase (A600 ∼ 0.5–0.8). Cells were pelleted from 1.5 ml of the growing culture and resuspended in 300 μl of buffer 1 (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 containing 150 mm NaCl, 4.5 μm l-aspartate (hemimagnesium salt), 2.0 g of bovine serum albumin, and 100 μl of Tween 20). 100 μl of cells in buffer 1 were then subjected to three rounds of freeze/thawing using a dry ice/ethanol water bath. 700 μl of buffer 2 (20 ml of buffer 1 containing 27.1 mg of CPRG) were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed until color development became visible. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 3.0 mm ZnCl2. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and β-galactosidase activity was measured at A578 using the resulting supernatant. Miller units were calculated as described (46Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The Miller units represented are the average values of five independent experiments. mRNA Expression Analysis—Cells were grown to exponential phase at 30 °C in YEPD. Total RNA was extracted from 3 × 107 cells using glass beads, SDS and buffered-saturated hot phenol. Total RNA was denatured in formaldehyde-SSPE (10 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.18 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) for 15 min at 65 °C. 20 μg of denatured RNA was applied to a nylon membrane using a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed in SSPE, UV crosslinked and hybridized to gel-purified PCR products that were obtained using pfu polymerase. The hybridization buffer consisted of SSPE containing Denhardt's solution. Post-hybridization, membranes were washed several times with SSPE containing 0.1% SDS. Hybridization and all washes were performed at 65 °C. PCR products were [32Pi] radio-labeled by random priming (Takara, Madison, WI). The level of U2 mRNA expression was used as a loading control. ERG gene expression levels were determined by autoradiography (Kodak XAR5)"

In OCs formed by the major σ70-RNAP, the stabilizing role of the β′-jaw is not restricted to any particular melted DNA segment. In contrast, in OCs formed by the major variant σ54-RNAP, the β′-jaw and a conserved σ54 regulatory domain co-operate to stabilize the melted DNA segment immediately upstream of the transcription start site.

The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) 3The abbreviations used are:RNAPDNA-dependent RNA polymeraseAAAATPases associated with various cellular activitiesgp2gene protein 2PspFphage shock protein F is central to all steps of transcription, the most regulated stage of gene expression. The core enzymes of multisubunit RNAPs from bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes display striking structural similarity to each other. For promoter-specific and regulated transcription to occur, the RNAP core needs to associate with auxiliary transcription initiation factors. In bacteria, RNAP core (subunit composition: α2ββ′ω, E) associates with a sigma (σ) subunit to form an RNAP holoenzyme (subunit composition: α2ββ′ωσ, Eσ), which is capable of promoter-specific transcription initiation. The major type of bacterial RNAP holoenzyme contains a σ subunit belonging to the σ70-class. The major variant bacterial RNAP holoenzyme contains an unrelated σ subunit, σ54, which is the sole representative of the σ54-class. The processes of transcription initiation by Eσ70 and Eσ54 are mechanistically distinct (1Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Specific transcription initiation requires that both types of Eσs bind to their respective promoters to form a closed complex. In the case of holoenzymes containing σ70-class σ subunits, the closed complex usually spontaneously isomerizes to form a transcription-competent open complex, in which the DNA strands are separated and placed in the catalytic cleft of the RNAP. In contrast, RNAP holoenzyme containing σ54 relies on specialized activator proteins that belong to the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) family to convert the closed complex to the open complex. The AAA activator binds to enhancer-like DNA sequences located upstream of Eσ54 promoters and upon ATP hydrolysis promotes open complex formation (2Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A class of mutant σ54 exists called activator-bypass σ54, which do not require activation to form open complexes in vitro (2Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). DNA-dependent RNA polymerase ATPases associated with various cellular activities gene protein 2 phage shock protein F In both types of bacterial RNAPs, transcription-competent open complex formation is accompanied by several conformational changes in the σ subunit and structurally conserved mobile modules of the core RNAP (β-lobes, β-flap, β′-clamp, and the β′-jaw) (3Nechaev S.

Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). These conformational changes trigger DNA strand separation and/or accommodate the separated strands of the promoter DNA within the catalytic cleft of the RNAP. In a model of the transcription elongation complex formed by the Escherichia coli RNAP, the double-stranded DNA downstream of the catalytic center is positioned in a trough formed by the β′-jaw and the β′-clamp modules (7Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Nudler E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 2000; 289: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The E. coli RNAP containing a deletion in the β′-jaw (Δ1149–1190; Fig. 1A) forms unstable Eσ70 open complexes, although the property is evident only on some σ70-dependent promoters (8Ederth J. Artsimovitch I. Isaksson L.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37456-37463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The β′-jaw is required for several other transcription-related activities including transcriptional pausing, replication of ColEI-type plasmids, and bacteriophage M13 minus-strand DNA synthesis (8Ederth J.

A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The β′-jaw is also bound by the T7 bacteriophage gp2 protein, a strong inhibitor of σ70-dependent transcription from most promoters (10Nechaev S. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Wigneshweraraj S.R. Burrows P.C. Nechaev S. Zenkin N. Severinov K. Buck M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The bacterial β′-jaw is the structural homologue of the RPB1 jawlobe of the eukaryotic RNAPII and its role in transcription has not been clearly determined in either RNAPs. In the bacterial RNAP, the role of the β′-jaw in σ binding, closed complex formation, and in steps leading to open complex formation have not been established. How the deletion of the β′-jaw affects open complex stability is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of the β′-jaw in open complex formation by three forms of the bacterial RNAP: Eσ54, activator-bypass Eσ54, and Eσ70. The results of this study provide insights into how DNA opening and open complex formation by the two mechanistically distinct types of the bacterial RNAP might occur; and provides one example of how regulated communication between the mobile modules of the RNAP and a functional domain of the σ subunit is required to establish the transcription proficient open complex. Proteins and Plasmids—Wild-type E. coli RNAP was purchased from Epicenter Technology (Madison, WI). E. coli RNAP deleted for β′ residues 1149–1190 was purified as described (12Kashlev M. Nudler E.

To ascertain that equal quantities of wild-type and mutant core RNAP are used in the reactions, samples of each RNAP preparation were checked on a SDS-PAGE gel. Wild-type and mutant σ54 and PspF-(1–275) were purified as described (13Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Bordes P. Jones S. Cannon W. Severinov K. Buck M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activation-defective mutant PspF-(1–275) harbored the T86A mutation and was purified and characterized as described (14Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). σ54 containing a carboxyl-terminal RRASV tag (to label with [32P]ATP using heart-muscle kinase) was used to generate 32P-labeled σ54. Briefly, 2 μg of σ54-RRASV was labeled by using 50 μCi (5,000 Ci/mmol) of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 unit of heart-muscle kinase for 10 min at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2,4mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 10 μl. Aliquots of labeled protein were stored at –70 °C and used only once after thawing. The plasmids for the in vitro transcription assays were constructed by cloning of PCR fragments containing the Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH, E. coli glnHp2, pspA, and pspG promoter sequence into pTE103 (13Wigneshweraraj S.R.

Native Gel Mobility Assay—All binding reactions (10 μl) were conducted in STA buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 8 mm Mg-acetate, 10 mm KCl, and 3.5% (w/v) PEG 6000) at 37 °C and are described in Ref. 13Wigneshweraraj S.R.

Mutant and wild-type Eσ54 was reconstituted using 100 nm core RNAP and 1 μm σ54 (unless otherwise stated in the figure legends). Reactions containing [32P]σ54 also contained 5 μg/μlof α-lactoalbumin. The promoter probes used in the native gel mobility assay (at a final concentration of 10 nm) were made as described (13Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Bordes P. Jones S. Cannon W. Severinov K. Buck M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and either 5′-labeled with 32P or 5′-tagged with fluorescein. PspF-(1–275) was present (where indicated) at a final concentration of 5 μm. The activator interaction assays were conducted as described (15Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All reactions were separated on a 4.5 (w/v) native gel that was run for 80 min at 60 V. The gels were analyzed, and the complexes were quantified using a FLA-5000 PhosphorImager Fluorescent Image Analyzer. All native gel mobility assays were repeated at least twice, and the values shown in the figures represent an average of these replicates with an error range of ±5%. In Vitro Transcription Assays—Single and multiple round transcription reactions from plasmid-based templates (10 nm final concentration) were conducted exactly as described (13Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Bordes P. Jones S. Cannon W. Severinov K. Buck M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Where indicated, reactions were challenged with 100 μg/ml of heparin for between 1 and 120 min (exact time specified in the figures and legends). Transcription elongation was initiated by adding a mixture containing 1 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, 0.05 mm UTP, and 3 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. The reactions were separated on a 6% denaturing gel and analyzed and quantified as above. For abortive transcription reactions, open complexes were formed on plasmid-based or linear templates and, where indicated, challenged with heparin, exactly as described above. For the abortive synthesis of a 4-nucleotide transcript (UGGG) from the S. meliloti nifH promoter, a mixture containing 0.5 mm initiating dinucleotide UpG, 4 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 0.5 μm GTP was added for 20 min. For the abortive synthesis of a 3-nucleotide transcript (AAU) from the lacUV5 promoter, a mixture containing 0.5 mm ApA, 4 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 0.5 μm UTP was added for 20 min. The reactions were separated on a 20% denaturing gel and quantified as above. All transcription assays were repeated at least three times, and the values shown in the figures represent an average of these replicates with an error range of ±5–8%. DNase I and KMnO4 Footprinting Assays—DNase I and KMnO4 footprinting assays on closed and open complexes (formed as described above) were conducted as described (16Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Ishihama A. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29728-29743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking Assays—These were conducted as described (17Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Removing β′ Residues 1149–1190 Affects the Ability of Eσ54 to Form Closed Promoter Complexes—A semi-quantitative native gel assay was used to test the ability of Δ1149–1190E to bind radioactively labeled σ54, [32P]σ54. A fixed amount of [32P]σ54 was combined with increasing amounts of RNAP core, and reaction products were separated by native PAGE and revealed by autoradiography (Fig. 2A). The free [32P]σ54 migrates as a diffused, high mobility band (Fig. 2A, lane 1), whereas E[32P]σ54 migrates as a sharp, low mobility band (Fig. 2A, lane 4). At [32P]σ54:E ratio of 1:1, Δ1149–1190E formed ∼50% less holoenzyme than the wild-type RNAP core (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 10). A 3-fold excess of Δ1149–1190E over [32P]σ54 was required to shift all [32P]σ54 to Δ1149–1190E[32P]σ54 (Fig. 2A, lane 12). Thus, it appears that removing β′ residues 1149–1190 leads to a moderate defect in σ54 binding to the core RNAP. Based on the similar mobilities of the mutant and wild-type Eσ54 complexes on native gels (Fig. 2, A–C), we infer that deletion of β′ residues 1149–1190 has no strong effect on the overall conformation of Eσ54. In all the experiments described below, we used saturating amounts of σ54 over the mutant and wild-type RNAP core to ensure that all core RNAP is converted into the holoenzyme. The ability of Δ1149–1190Eσ54 to form closed promoter complexes was tested using the well characterized S. meliloti nifH promoter (18Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A fixed amount of 32P-labeled linear promoter probe was incubated with increasing amounts of Eσ54 and the reaction products were separated by native PAGE. As evident from Fig. 2B, compared with WTEσ54, Δ1149–1190Eσ54 was ∼2-fold less active in closed complex formation. Because specific promoter DNA contacts in the closed complex appear to be made exclusively by σ54 (17Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Cannon W. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1995; 23: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we suggest that removal of β′ residues 1149–1190 affects, directly or indirectly, DNA-interacting domains of σ54 within Eσ54 thus explaining the reduced promoter binding by Δ1149–1190Eσ54. This view is supported by functional data that showed that deletion of the amino-terminal, promoter DNA-proximal region I of σ54 changes the conformation of the β′-jaw (11Wigneshweraraj S.R. Burrows P.C. Nechaev S. Zenkin N. Severinov K. Buck M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We incubated the Δ1149–1190Eσ54 closed complex with an AAA activator in the presence of an ATP hydrolysis transition state analogue, ADP-AlFx (15Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), to determine whether the Δ1149–1190 Eσ54 closed complex is able to interact with the activator. For experimental simplicity, a DNA-binding mutant of the E. coli AAA activator, phage shock protein F (PspF), was used. The mutant, PspF-(1–275), is able to interact with and activate the Eσ54 closed complex from solution (14Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of Eσ54 to DNA was adjusted so that approximately equal amounts of Eσ54 closed complexes were formed in reactions containing either the mutant or wild-type RNAP (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). As can be seen, in the presence of ADP-AlFx, PspF-(1–275) binds equally well to both the mutant and the wild-type closed complexes (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). We conclude that removal of β′ residues 1149–1190 does not grossly change the ability of the mutant closed complex to interact with the AAA activator. Δ1149–1190Eσ54 Fails to Form Stable Open Complexes—The ability of Δ1149–1190Eσ54 to form open complexes and to initiate transcript synthesis from the S. meliloti nifH promoter was tested using an abortive transcription assay. The sequence of the nifH promoter around the transcription start site is TGGG (from –1 to +3, non-template strand). In the presence of the UpG dinucleotide, radioactive GTP, and dATP (the latter is needed for the ATPase activity of the AAA activator), Eσ54 reiteratively synthesizes the tetranucleotide UGGG. The UGGG transcript (and therefore the transcriptionally proficient open complex) is formed only when PspF-(1–275) and dATP are added to reactions containing the Eσ54 closed complex (Fig. 3A, lane 6). When the polyanion heparin, a DNA competitor, is added to reactions after open complex formation, but prior to the addition of transcription substrates, the abortive transcription assay can be used to measure the stability of open complexes by determining the amount of transcript synthesized after incubation with heparin. With WTEσ54, the amount of transcript synthesized gradually decreases with time, reflecting dissociation of the open complex in the presence of heparin (Fig. 3B). When the experiment is repeated with Δ1149–1190Eσ54, the amount of synthesized transcripts decreases much more rapidly (Fig. 3B). For example, after a 20-min incubation with heparin, ∼12-fold fewer transcripts were synthesized by the mutant than by the wild-type RNAP (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Control assays established that the decrease in the amount of transcripts synthesized in reactions containing Δ1149–1190Eσ54 was not because of inactivation of the mutant RNAP during the assay (data not shown). The instability of the Δ1149–1190Eσ54 open complex upon addition of heparin may simply reflect a more rapid (compared with reactions containing WTEσ54) dissociation of the mutant core RNAP from σ54. To prove that this is not the case, we measured the mutant and wild-type open complex stabilities in the absence of heparin (Fig. 3C). To prevent PspF-(1–275) from repeatedly converting closed complexes to open complexes, an excess of an activation-defective PspF-(1–275) mutant was added to the reaction after the initial round of open complex formation (see schematic in Fig. 3C). Because PspF-(1–275) needs to oligomerize to convert Eσ54 closed complexes to open complexes (1Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Keetch C.A. Robinson C.V. Buck M. Zhang X. Science. 2005; 307: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the activation-defective mutant PspF-(1–275) inactivates activation-proficient PspF-(1–275) by forming activation-defective hetero-oligomers. Control experiments confirmed that PspF-(1–275) activity is completely abolished in the presence of a ∼6-fold excess of the activation-defective mutant PspF-(1–275) (data not shown). As can be seen from Fig. 3C, Δ1149–1190Eσ54 open complexes are less stable than WTEσ54 open complexes even in the absence of heparin. Transcription assays were repeated under conditions that allowed a single-round synthesis of a full-length transcript from the nifH promoter. As shown in Fig. 3D, and consistent with the results of the abortive transcription assays (Fig. 3B), Δ1149–1190Eσ54 produced ∼9-fold less full-length transcript than WTEσ54 after a 20-min incubation with heparin (Fig. 3D, lanes 1 and 5). In the absence of heparin, a condition when multiple rounds of transcription initiation can occur, Δ1149–1190Eσ54 produced ∼1.5-fold less full-length transcripts than WTEσ54 (Fig. 3D, lanes 9 and 13). A similar trend was observed on three other σ54-dependent promoters (E. coli glnHp2, pspA, and pspG) (Fig. 3D). The instability of Δ1149–1190Eσ54 open complexes was most pronounced in reactions containing the pspG promoter (Fig. 3D, lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16). Overall, we conclude that Δ1149–1190Eσ54 open complexes, once formed, are clearly much less stable than wild-type open complexes. Wild-type and Mutant Promoter Complexes are Indistinguishable—DNase I footprinting allows to distinguish between closed and open complexes at the nifH promoter, because DNA is protected from DNase I digestion downstream of the transcription start site only in open complexes (5Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Severinov K. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The DNase I footprints of closed and open complexes formed by the mutant and wild-type Eσ54 are indistinguishable on the non-template (Fig. 4A) and template (data not shown) DNA strands. We used KMnO4 probing to study the extent of DNA opening within the wild-type and mutant open complexes on the E. coli glnHp2 promoter. Unlike the S. meliloti nifH promoter, E. coli glnHp2 promoter contains a thymine-rich sequence that can be detected by the probing agent (Fig. 4B). As can be seen from Fig. 4B, the extent of DNA opening in the mutant and wild-type open complexes is the same (compare lanes 4 and 6). Further analysis of mutant and wild-type closed and open complexes by a range of other footprinting reagents, such as S1 nuclease (which also reports DNA opening) and ortho-copper phenanthroline (which reports a distortion near the start site-proximal consensus promoter element char-acteristic of Eσ54 closed complexes; (21Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) also did not reveal any detectable differences (data not shown). We used photoactive S. meliloti nifH promoter probes to further characterize mutant and wild-type open complexes. The photoactive probes were made by derivatizing a single, specifically placed phosphorothioate with p-azidophenacyl bromide. Upon UV irradiation, the aryl azide group of p-azidophenacyl bromide reacts with protein moieties that are within ∼12 Å from its attachment site on the DNA, resulting in the formation of covalently cross-linked protein-DNA complexes (17Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Mayer A.N. Barany F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because the p-azidophenacyl bromide-modified DNA strand also contains a [32P]phosphate at its 5′ end, protein-DNA cross-links can be easily detected after fractionation of reaction products by SDS-PAGE. Derivatization of several positions of the nifH promoter (both in the template and non-template strand; Fig. 4C) led to good yields of protein-DNA cross-links within the open complex. 4P. C. Burrows, S. R. Wigneshweraraj, and M. Buck, manuscript in preparation. Based on the mobilities of non-cross-linked β, β′, and σ subunits on a SDS-PAGE gel, the faster migrating band was identified as σ54 and the slower migrating band(s) were identified as cross-linked β/β′ (17Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 4P. C. Burrows, S. R. Wigneshweraraj, and M. Buck, manuscript in preparation. Comparisons of mutant and wild-type open complex patterns revealed no differences either in the number or intensity of cross-linked species. Overall, the results from DNase I and KMnO4 footprinting and the photocross-linking experiments suggest that the inherent instability of Δ1149–1190Eσ54 open complexes is not because of a lack of a direct specific interaction between β′ residues 1149–1190 and promoter DNA sequences within the open complex. Pre-opening Promoter DNA Stabilizes Δ1149–1190Eσ54 Open Complexes— Because Δ1149–1190Eσ54 forms open complexes as efficiently as WTEσ54 (Fig. 4B), the instability of Δ1149–1190Eσ54 open complexes could be because of the inability of the Δ1149–1190Eσ54 to maintain DNA strand separation within the open complex. To test this idea, we performed abortive transcription assays using a heteroduplex variant of the S. meliloti nifH promoter as a template. Such heteroduplex promoter probes are faithful templates for studying the transcription initiation process by the bacterial RNAP (23Tsujikawa L. Tsodikov O.V. de Haseth P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3493-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The S. meliloti nifH heteroduplex promoter probe used here contains a non-complementary segment between positions –10 and –1 and thus mimics the conformation of promoter DNA within the open complex (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Wedel A. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the presence of the activator, WTEσ54 forms heparin-resistant complexes on the –10 to –1 heteroduplex promoter probe, and thus likely adopts a conformation that is similar to that formed on homoduplex templates after the normal DNA opening process is completed (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Wedel A. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast to results with homoduplex promoter DNA (both on supercoiled plasmid and a linear DNA fragment; Fig. 3B and data not shown), the Δ1149–1190 mutant and WTEσ54 produced equal amounts of abortive transcripts from the heteroduplex promoter probe, even after preincubation with heparin for more than 1 h (Fig. 5). Thus, destabilization of promoter complexes caused by deletion of the β′-jaw is suppressed by pre-opening of promoter DNA (compare Figs. 3B and 5). It therefore appears that β′ residues 1149–1190 contribute to stable maintenance of DNA in the “opened” conformation once DNA opening per se has been completed. The melting of promoter DNA during open complex formation is a multistep process (26Sclavi B. Zaychikov E. Rogozina A. Walther F. Buckle M. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine which step en route to the transcription-competent open complex requires β′ residues 1149–1190, we performed abortive transcription assays using nifH promoter probes containing non-complementary segments between positions –10 and –6, –5 and –1, and –3 and –1. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, Δ1149–1190Eσ54 and WTEσ54 synthesized approximately equal amounts of abortive transcripts from all three heteroduplex promoter probes in the absence of heparin. However, when complexes were incubated with heparin for 5 min after activation but prior to the addition of transcription substrates, Δ1149–1190Eσ54 synthesized ∼4 times less abortive transcripts from the –10 to –6 heteroduplex probe than did WTEσ54. In contrast, the amounts of abortive transcripts synthesized by Δ1149–1190Eσ54 from promoter probes containing heteroduplexes from –5 to –1 and from –3 to –1 were comparable with the amounts synthesized by WTEσ54 even in the presence of heparin (Fig. 6, A and B). We next used promoters containing non-complementary segments between promoter positions –3 and –2, –2 and –1, and at –1 as templates in the abortive transcription assays, to further localize promoter positions that need to be pre-opened to allow heparin-resistant open complex formation by Δ1149–1190Eσ54. As shown in Fig. 6C, pre-opening of any promoter position between –3 and –1 allows Δ1149–1190Eσ54 to form stable open complexes. Thus, β′ residues 1149–1190 are needed to allow Eσ54 to stably maintain DNA strand separation between positions –3 and –1. Pre-opening of Promoter DNA Increases the Stability of Open Complexes Formed by Δ1149–1190Eσ70—The Δ1149–1190 RNAP forms unstable open complexes on some σ70-dependent promoters, such as the lacUV5 promoter (8Ederth J. Artsimovitch I. Isaksson L.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37456-37463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on the results with σ54 (above), we investigated whether pre-opening of the –1 position increases the stability of open complexes formed by Δ1149–1190Eσ70. As shown in Fig. 6D, in the absence of heparin, the wild-type and the mutant Eσ70 synthesized approximately equal amounts of abortive transcripts from the homoduplex lacUV5 promoter probe. However, when the open complexes were incubated with heparin for 5 min, Δ1149–1190Eσ70 synthesized ∼5 times"
