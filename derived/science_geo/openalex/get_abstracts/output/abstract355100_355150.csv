https://openalex.org/W2107555182,"Deep avian evolutionary relationships have been difficult to resolve as a result of a putative explosive radiation. Our study examined approximately 32 kilobases of aligned nuclear DNA sequences from 19 independent loci for 169 species, representing all major extant groups, and recovered a robust phylogeny from a genome-wide signal supported by multiple analytical methods. We documented well-supported, previously unrecognized interordinal relationships (such as a sister relationship between passerines and parrots) and corroborated previously contentious groupings (such as flamingos and grebes). Our conclusions challenge current classifications and alter our understanding of trait evolution; for example, some diurnal birds evolved from nocturnal ancestors. Our results provide a valuable resource for phylogenetic and comparative studies in birds."
https://openalex.org/W1979348491,"Spatial fingerprints of climate change on biotic communities are usually associated with changes in the distribution of species at their latitudinal or altitudinal extremes. By comparing the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species between 1905 and 1985 and 1986 and 2005 along the entire elevation range (0 to 2600 meters above sea level) in west Europe, we show that climate warming has resulted in a significant upward shift in species optimum elevation averaging 29 meters per decade. The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats and for grassy species, which are characterized by faster population turnover. Our study shows that climate change affects the spatial core of the distributional range of plant species, in addition to their distributional margins, as previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2009658139,"On nanotextured noble-metal surfaces, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is observed, where Raman scattering is enhanced by a factor, Ḡ , that is frequently about one million, but underlying the factor Ḡ is a broad distribution of local enhancement factors, η. We have measured this distribution for benzenethiolate molecules on a 330-nanometer silver-coated nanosphere lattice using incident light of wavelength 532 nanometers. A series of laser pulses with increasing electric fields burned away molecules at sites with progressively decreasing electromagnetic enhancement factors. The enhancement distribution P (η) d η was found to be a power law proportional to (η) –1.75 , with minimum and maximum values of 2.8 × 10 4 and 4.1 × 10 10 , respectively. The hottest sites (η &gt;10 9 ) account for just 63 in 1,000,000 of the total but contribute 24% to the overall SERS intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2001674944,"As a result of the redundancy of the genetic code, adjacent pairs of amino acids can be encoded by as many as 36 different pairs of synonymous codons. A species-specific “codon pair bias” provides that some synonymous codon pairs are used more or less frequently than statistically predicted. We synthesized de novo large DNA molecules using hundreds of over-or underrepresented synonymous codon pairs to encode the poliovirus capsid protein. Underrepresented codon pairs caused decreased rates of protein translation, and polioviruses containing such amino acid–independent changes were attenuated in mice. Polioviruses thus customized were used to immunize mice and provided protective immunity after challenge. This “death by a thousand cuts” strategy could be generally applicable to attenuating many kinds of viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2080152736,"Most homeodomains are unique within a genome, yet many are highly conserved across vast evolutionary distances, implying strong selection on their precise DNA-binding specificities. We determined the binding preferences of the majority (168) of mouse homeodomains to all possible 8-base sequences, revealing rich and complex patterns of sequence specificity and showing that there are at least 65 distinct homeodomain DNA-binding activities. We developed a computational system that successfully predicts binding sites for homeodomain proteins as distant from mouse as Drosophila and C. elegans, and we infer full 8-mer binding profiles for the majority of known animal homeodomains. Our results provide an unprecedented level of resolution in the analysis of this simple domain structure and suggest that variation in sequence recognition may be a factor in its functional diversity and evolutionary success."
https://openalex.org/W2095116945,"The synthesis of ordered mesoporous metal composites and ordered mesoporous metals is a challenge because metals have high surface energies that favor low surface areas. We present results from the self-assembly of block copolymers with ligand-stabilized platinum nanoparticles, leading to lamellar CCM-Pt-4 and inverse hexagonal (CCM-Pt-6) hybrid mesostructures with high nanoparticle loadings. Pyrolysis of the CCM-Pt-6 hybrid produces an ordered mesoporous platinum-carbon nanocomposite with open and large pores (>/=10 nanometers). Removal of the carbon leads to ordered porous platinum mesostructures. The platinum-carbon nanocomposite has very high electrical conductivity (400 siemens per centimeter) for an ordered mesoporous material fabricated from block copolymer self-assembly."

The analysis of all 84 independent homeodomains from D. melanogaster reveals the breadth of DNA sequences that can be specified by this recognition motif. The majority of these factors can be organized into 11 different specificity groups, where the preferred recognition sequence between these groups can differ at up to four of the six core recognition positions. Analysis of the recognition motifs within these groups led to a catalog of common specificity determinants that may cooperate or compete to define the binding site preference. With these recognition principles, a homeodomain can be reengineered to create factors where its specificity is altered at the majority of recognition positions. This resource also allows prediction of homeodomain specificities from other organisms, which is demonstrated by the prediction and analysis of human homeodomain specificities.

This resource also allows prediction of homeodomain specificities from other organisms, which is demonstrated by the prediction and analysis of human homeodomain specificities. In humans, as well as many other metazoans, homeodomains comprise the second largest class of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) (Tupler et al., 2001Tupler R. Perini G. Green M.R. Expressing the human genome.Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Homeotic genes were first identified in D. melanogaster because their altered activity resulted in dramatic phenotypes such as the formation of an additional pair of wings (Lewis, 1978Lewis E.B. A gene complex controlling segmentation in Drosophila.Nature. 1978; 276: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). Cloning of these genes led to the landmark observation that they contain a common sequence motif that encodes a DNA-binding domain (Gehring et al., 1994aGehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Homeodomain proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have identified a large number of additional homeodomain proteins in Drosophila that regulate diverse developmental processes. A remarkable number of these genes have mammalian homologs with conserved developmental functions and biochemical properties (Banerjee-Basu and Baxevanis, 2001Banerjee-Basu S. Baxevanis A.D.

Biol. 1996; 6: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The homeodomain consists of approximately 60 amino acids that fold into a stable three-helix bundle preceded by a flexible N-terminal arm. Interactions with a 5 to 7 bp DNA binding site are formed by positioning of a single “recognition” helix in the major groove and the N-terminal arm in the minor groove (Figures 1A and 1B). Despite a common DNA-binding architecture, there is significant variation in the sequence composition within the homeodomain family; for example the two superclasses of homeodomains, denoted as typical and atypical (Banerjee-Basu and Baxevanis, 2001Banerjee-Basu S.

This conserved binding geometry allows differences in amino acid sequence and DNA-binding specificity for various homeodomains to be interpreted within a common structural framework. Residues at positions 2, 3, and 5–8 on the N-terminal arm, as well as residues at positions 47, 50, 51, 54, and 55 on the recognition helix, can all contribute to DNA-binding specificity (Ades and Sauer, 1995Ades S.E.

How specific sequence variations between homeodomains lead to different recognition preferences has been defined in several cases. Seminal experiments demonstrated that Lys50 promotes recognition of TAATCC by the Bicoid class of homeodomains instead of the TAAT(T/G)(A/G) recognized by the Gln50-containing Antennapedia (Antp) and Engrailed (En) classes (Hanes and Brent, 1989Hanes S.D.

A single amino acid can determine the DNA binding specificity of homeodomain proteins.Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Beachy and colleagues mapped differences in binding site position 2 specificity for the posterior HOX protein Abd-B (TTATGG) and more anterior HOX family members (TAATGG) to amino acids at positions 3, 6, and 7 in the N-terminal arm (Ekker et al., 1994Ekker S.C.

The degree of variation in DNA sequence recognition among four Drosophila homeotic proteins.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Interestingly, substitutions at amino acids that overlap with these positions (6–8) are sufficient to switch the specificity of an NK-2 type homeodomain (CAAGTG) to the specificity of an Antp-type homeodomain (TAAGTG) at the neighboring base, binding site position 1 (Damante et al., 1996Damante G. Pellizzari L. Esposito G. Fogolari F. Viglino P. Fabbro D. Tell G. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. A molecular code dictates sequence-specific DNA recognition by homeodomains.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This complexity is not limited to the N-terminal arm, because residues at different amino acid positions, such as 47 and 54, can potentially contact the same base pair (Fraenkel et al., 1998Fraenkel E. Rould M.A. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Engrailed homeodomain-DNA complex at 2.2 A resolution: A detailed view of the interface and comparison with other engrailed structures.J. Mol.

Crystal structure of a MATalpha2 homeodomain-operator complex suggests a general model for homeodomain-DNA interactions.Cell. 1991; 67: 517-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This diversity in potential recognition contacts has hindered efforts to globally reengineer homeodomain specificity (Mathias et al., 2001Mathias J.R. Zhong H. Jin Y. Vershon A.K. Altering the DNA-binding specificity of the yeast Matalpha 2 homeodomain protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32696-32703Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Consequently, a comprehensive description of the determinants of homeodomain DNA-binding specificity remains an important goal. A complete survey of DNA-binding specificity on a large family of DNA-binding domains has not been previously attempted. We have recently described a bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) system that allows the specificities of a DNA-binding domain to be rapidly characterized with sufficient ease that multiple factors can be assayed in parallel (Meng et al., 2005Meng X. Brodsky M.H. Wolfe S.A. A bacterial one-hybrid system for determining the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Meng and Wolfe, 2006Meng X. Wolfe S.A. Identifying DNA sequences recognized by a transcription factor using a bacterial one-hybrid system.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 30-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using this system, we analyze the DNA-binding specificities for all 84 homeodomains in D. melanogaster that are not associated with an additional DNA-binding domain, as well as 16 mutant homeodomains with changes in residues that contribute to DNA recognition. Our analysis reveals a diverse array of DNA-binding specificities with a minimum of seventeen unique specificities in D. melanogaster, of which the majority of homeodomains can be clustered into 11 specificity groups. Members of a given specificity group typically share common recognition residues. Combining this data with previous structural and biochemical work on the homeodomain family, we propose and evaluate a detailed set of recognition determinants for homeodomains and use this information to broadly and accurately predict the specificities of homeodomains in the human genome. We have modified our B1H system to rapidly characterize the DNA-binding specificity of a homeodomain (Meng et al., 2005Meng X. Brodsky M.H. Wolfe S.A. A bacterial one-hybrid system for determining the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Noyes et al., 2008Noyes M.B. Meng X. Wakabayashi A. Sinha S. Brodsky M.H. Wolfe S.A. A systematic characterization of factors that regulate Drosophila segmentation via a bacterial one-hybrid system.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2547-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Homedomains are expressed as fusions to both the omega subunit of RNA polymerase (Dove and Hochschild, 1998Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Conversion of the omega subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase into a transcriptional activator or an activation target.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which provides better dynamic range than fusions to alpha (data not shown), and to zinc fingers 1 and 2 of the protein Zif268 (Zif12; Figure 1D). Because zinc finger-homeodomain chimeras exhibit increased affinity and specificity (Pomerantz et al., 1995Pomerantz J.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Structure-based design of transcription factors.Science. 1995; 267: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), even homeodomains with relatively low DNA-binding activity can be readily characterized. A library with ten randomized base pairs adjacent to a Zif12 binding site (ZF10) was used to isolate recognition sequences that are complementary to the homeodomain in this selection system (Figure 1D and Figure S1 available online). This system was used to determine DNA-binding specificities for all 84 of the homeodomains in the D. melanogaster genome that are not associated with an auxiliary DNA-binding domain (Figure S2 and Table S1). These homeodomains cluster into previously described families (Banerjee-Basu and Baxevanis, 2001Banerjee-Basu S. Baxevanis A.D. Molecular evolution of the homeodomain family of transcription factors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3258-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Mukherjee and Burglin, 2007Mukherjee K. Burglin T.R. Comprehensive analysis of animal TALE homeobox genes: New conserved motifs and cases of accelerated evolution.J. Mol. Evol. 2007; 65: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) on the basis of their amino acid similarity (Figure S3), where approximately 85% of these homeodomains are in the “typical” superclass. Present in the collection of Drosophila homeodomains are diverse sets of amino acids at DNA-recognition positions, which suggests that a range of DNA-binding specificities is possible (Figure 1C). One notable exception is Asn at position 51 of the recognition helix, which is present in all but one of these homeodomains. Comparisons to earlier studies confirm that the motifs obtained by the B1H method accurately reflect the DNA-binding specificities of homeodomains. For example, all of our specificities for the homeotic (HOX) gene family share a common consensus, T(A/T)AT(T/G)(A/G) (Figure S4), consistent with previous studies (Pearson et al., 2005Pearson J.C. Lemons D. McGinnis W. Modulating Hox gene functions during animal body patterning.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Furthermore, subtle differences in the specificity of Ubx, Dfd, and Abd-B that were previously observed in biochemical assays (Ekker et al., 1994Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. The degree of variation in DNA sequence recognition among four Drosophila homeotic proteins.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Ekker et al., 1992Ekker S.C. von Kessler D.P. Beachy P.A. Differential DNA sequence recognition is a determinant of specificity in homeotic gene action.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4059-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) are also present in our data, such as the preference of Abd-B for Thy over Ade at binding site position 2. Thus, even subtle differences in homeodomain specificity can be captured by the B1H analysis. The accuracy of our B1H-generated data was further validated by competition gel mobility shift assays performed for nine factors that display different specificities (Figure S5). Remarkable diversity exists in the B1H-determined DNA-binding specificities for the entire set of homeodomains (Figure S2). The conservation of Asn51, which specifies Ade at binding site position 3 (Fraenkel et al., 1998Fraenkel E. Rould M.A. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Engrailed homeodomain-DNA complex at 2.2 A resolution: A detailed view of the interface and comparison with other engrailed structures.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Wolberger et al., 1991Wolberger C. Vershon A.K. Liu B. Johnson A.D. Pabo C.O. Crystal structure of a MATalpha2 homeodomain-operator complex suggests a general model for homeodomain-DNA interactions.Cell. 1991; 67: 517-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), in combination with our ability to infer the orientation of each homeodomain on its binding site (Figure S6 and Table S2), provides a basis for aligning all of these recognition sequences. With this master alignment (Table S3), hierarchical clustering of the D. melanogaster homeodomains was performed on the basis of the similarity of their DNA-binding specificities (Figure 2A). The majority of these factors can be organized into 11 different specificity groups, and the average specificity of these groups was determined for the purposes of comparison (Figure 2). In this analysis, we used only the core 6 bp element recognized by these factors. Consistent with the idea that many homeodomain proteins prefer similar TAAT-related motifs, slightly more than half (43) of the homeodomains fall into the Antp or En specificity groups. There are also a number of specificity groups, such as the Abd-B and NK-1 group, that differ in sequence preference from the Antp or En groups at only one or two positions. However, other groups, such as the TGIF-Exd group, differ at four positions relative to the Antp or En groups. Outside of these specificity groupings are six factors that exhibit unique specificities. The observed diversity of specificities reveals the adaptability of the homeodomain architecture for the recognition of a variety of DNA sequences. Clustering of the D. melanogaster homeodomains by specificity has revealed that homeodomains that share strong amino acid sequence similarity are not always found in the same specificity group (Figure 2C). In nine examples, two factors share strong sequence similarity but fall into different specificity groups. In eight of these comparisons, this difference can be explained by the presence of a different residue at one or more of the key DNA-recognition positions (5, 47, 50, 51, 54, and 55, see below). Pairs of factors with high overall sequence similarity, but different specificities, may represent recently diverged gene duplications where one factor has acquired new target genes. The contribution of specific residues toward binding site preference for one or more group members has been demonstrated in previous studies. Below, we use correlations between the average group recognition motifs and the amino acid distributions at key DNA-recognition positions (Figure 2B) to systematically describe the characteristics of each group that lead to differences in binding specificity. Antp and En Groups. The largest groups of homeodomains provide a reference point to describe how differences in amino acid sequence correlate with DNA-binding specificity. The Antp and En groups share similar recognition motifs and amino acid distributions at the key recognition positions. However, at binding site position 5, the En group prefers Thy, whereas the Antp group tolerates either Gua or Thy. There is a corresponding difference at amino acid position 54: Ala for the En group and Met for the Antp group. In the Antp-DNA structure, the side chain of Met54 is neighboring this base pair (Fraenkel and Pabo, 1998Fraenkel E. Pabo C.O. Comparison of X-ray and NMR structures for the Antennapedia homeodomain-DNA complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Bcd Group. Typical homeodomains utilize Lys50 to specify Cyt at binding site positions 5 and 6 through the interaction of Lys50 with the complementary Gua at these positions (Tucker-Kellogg et al., 1997Tucker-Kellogg L. Rould M.A. Chambers K.A. Ades S.E. Sauer R.T. Pabo C.O.

NK-1, Bar, and Ladybird Groups. Many of these homeodomains are members of the NK or DL homeodomain classes (Banerjee-Basu and Baxevanis, 2001Banerjee-Basu S. Baxevanis A.D. Molecular evolution of the homeodomain family of transcription factors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3258-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and generally have Thr at position 47 or 54. Compared to the Antp and En groups, the homeodomains with Thr47 have reduced specificity at binding site positions 4 and/or 5 (Figure S7). NK-2 Group. The members of this group prefer Gua at position 4 because of an interaction between Tyr54 and the complementary Cyt (Gruschus et al., 1997Gruschus J.M. Tsao D.H. Wang L.H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Interactions of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain with DNA by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: Basis of binding specificity.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5372-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Their specificities vary at binding site position 1, which correlates with differences at residues 6 and 7 of the N-terminal arm (Damante et al., 1996Damante G. Pellizzari L. Esposito G. Fogolari F. Viglino P. Fabbro D. Tell G. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. A molecular code dictates sequence-specific DNA recognition by homeodomains.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Figure S8). Abd-B Group. These factors prefer Thy over Ade at position 2. In Abd-B, this preference has been mapped to amino acid positions 3, 6, and 7 of the N-terminal arm (Ekker et al., 1994Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. The degree of variation in DNA sequence recognition among four Drosophila homeotic proteins.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); however, the variability within the N-terminal arm precludes a simple correlation of binding preference and amino acid sequence. The atypical groups generally prefer Gua at binding site position 2 and Cyt and Ade at positions 4 and 5 (Figures 2B and 3A). In CG11617, the Iroquois group, and the TGIF group, the preference for Cyt and Ade at positions 4 and 5 correlates with the presence of Arg54, consistent with the structure of MATα2 (Wolberger et al., 1991Wolberger C.

The single exception to this correlation, Onecut, contains a unique residue (Met50), which may contribute to its distinct binding preference. Likewise, with the exception of the Iroquois group, homeodomains that contain Arg55 prefer Gua at position 2, consistent with the Exd and Pbx structures (Passner et al., 1999Passner J.M. Ryoo H.D.

All members of this group (So, Six4, and Optix) display a specificity that overlaps with the recognition motif TGATAC and share identical residues at the key DNA-recognition positions (47, 50, 51, 54, and 55). Our data are consistent with a known So motif [(T/C)GATAC] (Hazbun et al., 1997Hazbun T.R. Stahura F.L. Mossing M.C.

Six3-mediated auto repression and eye development requires its interaction with members of the Groucho-related family of co-repressors.Development. 2002; 129: 2835-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is investigated in the analysis of human homeodomains described below. Iroquois Group. Our monomeric motif (ACA) reflects part of the palindromic, homodimer binding site (ACANNTGT) for a full-length mirr protein (Bilioni et al., 2005Bilioni A. Craig G. Hill C. McNeill H. Iroquois transcription factors recognize a unique motif to mediate transcriptional repression in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Homeodomains in this group have weak preferences at binding site positions 1 and 2, despite containing notable specificity determinants (Arg5 and Arg55). One striking feature of the Iroquois group is Ala at position 8 (Figure S3). In other homeodomains, a large hydrophobic residue at this position binds in a cleft formed by the homeodomain helices and appears to position the N-terminal arm over the 5′ end of the binding site (Figure 4). The effect of residue 8 on lroquois specificity was examined by introduction of an AlaPhe mutation into Caup (Figure 4D). This mutation restores, albeit incompletely, the anticipated specificity at positions 1 and 2. The incomplete transformation suggests that additional determinants also contribute to specificity at the 5′ end of the binding site (Figure S9).

https://openalex.org/W2049174326,"Detection of volatile odorants by olfactory neurons is thought to result from direct activation of seven-transmembrane odorant receptors by odor molecules. Here, we show that detection of the Drosophila pheromone, 11-cis vaccenyl acetate (cVA), is instead mediated by pheromone-induced conformational shifts in the extracellular pheromone-binding protein, LUSH. We show that LUSH undergoes a pheromone-specific conformational change that triggers the firing of pheromone-sensitive neurons. Amino acid substitutions in LUSH that are predicted to reduce or enhance the conformational shift alter sensitivity to cVA as predicted in vivo. One substitution, LUSH(D118A), produces a dominant-active LUSH protein that stimulates T1 neurons through the neuronal receptor components Or67d and SNMP in the complete absence of pheromone. Structural analysis of LUSH(D118A) reveals that it closely resembles cVA-bound LUSH. Therefore, the pheromone-binding protein is an inactive, extracellular ligand converted by pheromone molecules into an activator of pheromone-sensitive neurons and reveals a distinct paradigm for detection of odorants."
https://openalex.org/W2071595256,"Energy flow in biological structures often requires submillisecond charge transport over long molecular distances. Kinetics modeling suggests that charge-transfer rates can be greatly enhanced by multistep electron tunneling in which redox-active amino acid side chains act as intermediate donors or acceptors. We report transient optical and infrared spectroscopic experiments that quantify the extent to which an intervening tryptophan residue can facilitate electron transfer between distant metal redox centers in a mutant Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin. Cu(I) oxidation by a photoexcited Re(I)-diimine at position 124 on a histidine(124)-glycine(123)-tryptophan(122)-methionine(121) beta strand occurs in a few nanoseconds, fully two orders of magnitude faster than documented for single-step electron tunneling at a 19 angstrom donor-acceptor distance."
https://openalex.org/W2081394635,"Predicting the strain hardening properties of crystals constitutes a long-standing challenge for dislocation theory. The main difficulty resides in the integration of dislocation processes through a wide range of time and length scales, up to macroscopic dimensions. In the present multiscale approach, dislocation dynamics simulations are used to establish a dislocation-based continuum model incorporating discrete and intermittent aspects of plastic flow. This is performed through the modeling of a key quantity, the mean free path of dislocations. The model is then integrated at the scale of bulk crystals, which allows for the detailed reproduction of the complex deformation curves of face-centered cubic crystals. Because of its predictive ability, the proposed framework has a large potential for further applications."
https://openalex.org/W2069914545,"Precision metrology and quantum measurement often demand that matter be prepared in well-defined quantum states for both internal and external degrees of freedom. Laser-cooled neutral atoms localized in a deeply confining optical potential satisfy this requirement. With an appropriate choice of wavelength and polarization for the optical trap, two electronic states of an atom can experience the same trapping potential, permitting coherent control of electronic transitions independent of the atomic center-of-mass motion. Here, we review a number of recent experiments that use this approach to investigate precision quantum metrology for optical atomic clocks and coherent control of optical interactions of single atoms and photons within the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

The adenylation and condensation domains of SrfA-C associate closely to form a catalytic platform, with their active sites on the same side of the platform. The peptidyl carrier protein domain is flexibly tethered to this platform and thus can move with its substrate-loaded 4′-phosphopantetheine arm between the active site of the adenylation domain and the donor side of the condensation domain.

https://openalex.org/W2023164919,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by early hippocampal atrophy and cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition. Using TissueInfo to screen for genes preferentially expressed in the hippocampus and located in AD linkage regions, we identified a gene on 10q24.33 that we call CALHM1. We show that CALHM1 encodes a multipass transmembrane glycoprotein that controls cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and Aβ levels. CALHM1 homomultimerizes, shares strong sequence similarities with the selectivity filter of the NMDA receptor, and generates a large Ca2+ conductance across the plasma membrane. Importantly, we determined that the CALHM1 P86L polymorphism (rs2986017) is significantly associated with AD in independent case-control studies of 3404 participants (allele-specific OR = 1.44, p = 2 × 10−10).

We propose that CALHM1 encodes an essential component of a previously uncharacterized cerebral Ca2+ channel that controls Aβ levels and susceptibility to late-onset AD. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a massive loss of neurons in several brain regions and by the presence of cerebral senile plaques comprised of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides (Mattson, 2004Mattson M.P.

The first atrophy observed in the AD brain occurs in the medial temporal lobe, which includes the hippocampus, and is the result of a massive synaptic degeneration and neuronal death (Braak and Braak, 1991Braak H.

Two major Aβ species are found, Aβ40 and Aβ42; both are produced from the sequential endoproteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE1/β-secretase and by presenilin (PS)/γ-secretase complexes. APP can also undergo a nonamyloidogenic proteolysis by α-secretase, which cleaves APP within the Aβ sequence and thereby precludes Aβ generation (Marambaud and Robakis, 2005Marambaud P. Robakis N.K.

The etiology of the disease is complex because of its strong genetic heterogeneity. Rare autosomal-dominant mutations in the genes encoding APP, PS1, and PS2 cause early-onset AD, whereas complex interactions among different genetic variants and environmental factors are believed to modulate the risk for the vast majority of late-onset AD (LOAD) cases (Kennedy et al., 2003Kennedy J.L.

To date, the only susceptibility gene unambiguously demonstrated worldwide is the ɛ4 allele of APOE on chromosome 19 (Strittmatter et al., 1993Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D.

However, epidemiological studies indicate that the presence of the APOE ɛ4 allele cannot explain the overall heritability of AD, implying that a significant proportion of LOAD cases is attributable to additional genetic risk factors (Lambert and Amouyel, 2007Lambert J.C.

A number of neurodegenerative disorders are caused by mutations in genes expressed principally in the central nervous system. This is the case for the brain proteins tau and α-synuclein, which are linked to autosomal-dominant forms of frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Here, we postulated that susceptibility to LOAD could come from genes predominantly expressed in affected brain regions, such as the hippocampus. We used TissueInfo (Skrabanek and Campagne, 2001Skrabanek L. Campagne F. TissueInfo: High-throughput identification of tissue expression profiles and specificity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (E102–E102)Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the Alzgene database (Bertram et al., 2007Bertram L. McQueen M.B. Mullin K. Blacker D. Tanzi R.E. Systematic meta-analyses of Alzheimer disease genetic association studies: The AlzGene database.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) to screen for genes predominantly expressed in the hippocampus and located in linkage regions for LOAD, and identified CALHM1, a gene of unknown function, located on chromosome 10 at 1.6 Mb of the LOAD marker D10S1671 (Bertram et al., 2000Bertram L. Blacker D. Mullin K. Keeney D. Jones J. Basu S. Yhu S. McInnis M.G. Go R.C. Vekrellis K. et al.Evidence for genetic linkage of Alzheimer's disease to chromosome 10q.Science. 2000; 290: 2302-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We found that CALHM1 homomultimerizes, controls cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, and shares similarities with the predicted selectivity filter of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Voltage-clamp analyses further revealed that CALHM1 generates Ca2+-selective cation currents at the plasma membrane. Importantly, we determined that the frequency of the rare allele of the nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2986017 in CALHM1, which results in a proline-to-leucine substitution at codon 86 (P86L), is significantly increased in AD cases in five independent cohorts. Further investigation demonstrated the functional significance of the rs2986017 SNP by showing that the P86L mutation promotes Aβ accumulation via a loss of CALHM1 control on Ca2+ permeability and cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Here, we propose that CALHM1 is a component of a previously uncharacterized cerebral Ca2+ channel family involved in Aβ metabolism and that CALHM1 variants may influence the risk for LOAD. We screened the human genome with TissueInfo to annotate human transcripts with tissue expression levels derived from the expressed sequence tag database (dbEST) (Campagne and Skrabanek, 2006Campagne F. Skrabanek L. Mining expressed sequence tags identifies cancer markers of clinical interest.BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 481Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Skrabanek and Campagne, 2001Skrabanek L. Campagne F. TissueInfo: High-throughput identification of tissue expression profiles and specificity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (E102–E102)Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Out of 33,249 human transcripts, the TissueInfo screen identified 30 transcripts, corresponding to 12 genes, with expression restricted to the hippocampus (Table 1). These transcripts matched either one or two ESTs sequenced from the hippocampus. Among these genes, one of unknown function, previously annotated as FAM26C, matched two hippocampal ESTs and mapped to the AD locus on 10q24.33 (Table 1). This gene, hereafter referred to as calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), encodes an open reading frame (ORF) of 346 amino acids and is predicted to contain four hydrophobic domains (HDs; TMHMM prediction) and two N-glycosylation motifs (NetNGlyc 1.0 prediction) (Figure 1A). No significant amino acid sequence homology to other functionally characterized proteins was found. Sequence database searches identified five human homologs of CALHM1 (collectively identified as the FAM26 gene family). Two homologs of human CALHM1 with broader tissue expression profiles (see the Supplemental Data available online) are clustered next to CALHM1 in 10q24.33 and are designated CALHM2 (26% protein sequence identity, previously annotated as FAM26B) and CALHM3 (39% identity, FAM26A) (Figure 1A). CALHM1 is conserved across at least 20 species, including mouse and C. elegans (Figures 1A and 1B).Table 1TissueInfo Expression ScreenChromosomeBandEnsembl Transcript IDHit(s)Hit(s) in HippocampusaIndicates how many ESTs matching the transcript were sequenced from a cDNA library made from the hippocampus.Tissue SummaryGene Name or Other ID1p34.3ENST0000031963722hippocampusEPHA102p21ENST0000030607821hippocampusKCNG32q37.1ENST0000031306421hippocampusC2orf526q15ENST0000030372631hippocampusCNR16q25.3ENST0000030825411hippocampusRetired in Ensembl 466q27ENST0000032258311hippocampusNP_787118.29q21.33ENST0000029874331hippocampusGAS110q24.33ENST0000032990532hippocampusCALHM1(FAM26C)11q24.1ENST0000035459731hippocampusOR8B317q25.3ENST0000032693121hippocampusQ8N8L1_HUMAN19p12ENST0000036088511hippocampusRetired in Ensembl 46Xq27.2ENST0000029829611hippocampusMAGEC3One transcript is shown for each gene identified in the screen.

Using RT-PCR, we analyzed human CALHM1 expression in 20 tissues and six brain regions. The expression of CALHM1 was highest in the total adult brain and in all brain regions tested. CALHM1 expression was noticeably lower in all other tissues, including fetal brain (Figure 2A). qRT-PCR revealed endogenous CALHM1 expression in retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (Figure S1A), suggesting that CALHM1 is a protein of neuronal origin. Immunofluorescence staining in transiently transfected cells revealed that CALHM1 strongly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it colocalized with the ER resident protein GRP78 (Figure 2B, left and middle panels). However, some cells revealed immunoreactivity for CALHM1 at the cell surface, suggesting that a pool of CALHM1 was localized at or near the plasma membrane (Figure 2B, right panel, arrows). Western blotting (WB) analyses revealed the presence of two immunoreactive bands in CALHM1-transfected cells (Figure 2C, lanes 1 and 2). Because human CALHM1 is predicted to be N-glycosylated at asparagine residues N74 and N140 (see Figure 1A, asterisks), we asked whether these bands might represent different N-glycosylated forms of the protein. Treatment of CALHM1-transfected cell lysates with N-glycosidase F, which cleaves all types of asparagine-bound N-glycans, completely eliminated the appearance of the higher molecular weight band and resulted in the accumulation of the lower band, which we conclude corresponds to the unmodified core protein (Figure 2C, lanes 2 and 4). CALHM1 was partially resistant to endoglycosidase H-mediated deglycosylation (Figure 2C, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that CALHM1 can reach the medial Golgi compartment and the cell surface, where proteins are terminally glycosylated and acquire resistance to endoglycosidase H. Plasma membrane expression of CALHM1 was also investigated by cell surface biotinylation. Figure 2D illustrates that a pool of CALHM1, enriched in glycosylated forms of the protein, was biotinylated and thus was present at the plasma membrane. We further determined that substitution of the N140 residue to alanine (N140A) completely prevented CALHM1 glycosylation, whereas N74A substitution had no effect (Figure 2C, lanes 5–7). Thus, CALHM1 is a multipass transmembrane protein, N-glycosylated at the residue N140, predominantly expressed in the adult brain, and localized to the ER and plasma membranes. These data further indicate that the HD3-HD4 loop, which contains the N140 residue, is oriented toward the luminal side when CALHM1 is in the ER membrane and toward the extracellular space when CALHM1 reaches the plasma membrane. The predicted membrane topology of CALHM1 suggests the presence of one re-entrant hydrophobic loop that does not cross the membrane bilayer and three membrane-spanning segments (TMHMM prediction). In the absence of significant homology to other characterized proteins, we postulated from the predicted topology that CALHM1 could function as an ion channel component. This is in part based on a suggestive similarity with the topology of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which also contain three transmembrane segments and a re-entrant loop that forms the lining of the ion channel pore region (Wollmuth and Sobolevsky, 2004Wollmuth L.P. Sobolevsky A.I. Structure and gating of the glutamate receptor ion channel.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because some ionotropic glutamate receptors are Ca2+-permeable membrane proteins (Gouaux and Mackinnon, 2005Gouaux E. Mackinnon R. Principles of selective ion transport in channels and pumps.Science. 2005; 310: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), we asked whether CALHM1 could control cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were conducted under resting conditions in the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. To reveal possible changes in the rate of Ca2+ entry in CALHM1-expressing cells, [Ca2+]i measurements were also performed under extracellular “Ca2+ add-back” conditions. These conditions are obtained after a transient external Ca2+ depletion that generates a driving force for Ca2+ entry. When the Ca2+ fluorescent dye Fluo-4 was used in mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells, no robust changes in fluorescence measurements were found under resting conditions after CALHM1 expression (data not shown). However, CALHM1 expression resulted in a strong and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i after extracellular Ca2+ add back (Figure 3A). CALHM1 expression significantly increased the initial rate of change in [Ca2+]i producing a peak of fluorescence at ∼2 min after Ca2+ addition (Figures 3A and 3B, Peak). CALHM1 expression also induced a significant elevation in the steady-state [Ca2+]i, compared to control conditions (Figures 3A and 3B, Steady-state). To measure absolute [Ca2+]i, we also determined the effect of CALHM1 on [Ca2+]i by using the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura-2. We confirmed that, under Ca2+ add-back conditions, CALHM1 expression induced a significant elevation of [Ca2+]i from 106 ± 4 nM (prior to Ca2+ add back) to 264 ± 48 nM at the peak (after Ca2+ addition), whereas control cells showed no significant changes in [Ca2+]i (from 105 ± 5 nM to 110 ± 6 nM; Figure S2). Because massive Ca2+ influx can be cytotoxic, we evaluated the viability of cells expressing CALHM1. Figure S3 illustrates that, in both normal and Ca2+ add-back conditions, no noticeable cell viability impairments or cytotoxicity were observed after CALHM1 expression. One important mechanism of Ca2+ entry coupled to ER Ca2+ release is called store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). In excitable cells, such as neurons, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) represent another critical mechanism of Ca2+ influx during membrane depolarization (Berridge et al., 2003Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Calcium signalling: Dynamics, homeostasis and remodelling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar). Inhibition of SOCE by the use of 2-APB did not prevent CALHM1 from affecting [Ca2+]i (Figure 3C). Similarly, selective blockage of the different subtypes of VGCCs with SNX-482 (R type VGCC inhibitor), mibefradil (T type), nifedipine (L type), or ω-conotoxin MVIIC (N, P, Q types) did not block the rise of [Ca2+]i induced by CALHM1 expression (Figures 3D and 3E). Because cytosolic Ca2+ can be released from intracellular stores via activation of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) or the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) at the ER membrane (Berridge et al., 2003Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Calcium signalling: Dynamics, homeostasis and remodelling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar), we next asked whether CALHM1 expression promotes InsP3R or RyR activation. The InsP3R inhibitor xestospongin C and the RyR inhibitor dantrolene were found to have no effect on the CALHM1-driven [Ca2+]i increase (Figure 3F), indicating that ER Ca2+ release via InsP3Rs or RyRs did not account for the effect of CALHM1 on cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Because presenilins were recently proposed to form ER calcium leak channels (Tu et al., 2006Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I. Presenilins form ER Ca2+ leak channels, a function disrupted by familial Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations.Cell. 2006; 126: 981-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether CALHM1 requires the presence of PS1 or PS2 to control cytosolic Ca2+ levels. We found that CALHM1 expression caused similar increases in [Ca2+]i in WT fibroblasts and in fibroblasts deficient for both PS1 and PS2 (Figure S4), showing that CALHM1 controls cytosolic Ca2+ levels independently of presenilins. We found, however, that the increase of [Ca2+]i observed after CALHM1 expression was blocked by cobalt (Co2+) and nickel (Ni2+), two nonspecific Ca2+ channel blockers. Indeed, Figures 3G and 3H show that 50 μM Co2+ or 10 μM Ni2+ were sufficient to completely inhibit the rise of intracellular Ca2+ induced by CALHM1 without causing changes in CALHM1 expression (Figure 3I). Because Ni2+ does not penetrate the cells (Shibuya and Douglas, 1992Shibuya I. Douglas W.W. Calcium channels in rat melanotrophs are permeable to manganese, cobalt, cadmium, and lanthanum, but not to nickel: Evidence provided by fluorescence changes in fura-2-loaded cells.Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1936-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the two inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers acted at the plasma membrane to block Ca2+ entry. Collectively, these results strongly indicate that CALHM1 expression promotes Ca2+ influx via activation of a cell-surface ion channel that is distinct from known VGCC or SOCE channels. Because many channels multimerize to form an ion pore, and because monomeric CALHM1 cannot create a functional pore with three transmembrane segments, we asked whether CALHM1 could form multimers. WB analyses of CALHM1-transfected cells under nonreducing conditions revealed the presence of immunoreactive bands with molecular weights compatible with dimers and tetramers of CALHM1 (Figure 4A). To test the possibility that CALHM1 self-associates, we coexpressed in cells two different tagged versions of the protein and used coimmunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether the two versions of CALHM1 form a complex. We found that immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged CALHM1 coprecipitated V5-tagged CALHM1 (Figure 4B), indicating that CALHM1 homomultimerized to form dimeric and possibly tetrameric structures. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ion-conducting membrane proteins with specific ion-selectivity properties (Gouaux and Mackinnon, 2005Gouaux E. Mackinnon R. Principles of selective ion transport in channels and pumps.Science. 2005; 310: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Recent advances in the structural analysis of ion channels have determined that the ion selectivity of some ion channels is controlled by a short amino acid sequence called the selectivity filter, which forms a narrow constriction in the pore across the membrane bilayer (Gouaux and Mackinnon, 2005Gouaux E. Mackinnon R. Principles of selective ion transport in channels and pumps.Science. 2005; 310: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The predicted selectivity filter of ionotropic glutamate receptors is located in a re-entrant loop called M2 and is critical for Ca2+ permeability (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. The glutamate receptor ion channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar, Wollmuth and Sobolevsky, 2004Wollmuth L.P. Sobolevsky A.I. Structure and gating of the glutamate receptor ion channel.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). By manual inspection, we screened ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit sequences for similarities with CALHM1 and found a short sequence in C terminus of CALHM1 HD2 that aligns with the predicted ion-selectivity filter of NMDAR NR2 subunits (Figure 4C). Previous studies have determined that the asparagine (N) residue in the so-called Q/R/N site of NMDAR NR2 subunits is critical for ion selectivity and permeation (see Figure 4C, asterisk) (Wollmuth and Sobolevsky, 2004Wollmuth L.P. Sobolevsky A.I. Structure and gating of the glutamate receptor ion channel.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). By sequence comparison, we identified a highly conserved N72 residue in human CALHM1 that aligns with the Q/R/N site at the C terminus end of the second hydrophobic domain of both CALHM1 and NMDAR (Figure 4C, asterisk). Importantly, we found that mutagenesis of the N72 residue to glycine (N72G) resulted in a significant inhibition of the effect of CALHM1 on [Ca2+]i (Figures 4D and 4E). Two-electrode voltage clamping of Xenopus oocytes was employed so that the effects of CALHM1 expression on plasma membrane conductance could be determined. Oocytes were injected with either water or CALHM1 cRNA, and conductance was recorded 24–72 hr later in a normal Na+-containing bath. In water-injected oocytes, the resting membrane potential Vm was −38mV ± 1mV (n = 74), and the membrane conductance, measured as the slope conductance around the reversal potential Vrev, was 1.5 ± 0.2 μS (n = 7). In contrast, the Vm in CALHM1-expressing oocytes was depolarized to −16mV ± 0.3mV (n = 96; p < 0. 0001), and membrane conductance was enhanced to 422 ± 78 μS (n = 12) (p < 0.005). The current-voltage (I-V) relation was outwardly rectifying (slope conductances of 372 ± 110 and 670 ± 131 μS at −55mV and +55mV, respectively) (Figure 4F). Depolarization of the resting Vm suggested that the CALHM1-enhanced conductance was contributed by a Na+ permeability. Isosmotic replacement of bath Na+ with NMDG hyperpolarized Vm by 7mV ± 0.8mV (Figure 4F; n = 12; p < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that expression of CALHM1 conferred a constitutive Na+ conductance in Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane. Expression of CALHM1 in CHO cells also generated an outwardly rectifying current in whole-cell recordings with Cs+ in the pipette (cytoplasmic) and Na+ in the bath (Figure 4G). The current reversed ∼0mV, indicating that the relative permeabilities of Cs+ and Na+ were similar (PNa: PCs = 0.8). The current was not observed in either untransfected or EGFP-transfected cells (Figure 4G, control), and it was eliminated when the monovalent cations in the bath and pipette solutions were replaced with NMDG (Figure 4H), indicating that the current was carried by Cs+ and Na+. The CALHM1-induced slope conductance measured around the Vrev was 360 ± 60 pS/pF (n = 42), compared with 74 ± 17 pS/pF (n = 11) in control cells. Gd3+ (100 μM) nearly completely inhibited the CALHM1-induced current (Figure 4G). With bath Na+ replaced by NMDG and 20 mM Ca2+, an outwardly rectifying, Gd3+-sensitive current was observed in the CALHM1-expressing cells that reversed at +8.3mV ± 2.9mV (n = 7), indicating PCa: PCs = 5 (Figure 4H). Thus, expression of CALHM1 conferred a constitutive Ca2+-selective cation current in CHO cell plasma membrane. In summary, our studies show that a region of CALHM1 shares sequence similarities with the selectivity filter of NMDAR and that the N72 residue is a key determinant in the control of cytosolic Ca2+ levels by CALHM1. Furthermore, electrophysiological analyses in CALHM1-expressing Xenopus oocytes and CHO cells demonstrated that CALHM1 i"

In addition to generating two or more stereocentres in a single reaction, multiple asymmetric reactions also impart increased enantiomeric excess to the final product in comparison with the analogous single transformation. Furthermore, multiple asymmetric operations have the potential to independently construct several stereocentres at remote points within the same molecular scaffold, rather than relying on pre-existing chiral centres that are proximal to the reactive site. Despite the inherent benefits of multiple catalytic enantioselective reactions, their application to natural product total synthesis remains largely underutilized. Here we report the use of a double stereoablative enantioselective alkylation reaction in a concise synthesis of the marine diterpenoid (-)-cyanthiwigin F (ref. 8). By employing a technique for independent, selective formation of two stereocentres in a single stereoconvergent operation, we demonstrate that a complicated mixture of racemic and meso diastereomers may be smoothly converted to a synthetically useful intermediate with exceptional enantiomeric excess. The stereochemical information generated by means of this catalytic transformation facilitates the easy and rapid completion of the total synthesis of this marine natural product."
https://openalex.org/W2117924558,"During nervous system development, spinal commissural axons project toward and across the ventral midline. They are guided in part by netrin-1, made by midline cells, which attracts the axons by activating the netrin receptor DCC. However, previous studies suggest that additional receptor components are required. Here, we report that the Down's syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM), a candidate gene implicated in the mental retardation phenotype of Down's syndrome, is expressed on spinal commissural axons, binds netrin-1, and is necessary for commissural axons to grow toward and across the midline. DSCAM and DCC can each mediate a turning response of these neurons to netrin-1. Similarly, Xenopus spinal neurons exogenously expressing DSCAM can be attracted by netrin-1 independently of DCC. These results show that DSCAM is a receptor that can mediate turning responses to netrin-1 and support a key role for netrin/DSCAM signaling in commissural axon guidance in vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W1982396039,"Haploidization of the genome in meiosis requires that chromosomes be sorted exclusively into pairs stabilized by synaptonemal complexes (SCs) and crossovers. This sorting and pairing is accompanied by active chromosome positioning in meiotic prophase in which telomeres cluster near the spindle pole to form the bouquet before dispersing around the nuclear envelope. We now describe telomere-led rapid prophase movements (RPMs) that frequently exceed 1 microm/s and persist throughout meiotic prophase. Bouquet formation and RPMs depend on NDJ1, MPS3, and a new member of this pathway, CSM4, which encodes a meiosis-specific nuclear envelope protein required specifically for telomere mobility. RPMs initiate independently of recombination but differ quantitatively in mutants that fail to complete recombination, suggesting that RPMs respond to recombination status. Together with recombination defects described for ndj1, our observations suggest that RPMs and SCs balance the disruption and stabilization of recombinational interactions, respectively, to regulate crossing over."

Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4221) Google Scholar). Despite the pervasive nature of Ca2+, its detection can be highly selective in space and time, as required for specificity in signaling to appropriate targets (Bootman et al., 2001Bootman M.D. Lipp P.

Among the most critical of these detection modes are those relating to Ca2+ sensors positioned in close proximity, i.e., within nanometers, of Ca2+ sources. This placement of sensors within such a “nanodomain” promotes rapid and privileged Ca2+ signaling (Augustine et al., 2003Augustine G.J. Santamaria F. Tanaka K.

Interactions of presynaptic Ca2+ channels and snare proteins in neurotransmitter release.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, such proximity to a Ca2+ source challenges a sensor's ability to integrate Ca2+ signals from distant sources, which is essential for coordinated signaling at the whole-cell level. A prototype for coupled sensors and sources is the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM), in its regulation of the CaV1-2 family of Ca2+ channels (Dunlap, 2007Dunlap K. Calcium channels are models of self-control.J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CaM is continuously complexed with channels as a resident Ca2+ sensor (Erickson et al., 2001Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30794-30802Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ binding to the C- and N-terminal lobes of CaM can each induce a separate form of regulation on the same channel (DeMaria et al., 2001DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Calmodulin bifurcates the local Ca2+ signal that modulates P/Q-type Ca2+ channels.Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2006Yang P.S.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10677-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Given the approximate diameter of Ca2+ channels (Wang et al., 2002Wang M.C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. 3D structure of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the resident CaM would be ∼10 nm from the channel pore, well within the channel nanodomain. Despite this proximity, each lobe responds selectively to distinct Ca2+ signals (cartooned in Figure 1A), which differ in both their spatial distribution (top row) and temporal characteristics (bottom row). Under physiological conditions, the composite Ca2+ signal (Figure 1A, left column) is the sum of two distinct components. First, Ca2+ inflow during channel openings produces a “local signal” component (Figure 1A, middle column) comprising brief yet intense local spikes of amplitude Caspike ∼100 μM (bottom row). These spikes are tightly synchronized with openings of the host channel, and localized to the nanodomain (top row, green hemisphere) (Neher, 1998Neher E. Vesicle pools and Ca2+ microdomains: new tools for understanding their roles in neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, Sherman et al., 1990Sherman A.

J. 1990; 58: 985-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Data [3], available online). Second, accumulation of Ca2+ from distant sources (e.g., other Ca2+ channels) generates a “global signal” component (Figure 1A, right column) consisting of a far smaller (∼5 μM) global pedestal (bottom row), which is spatially widespread (top row, green shading). In the CaV1-2 family of Ca2+ channels, regulation triggered by the C-lobe of CaM exploits channel proximity and responds almost maximally to the local Ca2+ signal alone (Liang et al., 2003Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Unified mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation across the Ca2+ channel family.Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This “local selectivity” is schematized for a Ca2+-dependent inactivation process (CDI) triggered by the C-lobe (Figure 1B). Such CDI produces a strong decay of Ca2+ current during sustained voltage activation whether Ca2+ is buffered at physiological levels, or much more strongly (Figure 1B). Since high Ca2+ buffering eliminates the global pedestal while hardly affecting local spikes (Figure 1A, middle column; Supplemental Data [3]) (Neher, 1998Neher E. Vesicle pools and Ca2+ microdomains: new tools for understanding their roles in neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), the sparing of CDI under this condition indicates that the local signal alone is sufficient. By contrast, N-lobe mediated regulation of all CaV2 channels somehow prefers the diminutive global pedestal over the far larger local spikes. The hallmark of this “global selectivity” is the presence of strong CDI in physiological buffering (Figure 1C, left), and its near absence in high buffering (Figure 1C, middle) (DeMaria et al., 2001DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Calmodulin bifurcates the local Ca2+ signal that modulates P/Q-type Ca2+ channels.Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 2003Liang H. DeMaria C.D.

Unified mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation across the Ca2+ channel family.Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Without this detection mode, Ca2+ feedback would be restricted to isolated complexes, and lack coordination over larger regions. Global selectivity is thus critical to the signaling repertoire of Ca2+ sensors positioned near Ca2+ sources. What are the mechanisms for the contrast in spatial Ca2+ selectivity of the lobes of CaM? The simplest explanation would presume that while the C-lobe resides within the nanodomain, the N-lobe lies outside this zone, where the local signal would be smaller than the global pedestal (Figure 1A, top row). However, each channel is constitutively complexed with a single CaM (Mori et al., 2004Mori M.X. Erickson M.G. Yue D.T. Functional stoichiometry and local enrichment of calmodulin interacting with Ca2+ channels.Science. 2004; 304: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2007Yang P.S. Mori M.X. Antony E.A. Tadross M.R. Yue D.T. A single calmodulin imparts distinct N- and C-lobe regulatory processes to individual CaV1.3 channels (abstr.).Biophys. J. 2007; 20a: 1669Google Scholar), and the lobes of CaM are very close to one another (<6 nm), indicating that both lobes are likely within the nanodomain (Dunlap, 2007Dunlap K. Calcium channels are models of self-control.J. Gen.

Hence, the N-lobe must be insensitive to Ca2+ intensity, and instead may respond to certain temporal features of nanodomain Ca2+ (Figure 1A, bottom row). Though some Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that favor specific temporal patterns of Ca2+ have been characterized (De Koninck and Schulman, 1998De Koninck P. Schulman H. Sensitivity of CaM kinase II to the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations.Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, Oancea and Meyer, 1998Oancea E. Meyer T. Protein kinase C as a molecular machine for decoding calcium and diacylglycerol signals.Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), none can respond to signals of low amplitude and frequency (global pedestal), while ignoring signals of high amplitude and frequency (local spikes). Hence, global selectivity must employ a thus far unknown mechanism. Here, theoretical and experimental advances explain how this unusual selectivity for global Ca2+ signals arises from the combination of two common elements: rapid Ca2+ release from CaM, together with greater channel affinity for Ca2+-free (apoCaM) versus Ca2+-bound CaM (Ca2+/CaM). Since our proposed mechanism requires CaM/channel interactions as present within intact channels, we develop the means to probe Ca2+ dynamics within this integrated setting, using channels engineered for enhanced opening, with a “voltage block” electrophysiological technique to precisely control nanodomain Ca2+. These tools resolve Ca2+ response characteristics clearly distinctive of the proposed mechanism. Combining this approach with manipulation of a recently identified CaM regulatory site (Dick et al., 2008Dick I.E. Tadross M.R. Liang H. Tay L.H. Yang W. Yue D.T. A modular switch for spatial Ca2+ selectivity in the calmodulin regulation of CaV channels.Nature. 2008; 451: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) enables quantitative confirmation of a key prediction—selectivity can be incrementally changed from global to local by adjusting the ratio of channel affinity for apoCaM versus Ca2+/CaM. Our findings generalize across CaV1–CaV2 channels, and likely extend to diverse Ca2+ sensors situated near Ca2+ sources. To explore how the CaM/channel complex could produce both local and global Ca2+ selectivity, we outlined a basic system comprised of the dominant conformations of this molecular assembly (Figure 2A). Several established features were considered. First, a 1:1 CaM/channel stoichiometry has been demonstrated (Mori et al., 2004Mori M.X. Erickson M.G. Yue D.T. Functional stoichiometry and local enrichment of calmodulin interacting with Ca2+ channels.Science. 2004; 304: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2007Yang P.S. Mori M.X.

Second, two distinct types of CaM/channel interactions are known to exist: apoCaM binding, which anchors CaM to the channel as a resident sensor; and Ca2+/CaM binding, which here produces CDI. Finally, an appropriate first-order approximation was to separately consider the operation of the C- and N-lobes of CaM, each with simultaneous (un)binding of two Ca2+ ions (Linse et al., 1991Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. Calcium binding to calmodulin and its globular domains.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Martin et al., 1985Martin S.R.

A stopped-flow fluorescence study using Quin 2 reveals a two-domain structure.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This single-lobe approximation was reinforced in our experiments by the use of mutant CaM molecules that restrict Ca2+ binding to one lobe or the other (DeMaria et al., 2001DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T.

Calmodulin is the Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+ -dependent inactivation of L- type calcium channels.Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Based upon these features, four main conformations result (Figure 2A, valid for either the C- or N-lobe). State 1 represents apoCaM (yellow circle) bound to the channel preassociation site (round pocket). Direct Ca2+ binding to CaM in state 1 is not considered, as such interaction is unlikely according to an analogous apoCaM/peptide structure (Houdusse et al., 2006Houdusse A. Gaucher J.F. Krementsova E. Mui S. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Crystal structure of apo-calmodulin bound to the first two IQ motifs of myosin V reveals essential recognition features.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19326-19331Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). State 2 portrays apoCaM after it releases from the preassociation site, at which point it can bind Ca2+ to produce Ca2+/CaM (square) in state 3. We reason that a transiently dissociated lobe of CaM (state 2 or 3) does not diffuse away (retained within a channel alcove), because of the slow rate of exchange between perfused CaM and channel-associated CaM (Chaudhuri et al., 2005Chaudhuri D. Alseikhan B.A. Chang S.Y. Soong T.W. Yue D.T. Developmental activation of calmodulin-dependent facilitation of cerebellar P-type Ca2+ current.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8282-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, in state 4, Ca2+/CaM binds the channel effector site (square pocket), which triggers CDI. The effector site is unlikely to bind apoCaM, because CDI is absent without Ca2+. Further arguments in support of this basic four-state configuration appear in the Discussion and Supplemental Data (1F). How might local Ca2+ selectivity of the C-lobe arise? This lobe is known to release Ca2+ slowly compared to the millisecond duration of Ca2+ channel closings (Bayley et al., 1984Bayley P. Ahlstrom P. Martin S.R. Forsen S.

A stopped-flow fluorescence study using Quin 2 reveals a two-domain structure.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), yielding a “slow CaM” mechanism (Figure 2B). Given this scheme, numerical simulations readily exhibit local selectivity, with strong CDI produced by Ca2+ signals appropriate for both physiological Ca2+ buffering (Figure 2Ca) and high buffering (Figure 2Cb, see legend for simulation details). This outcome is plausible because once CaM binds Ca2+ during a channel opening (Figure 2A, state 3), CaM will likely retain Ca2+ during millisecond closures, causing accumulation in state 3 that subsequently drives entry into state 4 (CDI) (Supplemental Data [2]). For analytical insight, we define a graphical “input-output” relation for Ca2+ detection (Figure 2D). The “output” is taken as the extent of CDI reached at steady-state (CDI(∞)), and the “input” as the channel open probability PO, both as observed under high Ca2+ buffering. In this regime, PO specifies the fraction of time Ca2+ is present (the “fractional presence” of Ca2+). This quantity is useful because nanodomain Ca2+ will achieve a steady concentration of Caspike within microseconds of channel opening, and rapidly decay to zero upon channel closing (Figure 2Cb, top; Supplemental Data [3]) (Sherman et al., 1990Sherman A. Keizer J. Rinzel J. Domain model for Ca2(+)-inactivation of Ca2+ channels at low channel density.Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 985-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) . Accordingly, PO becomes directly proportional to Ca2+ entry, and thereby serves as shorthand for the Ca2+ input. A first beneficial outcome of this format is a visual definition of local Ca2+ selectivity. Specifically, local selectivity maintains near maximal CDI under high buffering, with inputs spanning the range of naturally occurring PO (∼0.1–0.6). Therefore, the CDI(∞)–PO relation for all processes with local selectivity must intersect the red zone in Figure 2D, as exemplified by the data point (round symbol) corresponding to our numerical simulation (Figure 2Cb). As a second advantage, we deduce a simple formula for the CDI(∞)–PO response of the slow CaM mechanism. Under high buffering, slow Ca2+ release from the C-lobe allows the time-varying rate constant for transitions from state 2 to 3 (= kon·Ca2(t)) to be replaced by a fixed value equal to kon · Caspike2 · PO (Supplemental Data [2A]). This yields the equivalent system in Figure 2E, from which algebraic manipulation gives the analytic CDI(∞)–PO relation, with CDI(∞) proportional to steady-state occupancy of state 4.CDI(∞)=G⋅POPO+Keff.(Equation 1) This relation resembles the Michaelis-Menton equation, with PO analogous to substrate concentration. G incorporates the affinity of the channel for the Ca2+-bound C-lobe, and Keff reflects the balance between Caspike and CaM affinity for Ca2+ (Supplemental Data [2B]). Though Equation 1 is defined for high buffering, the strong CDI characteristic of Ca2+-detection processes under physiological Ca2+ buffering constrains G ∼1 and Keff ≪ 1 (Supplemental Data [2C]). Hence, any slow CaM mechanism will invariably produce local selectivity, with saturating CDI(∞)–PO relations that intersect the red zone (Figure 2D, smooth curve). How might global Ca2+ selectivity of the N-lobe arise? For this lobe, Ca2+ binding and unbinding should be rapid enough to achieve steady state within the millisecond durations of channel openings and closings (Bayley et al., 1984Bayley P. Ahlstrom P. Martin S.R. Forsen S. The kinetics of calcium binding to calmodulin: Quin 2 and ANS stopped-flow fluorescence studies.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A stopped-flow fluorescence study using Quin 2 reveals a two-domain structure.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, the system would switch “quickly” between states 3 and 2, in sync with channel openings and closings. A second difference from the C-lobe regime is that the kinetics of entry and exit from the outermost states become important. Switching between states 3 and 4 must be “slow” because experimentally, both CDI onset and recovery take much longer than milliseconds (Schnee and Ricci, 2003Schnee M.E. Ricci A.J. Biophysical and pharmacological characterization of voltage-gated calcium currents in turtle auditory hair cells.J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 697-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If switching between states 1 and 2 is similarly slow, the resulting SQS mechanism (“slow quick slow” in Figure 2F) can produce global selectivity—simulated CDI is strong under physiological buffering (Figure 2Ga), but absent in high buffering (Figure 2Gb and legend). A more quantitative definition of the kinetic constraints for the SQS regime appears in Supplemental Data (1A). This mechanism achieves global selectivity by combining two factors which collaborate to resist inactivation in response to transient and high-amplitude local Ca2+ spikes. Consider the case where only local spikes are present, such as in high buffering (Figure 2Gb, top). First, since the preassociated form of apoCaM (Figure 2A, state 1) binds Ca2+ poorly, the long lifetimes in state 1 can “protect” CaM from binding Ca2+ during brief Ca2+ spikes of high intensity. Second, should this first line of protection fail and state 3 be reached, rapid Ca2+ release ensures prompt return to state 2 during channel closures, thus preventing CDI (state 4) and favoring return to the apoCaM preassociated site (state 1). Under physiological buffering, however, global signals would bypass both protective measures. The persistence of a ∼5 μM global Ca2+ pedestal (Figure 2Ga, top), whose amplitude exceeds the micromolar Ca2+ affinity of the N-lobe, would outlast lifetimes in protected state 1 (Figure 2A) and subsequently allow state 2 to bind Ca2+ and accumulate in state 3, thus driving strong CDI (state 4). Likewise, even under high buffering, if a channel had a PO of 1, the continuous local Ca2+ entry would produce a ∼100 μM Ca2+ pedestal (Figure 2Gc, top). This sustained Ca2+ signal would again overwhelm both measures of protection, resulting in strong CDI (bottom). This CDI is only slightly stronger than seen at the native channel PO under physiological buffering (compare Figures 2Gc and 2Ga), illustrating that the SQS mechanism is relatively insensitive to Ca2+ intensity. Instead, the contrast in CDI produced by different PO values under high buffering (compare Figures 2Gb and 2Gc) implicates a striking preference for the fractional presence of Ca2+. Viewing these events in the graphical CDI(∞)–PO format aids analytical understanding of this mechanism (Figure 2H). For orientation, the red zone associated with local selectivity is reproduced from Figure 2D. Additionally, a corresponding green zone for global Ca2+ selectivity can be specified, because all processes with global Ca2+ selectivity, regardless of mechanism, must exhibit near elimination of CDI by high Ca2+ buffering. Indeed, mapping the high-buffering SQS simulation (Figure 2Gb) onto this graph (Figure 2H, round symbol) confirms the ability of the SQS mechanism to intersect this global zone (Figure 2H, green shading). This graphical framework motivates deduction of the closed-form CDI(∞)–PO solution, obtained as follows (Supplemental Data [1A]). Because multiple transitions will occur between states 2 and 3 before exiting to either state 1 or 4, a number of simplifications can be made according to the analysis of Neher and Steinbach (Neher and Steinbach, 1978Neher E. Steinbach J.H. Local anaesthetics transiently block currents through single acetylcholine-receptor channels.J. Physiol. 1978; 277: 153-176PubMed Google Scholar). States 2 and 3 may be combined into a single state “2-3,” with all rate constants replaced by time-independent equivalents (Figure 2I). Since transitions to state 4 can only occur from state 3, which is only occupied during channel openings, the rate constant from compound state “2-3” to state 4 becomes α · PO. Similarly, the rate constant from compound state “2-3” to state 1 is a · (1 − PO). This equivalent system (Figure 2I) yields:CDI(∞)=CDImax⋅PO⋅rPO⋅(r−1)+1/ɛ+1(Equation 2) with individual rate constants (a, b, α, β) defined in Figure 2A, γ = α / β, ɛ = a / b, and r = γ / ɛ. CDImax accounts for the small PO of inactivated channels (Imredy and Yue, 1994Imredy J.P. Yue D.T. Mechanism of Ca2+-sensitive inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels.Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Importantly, Equation 2 suggests that the SQS mechanism need not always produce a global Ca2+ selectivity. Rather, N-lobe selectivity is predicted to be transformable between global and local extremes by adjusting the ratio of channel affinity for Ca2+/CaM versus apoCaM (parameter r). To begin, we note that CDI at PO = 1 (square in Figures 2Gc and 2H) will always exceed the strong CDI present in physiological buffering (arrow in Figures 2Ga and 2H). This is true because the Ca2+ input from a channel with PO = 1 under high buffering (Figure 2Gc, top) is larger than the input from a channel with native PO under physiological buffering (Figure 2Ga, top). Hence, we need only consider parameters yielding CDI(∞)–PO relations with strong CDI at PO = 1. Given this constraint, we first evaluate the case where r = 1/10 in Equation 2, as for the simulations in Figure 2G. Here, the equation produces a CDI(∞)–PO relation that intersects the global zone, as well as the numerically simulated data points (Figure 2H, green curve). Because r < 1, the denominator of Equation 2 now differs from a Michaelis-Menton relation. This yields an upward curvature indicating high sensitivity to the fractional presence of Ca2+, as represented by PO. However, this is not the only mode of operation. Setting r = 10 yields a saturating relation that intersects the local selectivity region (Figure 2H, red curve). Finally, if r = 1, the relationship becomes a straight"

Here we describe a candidate pluripotency factor, Ronin, that possesses a THAP domain, which is associated with sequence-specific DNA binding and epigenetic silencing of gene expression. Ronin is expressed primarily during the earliest stages of murine embryonic development, and its deficiency in mice produces periimplantational lethality and defects in the inner cell mass. Conditional knockout of Ronin prevents the growth of ES cells while forced expression of Ronin allows ES cells to proliferate without differentiation under conditions that normally do not promote self-renewal. Ectopic expression also partly compensates for the effects of Oct4 knockdown. We demonstrate that Ronin binds directly to HCF-1, a key transcriptional regulator. Our findings identify Ronin as an essential factor underlying embryogenesis and ES cell pluripotency. Its association with HCF-1 suggests an epigenetic mechanism of gene repression in pluripotent cells."

This view of a multimeric membrane-tethering assembly complexed with a Rab provides a framework for understanding events preceding membrane fusion at the molecular level. In eukaryotic cells, vesicles transport materials between membrane-bound compartments. After a vesicle buds from a donor membrane, it travels through the cytoplasm to its target membrane, where it fuses to deliver its cargo. This membrane-fusion event is mediated by SNAREs, a family of membrane proteins located on the vesicle and target membranes (Jahn and Scheller, 2006Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs—engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Vesicle transport, however, also requires the interplay of a large number of peripheral membrane proteins that act upstream of the SNAREs. These include coat proteins that are needed for cargo selection and vesicle budding, tethering proteins, and small GTPases of the Rab family involved in regulation. Tethers are either long coiled-coil proteins or large multimeric complexes that mediate the initial interaction of the vesicle and its target membrane (reviewed in Cai et al., 2007aCai H. Reinisch K.

In yeast, TRAPPI mediates the tethering of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived COPII-coated vesicles at the cis-Golgi (Sacher et al., 1998Sacher M. Jiang Y. Barrowman J. Scarpa A. Burston J. Zhang L.

Tethering involves interactions between the TRAPPI subunit Bet3p and Sec23p (Cai et al., 2007bCai H. Yu S. Menon S. Cai Y. Lazarova D. Fu C. Reinisch K. Hay J.C. Ferro-Novick S.

Critically, TRAPPI also functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rab GTPase Ypt1p (Sacher et al., 2001Sacher M. Barrowman J. Wang W. Horecka J. Zhang Y.

Membrane fusion proceeds only once Ypt1p is activated by TRAPPI (Cai et al., 2007aCai H. Reinisch K. Novick S.

TRAPPI shares multiple subunits with the TRAPPII complex, which mediates trafficking events within the Golgi and from the early endosome to the late Golgi (Cai et al., 2005Cai H. Zhang Y. Pypaert M.

The TRAPPI complex comprises seven small subunits (two copies of Bet3p and one copy each of Bet5p, Trs20p, Trs23p, Trs31p, and Trs33p), which range in size from 18 to 33 kDa, as well as a larger 80 kDa protein Trs85p (Sacher et al., 1998Sacher M.

The requirement of complex assembly as a prerequisite for GEF activity may allow for additional regulation of vesicle transport. To understand how TRAPPI subunits cooperate in activating Ypt1p, we have determined the crystal structure of a TRAPPI subassembly in complex with Ypt1p at a resolution of 3.7 Å. The structure offers a snapshot of the interactions between a multimeric membrane-tethering complex and a Rab GTPase. The TRAPPI subcomplex studied contains the minimum number of subunits (two copies of Bet3p and one each of Bet5p, Trs23p, and Trs31p) needed to activate Ypt1p (Kim et al., 2006Kim Y.G. Raunser S.

A comparison of nucleotide-free Ypt1p with existing nucleotide-bound structures of the enzyme (PDB ID 1YZN; Eathiraj et al., 2005Eathiraj S. Pan X. Ritacco C. Lambright D.G. Structural basis of a family-wide Rab GTPase recognition by rabenosyn-5.Nature. 2005; 436: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) or its mammalian homolog Rab1a (PDB ID 2FOL) allows us to propose a mechanism for guanine nucleotide exchange in which each subunit in the TRAPPI subassembly contributes to the activity of this multimeric GEF. The crystal structure of a TRAPPI subassembly (Figures 1A–1C) consisting of one copy each of Bet5p, Trs23p, and Trs31p and two copies of Bet3p (named Bet3p-A and Bet3p-B) was determined in complex with a C-terminally truncated Ypt1p (residues 1–180). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S1 (see Supplemental Data available online). The 26 residue Ypt1p C terminus that was truncated is not required for activation of nucleotide exchange by TRAPPI (data not shown). The TRAPPI subassembly is about 135 Å long and 30–75 Å in diameter (Figure 1A). One of its surfaces is largely acidic, whereas the other has both basic and acidic regions (Figure 1B). Bet3p-A, Bet5p, Trs23p, and Bet3p-B are arranged end to end along the length of the complex (Figures 1A and 1C). Bet3p-A/Bet5p and Bet3p-B/Trs23p are related by a 2-fold rotation around an axis centered at the Bet5p/Trs23p interface. Trs31p binds at one end of the otherwise cylindrical complex, interacting with both Trs23p and Bet3p-B. The yeast small TRAPPI subunits in the crystal structure have mixed α/β topologies (Figure 1C) similar to those previously described for their vertebrate homologs (Kim et al., 2006Kim Y.G. Raunser S.

Despite limited sequence homology, Bet5p and Trs23p (20% sequence identity) share a common fold, as do Bet3p and Trs31p (15% sequence identity). The yeast Trs23p protein does not have the PDZ-like domain described for the mammalian protein, and insertions in the yeast proteins with respect to the mammalian sequences are for the most part disordered in the crystal structure. These insertions include residues 76–103 and 148–168 in Trs23p and residues 1–54 and 104–164 in Trs31p. Bet3p has an additional N-terminal α helix, which plays a role in subunit interactions. Importantly, the C-terminal residues of Bet3p, disordered in all existing structures of the mammalian homolog (Kim et al., 2005aKim M.S. Yi M.J. Lee K.H. Wagner J. Munger C. Kim Y.G. Whiteway M.

A deep channel lined by hydrophobic residues traverses each of the Bet3p subunits. Bet3p is palmitoylated via a thioester linkage to a conserved cysteine (C80) (Turnbull et al., 2005Turnbull A.P. Kummel D. Prinz B. Holz C. Schultchen J. Lang C. Niesen F.H. Hofmann K.P. Delbruck H. Behlke J. et al.Structure of palmitoylated BET3: Insights into TRAPP complex assembly and membrane localization.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have modeled a palmitoylate group into the channel of Bet3p-A, where we find density continuous with Cys80 in averaged composite omit maps (Figure S1). The bound fatty acid is less well defined in Bet3p-B, though there is electron density deep in the channel corresponding to eight to nine methylene groups of the hydrocarbon tail. The palmitoyl group has been shown to contribute to the stability of Bet3p (Kummel et al., 2006aKummel D. Heinemann U. Veit M.

USA. 2006; 103: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis suggests, however, that neither the palmitoyl group (Kim et al., 2005aKim M.S. Yi M.J. Lee K.H. Wagner J.

The Ypt1p binding site is on the acidic surface of the TRAPPI subassembly. The interface is formed primarily by the Trs23p subunit with smaller contributions from the two copies of Bet3p and Bet5p (see Figures 1A and 1B). The total accessible surface buried in the interface between Ypt1p and TRAPPI is 2990 Å2. Accessible surfaces buried in the interfaces with Trs23p, Bet3p-A, Bet3p-B, and Bet5p measure ∼1870, ∼650, ∼250, and ∼250 Å2, respectively. There is no direct interaction between Ypt1p and Trs31p. TRAPPI interacts (Figure 2) primarily with residues in the central β sheet of Ypt1p (in strands S1, S2, and S3), the switch I and II regions (residues 31–45 and 64–78), and the phosphate-binding loop, or P loop (residues 15–23). Switches I and II are those regions in the nucleotide-binding pocket that adopt different conformations in the active and inactive forms of Ypt1p, and the P loop is important in binding the β- and γ-phosphates of nucleotides. Structures are available for Ypt1p in complex with the nonhydrolysable GTP analog guanosine-5′ (β,γ) imidotriphosphate (GppNHP) (PDB ID 1YZN; Eathiraj et al., 2005Eathiraj S. Pan X. Ritacco C. Lambright D.G. Structural basis of a family-wide Rab GTPase recognition by rabenosyn-5.Nature. 2005; 436: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and its mammalian homolog Rab1a bound to GDP (PDB ID 2FOL). Rab1a is nearly identical to Ypt1p over most of its sequence. In the Ypt1p/TRAPPI complex, the Ypt1p N terminus (residues 4–10, where 7–10 are in β strand S1) contacts Trs23p and has shifted with respect to nucleotide-bound forms (Figure 2, Figure 3). Small shifts in adjacent structural elements, the loop between strands S2 and S3 (residues 53–54), as well as the C terminus (residues 150–174, including H5) accompany the change in the N terminus. The most dramatic changes in Ypt1p, however, are in the nucleotide-binding pocket. Residues 150–155 in a loop at the Ypt1p C terminus form part of this pocket. In the Ypt1p/TRAPPI complex, they are shifted into the pocket close to the position occupied by the guanosine base in nucleotide-bound structures. The Ala152 Cβ would be within 2 Å of atoms in the guanosine base, in a position incompatible with nucleotide binding. The nucleotide-binding pocket is further perturbed by the insertion of the Bet3p-A C terminus, which would clash sterically (particularly at residues 189–193) with switch I as oriented in nucleotide-bound forms of Ypt1p/Rab1a (Figures 3A and 3B). The switch I region (residues 27–45) of Ypt1p is rearranged relative to its nucleotide-bound conformations (Figures 3A and 3B), opening up the nucleotide-binding pocket. In their new conformation, switch I residues 37–45 contact the Bet3-A C terminus as well as residues in helix H1 of Bet5p and helix H1 of Trs23p (Figure 2). Residues 32–36 in the middle of switch I are not well ordered in the complex structure. In the nucleotide-bound form, the highly conserved Tyr33 from this sequence contacts the guanine base via an edge-to-face aromatic interaction (Eathiraj et al., 2005Eathiraj S. Pan X. Ritacco C. Lambright D.G. Structural basis of a family-wide Rab GTPase recognition by rabenosyn-5.Nature. 2005; 436: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar; PDB IDs 1YZN, 2FOL). Mutating this residue to alanine (Y33A) accelerates GDP release by ∼10-fold (Figure 3C) while not affecting nucleotide uptake (Figure 3D), thereby lowering Ypt1p affinity for GDP by an order of magnitude. Thus, the perturbation of Tyr33 during switch I reorganization would similarly be expected to weaken the affinity for GDP in the TRAPPI-bound form of Ypt1p and accelerate GDP release by roughly an order of magnitude. The switch II region of the nucleotide-binding pocket also alters its conformation in the Ypt1p/TRAPPI complex. Switch II residues are disordered in the Rab1a/GDP structure (PDB ID 2FOL), and their conformation differs in the active and TRAPPI-bound forms of Ypt1p (Figures 3A and 3B). In the Ypt1p/TRAPPI complex, switch II is folded against a surface formed by helices H1 of Trs23p, H1 of Bet5p, and residues near the C terminus of Bet3p-B of TRAPPI. This interaction drives the formation of a helix (H2; Figures 2, 3A, and 3B) and moves switch II residues out of the nucleotide-binding pocket as compared with their position in activated Ypt1p. We will discuss the implications of switch II folding below. The conformation of the P loop in TRAPPI-bound Ypt1p is similar to that of nucleotide-bound forms of Ypt1p and Rab1a. In the Ypt1p/TRAPPI complex, the loop is stabilized in part by a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the P loop residue Lys21 and Glu192 in the Bet3p-A C terminus (Figures 3A and 3B). As modeled, this glutamate side chain (including Cβ and Cγ as well as the carboxylate group) would be within 1.6 Å of the nucleotide phosphates in the nucleotide-bound forms of Ypt1/Rab1a, in a position incompatible with nucleotide binding. However, the sequence identity of residue 192 is not critical for nucleotide exchange, as the E192A/D193A double mutation in the Bet3p C terminus has only a small effect on GEF efficiency (Table 1 and Figure 4A).Table 1Activation of Ypt1p by TRAPPI and TRAPPI MutantsConstructColor in Figure 4D[TRAPPI] (μM)k-GDP,obs (s−1)aObserved GDP dissociation rate constant.Relative Rate IncreasebRelative to Ypt1p in the absence of TRAPPI.“kcat/KM”cCatalytic efficiency, taken as initial slope of TRAPPI concentration dependence on exchange rate k-GDP,obs at subsaturating TRAPPI concentration (see Delprato et al., 2004).

The C terminus may be important for initiating the conformational changes in switch I that help to catalyze nucleotide exchange. Additionally, contacts with the Bet3p C terminus seen in the structure (Figure 2) may be important for stabilizing switch I in its new conformation. To assess the importance of the Bet3p C terminus for exchange, we prepared TRAPPI subassemblies that incorporate C-terminally truncated versions of Bet3p. Constructs of Bet3p that contained 185, 188, or 191 residues of the 193 amino acid sequence catalyzed nucleotide exchange at least 150-fold less efficiently than the TRAPPI complex with full-length Bet3p (Table 1 and Figures 4A and 4B), consistent with a critical role for the entire Bet3p C terminus in the exchange mechanism. Mutations in other TRAPPI surfaces at the Ypt1p interface would also be expected to affect Ypt1p recognition and possibly nucleotide exchange. Indeed, we were able to entirely, or almost entirely, eliminate TRAPPI GEF activity by mutating surface patches on any one of three different subunits: Bet3p, Bet5p, or Trs23p (Table 1 and Figures 4B and 4D). We found that mutations in the Trs23p surface that interacts with strand S1 in the Ypt1p N terminus (S12K/G14M/L34k and M200A/P201W/R203S) abrogate GEF activity entirely (Table 1 and Figure 4B). Similarly, mutations designed to interfere with a switch I interaction, a double mutation in Bet5p (G46W/S50K), or a point mutation in Trs23p (S38R) completely inactivated TRAPPI (Table 1 and Figure 4B). Finally, a quadruple mutation in Trs23p (H41A/G42M/A45W/I46R) at the switch II binding surface of TRAPPI reduced the catalytic efficiency to residual levels (Table 1 and Figure 4B). In addition to assessing the consequences of each of these mutations in vitro, we also examined their effect on viability in yeast. Two different methods were used to construct the mutants. The C-terminal truncations of Bet3p were constructed using the method of Longtine et al., 1998Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar. For the other mutations, a mutant copy of each gene was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis on a CEN plasmid (LEU2) and then transformed into a strain in which the sole copy of the wild-type gene was on a CEN balancing plasmid (URA3). The balancing plasmid with the wild-type gene was subsequently lost on a 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plate, allowing us to evaluate the effect of the mutation on growth. We found that TRAPP mutants lacking all GEF activity in vitro were inviable (Table 1 and Figure 4C). However, mutants with residual in vitro activity grew as well as wild-type at 25°C or 37°C and did not display defects in invertase secretion (Table 1 and Figures 4C and S3). A likely explanation for this apparent anomaly is that TRAPPI may act more effectively in the cell than in vitro. Soluble TRAPPI and Ypt1p were used in vitro, whereas in cells, Ypt1p is anchored to a membrane via its prenylated C terminus, and exchange occurs at the membrane. Thus, the effect of certain mutations may be less pronounced in vivo than in vitro. Biochemical solution studies of nucleotide binding and exchange reveal the kinetic basis of Ypt1p activation by TRAPPI. TRAPPI accelerates the dissociation of Ypt1p-bound GDP (k-GDP) >400-fold (Table 1 and Figure 4A). The initial velocities of TRAPPI-dependent nucleotide exchange (Table 1 and Figure 4A) yield apparent second-order rate constants for TRAPPI activation of nucleotide exchange from Ypt1p (equivalent to the enzymatic kcat/Km) and serve as a practical reference with which to assess the catalytic efficiency of a GEF (Itzen et al., 2007Itzen A. Rak A. Goody R.S. Sec2 is a highly efficient exchange factor for the Rab protein Sec4.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of TRAPPI, .016 ± .001 μM−1s−1, is intermediate between two other characterized Rab GEFs, Vps9 and Sec2p (Esters et al., 2001Esters H. Alexandrov K. Iakovenko A. Ivanova T.

In addition, TRAPPI accelerates GTP binding to Ypt1p (k+GTP) ∼30-fold (Figure 4E), more than has been observed for other Rab GEFs (Esters et al., 2001Esters H. Alexandrov K. Iakovenko A. Ivanova T.

The acceleration of nucleotide dissociation and binding serves as a framework for formulating structure-based models of TRAPPI-mediated nucleotide exchange from Ypt1p. The structure and kinetic analysis of TRAPPI mutants (Table 1 and Figure 4) suggest an important role for the Bet3p-A C terminus in the guanine nucleotide-exchange mechanism. In the structure, which represents an intermediate in exchange following release of bound nucleotide, the Bet3p-A C terminus invades the GTPase nucleotide-binding pocket. We propose that the Bet3p-A C terminus functions in the remodeling of switch I that promotes the release of bound nucleotide.

https://openalex.org/W1985122731,"During development, organ primordia reorganize to form repeated functional units. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), mechanosensory organs called neuromasts are deposited at regular intervals by the migrating posterior lateral line (pLL) primordium. The pLL primordium is organized into polarized rosettes representing proto-neuromasts, each with a central atoh1a-positive focus of mechanosensory precursors. We show that rosettes form cyclically from a progenitor pool at the leading zone of the primordium as neuromasts are deposited from the trailing region. fgf3/10 signals localized to the leading zone are required for rosette formation, atoh1a expression, and primordium migration. We propose that the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) source controls primordium organization, which, in turn, regulates the periodicity of neuromast deposition. This previously unrecognized mechanism may be applicable to understanding segmentation and morphogenesis in other organ systems."

https://openalex.org/W2005802496,"Roughly 60% of the Earth’s outer surface is composed of oceanic crust formed by volcanic processes at mid-ocean ridges. Although only a small fraction of this vast volcanic terrain has been visually surveyed or sampled, the available evidence suggests that explosive eruptions are rare on mid-ocean ridges, particularly at depths below the critical point for seawater (3,000 m)1. A pyroclastic deposit has never been observed on the sea floor below 3,000 m, presumably because the volatile content of mid-ocean-ridge basalts is generally too low to produce the gas fractions required for fragmenting a magma at such high hydrostatic pressure. We employed new deep submergence technologies during an International Polar Year expedition to the Gakkel ridge in the Arctic Basin at 85° E, to acquire photographic and video images of ‘zero-age’ volcanic terrain on this remote, ice-covered ridge. Here we present images revealing that the axial valley at 4,000 m water depth is blanketed with unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits, including bubble wall fragments (limu o Pele)2, covering a large (>10 km2) area. At least 13.5 wt% CO2 is necessary to fragment magma at these depths3, which is about tenfold the highest values previously measured in a mid-ocean-ridge basalt4. These observations raise important questions about the accumulation and discharge of magmatic volatiles at ultraslow spreading rates on the Gakkel ridge5 and demonstrate that large-scale pyroclastic activity is possible along even the deepest portions of the global mid-ocean ridge volcanic system."

Splicing is catalyzed by a large ribonucleoprotein complex, the spliceosome, which is composed of five small nuclear RNAs and more than 100 protein factors. Despite the complexity of the spliceosome, the chemistry of the splicing reaction is simple, consisting of two consecutive transesterification reactions. The presence of introns in spliceosomal RNAs of certain fungi has suggested that splicing may be reversible; however, this has never been demonstrated experimentally. By using affinity-purified spliceosomes, we have shown that both catalytic steps of splicing can be efficiently reversed under appropriate conditions. These results provide considerable insight into the catalytic flexibility of the spliceosome."

Early embryos of Caenorhabditis elegans polarize radially when cell contacts restrict the polarity protein PAR-6 to contact-free cell surfaces, where PAR-6 regulates gastrulation movements. We have identified a Rho guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (RhoGAP), PAC-1, which mediates C. elegans radial polarity and gastrulation by excluding PAR-6 from contacted cell surfaces. We show that PAC-1 is recruited to cell contacts, and we suggest that PAC-1 controls radial polarity by restricting active CDC-42 to contact-free surfaces, where CDC-42 binds and recruits PAR-6.

We assumed that accretion of the outer portion of the stellar core by a central black hole fuels the prompt emission and that fall-back and accretion of the stellar envelope later produce the plateau in the x-ray light curve seen in some bursts. Using x-ray data for three bursts, we estimated the radius of the stellar core to be ∼(1 – 3) × 10 10 cm and that of the stellar envelope to be ∼(1 – 2) × 10 11 cm. The density profile in the envelope is fairly shallow, with ρ ∼ r –2 (where ρ is density and r is distance from the center of the explosion). The rotation speeds of the core and envelope are ∼0.05 and ∼0.2 of the local Keplerian speed, respectively."

Here we narrow it further by presenting the skull, exceptionally preserved braincase, shoulder girdle and partial pelvis of Ventastega curonica from the Late Devonian of Latvia, a transitional intermediate form between the 'elpistostegids' Panderichthys and Tiktaalik and the Devonian tetrapods (limbed vertebrates) Acanthostega and Ichthyostega. Ventastega is the most primitive Devonian tetrapod represented by extensive remains, and casts light on a part of the phylogeny otherwise only represented by fragmentary taxa: it illuminates the origin of principal tetrapod structures and the extent of morphological diversity among the transitional forms."
https://openalex.org/W1972770938,"Background Lectins are sugar-binding proteins that specifically recognize sugar complexes. Based on the specificity of protein–sugar interactions, different lectins could be used as carrier molecules to target drugs specifically to different cells which express different glycan arrays. In spite of lectin's interesting biological potential for drug targeting and delivery, a potential disadvantage of natural lectins may be large size molecules that results in immunogenicity and toxicity. Smaller peptides which can mimic the function of lectins are promising candidates for drug targeting. Principal Findings Small peptide with lectin-like behavior was screened from amphibian skin secretions and its structure and function were studied by NMR, NMR-titration, SPR and mutant analysis. A lectin-like peptide named odorranalectin was identified from skin secretions of Odorrana grahami. It was composed of 17 aa with a sequence of YASPKCFRYPNGVLACT. L-fucose could specifically inhibit the haemagglutination induced by odorranalectin. 125I-odorranalectin was stable in mice plasma. In experimental mouse models, odorranalectin was proved to mainly conjugate to liver, spleen and lung after i.v. administration. Odorranalectin showed extremely low toxicity and immunogenicity in mice. The small size and single disulfide bridge of odorranalectin make it easy to manipulate for developing as a drug targeting system. The cyclic peptide of odorranalectin disclosed by solution NMR study adopts a β-turn conformation stabilized by one intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys6-Cys16 and three hydrogen bonds between Phe7-Ala15, Tyr9-Val13, Tyr9-Gly12. Residues K5, C6, F7, C16 and T17 consist of the binding site of L-fucose on odorranalectin determined by NMR titration and mutant analysis. The structure of odorranalectin in bound form is more stable than in free form. Conclusion These findings identify the smallest lectin so far, and show the application potential of odorranalectin for drug delivery and targeting. It also disclosed a new strategy of amphibian anti-infection."

We conducted stratigraphic and petrologic analyses of the cores to elucidate the timing and results of impact-melt creation and distribution, transient-cavity collapse, and ocean-water resurge. Comparison of post-impact sedimentary sequences inside and outside the structure indicates that compaction of the crater fill influenced long-term sedimentation patterns in the mid-Atlantic region. Salty connate water of the target remains in the crater fill today, where it poses a potential threat to the regional groundwater resource. Observed depth variations in microbial abundance indicate a complex history of impact-related thermal sterilization and habitat modification, and subsequent post-impact repopulation."
https://openalex.org/W2065632930,"An immunodetection study of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B), SHP-2, and Src in isolated mitochondria from different rat tissues (brain, muscle, heart, liver, and kidney) revealed their exclusive localization in the brain. Given this result, we sought whether mitochondria respond to ATP and to the general tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and found little or no change in the tyrosine phosphorylation profile of mitochondria from muscle, heart, liver, and kidney. In contrast, ATP induced an enhancement in the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein profile of brain mitochondria, which was further greatly enhanced with orthovanadate and which disappeared when Src was inhibited with two inhibitors: PP2 and PP1. Importantly, we found that in brain mitochondria, ATP addition induced Src autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 in its catalytic site, leading to its activation, whereas the regulatory Tyr-527 site remained unphosphorylated. Functional implications were addressed by measurements of the enzymatic activity of each of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes in brain mitochondria in the presence of ATP. We found an increase in complex I, III, and IV activity and a decrease in complex V activity, partially reversed by Src inhibition, demonstrating that the complexes are Src substrates. These results complemented and reinforced our initial study showing that respiration of brain mitochondria was partially dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, the present data suggest a possible control point in the regulation of respiration by tyrosine phosphorylation of the complexes mediated by Src auto-activation."
https://openalex.org/W2160475848,"In the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa, including Trypanosoma brucei, RNA editing inserts and/or deletes uridines from pre-mRNAs to produce mature, translatable mRNAs. RNA editing is carried out by several related multiprotein complexes known as editosomes, which contain all of the enzymatic components required for catalysis of editing. In addition, noneditosome accessory factors necessary for editing of specific RNAs have also been described. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo characterization of the mitochondrial TbRGG2 protein (originally termed TbRGGm) and demonstrate that it acts as an editing accessory factor. TbRGG2 is an RNA-binding protein with a preference for poly(U). TbRGG2 protein levels are up-regulated 10-fold in procyclic form T. brucei compared with bloodstream forms. Nevertheless, the protein is essential for growth in both life cycle stages. TbRGG2 associates with RNase-sensitive and RNase-insensitive mitochondrial complexes, and a small fraction of the protein co-immunoprecipitates with editosomes. RNA interference-mediated depletion of TbRGG2 in both procyclic and bloodstream form T. brucei leads to a dramatic decrease in pan-edited RNAs and in some cases a corresponding increase in the pre-edited RNA. TbRGG2 down-regulation also results in moderate stabilization of never-edited and minimally edited RNAs. Thus, our data are consistent with a model in which TbRGG2 is multifunctional, strongly facilitating the editing of pan-edited RNAs and modestly destabilizing minimally edited and never-edited RNAs. This is the first example of an RNA editing accessory factor that functions in the mammalian infective T. brucei life cycle stage."
https://openalex.org/W1993308103,"Serum calcium and phosphate concentrations and experimental chronic kidney failure control parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression post-transcriptionally through regulated binding of the trans-acting proteins AUF1 and upstream of N-ras (Unr) to an AU-rich element (ARE) in PTH mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). We show that the mRNA decay promoting K-homology splicing regulator protein (KSRP) binds to PTH mRNA in intact parathyroid glands and in transfected cells. This binding is decreased in glands from calcium-depleted or experimental chronic kidney failure rats in which PTH mRNA is more stable compared to parathyroid glands from control and phosphorus-depleted rats in which PTH mRNA is less stable. PTH mRNA decay depends on the KSRP-recruited exosome in parathyroid extracts. In transfected cells, KSRP overexpression and knockdown experiments show that KSRP decreases PTH mRNA stability and steady-state levels through the PTH mRNA ARE. Overexpression of isoform p45 of the PTH mRNA stabilizing protein AUF1 blocks KSRP-PTH mRNA binding and partially prevents the KSRP mediated decrease in PTH mRNA levels. Therefore, calcium or phosphorus depletion, as well as chronic kidney failure, regulate the interaction of KSRP and AUF1 with PTH mRNA and its half-life. Our data indicate a novel role for KSRP in PTH gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1983396749,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a member of the CCN family of proteins, is expressed by osteoblasts, but its function in cells of the osteoblastic lineage has not been established. We investigated the effects of CTGF overexpression by transducing murine ST-2 stromal cells with a retroviral vector, where CTGF is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Overexpression of CTGF in ST-2 cells increased alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase mRNA levels, and mineralized nodule formation. CTGF overexpression decreased the effect of bone morphogenetic protein-2 on Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation and of Wnt 3 on cytosolic beta-catenin, indicating that the stimulatory effect on osteoblastogenesis was unrelated to BMP and Wnt signaling. CTGF overexpression suppressed Notch signaling and induced the transcription of hairy and E (spl)-1 (HES)-1, by Notch-independent mechanisms. CTGF induced nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transactivation by a calcineurin-dependent mechanism. Down-regulation of CTGF enhanced Notch signaling and decreased HES-1 transcription and NFAT transactivation. Similar effects were observed following forced CTGF overexpression, the addition of CTGF protein, or the transduction of ST-2 cells with a retroviral vector expressing HES-1. In conclusion, CTGF enhances osteoblastogenesis, possibly by inhibiting Notch signaling and inducing HES-1 transcription and NFAT transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2084677171,"E1 and E2 enzymes coordinate the first steps in conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls). ISG15 is an interferon-alpha/beta-induced Ubl, and the E1 and E2 enzymes for ISG15 conjugation are Ube1L and UbcH8, respectively. UbcH7 is the most closely related E2 to UbcH8, yet it does not function in ISG15 conjugation in vivo, while both UbcH7 and UbcH8 have been reported to function in Ub conjugation. Kinetic analyses of wild-type and chimeric E2s were performed to determine the basis for preferential activation of UbcH8 by Ube1L and to determine whether UbcH8 is activated equally well by Ube1L and E1(Ub) (Ube1). K(m) determinations confirmed the strong preference of Ube1L for UbcH8 over UbcH7 (a 29-fold K(m) difference), similar to the preference of E1(Ub) for UbcH7 over UbcH8 (a 36-fold K(m) difference). Thioester assays of chimeric E2s identified two structural elements within residues 1-39 of UbcH8 that play a major role in defining Ube1L-UbcH8 specificity: the alpha1-helix and the beta1-beta2 region. The C-terminal ubiquitin fold domain (UFD) of Ube1L was required for transfer of ISG15 to UbcH8 and for binding of Ube1L to UbcH8. Replacement of the Ube1L UFD with that from E1(Ub) resulted in preferential transfer of ISG15 to UbcH7. Together, these results indicate that Ube1L discriminates between UbcH8 and closely related Ub E2s based on specific interactions between the Ube1L UFD and determinants within the N-terminal region of UbcH8."
https://openalex.org/W2060705160,"Bacterial protein toxins are powerful tools for elucidating signaling mechanisms in eukaryotic cells. A number of bacterial protein toxins, e.g. cholera toxin, pertussis toxin (PTx), or Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT), target heterotrimeric G proteins and have been used to stimulate or block specific signaling pathways or to demonstrate the contribution of their target proteins in cellular effects. PMT is a major virulence factor of P. multocida causing pasteurellosis in man and animals and is responsible for atrophic rhinitis in pigs. PMT modulates various signaling pathways, including phospholipase Cβ and RhoA, by acting on the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαq and Gα12/13, respectively. Here we report that PMT is a powerful activator of Gi protein. We show that PMT decreases basal isoproterenol and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in intact Swiss 3T3 cells, inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity in cell membrane preparations, and enhances the inhibition of cAMP accumulation caused by lysophosphatidic acid via endothelial differentiation gene receptors. PMT-mediated inhibition of cAMP production is independent of toxin activation of Gαq and/or Gα12/13.

As shown in Fig. 1A, PMT inhibited cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner, with half-maximal effect at concentrations of 30-100 pm. This inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was specific for PMT because treatment of cells with the inactive toxin mutant PMTC1165S had no effect. To exclude the possibility that PMT interferes with the β-adrenoreceptor-Gs coupling, we studied the effect of PMT on forskolin-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP accumulation. Similar to that observed with isoproterenol, wild-type, but not inactive mutant, PMT potently blocked cAMP accumulation (Fig. 1B). Additionally, we measured the activity of adenylyl cyclase in membrane preparations from MEFs, which were pretreated with or without PMT, then stimulated with forskolin or isoproterenol, and adenylyl cyclase activity was determined. Hormone-stimulated membranes of PMT-pretreated MEFs likewise showed diminished adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 1, C and D). Because determination of adenylyl cyclase activity was performed in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, the data indicate that a decrease in cAMP production observed after PMT treatment was not because of enhanced hydrolysis of cAMP. Next we compared the PMT-induced inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation to that of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which acts as an agonist of Gi-coupled endothelial differentiation gene receptors. LPA induced an immediate inhibition of isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2A). This effect was attenuated with time because of receptor desensitization and/or degradation of LPA. In contrast, PMT-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation occurred after a lag time of about 60 min (Fig. 2A). The latency of the effect of PMT is probably because of the time of toxin uptake. Additionally, we tested the effect of combined treatment of PMT and LPA on cAMP accumulation. After prolonged treatment of MEFs with PMT, LPA had no additional inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity. However, at sub-maximal concentrations both agents synergistically decreased cAMP accumulation. Whereas LPA (100 nm) or PMT (10 pm) alone only marginally inhibited cAMP accumulation at low doses, a strong inhibition was observed in the presence of both agents (Fig. 2B). To exclude the possibility that the effect of PMT on cAMP accumulation was because of cross-talk between Gi and the known PMT targets Gq and G12/13, we examined the effects of the toxin on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in Gαq/11- or in Gα12/13-deficient MEFs. As was found for wild-type MEFs, PMT inhibited cAMP accumulation in Gαq/11-deficient cells (Fig. 3A) as well as in Gα12/13-deficient cells (Fig. 3B). PMT inhibition of cAMP accumulation occurred in Gα12/13-deficient MEFs even in the presence of YM-254890, a specific inhibitor of Gαq/11 activation (32Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For control the inhibitory effect of YM-254890 on PMT-induced PLCβ activation was confirmed in Gα12/13-deficient MEF (Fig. 3B, inset). Additionally, we measured the activity of adenylyl cyclase in membrane preparations from Gαq/11- and Gα12/13-deficient MEFs, which were pretreated with or without PMT. Forskolin-stimulated membranes of PMT-pretreated Gαq/11- and Gα12/13-deficient MEFs likewise showed diminished adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, the PMT-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was not because of cross-talk between Gαi and Gαq/11 or Gα12/13. Instead, all these data indicated that Gαi, like Gαq and Gα12/13, was activated directly by PMT. PTx, which prevents interaction of Gi/o proteins with GPCRs by ADP-ribosylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue of Gαi/o (7Katada T. Ui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 8Murayama T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3319-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was employed to study the effects of uncoupling of Gi proteins from receptors on PMT-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation. As expected, the LPA-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation was abolished after overnight treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PTx (Fig. 4A), whereas PMT-induced inhibition of cAMP formation was still observed in cells pretreated with PTx. PTx-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Gi in Swiss 3T3 cell membranes was strongly inhibited by pretreatment with PMT (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Immunoblot analysis of the membranes from PMT-pretreated cells revealed that the total amount of Gi was not depleted (Fig. 4B). These data strongly support the view that PMT also activates Gi. Next, we studied the effect of PMT on the stimulation of steady-state GTPase activity of Gαi by LPA in membrane preparations. LPA increased GTP hydrolysis by up to 70% in membrane preparations from Swiss 3T3 cells, whereas pretreatment with PMT (1 nm) for 16 h reduced both basal and LPA-stimulated steady-state levels of GTPase activity in membrane preparations (Fig. 5A). The effect of PMT on LPA-induced GTPase activity was time-dependent and occurred after 1 h with complete inhibition after 3 h (supplemental Fig. S1). The observed increased GTP hydrolysis was mainly mediated through Gαi, because PTx blocked the GTPase stimulation by LPA (Fig. 5B). This effect was specific for PMT and was not observed after pretreatment of cells with the inactive toxin mutant (supplemental Fig. S1). A similar effect as that observed for LPA was found by using the wasp venom peptide mastoparan (supplemental Fig. S1), which is widely used to activate Gαi independently of GPCRs (33Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gil J. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally we studied the GPCR-induced GTPγS binding to Gαi (Fig. 5C). LPA induced a strong binding of GTPγS in membranes from untreated cells. The observed increased GTPγS binding was mainly through Gαi, because PTx blocked the LPA-stimulated binding of GTPγS. However, pretreatment of cells with PMT (1 nm) for 16 h reduced basal binding of GTPγS, and further stimulation of PMT-pretreated membranes with LPA did not restore GTPγS binding. There was no additional inhibition of basal and LPA-induced GTPγS binding after co-treatment of cells with maximal doses of PTx and PMT overnight. The 146-kDa Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is the primary virulence factor of P. multocida leading to various diseases, including atrophic rhinitis, which is characterized by turbinate bone loss in pigs (35Wilson B.A. Ho M.

Heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq and G13 families play pivotal roles in PMT-mediated signaling. Intoxication of mammalian cells by PMT increases total inositol phosphates because of activation of phospholipase Cβ via Gq (9Staddon J.M. Barker C.J. Murphy A.C. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Michell R.H.

Lang S. Taniguchi M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36701-36707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The effects of PMT on cAMP levels, in comparison with other second messengers, were studied previously (12Rozengurt E. Higgins T. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Staddon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Mullan P.B. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 959-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, those studies focused on the strong increase in inositol phosphate production caused by PMT-induced activation of PLC and apparently overlooked the inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Here we report that PMT treatment leads to inhibition of cAMP accumulation via stimulation of Gi signaling. Incubation of fibroblasts with PMT, followed by stimulation with the β-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol or with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, leads to dose-dependent inhibition of both receptor-dependent (isoproterenol) and receptor-independent (forskolin) cAMP accumulation. The EC50 values for PMT were in the same range as reported previously for the stimulation of the Gq-PLCβ pathway by the toxin (26Orth J.H. Lang S. Preuss I. Milligan G. Aktories K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of PMT on cAMP accumulation were not observed with the inactive PMTC1165S mutant. In addition, we found that both receptor-dependent and forskolin-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in membrane preparations of fibroblasts were inhibited by pretreatment with PMT. These findings indicated that PMT causes activation of Gi, which is in line with recent findings that the effects of PMT are persistent in membrane preparations of toxin-pretreated cells (26Orth J.H. Lang S. Preuss I. Milligan G. Aktories K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PTx is widely used to dissect Gi-dependent from Gi-independent signaling pathways (28Nürnberg B. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins, Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 47-60Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 37Ui M. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1990: 45-77Google Scholar). PTx ADP-ribosylates Cys-351 at the C terminus of Gαi, thereby disrupting G protein-coupled receptor signaling through Gi/o (7Katada T. Ui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 8Murayama T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3319-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that although PTx treatment of cells prevented receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation, PTx failed to block PMT-mediated inhibition. This finding is in agreement with our previous report (26Orth J.H. Lang S. Preuss I. Milligan G. Aktories K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), showing that PMT can still activate a Gαq mutant protein lacking its C terminus, which does not couple to GPCRs. Thus, receptor interaction is not needed for activation of G proteins by PMT. We also observed that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PMT inhibited PTx-induced ADP-ribosylation of Gi. It is known that PTx preferentially ADP-ribosylates Gi/o in its heterotrimeric form (38Katada T. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8182-8191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that activation of Gi/o by PMT most likely results in dissociation of the complex, presumably through release of the Gβγ subunits, and thereby decreases ADP-ribosylation by PTx. Identification of Gi as a target of PMT allowed us to study the effect of the toxin on the GTPase activity of Gi. Pretreatment of fibroblasts with PMT caused inhibition of basal and LPA-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Gi proteins. Because PTx inhibited basal GTPase activity to the same extent as PMT, we suggest that the basal GTPase activity is mainly because of Gi activity. PMT treatment also blocked GTPase activity by mastoparan, a GPCR-independent activator of Gi, excluding the possibility that GPCR desensitization resulted in the observed decrease in LPA stimulatory activity. These findings suggested that PMT-mediated activation of Gi and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase may be due to inhibition of the inherent GTPase activity of the G protein. However, when we studied the GPCR-induced GTPγS binding to Gαi, we found a strong inhibitory effect mediated by PMT. The observed PMT-mediated inhibition of Gi signaling was functionally comparable with the uncoupling of receptor-Gi signaling mediated by PTx. Thus, whereas PTx uncouples Gi from its GPCR by locking Gi in the inactive heterotrimeric Gαβγ state, PMT activates Gi as shown by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, yet PMT action also leads to functional uncoupling of Gi from its GPCR. Although Gq and Gi are regulated by a GTPase cycle in a similar manner, studies of GTPase activity are much more tractable with Gαi than with Gαq/11, because the levels of Gi in cells, as well as the rates of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis, are significantly higher and more readily measured (39Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 87-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Identification of Gαi as a target of PMT will thus facilitate the elucidation of the underlying biochemical mechanism of PMT on its G protein targets. We anticipate that PMT activates Gq, G13 and Gi through a common mechanism. We thank Dr. S. Offermanns for the kind gift of Gα12/Gα13- and Gαq/Gα11-deficient MEFs and Dr. B.

Being positioned at the injectisome extremity, V proteins participate in the translocation process across the host cell plasma membrane. In this study, we demonstrate the assembly of V proteins into oligomeric doughnut-like complexes upon controlled refolding of the proteins in vitro. The oligomeric nature of refolded PcrV was revealed by size exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoresis, and native mass spectrometry, which ascertain the capacity of the protein to multimerize into higher-order species. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy performed on oligomers of both PcrV and LcrV revealed the presence of distinct structures with approximate internal and external diameters of 3-4 and 8-10 nm, respectively. The C-terminal helix, alpha12, of PcrV and notably the hydrophobic residues Val(255), Leu(262), and Leu(276) located within this helix, were shown to be crucial for oligomerization. Moreover, the corresponding mutant proteins produced in P. aeruginosa were found to be non-functional in in vivo type III-dependent cytotoxicity assays by directly affecting the correct assembly of PopB/D translocon within the host cell membranes. The detailed understanding of structure-function relationships of T3SS needle tip proteins will be of value in further developments of new vaccines and antimicrobials."

The steady-state ATPase rate and duration of GroES binding showed that the functional cycle of the truncated GroEL is extended by ∼2 s in comparison with that of the wild type, without interfering with the basic functions of GroEL. We have proposed a model for the functional cycle of GroEL, which consists of two rate-limiting steps of ∼3- and ∼5-s duration (Ueno, T., Taguchi, H., Tadakuma, H., Yoshida, M., and Funatsu, T.

We found that a 20-residue truncation of the C terminus extends the time until inorganic phosphate is generated and the time for arresting protein folding in the central cavity, i.e. the lifetime of the first rate-limiting step in the functional cycle, to an ∼5-s duration. These results suggest that the integrity of the C-terminal region facilitates the transition from the first to the second rate-limiting state.

The chaperonin GroEL is an essential molecular chaperone that mediates protein folding with its cofactor GroES in Escherichia coli. GroEL is composed of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits arranged in two heptameric rings stacked back-to-back, each contains a cavity. GroES consists of a dome-shaped heptameric ring of identical 10-kDa subunits and interacts with one or both GroEL rings in an ATP-regulated manner. The substrate protein is encapsulated in the GroEL cavity underneath GroES, where it folds during the time of ATP hydrolysis (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 2Horwich A.L. Fenton W.A. Chapman E. Farr G.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 115-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Each subunit of GroEL is divided into the following three distinct domains: apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains. The apical domain forms the entrance to the GroEL cavity and includes the residues involved in the binding to substrate proteins and GroES. The intermediate domain connects the equatorial and apical domains of each subunit. The equatorial domain, which is composed of N- and C-terminal regions, is involved in intra- and inter-ring contacts and contains the ATP-binding site (3Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C.

Recent studies have renewed interest in the functional role of the C-terminal region. An intriguing feature is the presence of Gly-Gly-Met (GGM) repeated sequences at the C terminus of GroEL. The sequence is strongly conserved among most GroEL homologues (7Brocchieri L. Karlin S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but its significance is unknown. Earlier studies have shown that up to 27 amino acids can be deleted from the C terminus without affecting E. coli viability in ideal growing conditions (8Burnett B.P. Horwich A.L. Low K.B. J.

On the contrary, Farr et al. (13Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5342-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported no acceleration in folding rate in GroEL mutants with elongated GGM repeat(s). Elad et al. (14Elad N. Farr G.W. Clare D.K.

Given that the C-terminal region is located in the central cavity, it is likely that the region contributes to maintaining the volume and the environment of the central cavity for proper protein folding. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that the C-terminal region is closely related to the rate of ATP hydrolysis (9McLennan N.F. Girshovich A.S. Lissin N.M. Charters Y. Masters M. Mol.

They also suggested that disturbance of the ATPase rate can affect the folding rate of substrate proteins within the cavity. Therefore, it is important to understand what the effects of the C-terminal region are on the functional cycle of GroEL. To this end, we constructed a C-terminal truncated mutant (termed ELtc20), 3The abbreviations used are:ELtc20GroEL mutant with 20-amino acid truncation from the C terminusLAα-lactalbuminrLAdisulfide bond-reduced form of LAELwtwild-type GroELES98CGroES mutant with a single cysteine added at the C terminus of each subunitIC5bio-ESES98C modified with IC5 and biotinZMWzero-mode waveguideGFPS65T mutant of green fluorescence proteinTMRtetramethylrhodamineBSAbovine serum albuminDTTdithiothreitol. 3The abbreviations used are:ELtc20GroEL mutant with 20-amino acid truncation from the C terminusLAα-lactalbuminrLAdisulfide bond-reduced form of LAELwtwild-type GroELES98CGroES mutant with a single cysteine added at the C terminus of each subunitIC5bio-ESES98C modified with IC5 and biotinZMWzero-mode waveguideGFPS65T mutant of green fluorescence proteinTMRtetramethylrhodamineBSAbovine serum albuminDTTdithiothreitol. which lacks the final 20 amino acid residues, and characterized it. ELtc20 was shown to have the basic functions of GroEL and the extended functional cycle (∼10 s) in comparison with that of the wild type (∼8 s). Previously, we proposed a model for the functional cycle of GroEL with two successive rate-limiting steps of ∼3 and ∼5 s duration (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic studies revealed that the C-terminal truncation extends the lifetime of the first rate-limiting step to ∼5 s. From these results, we suggest the notion that the integrity of the C-terminal region facilitates the transition from the first to the second rate-limiting state in the functional cycle.

PCR amplification was conducted with KOD-Plus- (Toyobo) using the plasmid pET-EL as a template (18Motojima F. Makio T. Aoki K. Makino Y. Kuwajima K. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The labeled ES98C (IC5bio-ES) was separated from unreacted reagents by a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare). The extent of labeling was estimated according to the following procedure. The concentration of IC5 was determined spectrophotometrically at 645 nm with an extinction coefficient of 178,000 m-1 cm-1. The concentration of ES98C was determined using the Lowry method (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad). The molar ratio of IC5 to the ES98C heptamer was 1.8 throughout the study. ELwt and ELtc20 were labeled with Cy3 monofunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester in HKM buffer containing 20 mm sodium bicarbonate to raise the pH (∼8.7). Labeling resulted in a stoichiometry of ∼1.1 Cy3 dye molecules per GroEL tetradecamer. Fluorescent-labeled GroEL and ES98C exhibited behavior similar to the wild-type proteins (data not shown). LA (300 μm) was treated with HKM buffer containing 7.5 mm DTT for 15 min at room temperature. The disulfide bond-reduced form of LA (rLA) is known to bind strongly to GroEL (18Motojima F. Makio T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Pepsin (300 μm) was dissolved in HKM buffer and was used as denatured pepsin, because it is known to lose its native conformation at a neutral pH and interact with GroEL (20Aoki K. Taguchi H.

The GFP employed in this study is the S65T mutant (22Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). It was expressed and purified as described previously (23Makino Y. Amada K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). GFP (20 μm) was denatured in HKM buffer containing 100 mm HCl at room temperature for 2 min. Steady-state ATPase Rate Measurements—Steady-state ATPase rate of GroEL was measured at 23 °C with an ATP-regeneration system (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The assay mixture consisted of HKM buffer containing 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 100 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 100 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2.5 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP in the presence or absence of 500 nm GroES. 4Unless otherwise stated, wild-type GroES was used in assays. After a 1-min incubation, ATP hydrolysis was initiated by the injection of 100 nm GroEL into the vigorously stirred mixture. After incubation for 200 s, the denatured protein (75 μm rLA, 75 μm denatured pepsin, or 1 μm denatured rhodanese) was diluted into the assay mixture. The decreases in the absorbance at 340 nm, because of oxidation of NADH, were monitored continuously with a spectrophotometer (V-550, Jasco). Steady-state ATPase activity was determined from the slope of the absorbance decrease with time. Measurements were repeated in triplicate. Sample Preparation for Microscopy—Zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) were fabricated in a 100-nm-thick aluminum film deposited on a concaved quartz coverslip. The detailed procedures are reported elsewhere (25Miyake T. Tanii T. Sonobe H. Akahori R. Shimamoto N. Ueno T. Funatsu T. Ohdomari I. Anal. Chem. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The ZMW holes used in this study were ∼90 nm in diameter and ∼160 nm in depth (Fig. 2A). The coverslip with ZMWs was placed in an oxygen plasma asher to clean the surfaces before use. A flow cell was constructed from the glass slide and coverslip with ZMWs separated by two spaces of ∼50 μm thickness. IC5bio-ES was immobilized on the bottom of ZMWs via biotinylated BSA and streptavidin as described previously (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). First, 3.0 mg/ml biotinylated BSA was injected into the flow cell. The cell was washed by HKM buffer. Infusion and washing were repeated as follows: infusion of 0.33 mg/ml streptavidin, washing with HKM buffer, infusion of 25 nm IC5bio-ES, washing with HKM buffer and HKM buffer containing 10 nm Cy3-labeled GroEL, the oxygen scavenger system (25 mm glucose, 2.5 μm glucose oxidase, 10 nm catalase, and 10 mm DTT), 75 μm rLA, and 2 mm ATP. Microscopy and Data Analyses—Single molecules in ZMWs were observed by using an epi-illumination configuration in an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus). The surface-immobilized IC5bio-ES was illuminated with a red solid-state laser (87.5 microwatts, 635 nm; Coherent). Cy3-labeled GroEL molecules were excited with a green solid-state laser (250 microwatts, 532 nm, COMPASS315M-100; Coherent). Fluorescence was collected through an oil-immersion objective (ApoN 60×OTIRFM, NA 1.49; Olympus) on a microscope equipped with a custom-made dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology) and emission filters (605AF80 for Cy3 detection and HQ700/75 for IC5 detection). Fluorescence images were recorded every 200 ms for 5 min with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) camera (C9100-13, Hamamatsu Photonics). At least two fields of images were recorded for 5 min in each assay, and statistical analysis was made from 11 to 14 independent assays. Observations were carried out at 23 °C. The positions of IC5bio-ES were marked using a program specifically developed to interface with the Halcon image processor (MVTec Software GmbH) as described previously (26Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The duration of GroEL-GroES binding was determined by marking the association and dissociation events of Cy3-labeled GroEL molecules. Nonspecific binding of Cy3-labeled GroEL to the glass surface was observed as a flickering spot with a short duration (<1 s) and occurred randomly at all apertures in the observation field. For each analysis, the nonspecific binding of Cy3-labeled GroEL around the position of GroES (25-27% of the total binding events) was subtracted. Rate constants were determined by fitting to the resulting histograms using Equation 1 (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar),N(t)=C{-exp(-k1t)+exp(-k2t)}(Eq. 1) where N(t) is the number of GroEL molecules bound to GroES at time t, and t is the duration of binding of GroEL to GroES (termed on-time), respectively; in addition, k1 and k2 are the rate constants of a two-step reaction, respectively. C means that C = N·k1·k2/(k1 - k2), where N is the total number of GroEL bound to GroES. Henceforth, data fitting was carried out using the Kaleidagraph program (version 3.6; Synergy Software). Initial Kinetic Measurement of ATP Hydrolysis—The amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) produced was measured with the malachite green assay at 23 °C (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). GroEL (3 μm) was incubated in HKM buffer containing rLA (150 μm) and 10 mm DTT in the presence or absence of GroES (9 μm) for 5 min at 23 °C, while being continuously mixed. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the same volume (35 μl) of HKM buffer containing 0.4 mm ATP. At the indicated times, ice-cold perchloric acid (5%) was added to the mixture and then centrifuged to remove protein precipitates. The supernatant was treated with a malachite green reagent, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured. Rate constants were determined by fitting to the data using the following equations (Equation 2, in the absence of GroES; Equation 3, in the presence of GroES) (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar),[PL]t=7k[EL]t(Eq. 2) [PL]t=7k1[EL](k2t-k1/(k1+k2)(exp{-(k1+k2t)}-1))/(k1+k2)(Eq. 3) where [EL] is the concentration of GroEL tetradecamer, and [Pi]t is the concentration of Pi at time t, respectively; in addition, k, k1, and k2 are the rate constants, respectively. Fluorometric Monitoring of GFP Refolding—The denatured GFP (100 nm) was diluted 200-fold in the refolding buffer (HKM buffer plus 5 mm DTT) containing GroEL (150 nm) and GroES (1.5 μm). After a 50-s incubation, ATP (0.45 mm) was injected into the mixture using a microsyringe to initiate the refolding mediated by GroEL (time 0). Spontaneous refolding was initiated by injecting acid-denatured GFP into the refolding buffer (time 0). The fluorescence of GFP at 512 nm with excitation at 485 nm was continuously monitored with an interval of 0.01 s using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer. The reaction mixtures were continuously stirred at 23 °C throughout the assays. The dead time of the mixing was about 400 ms. The resultant fluorescence profiles for the first 30 s in the assay were analyzed as described previously (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The rate constants were calculated by fitting to the fluorescence profiles using the following equations (Equation 4, in the absence of GroEL and GroES; Equation 5, in the presence of GroEL and GroES) (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar),I(t)=I(∞){1-exp(-kfoldt)}(Eq. 4) I(t)=I(∞)(1-{kfoldexp(-k1t)-k1exp(-kfoldt)}/(kfold-k1))(Eq. 5) in which I(t) and I(∞) are the fluorescence intensities of GFP at time t and the infinite time, respectively; in addition, k1 and kfold are the rate constants at each step, respectively. The rate constants were the average values from three independent experiments. Stopped-flow Anisotropy Measurements—Rhodanese (60 μm) was mixed with a 10-fold amount of TMR-maleimide in TKE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 6 m guanidine-HCl. Unreacted dye was removed by PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), and the extent of the labeling was determined by absorption spectroscopy using the following extinction coefficients (in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride): rhodanese, 49,000 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm; TMR, 94,000 m-1 cm-1 at 558 nm. Approximately 0.85 mol of TMR were coupled per mol of denatured rhodanese. The denatured TMR-labeled rhodanese (27.8 μm) was diluted 100-fold in TKE buffer with 116 nm GroEL. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the aggregated rhodanese was removed by centrifugation. Then the supernatant was applied to a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare), and GroEL complexed with TMR-rhodanese was isolated. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out at 23 °C using an SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with an FP.1 accessory (Applied Photophysics). A solution of 1 μm GroEL complexed with TMR-rhodanese and 5 mm DTT in HKM buffer was loaded into one syringe of the stopped-flow device. A solution of HKM buffer containing 2 μm GroES and 5 mm DTT with or without 10 mm ATP was loaded into the other syringe. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes from each syringe. Excitation was done with vertically polarized light at 515 nm (bandwidth 18.6 nm). Two photomultiplier tubes, both with 550 nm long pass filters (OG550, Schott), were used to monitor the vertical and horizontal polarized emission components simultaneously. Fluorescence anisotropy data were collected with a 50-s log time base. The dead time of the mixing was about 20 ms. The time trajectories of anisotropy shown were the average of 29-34 individual shots. The trajectories were fitted with Equation 6 (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar),A(t)=A4+(A1+A4)exp(-k0t)+(A2+A4)k1/(k0/-k1){exp(-k1t)-exp(-k0t)}+(A3-A4)k0k1/(k0-k1)/(k1-k2')/(k0-k2'){(k1-k2')exp(-k0t)-(k0-k2')exp(-k1t)+(k0-k1)exp(-k2't)}(Eq. 6) where A1 - A4 are the anisotropy values at each step, and A(t) is the anisotropy value at time t, respectively; in addition, k0, k1, and k′2 are the rate constants of a three-step reaction, respectively. Truncation of the C-terminal Region Extends the GroEL ATPase Cycle—To examine the role of the C-terminal region in the function cycle of GroEL, we constructed a C-terminal truncated mutant (named as ELtc20), which lacks the final 20 amino acid residues. ELtc20 was expressed in E. coli, and was purified in the same manner as the wild type (termed ELwt). The truncation had no effect on the oligomer formation and slightly decreased the yield in assisted folding of GFP and malate dehydrogenase (data not shown). We first examined the steady-state ATPase rates of ELwt and ELtc20 in the presence or absence of saturating amounts of GroES and substrate proteins (Fig. 1). GroES is known to decrease by about one-half the rate of ATP hydrolysis by GroEL (18Motojima F. Makio T. Aoki K. Makino Y. Kuwajima K. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The presence of GroES suppressed the steady-state ATPase rate of ELwt by ∼37% (Fig. 1, open bar). The comparable suppression by GroES (∼35%) was observed in ELtc20 (Fig. 1, filled bar). As reported previously (27Aoki K. Motojima F. Taguchi H. Yomo T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13755-13758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L.

Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), when substrate proteins such as rLA, denatured pepsin, and denatured rhodanese were present, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was enhanced (Fig. 1, open bar). Similarly, the presence of substrate proteins increased in the ATPase rate of ELtc20 (Fig. 1, filled bar). From these results, ELtc20 is considered to have the normal “accelerator” and “brake” for its ATPase rate. However, ELtc20 showed an ∼20% reduction in its steady-state ATPase rate irrespective of the presence of GroES and substrate proteins (p < 0.01, Student's t test). The rates of ELwt and ELtc20 in the presence of GroES and rLA or denatured rhodanese were ∼0.12 and ∼0.10 s-1, respectively. These results suggest that the truncation of the C-terminal region extends the ATPase cycle without impairing the enzyme properties. Truncation of the C-terminal Region Extends the Duration of GroES Binding to GroEL—We previously demonstrated single-molecule imaging of the association and dissociation of the GroEL-GroES complex in the functional GroEL cycle. The dissociation of GroES from GroEL was observed to proceed as a two-step process with rate constants of ∼0.3 and ∼0.2 s-1, respectively (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To confirm whether ELtc20 retains the same mechanism to interact with GroES as ELwt, the interaction between ELtc20 and GroES was observed at the single-molecule level (Fig. 2, B-D). In previous studies, biotinylated GroEL was immobilized to the glass surface, and the association and dissociation of fluorescently labeled GroES to and from GroEL were observed (17Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, the interaction was observed between surface-immobilized GroES, a cysteine-introduced variant (ES98C) (19Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) modified with IC5 and biotin (termed IC5bio-ES) and Cy3-labeled GroEL in the presence of saturating amounts of rLA 5Substitution of Asp-490 for cysteine in ELtc20 showed an ∼75% reduction of ATPase activity compared with ELtc20.

https://openalex.org/W1967282262,"Calmodulin (CaM), a eukaryotic calcium sensor that regulates diverse biological activities, consists of N- and C-terminal globular domains (N-CaM and C-CaM, respectively). CaM serves as the activator of CyaA, a 188-kDa adenylyl cyclase toxin secreted by Bordetella pertussis, which is the etiologic agent for whooping cough. Upon insertion of the N-terminal adenylyl cyclase domain (ACD) of CyaA to its targeted eukaryotic cells, CaM binds to this domain tightly ( approximately 200 pm affinity). This interaction activates the adenylyl cyclase activity of CyaA, leading to a rise in intracellular cAMP levels to disrupt normal cellular signaling. We recently solved the structure of CyaA-ACD in complex with C-CaM to elucidate the mechanism of catalytic activation. However, the structure of the interface between N-CaM and CyaA, the formation of which contributes a 400-fold increase of binding affinity between CyaA and CaM, remains elusive. Here, we used site-directed mutations and molecular dynamic simulations to generate several working models of CaM-bound CyaA-ACD. The validity of these models was evaluated by disulfide bond cross-linking, point mutations, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. Our study reveals that a beta-hairpin region (amino acids 259-273) of CyaA-ACD likely makes contacts with the second calcium binding motif of the extended CaM. This mode of interaction differs from the interaction of N-CaM with anthrax edema factor, which binds N-CaM via its helical domain. Thus, two structurally conserved, bacterial adenylyl cyclase toxins have evolved to utilize distinct binding surfaces and modes of activation in their interaction with CaM, a highly conserved eukaryotic signaling protein."
https://openalex.org/W1975440932,"Previous studies have demonstrated that Bcl10 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10) is essential for T cell receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation and subsequent proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL2) production. However, here we demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, Bcl10 is differentially required for T cell activation, including for both proliferation and cytokine production. When CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were divided based on expression levels of CD44, which distinguishes naïve cells (CD44lo) versus those that are antigen-experienced (CD44hi), IL2 production by and proliferation of CD4+CD44lo naïve cells and both subpopulations of CD8+ T cells were clearly Bcl10-dependent, whereas these same functional properties of CD4+CD44hi T cells occurred largely independent of Bcl10. As with the other subpopulations of T cells, CD4+CD44hi T cells did not activate the NF-kappaB pathway in the absence of Bcl10; nevertheless, these CD4+CD44hi antigen-experienced T cells efficiently secreted IL2 after T cell receptor stimulation. Strikingly, therefore, T cell receptor-mediated IL2 production in these cells is NF-kappaB-independent. Our studies suggest that antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells differ from their naïve counterparts and from CD8+ T cells in their ability to achieve activation independent of the Bcl10/NF-kappaB pathway."
