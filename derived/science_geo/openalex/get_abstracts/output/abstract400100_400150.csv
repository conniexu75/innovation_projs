https://openalex.org/W1967761143,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics instructors have been charged with improving the performance and retention of students from diverse backgrounds. To date, programs that close the achievement gap between students from disadvantaged versus nondisadvantaged educational backgrounds have required extensive extramural funding. We show that a highly structured course design, based on daily and weekly practice with problem-solving, data analysis, and other higher-order cognitive skills, improved the performance of all students in a college-level introductory biology class and reduced the achievement gap between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged students--without increased expenditures. These results support the Carnegie Hall hypothesis: Intensive practice, via active-learning exercises, has a disproportionate benefit for capable but poorly prepared students."

https://openalex.org/W2039227019,"Epistasis has substantial impacts on evolution, in particular, the rate of adaptation. We generated combinations of beneficial mutations that arose in a lineage during rapid adaptation of a bacterium whose growth depended on a newly introduced metabolic pathway. The proportional selective benefit for three of the four loci consistently decreased when they were introduced onto more fit backgrounds. These three alleles all reduced morphological defects caused by expression of the foreign pathway. A simple theoretical model segregating the apparent contribution of individual alleles to benefits and costs effectively predicted the interactions between them. These results provide the first evidence that patterns of epistasis may differ for within- and between-gene interactions during adaptation and that diminishing returns epistasis contributes to the consistent observation of decelerating fitness gains during adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2094545983,"Landauer's erasure principle, a widely accepted part of classical information theory first proposed by Rolf Landauer in 1961, asserts that it is necessary to perform work in order to erase data. This occurs when carrying out irreversible operations, thus releasing heat to the environment. For example, in electronics, heat generation is a major obstacle to circuitry miniaturization. Del Rio et al. show that the situation is completely different in the presence of quantum information about the system, and the implications of Landauer's principle are invalid. The more that is known about a system, the less it costs to erase it. An observer who is strongly correlated with a system may even gain work while erasing it, therefore cooling the environment. The quantum systems needed to experimentally demonstrate these results are, in principle, accessible with current technology. The heat generated by computations is not only an obstacle to circuit miniaturization but also a fundamental aspect of the relationship between information theory and thermodynamics. In principle, reversible operations may be performed at no energy cost; given that irreversible computations can always be decomposed into reversible operations followed by the erasure of data1,2, the problem of calculating their energy cost is reduced to the study of erasure. Landauer’s principle states that the erasure of data stored in a system has an inherent work cost and therefore dissipates heat3,4,5,6,7,8. However, this consideration assumes that the information about the system to be erased is classical, and does not extend to the general case where an observer may have quantum information about the system to be erased, for instance by means of a quantum memory entangled with the system. Here we show that the standard formulation and implications of Landauer’s principle are no longer valid in the presence of quantum information. Our main result is that the work cost of erasure is determined by the entropy of the system, conditioned on the quantum information an observer has about it. In other words, the more an observer knows about the system, the less it costs to erase it. This result gives a direct thermodynamic significance to conditional entropies, originally introduced in information theory. Furthermore, it provides new bounds on the heat generation of computations: because conditional entropies can become negative in the quantum case, an observer who is strongly correlated with a system may gain work while erasing it, thereby cooling the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1986122165,"Cryptic variation is caused by the robustness of phenotypes to mutations. Cryptic variation has no effect on phenotypes in a given genetic or environmental background, but it can have effects after mutations or environmental change. Because evolutionary adaptation by natural selection requires phenotypic variation, phenotypically revealed cryptic genetic variation may facilitate evolutionary adaptation. This is possible if the cryptic variation happens to be pre-adapted, or ""exapted"", to a new environment, and is thus advantageous once revealed. However, this facilitating role for cryptic variation has not been proven, partly because most pertinent work focuses on complex phenotypes of whole organisms whose genetic basis is incompletely understood. Here we show that populations of RNA enzymes with accumulated cryptic variation adapt more rapidly to a new substrate than a population without cryptic variation. A detailed analysis of our evolving RNA populations in genotype space shows that cryptic variation allows a population to explore new genotypes that become adaptive only in a new environment. Our observations show that cryptic variation contains new genotypes pre-adapted to a changed environment. Our results highlight the positive role that robustness and epistasis can have in adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2058802596,"In the past two decades, a variety of single-cell organisms have been found living within Earth's crust, forming what has become known as the deep subsurface biosphere. A new report describes the first multicellular creatures from this biosphere — nematode worms, including one new to science. Up to around half a millimetre in length, the worms feed on bacteria, reproduce without mating by parthenogenesis and tolerate the high temperatures found in their habitat, 3 kilometres deep in the Beatrix gold mine in South Africa. Similar organisms might be expected to occur in certain sub-seafloor settings, and the viability of multicellular life in such a hostile environment will also be of relevance to astrobiology. Since its discovery over two decades ago, the deep subsurface biosphere has been considered to be the realm of single-cell organisms, extending over three kilometres into the Earth’s crust and comprising a significant fraction of the global biosphere1,2,3,4. The constraints of temperature, energy, dioxygen and space seemed to preclude the possibility of more-complex, multicellular organisms from surviving at these depths. Here we report species of the phylum Nematoda that have been detected in or recovered from 0.9–3.6-kilometre-deep fracture water in the deep mines of South Africa but have not been detected in the mining water. These subsurface nematodes, including a new species, Halicephalobus mephisto, tolerate high temperature, reproduce asexually and preferentially feed upon subsurface bacteria. Carbon-14 data indicate that the fracture water in which the nematodes reside is 3,000–12,000-year-old palaeometeoric water. Our data suggest that nematodes should be found in other deep hypoxic settings where temperature permits, and that they may control the microbial population density by grazing on fracture surface biofilm patches. Our results expand the known metazoan biosphere and demonstrate that deep ecosystems are more complex than previously accepted. The discovery of multicellular life in the deep subsurface of the Earth also has important implications for the search for subsurface life on other planets in our Solar System."
https://openalex.org/W2149461468,"Type 1 pili are the archetypal representative of a widespread class of adhesive multisubunit fibres in Gram-negative bacteria. During pilus assembly, subunits dock as chaperone-bound complexes to an usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus translocation across the outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length FimD usher bound to the FimC–FimH chaperone–adhesin complex and that of the unbound form of the FimD translocation domain. The FimD–FimC–FimH structure shows FimH inserted inside the FimD 24-stranded β-barrel translocation channel. FimC–FimH is held in place through interactions with the two carboxy-terminal periplasmic domains of FimD, a binding mode confirmed in solution by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To accommodate FimH, the usher plug domain is displaced from the barrel lumen to the periplasm, concomitant with a marked conformational change in the β-barrel. The amino-terminal domain of FimD is observed in an ideal position to catalyse incorporation of a newly recruited chaperone–subunit complex. The FimD–FimC–FimH structure provides unique insights into the pilus subunit incorporation cycle, and captures the first view of a protein transporter in the act of secreting its cognate substrate. Gram-negative bacteria express appendages known as pili on their outer surfaces that are used for attachment and invasion of host cells. The chaperone–usher pili are assembled at the outer membrane by a periplasmic chaperone and an outer-membrane, pore-forming protein called the usher. Gabriel Waksman and colleagues present a high-resolution crystal structure of the usher (FimD) from uropathogenic Escherichia coli bound to a translocating substrate (FimH adhesin). The structure provides insight into the activation mechanism of an archetypal protein transporter, and may inform the design of drugs capable of disrupting type 1 pilus formation and potentially inhibiting cystitis."

https://openalex.org/W1967042670,"A blood cell type termed crystal cell in Drosophila functions in clotting and wound healing and requires Notch for specification and maintenance. We report that crystal cells express elevated levels of Sima protein orthologous to mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor-α (Hif-α) even under conditions of normal oxygen availability. In these platelet-like crystal cells, Sima activates full-length Notch receptor signaling via a noncanonical, ligand-independent mechanism that promotes hemocyte survival during both normal hematopoietic development and hypoxic stress. This interaction initiates in early endosomes, is independent of Hif-β (Τangο in Drosophila), and does not activate hypoxia response targets. Studies in vertebrate myeloid cells have shown a similar up-regulation of Hif-α protein in well-oxygenated environments. This study provides a mechanistic paradigm for Hif-α/Notch interaction that may be conserved in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2143179963,"Female blood-feeding mosquitoes in search of a meal are attracted by carbon dioxide exhaled in the breath of their vertebrate hosts. The CO2 detection machinery is a tempting target in the search for ways of disrupting disease transmission by insect vectors. Anandasankar Ray and colleagues have now identified volatile odorants that modify the CO2 detection pathway in the three deadliest mosquito species (Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus), and demonstrate the ability of odorants to disrupt CO2-mediated attraction behaviour. One compound has the novel property of causing ultra-prolonged activation of CO2-detecting nerve cells, with brief exposure resulting in prolonged disorientation. Others mimic or inhibit CO2-sensing. Compounds used in this proof-of-principle experiment, such as 2,3-butanedione, have properties that preclude use on humans, but this work could lead to the development of a new generation of insect repellents and lures that can work in small quantities. Carbon dioxide (CO2) present in exhaled air is the most important sensory cue for female blood-feeding mosquitoes, causing activation of long-distance host-seeking flight, navigation towards the vertebrate host1 and, in the case of Aedes aegypti, increased sensitivity to skin odours2. The CO2 detection machinery is therefore an ideal target to disrupt host seeking. Here we use electrophysiological assays to identify a volatile odorant that causes an unusual, ultra-prolonged activation of CO2-detecting neurons in three major disease-transmitting mosquitoes: Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus and A. aegypti. Importantly, ultra-prolonged activation of these neurons severely compromises their ability subsequently to detect CO2 for several minutes. We also identify odours that strongly inhibit CO2-sensitive neurons as candidates for use in disruption of host-seeking behaviour, as well as an odour that evokes CO2-like activity and thus has potential use as a lure in trapping devices. Analysis of responses to panels of structurally related odours across the three mosquitoes and Drosophila, which have related CO2-receptor proteins, reveals a pattern of inhibition that is often conserved. We use video tracking in wind-tunnel experiments to demonstrate that the novel ultra-prolonged activators can completely disrupt CO2-mediated activation as well as source-finding behaviour in Aedes mosquitoes, even after the odour is no longer present. Lastly, semi-field studies demonstrate that use of ultra-prolonged activators disrupts CO2-mediated hut entry behaviour of Culex mosquitoes. The three classes of CO2-response-modifying odours offer powerful instruments for developing new generations of insect repellents and lures, which even in small quantities can interfere with the ability of mosquitoes to seek humans."
https://openalex.org/W2093739574,"Background T helper 17 cells (TH-17) represent a lineage of effector T cells critical in host defence and autoimmunity. In both mouse and human IL-1β has been indicated as a key cytokine for the commitment to TH-17 cells. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a group of inflammatory diseases associated with mutations of the NLRP3 gene encoding the inflammasome component cryopyrin. In this work we asked whether the deregulated secretion of IL-1β secondary to mutations characterizing these patients could affect the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 11 CAPS, 26 systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) patients and 20 healthy controls were analyzed. Serum levels of IL-17 and IL-6 serum were assessed by ELISA assay. Frequency of TH17 cells was quantified upon staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) stimulation. Secretion of IL-1β, IL-23 and IL-6 by monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs), were quantified by ELISA assay. A total of 8 CAPS and 11 SoJIA patients were also analysed before and after treatment with IL-1β blockade. Untreated CAPS patients showed significantly increased IL-17 serum levels as well as a higher frequency of TH17 compared to control subjects. On the contrary, SoJIA patients displayed a frequency of TH17 similar to normal donors, but were found to have significantly increased serum level of IL-6 when compared to CAPS patients or healthy donors. Remarkably, decreased IL-17 serum levels and TH17 frequency were observed in CAPS patients following in vivo IL-1β blockade. On the same line, MoDCs from CAPS patients exhibited enhanced secretion of IL-1β and IL-23 upon TLRs stimulation, with a reduction after anti-IL-1 treatment. Conclusion/Significance These findings further support the central role of IL-1β in the differentiation of TH17 in human inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2049698925,"The current study was designed to investigate the actions of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) on primordial follicle assembly. Ovarian primordial follicles develop from the breakdown of oocyte nests during fetal development for the human and immediately after birth in rodents. AMH was found to inhibit primordial follicle assembly and decrease the initial primordial follicle pool size in a rat ovarian organ culture. The AMH expression was found to be primarily in the stromal tissue of the ovaries at this period of development, suggesting a stromal-epithelial cell interaction for primordial follicle assembly. AMH was found to promote alterations in the ovarian transcriptome during primordial follicle assembly with over 200 genes with altered expression. A gene network was identified suggesting a potential central role for the Fgf2/Nudt6 antisense transcript in the follicle assembly process. A number of signal transduction pathways are regulated by AMH actions on the ovarian transcriptome, in particular the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFß) signaling process. AMH is the first hormone/protein shown to have an inhibitory action on primordial follicle assembly. Due to the critical role of the primordial follicle pool size for female reproduction, elucidation of factors, such as AMH, that regulate the assembly process will provide insights into potential therapeutics to manipulate the pool size and female reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2095022530,"Two-dimensional (2D) vibrational echo spectroscopy has previously been applied to structural determination of small peptides. Here we extend the technique to a more complex, biologically important system: the homodimeric transmembrane dimer from the α chain of the integrin α(IIb)β(3). We prepared micelle suspensions of the pair of 30-residue chains that span the membrane in the native structure, with varying levels of heavy ((13)C=(18)O) isotopes substituted in the backbone of the central 10th through 20th positions. The constraints derived from vibrational coupling of the precisely spaced heavy residues led to determination of an optimized structure from a range of model candidates: Glycine residues at the 12th, 15th, and 16th positions form a tertiary contact in parallel right-handed helix dimers with crossing angles of -58° ± 9° and interhelical distances of 7.7 ± 0.5 angstroms. The frequency correlation established the dynamical model used in the analysis, and it indicated the absence of mobile water associated with labeled residues. Delocalization of vibrational excitations between the helices was also quantitatively established."

https://openalex.org/W2002516194,"T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) is a newly identified negative immunomodulator that is up-regulated on dysfunctional T cells during viral infections. The expression and function of Tim-3 on human innate immune responses during HCV infection, however, remains poorly characterized. In this study, we report that Tim-3 is constitutively expressed on human resting CD14+ monocyte/macrophages (M/MØ) and functions as a cap to block IL-12, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine linking innate and adaptive immune responses. Tim-3 expression is significantly reduced and IL-12 expression increased upon stimulation with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand - lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR7/8 ligand - R848. Notably, Tim-3 is over-expressed on un-stimulated as well as TLR-stimulated M/MØ, which is inversely associated with the diminished IL-12 expression in chronically HCV-infected individuals when compared to healthy subjects. Up-regulation of Tim-3 and inhibition of IL-12 are also observed in M/MØ incubated with HCV-expressing hepatocytes, as well as in primary M/MØ or monocytic THP-1 cells incubated with HCV core protein, an effect that mimics the function of complement C1q and is reversible by blocking the HCV core/gC1qR interaction. Importantly, blockade of Tim-3 signaling significantly rescues HCV-mediated inhibition of IL-12, which is primarily expressed by Tim-3 negative M/MØ. Tim-3 blockade reduces HCV core-mediated expression of the negative immunoregulators PD-1 and SOCS-1 and increases STAT-1 phosphorylation. Conversely, blocking PD-1 or silencing SOCS-1 gene expression also decreases Tim-3 expression and enhances IL-12 secretion and STAT-1 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that Tim-3 plays a crucial role in negative regulation of innate immune responses, through crosstalk with PD-1 and SOCS-1 and limiting STAT-1 phosphorylation, and may be a novel target for immunotherapy to HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2050203280,"The N-myc downstream-regulated gene (NDRG) family consists of four related proteins, NDRG1-NDRG4, in mammals. We previously generated NDRG1-deficient mice that were unable to maintain myelin sheaths in peripheral nerves. This condition was consistent with human hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D, caused by a nonsense mutation of NDRG1. In contrast, the effects of genetic defects of the other NDRG members remain unknown. In this study, we focused on NDRG4, which is specifically expressed in the brain and heart. In situ mRNA hybridization on the brain revealed that NDRG4 was expressed in neurons of various areas. We generated NDRG4-deficient mice that were born normally with the expected Mendelian frequency. Immunochemical analysis demonstrated that the cortex of the NDRG4-deficient mice contained decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and normal levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, NGF, neurotrophin-3, and TGF-β1. Consistent with BDNF reduction, NDRG4-deficient mice had impaired spatial learning and memory but normal motor function in the Morris water maze test. When temporary focal ischemia of the brain was induced, the sizes of the infarct lesions were larger, and the neurological deficits were more severe in NDRG4-deficient mice compared with the control mice. These findings indicate that NDRG4 contributes to the maintenance of intracerebral BDNF levels within the normal range, which is necessary for the preservation of spatial learning and the resistance to neuronal cell death caused by ischemic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1987096120,"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) may be used for focal delivery of plasmids, drugs, cells, and other applications. Here we ask whether such particles are toxic to ocular structures.To evaluate the ocular toxicity of MNPs, we asked if either 50 nm or 4 µm magnetic particles affect intraocular pressure, corneal endothelial cell count, retinal morphology including both cell counts and glial activation, or photoreceptor function at different time points after injection. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 44) were injected in the left eye with either 50 nm (3 µl, 1.65 mg) or 4 µm (3 µl, 1.69 mg) magnetic particles, and an equal volume of PBS into the right eye. Electroretinograms (ERG) were used to determine if MNPs induce functional changes to the photoreceptor layers. Enucleated eyes were sectioned for histology and immunofluorescence.Compared to control-injected eyes, MNPs did not alter IOP measurements. ERG amplitudes for a-waves were in the 100-250 µV range and b-waves were in the 500-600 µV range, with no significant differences between injected and non-injected eyes. Histological sectioning and immunofluorescence staining showed little difference in MNP-injected animals compared to control eyes. In contrast, at 1 week, corneal endothelial cell numbers were significantly lower in the 4 µm magnetic particle-injected eyes compared to either 50 nm MNP- or PBS-injected eyes. Furthermore, iron deposition was detected after 4 µm magnetic particle but not 50 nm MNP injection.Intravitreal or anterior chamber injections of MNPs showed little to no signs of toxicity on retinal structure, photoreceptor function or aqueous drainage in the eye. Our results suggest that MNPs are safe for intraocular use."
https://openalex.org/W2073972954,"Mycobacteria have always proven difficult to identify due to their low growth rate and fastidious nature. Therefore molecular biology and more recently nanotechnology, have been exploited from early on for the detection of these pathogens. Here we present the first stage of development of an assay incorporating cadmium selenide quantum dots (QDs) for the detection of mycobacterial surface antigens. The principle of the assay is the separation of bacterial cells using magnetic beads coupled with genus-specific polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies for heparin-binding hemagglutinin. These complexes are then tagged with anti-mouse biotinylated antibody and finally streptavidin-conjugated QDs which leads to the detection of a fluorescent signal. For the evaluation of performance, the method under study was applied on Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (positive controls), as well as E. coli and Salmonella spp. that constituted the negative controls. The direct observation of the latter category of samples did not reveal fluorescence as opposed to the mycobacteria mentioned above. The minimum detection limit of the assay was defined to 104 bacteria/ml, which could be further decreased by a 1 log when fluorescence was measured with a spectrofluorometer. The method described here can be easily adjusted for any other protein target of either the pathogen or the host, and once fully developed it will be directly applicable on clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W2006576740,"The cascade of molecular events involved in mammalian sex determination has been shown to involve the SRY gene, but specific downstream events have eluded researchers for decades. The current study identifies one of the first direct downstream targets of the male sex determining factor SRY as the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TCF21. SRY was found to bind to the Tcf21 promoter and activate gene expression. Mutagenesis of SRY/SOX9 response elements in the Tcf21 promoter eliminated the actions of SRY. SRY was found to directly associate with the Tcf21 promoter SRY/SOX9 response elements in vivo during fetal rat testis development. TCF21 was found to promote an in vitro sex reversal of embryonic ovarian cells to induce precursor Sertoli cell differentiation. TCF21 and SRY had similar effects on the in vitro sex reversal gonadal cell transcriptomes. Therefore, SRY acts directly on the Tcf21 promoter to in part initiate a cascade of events associated with Sertoli cell differentiation and embryonic testis development."
https://openalex.org/W2023408201,"We analyse data from the early epidemic of H1N1-2009 in New Zealand, and estimate the reproduction number . We employ a renewal process which accounts for imported cases, illustrate some technical pitfalls, and propose a novel estimation method to address these pitfalls. Explicitly accounting for the infection-age distribution of imported cases and for the delay in transmission dynamics due to international travel, was estimated to be (95% confidence interval: ). Hence we show that a previous study, which did not account for these factors, overestimated . Our approach also permitted us to examine the infection-age at which secondary transmission occurs as a function of calendar time, demonstrating the downward bias during the beginning of the epidemic. These technical issues may compromise the usefulness of a well-known estimator of - the inverse of the moment-generating function of the generation time given the intrinsic growth rate.

https://openalex.org/W2088563616,"Levels of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have widely been used as biomarker for angiogenic activity in cancer. For this purpose, non-standardized measurements in plasma and serum were used, without correction for artificial VEGF release by platelets activated ex vivo. We hypothesize that ""true"" circulating (c)VEGF levels in most cancer patients are low and unrelated to cancer load or tumour angiogenesis.We determined VEGF levels in PECT, a medium that contains platelet activation inhibitors, in citrate plasma, and in isolated platelets in 16 healthy subjects, 18 patients with metastatic non-renal cancer (non-RCC) and 12 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In non-RCC patients, circulating plasma VEGF levels were low and similar to VEGF levels in controls if platelet activation was minimized during the harvest procedure by PECT medium. In citrate plasma, VEGF levels were elevated in non-RCC patients, but this could be explained by a combination of increased platelet activation during blood harvesting, and by a two-fold increase in VEGF content of individual platelets (controls: 3.4 IU/10(6), non-RCC: 6.2 IU/10(6) platelets, p = 0.001). In contrast, cVEGF levels in RCC patients were elevated (PECT plasma: 64 pg/ml vs. 21 pg/ml, RCC vs. non-RCC, p<0.0001), and not related to platelet VEGF concentration.Our findings suggest that ""true"" freely cVEGF levels are not elevated in the majority of cancer patients. Previously reported elevated plasma VEGF levels in cancer appear to be due to artificial release from activated platelets, which in cancer have an increased VEGF content, during the blood harvest procedure. Only in patients with RCC, which is characterized by excessive VEGF production due to a specific genetic defect, were cVEGF levels elevated. This observation may be related to limited and selective success of anti-VEGF agents, such as bevacizumab and sorafenib, as monotherapy in RCC compared to other forms of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2046155613,"Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) plays a significant role in regulation of energy balance, food intake, physical activity and body weight in humans and rodents. Several association studies for human obesity showed contrary results concerning the SNPs rs133072 (G/A) and rs133073 (T/C), which localize to the first exon of MCHR1. The variations constitute two main haplotypes (GT, AC). Both SNPs affect CpG dinucleotides, whereby each haplotype contains a potential methylation site at one of the two SNP positions. In addition, 15 CpGs in close vicinity of these SNPs constitute a weak CpG island. Here, we studied whether DNA methylation in this sequence context may contribute to population- and age-specific effects of MCHR1 alleles in obesity.We analyzed DNA methylation of a 315 bp region of MCHR1 encompassing rs133072 and rs133073 and the CpG island in blood samples of 49 individuals by bisulfite sequencing. The AC haplotype shows a significantly higher methylation level than the GT haplotype. This allele-specific methylation is age-dependent. In young individuals (20-30 years) the difference in DNA methylation between haplotypes is significant; whereas in individuals older than 60 years it is not detectable. Interestingly, the GT allele shows a decrease in methylation status with increasing BMI, whereas the methylation of the AC allele is not associated with this phenotype. Heterozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines show the same pattern of allele-specific DNA methylation. The cell line, which exhibits the highest difference in methylation levels between both haplotypes, also shows allele-specific transcription of MCHR1, which can be abolished by treatment with the DNA methylase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.We show that DNA methylation at MCHR1 is allele-specific, age-dependent, BMI-associated and affects transcription. Conceivably, this epigenetic regulation contributes to the age- and/or population specific effects reported for MCHR1 in several human obesity studies."
https://openalex.org/W1968214100,"The long pentraxin PTX3 has multiple roles in innate immunity. For example, PTX3 regulates C1q binding to pathogens and dead cells and regulates their uptake by phagocytes. It also inhibits P-selectin-mediated recruitment of leukocytes. Both of these mechanisms are known to be involved in autoimmunity and autoimmune tissue injury, e.g. in systemic lupus erythematosus, but a contribution of PTX3 is hypothetical. To evaluate a potential immunoregulatory role of PTX3 in autoimmunity we crossed Ptx3-deficient mice with Fas-deficient (lpr) C57BL/6 (B6) mice with mild lupus-like autoimmunity. PTX3 was found to be increasingly expressed in kidneys and lungs of B6lpr along disease progression. Lack of PTX3 impaired the phagocytic uptake of apoptotic T cells into peritoneal macrophages and selectively expanded CD4/CD8 double negative T cells while other immune cell subsets and lupus autoantibody production remained unaffected. Lack of PTX3 also aggravated autoimmune lung disease, i.e. peribronchial and perivascular CD3+ T cell and macrophage infiltrates of B6lpr mice. In contrast, histomorphological and functional parameters of lupus nephritis remained unaffected by the Ptx3 genotype. Together, PTX3 specifically suppresses autoimmune lung disease that is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Vice versa, loss-of-function mutations in the Ptx3 gene might represent a genetic risk factor for pulmonary (but not renal) manifestations of systemic lupus or other autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2135220764,"Previous cue integration studies have examined continuous perceptual dimensions (e.g., size) and have shown that human cue integration is well described by a normative model in which cues are weighted in proportion to their sensory reliability, as estimated from single-cue performance. However, this normative model may not be applicable to categorical perceptual dimensions (e.g., phonemes). In tasks defined over categorical perceptual dimensions, optimal cue weights should depend not only on the sensory variance affecting the perception of each cue but also on the environmental variance inherent in each task-relevant category. Here, we present a computational and experimental investigation of cue integration in a categorical audio-visual (articulatory) speech perception task. Our results show that human performance during audio-visual phonemic labeling is qualitatively consistent with the behavior of a Bayes-optimal observer. Specifically, we show that the participants in our task are sensitive, on a trial-by-trial basis, to the sensory uncertainty associated with the auditory and visual cues, during phonemic categorization. In addition, we show that while sensory uncertainty is a significant factor in determining cue weights, it is not the only one and participants' performance is consistent with an optimal model in which environmental, within category variability also plays a role in determining cue weights. Furthermore, we show that in our task, the sensory variability affecting the visual modality during cue-combination is not well estimated from single-cue performance, but can be estimated from multi-cue performance. The findings and computational principles described here represent a principled first step towards characterizing the mechanisms underlying human cue integration in categorical tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2004078546,"Odour baited traps have potential use in population surveillance of insect vectors of disease, and in some cases for vector population reduction. Established attractants for human host-seeking mosquitoes include a combination of CO(2) with L-lactic acid and ammonia, on top of which additional candidate compounds are being tested. In this field study in rural Gambia, using Latin square experiments with thorough randomization and replication, we tested nine different leading candidate combinations of chemical odorants for attractiveness to wild mosquitoes including anthropophilic malaria vectors, using modified Mosquito Magnet-X (MM-X) counterflow traps outside experimental huts containing male human sleepers. Highest catches of female mosquitoes, particularly of An. gambiae s.l. and Mansonia species, were obtained by incorporation of tetradecanoic acid. As additional carboxylic acids did not increase the trap catches further, this 'reference blend' (tetradecanoic acid with L-lactic acid, ammonia and CO(2)) was used in subsequent experiments. MM-X traps with this blend caught similar numbers of An. gambiae s.l. and slightly more Mansonia and Culex mosquitoes than a standard CDC light trap, and these numbers were not significantly affected by the presence or absence of human sleepers in the huts. Experiments with CO(2) produced from overnight yeast cultures showed that this organic source was effective in enabling trap attractiveness for all mosquito species, although at a slightly lower efficiency than obtained with use of CO(2) gas cylinders. Although further studies are needed to discover additional chemicals that increase attractiveness, as well as to optimise trap design and CO(2) source for broader practical use, the odour-baited traps described here are safe and effective for sampling host-seeking mosquitoes outdoors and can be incorporated into studies of malaria vector ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2015966835,"Recent advancement in the area of green fluorescent protein techniques coupled with microscopic imaging has significantly contributed in defining and dissecting subcellular changes of apoptosis with high spatio-temporal resolution. Although single cell based studies using EGFP and associated techniques have provided valuable information of initiation and hierarchical changes of apoptosis, they are yet to be exploited for multiparameter cell based real time analysis for possible drug screening or pathway defining in a high throughput manner. Here we have developed multiple cancer cell lines expressing FRET sensors for active caspases and adapted them for high throughput live cell ratio imaging, enabling high content image based multiparameter analysis. Sensitivity of the system to detect live cell caspase activation was substantiated by confocal acceptor bleaching as well as wide field FRET imaging. Multiple caspase-specific activities of DEVDase, IETDase and LEHDase were analysed simultaneously with other decisive events of cell death. Through simultaneous analysis of caspase activation by FRET ratio change coupled with detection of mitochondrial membrane potential loss or superoxide generation, we identified several antitumor agents that induced caspase activation with or without membrane potential loss or superoxide generation. Also, cells that escaped the initial drug-induced caspase activation could be easily followed up for defining long term fate. Employing such a revisit imaging strategy of the same area, we have tracked the caspase surviving fractions with multiple drugs and its subsequent response to retreatment, revealing drug-dependent diverging fate of surviving cells. This thereby indicates towards a complex control of drug induced tumor resistance. The technique described here has wider application in both screening of compound libraries as well as in defining apoptotic pathways by linking multiple signaling to identify non-classical apoptosis inducing agents, the greatest advantage being that the high content information obtained are from individual cells rather than being population based."
https://openalex.org/W2071057720,"Diminished adult neurogenesis is considered a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). In HAD, HIV-1-infected and immune-activated brain mononuclear phagocytes (MP; perivascular macrophages and microglia) drive central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and may alter normal neurogenesis. We previously demonstrated HIV-1-infected and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) inhibit human neural progenitor cell (NPC) neurogenesis, while enhancing astrogliogenesis through the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), in vitro and in vivo. Here we further test the hypothesis that HIV-1-infected/activated MDM promote NPC astrogliogenesis via activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a critical factor for astrogliogenesis. Our results show that LPS-activated MDM-conditioned medium (LPS-MCM) and HIV-infected/LPS-activated MDM-conditioned medium (LPS+HIV-MCM) induced Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and STAT3 activation. Induction of the Jak-STAT3 activation correlated with increased glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, demonstrating an induction of astrogliogenesis. Moreover, STAT3-targeting siRNA (siSTAT3) decreased MCM-induced STAT3 activation and NPC astrogliogenesis. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α) produced by LPS-activated and/or HIV-1-infected MDM may contribute to MCM-induced STAT3 activation and astrocytic differentiation. These observations were confirmed in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). In HIVE mice, siRNA control (without target sequence, sicon) pre-transfected NPCs injected with HIV-1-infected MDM showed more astrocytic differentiation and less neuronal differentiation of NPCs as compared to NPC injection alone. siSTAT3 abrogated HIV-1-infected MDM-induced astrogliogenesis of injected NPCs. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that HIV-1-infected/activated MDM induces NPC astrogliogenesis through the STAT3 pathway. This study generates important data elucidating the role of brain inflammation in neurogenesis and may provide insight into new therapeutic strategies for HAD."
https://openalex.org/W1995742095,"The continuous production and addition of new neurons during life in the olfactory bulb is well accepted and has been extensively studied in rodents. This process could allow the animals to adapt to a changing environment. Olfactory neurogenesis begins in the subventricular zone where stem cells proliferate and give rise to young undifferentiated neuroblasts that migrate along the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (OB). Olfaction is crucial for the expression of sexual behavior in rodents. In female rats, the ability to control the rate of sexual interactions (pacing) has important physiological and behavioral consequences. In the present experiment we evaluated if pacing behavior modifies the rate of new cells that reach the main and accessory olfactory bulb. The BrdU marker was injected before and after different behavioral tests which included: females placed in a mating cage (control), females allowed to pace the sexual interaction, females that mated but were not able to control the rate of the sexual interaction and females exposed to a sexually active male. Subjects were sacrificed fifteen days after the behavioral test. We observed a significant increase in the density of BrdU positive cells in the internal cellular layer of the accessory olfactory bulb when females paced the sexual interaction in comparison to the other 3 groups. No differences in the cell density in the main olfactory bulb were found. These results suggest that pacing behavior promotes an increase in density of the new cells in the accessory olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2009043793,"Background Seven serine/threonine kinase genes have been predicted in unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. SpkA and SpkB were shown to be required for cell motility and SpkE has no kinase activity. There is no report whether the other four STKs are involved in stress-mediated signaling in Synechocystis PCC6803. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we examined differential expression of the other four serine/threonine kinases, SpkC, SpkD, SpkF and SpkG, at seven different stress conditions. The transcriptional level was up-regulated of spkG and down-regulated of spkC under high salt stress condition. Two spk deletion mutants, ΔspkC and ΔspkG, were constructed and their growth characteristic were examined compared to the wild strain. The wild strain and ΔspkC mutant were not affected under high salt stress conditions. In contrast, growth of spkG mutant was completely impaired. To further confirm the function of spkG, we also examined the effect of mutation of spkG on the expression of salt stress-inducible genes. We compared genome-wide patterns of transcription between wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and cells with a mutation in the SpkG with DNA microarray analysis. Conclusion In this study, we first study the spkG gene as sensor of high salt signal. We consider that SpkG play essential roles in Synechocystis sp. for sensing the high salt signal directly, rather than mediating signals among other kinases. Our microarray experiment may help select relatively significant genes for further research on mechanisms of signal transduction of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 under high salt stress."

https://openalex.org/W2068403110,"Human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAdV5)-based vectors administered intravenously accumulate in the liver as the result of their direct binding to blood coagulation factor X (FX) and subsequent interaction of the FX-HAdV5 complex with heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) at the surface of liver cells. Intriguingly, the serotype 35 fiber-pseudotyped vector HAdV5F35 has liver transduction efficiencies 4-logs lower than HAdV5, even though both vectors carry the same hexon capsomeres. In order to reconcile this apparent paradox, we investigated the possible role of other viral capsid proteins on the FX/HSPG-mediated cellular uptake of HAdV5-based vectors. Using CAR- and CD46-negative CHO cells varying in HSPG expression, we confirmed that FX bound to serotype 5 hexon protein and to HAdV5 and HAdV5F35 virions via its Gla-domain, and enhanced the binding of both vectors to surface-immobilized hypersulfated heparin and cellular HSPG. Using penton mutants, we found that the positive effect of FX on HAdV5 binding to HSPG and cell transduction did not depend on the penton base RGD and fiber shaft KKTK motifs. However, we found that FX had no enhancing effect on the HAdV5F35-mediated cell transduction, but a negative effect which did not involve the cell attachment or endocytic step, but the intracellular trafficking and nuclear import of the FX-HAdV5F35 complex. By cellular imaging, HAdV5F35 particles were observed to accumulate in the late endosomal compartment, and were released in significant amounts into the extracellular medium via exocytosis. We showed that the stability of serotype 5 hexon∶FX interaction was higher at low pH compared to neutral pH, which could account for the retention of FX-HAdV5F35 complexes in the late endosomes. Our results suggested that, despite the high affinity interaction of hexon capsomeres to FX and cell surface HSPG, the adenoviral fiber acted as the dominant determinant of the internalization and trafficking pathway of HAdV5-based vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2128872451,"Social learning is defined as the ability of a population to aggregate information, a process which must crucially depend on the mechanisms of social interaction. Consumers choosing which product to buy, or voters deciding which option to take with respect to an important issue, typically confront external signals to the information gathered from their contacts. Economic models typically predict that correct social learning occurs in large populations unless some individuals display unbounded influence. We challenge this conclusion by showing that an intuitive threshold process of individual adjustment does not always lead to such social learning. We find, specifically, that three generic regimes exist separated by sharp discontinuous transitions. And only in one of them, where the threshold is within a suitable intermediate range, the population learns the correct information. In the other two, where the threshold is either too high or too low, the system either freezes or enters into persistent flux, respectively. These regimes are generally observed in different social networks (both complex or regular), but limited interaction is found to promote correct learning by enlarging the parameter region where it occurs."

It is unknown how cost-effectiveness of this intervention is affected by suboptimal S. aureus screening. We determined cost-effectiveness of different preoperative S. aureus screening regimes.We compared different screening scenarios (ranging from treating all patients without screening to treating only identified S. aureus carriers) to the base case scenario without any screening and treatment. Screening and treatment costs as well as costs and mortality due to deep-seated S. aureus infection were derived from hospital databases and prospectively collected data, respectively.As compared to the base case scenario, all scenarios are associated with improved health care outcomes at reduced costs. Treating all patients without screening is most cost-beneficial, saving €7339 per life year gained, as compared to €3330 when only identified carriers are treated. In sensitivity analysis, outcomes are susceptible to the sensitivity of the screening test and the efficacy of treatment. Reductions in these parameters would reduce the cost-effectiveness of scenarios in which treatment is based on screening. When only identified S. aureus carriers are treated costs of screening should be less than €6.23 to become the dominant strategy.Preoperative screening and eradication of S. aureus carriage to prevent deep-seated S. aureus infections saves both life years and medical costs at the same time, although treating all patients without screening is the dominant strategy, resulting in most health gains and largest savings."
https://openalex.org/W2088512658,"Aberrant up-regulation of P-Rex1 expression plays important roles in cancer progression and metastasis. The present study investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying P-Rex1 gene expression in prostate cancer cells. We showed that P-Rex1 expression was much higher in metastatic prostate cancer cells than in prostate epithelial cells and non-metastatic prostate cancer cells. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or silence of endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 markedly elevated P-Rex1 transcription in non-metastatic prostate cancer cells, whereas overexpression of recombinant HDAC1 in metastatic prostate cancer cells suppressed P-Rex1 expression. HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) also significantly increased P-Rex1 promoter activity and caused acetylated histones to accumulate and associate with the P-Rex1 promoter. One Sp1 site, essential for basal promoter activity, was identified as critical for the TSA effect. TSA treatment did not alter the DNA-binding activity of Sp1 toward the P-Rex1 promoter; however, it facilitated the dissociation of the repressive HDAC1 and HDAC2 from the Sp1 binding region. Interestingly, HDAC1 association with Sp1 and with the P-Rex1 promoter were much weaker in metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells than in non-metastatic prostate cancer cells, and HDAC inhibitors only had very modest stimulatory effects on P-Rex1 promoter activity and P-Rex1 expression in PC-3 cells. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that HDACs could regulate P-Rex1 gene transcription by interaction with Sp1 and by region-specific changes in histone acetylation within the P-Rex1 promoter.

Immunohistochemical staining of P-Rex1 protein in human prostate cancer specimens also suggests that P-Rex1 expression levels are an index of metastasis, the major cause of prostate cancer death.

P-Rex1 expression is normally repressed in most cells, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may be responsible for its low levels, whereas a reversal of epigenetic inhibition could contribute to the elevated expression of P-Rex1 during the later phases of prostate cancer progression. However, the exact molecular mechanism for P-Rex1 regulation is entirely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that HDACs have a major role in suppressing Sp1-driven P-Rex1 gene transcription. Disassociation of HDACs from Sp1 on the P-Rex1 promoter may contribute to aberrant up-regulation of P-Rex1 in metastatic prostate cancer cells.

PC-3 cells in suspension were transfected with 50 nm control siRNA (negative control #1 siRNA, Ambion) or siRNAs targeting Sp1 or HDAC1 and HDAC2 using Lipofectamine 2000.

The following day, adherent PC-3 cells were re-transfected with the same siRNAs. Two days later, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis of Sp1, HDAC1, HDAC2, and P-Rex1 expression. Protein was extracted from exponentially growing cells using 1× radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein samples (40 μg) were loaded on SDS-PAGE, electrophoresed, and transferred to an Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore). Primary antibodies were used to identify the relevant protein of interest and loading control (β-actin). IRdye700- or IRdye800-labeled secondary antibodies were used for protein band detection. The images were captured with a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) at wavelengths of 700 or 800 nm. To analyze the effect of recombinant HDAC1 on endogenous P-Rex1 expression, PC-3 cells (100-mm dish) were transfected with 10 μg of pEGFP-N1 or 20 μg of HDAC1-GFP plasmids (Addgene) using Lipofectamine LTX with Plus reagent. 18 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with or without 500 nm TSA for 24 h. GFP+ cells were then separated from GFP− cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a FACSAria (BD Immunocytometry Systems) at the Creighton University Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Alteration of P-Rex1 mRNA and protein expression in GFP+ cells was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. For luciferase reporter assays, cells were seeded in 24-well plates, and transfections were performed when the cells were grown to 90% confluence. 22Rv1 cells or HEK293 cells were transfected with 500 ng of pGL3-Basic vector or P-Rex1 promoter reporter constructs with 10 ng of TK-Renilla plasmid (pRL-tk), used to normalize for transfection efficiency. For Sp1 overexpression experiments, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with P-Rex1 promoter reporter constructs (100 ng), pRL-tk (10 ng), and 1000 ng of pcDNA3.1 empty vector or vector encoding HA-tagged Sp1. For HDAC1 overexpression experiments, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the P-Rex1 promoter reporter construct, pRL-tk, and GFP-tagged HDAC1 or control pEGFP-N1 plasmid. To examine P-Rex1 promoter activities in various cell lines, 100 ng of pRL-tk and 3 μg of the P-Rex1 promoter luciferase construct (−576/+3), cloned from the genomic DNA of RWPE-1 cells, were transfected into RWPE-1, 22Rv1, or PC-3 cells (2 × 106) with a Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V using the Amaxa Nucleofector System (Lonza Inc., Walkersville, MD), and transfected cells were seeded onto 24-well plates. After 24 h of culture, cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase assays. The luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase assay kits (Promega) (23Xie Y. Wolff D.W. Lin M.F. Tu Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The data presented are averages of at least three independent experiments. Nuclear extracts from PC-3 cells were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EMSA was preformed as previously described (23Xie Y. Wolff D.W. Lin M.F. Tu Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using the Sp1 IRdye-labeled oligonucleotide as a probe. Briefly, PC-3 nuclear extract (5 μg) was incubated with the IRdye-labeled double-stranded Sp1 consensus binding motif (50 fmol) in 20-μl solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid) for 30 min on ice. For competition assays, the competitive oligonucleotide (2.5 pmol) was preincubated with nuclear extracts for 5 min before adding the Sp1 IRdye-labeled oligonucleotide. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5% glycerol. Gel imaging was carried out using the Odyssey infrared imaging system at 700 nm. ChIP assay was carried out using the ChIP-IT express kit (Reactive Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (80% confluence) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cell lysates were centrifuged to pellet the nuclei at 5000 rpm for 10 min in 4 °C. DNA was sheared into 200- to 800-bp fragments by sonications, followed by centrifugation to remove debris. The chromatin fraction was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C in ChIP buffer containing protein G magnetic beads and 5 μg of the following antibodies: anti-Sp1, anti-HDAC1, anti-HADC2, anti-Ac-H4, or control rabbit IgG. The chromatin-protein complexes were eluted from magnetic beads, reverse-cross-linked, and then treated with proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h. The final DNA products were used as PCR templates for amplification using the P-Rex1 proximal promoter-specific primers (supplemental Table S1). Nuclear extracts of PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells were prepared using a Nuclear Complex Co-IP Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) following the manufacture's protocol. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using a Dynabeads Protein A Immunoprecipitation Kit (Invitrogen). In brief, 3 μg of polyclonal Sp1 antibody or pre-immune rabbit IgG was incubated with 40 μl of Dynabeads Protein A suspension. Cell nuclear extracts were incubated with IgG-Dynabeads or Sp1-Dynabeads for 5 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer and eluted in SDS sample buffer and detected by Western blot using monoclonal HDAC1 antibody and polyclonal Sp1 antibody. Results are the mean ± S.E. of at least three determinations. Statistical comparisons used a Student's t test, or a two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction or Newman-Keuls test where there were multiple comparisons. A probability (p) value of <0.05 was considered significant. To understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying regulation of P-Rex1 expression, non-metastatic prostate cancer 22Rv1 cells were treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-dC or a histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (24Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P-Rex1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A, top section) increased dramatically after TSA treatment, whereas 5-Aza-dC treatment had no effect. Western blot analysis using a monoclonal P-Rex1 antibody confirmed that P-Rex1 protein was also significantly increased in TSA-treated but not in 5-Aza-dC-treated 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 1A, lower section). In contrast, the expression of the β-actin gene was not affected. As previously reported (14Qin J. Xie Y. Wang B. Hoshino M. Wolff D.W. Zhao J. Scofield M.A. Dowd F.J. Lin M.F. Tu Y. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), human metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells express high levels of P-Rex1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1A, lane 4). TSA treatment significantly increased P-Rex1 transcription in 22Rv1 cells in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To further confirm that transcription of P-Rex1 gene was subject to regulation by HDACs through chromatin modifications, NaB, another HDAC inhibitor (25Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), was also used. In human immortalized prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells and non-metastatic prostate cancer 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells, both NaB and TSA significantly increased P-Rex1 expression by over 30-fold (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the basal level of P-Rex1 expression in PC-3 cells was significantly higher than that in RWPE-1, 22Rv1, or LNCaP cells, and NaB or TSA only increased P-Rex1 expression by <2-fold in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1C). The functions of HDACs, especially HDAC1 and HDAC2, in gene transcriptional regulation have been extensively studied. Thus, we next examined the effects of knocking down endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 on P-Rex1 expression in 22Rv1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, a combination of siRNAs against HDAC1 and HDAC2 reduced expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in 22Rv1 cells by ∼70 and 50%, respectively. Consequently, P-Rex1 gene expression in 22Rv1 cells was significantly increased by ∼4-fold. We further investigated the effect of overexpression of HDAC1 on endogenous P-Rex1 expression in PC-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the endogenous P-Rex1 mRNA expression in PC-3 cells transfected with GFP-tagged HDAC1 was ∼60% lower than that in cells transfected with GFP control. Western blot analysis confirmed that P-Rex1 protein was also significantly decreased by ∼50% in PC-3 cells expressing GFP-HDAC1 as compared with cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 2B, inset). Together, our results demonstrate that HDACs such as HDAC1 and HDAC2 act as a negative regulator of the transcription of the P-Rex1 gene. It is generally accepted that HDACs suppress the transcription of a specific gene by binding to its promoter region. To identify the putative promoter that regulates P-Rex1 expression, a 2024-bp DNA fragment upstream of the human P-Rex1 coding region was amplified using genomic DNA of human prostate tissue as a template and was then cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic, designated as P(−2021/+3) (the “+3” represents the third base from the putative transcription start site). 22Rv1 cells transiently transfected with the P(−2021/+3) or the control pGL3-Basic vector were treated with or without 500 nm TSA. As shown in Fig. 3A, the P(−2021/+3) construct displayed a 4-fold basal activity over the pGL3-Basic vector, and a further 13.8-fold induction after TSA treatment. In contrast, TSA treatment only increased the activity of pGL3-Basic vector by <2-fold. This result demonstrates that the fragment cloned is both transcriptionally active and TSA-inducible. Analysis of this fragment by PromoterScan software identified a putative promoter region within the 579-bp fragment upstream of the P-Rex1 gene. The P(−576/+3) plasmid containing this region displayed similar basal and TSA-induced promoter activities as compared with P(−2021/+3) (Fig. 3A), and the induction of its promoter activity by TSA was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3B). In 22Rv1 cells, NaB also stimulated the P(−576/+3) promoter activity by 9-fold (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the P(−576/+3) constructs cloned from RWPE-1, 22Rv1, or PC-3 cells displayed similar promoter activities in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3D). DNA sequence analysis of the 579-bp fragments cloned from these cell lines confirmed the identical sequences (data not shown). We then compared the promoter activity of P(−576/+3) construct cloned from RWPE-1 cells in various prostate cell lines. The data shown in Fig. 3E indicated that the basal promoter of the P(−576/+3) activity was 5-fold and 2-fold higher in PC-3 cells than that in RWPE-1 cells and 22Rv1 cells, respectively. In contrast, TSA-mediated stimulation of the P(−576/+3) promoter activity was only 3.5-fold in PC-3 cells but 30-fold and 13-fold in RWPE-1 cells and 22Rv1 cells, respectively. Thus, the P-Rex1 promoter has higher basal activity with less TSA response in PC-3 cells than that in RWPE-1 cells or 22Rv1 cells, similar to the endogenous P-Rex1 expression patterns and TSA-response in these cell lines. To further determine the cis-element responsible for TSA stimulation within the P-Rex1 promoter, luciferase reporter gene constructs containing the various 5′ flanking regions of the P-Rex1 promoter were transiently transfected into 22Rv1 cells, and their promoter activities were determined in the presence or absence of 500 nm TSA. As shown in Fig. 4A, following progressive deletion, the P(−190/+3) plasmid still retains the basal promoter activity, similar to that of the P(−576/+3) plasmid (3.5- versus 5.0-fold, respectively). Moreover, P(−190/+3) displayed a similar TSA induction compared with P(−576/+3) (12.2- versus 13.3-fold, respectively). However, a further 92-bp deletion of P(−190/+3) resulted in a significant loss of the basal promoter activity (1.2- versus 3.5-fold) and TSA induction (2.0- versus 12.2-fold) (Fig. 4A), suggesting that this deleted 92-bp fragment (−190/−98) contains key elements of the P-Rex1 promoter. Using TFSEARCH, a tool for searching transcription factor binding sites, we identified two consensus Sp1 binding domains at −178/−169 bp (Sp1-1) and −147/−138 bp (Sp1-2) in this 92-bp fragment (Fig. 4A, lower section). Simultaneous mutation of these two consensus Sp1 binding domains in the P(−190/+3) construct (Sp1-1/2m) significantly reduced both basal promoter activity and TSA induction by ∼85% (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, mutation of the first Sp1 binding domain (Sp1-1m) had similar inhibitory effects on the basal promoter activity and TSA induction as the mutations of both Sp1 binding domains, whereas mutation of the second Sp1 binding domain (Sp1-2m) only reduced basal promoter activity by ∼25% (p < 0.05) without any significant effect on TSA induction (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the first Sp1 binding domain (−178/−169) is critical for both basal promoter activity and activation/derepression of P-Rex1 gene transcription by the HDAC inhibitor TSA. We further investigated whether oligonucleotid"

https://openalex.org/W2018622246,"Whereas the use of discrete pitch intervals is characteristic of most musical traditions, the size of the intervals and the way in which they are used is culturally specific. Here we examine the hypothesis that these differences arise because of a link between the tonal characteristics of a culture's music and its speech. We tested this idea by comparing pitch intervals in the traditional music of three tone language cultures (Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese) and three non-tone language cultures (American, French and German) with pitch intervals between voiced speech segments. Changes in pitch direction occur more frequently and pitch intervals are larger in the music of tone compared to non-tone language cultures. More frequent changes in pitch direction and larger pitch intervals are also apparent in the speech of tone compared to non-tone language cultures. These observations suggest that the different tonal preferences apparent in music across cultures are closely related to the differences in the tonal characteristics of voiced speech."
https://openalex.org/W2079603008,"Background Due to the increased accuracy of Copy Number Variable region (CNV) break point mapping, it is now possible to say with a reasonable degree of confidence whether a gene (i) falls entirely within a CNV; (ii) overlaps the CNV or (iii) actually contains the CNV. We classify these as type I, II and III CNV genes respectively. Principal Findings Here we show that although type I genes vary in copy number along with the CNV, most of these type I genes have the same expression levels as wild type copy numbers of the gene. These genes must, therefore, be under homeostatic dosage compensation control. Looking into possible mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression we found that type I genes have a significant paucity of genes regulated by miRNAs and are not significantly enriched for monoallelically expressed genes. Type III genes, on the other hand, have a significant excess of genes regulated by miRNAs and are enriched for genes that are monoallelically expressed. Significance Many diseases and genomic disorders are associated with CNVs so a better understanding of the different ways genes are associated with normal CNVs will help focus on candidate genes in genome wide association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2003506383,"The rs9939609 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the fat mass and obesity (FTO) gene has previously been associated with higher BMI levels in children and young adults. In contrast, this association was not found in elderly men. BMI is a measure of overweight in relation to the individuals' height, but offers no insight into the regional body fat composition or distribution.To examine whether the FTO gene is associated with overweight and body composition-related phenotypes rather than BMI, we measured waist circumference, total fat mass, trunk fat mass, leg fat mass, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and daily energy intake in 985 humans (493 women) at the age of 70 years. In total, 733 SNPs located in the FTO gene were genotyped in order to examine whether rs9939609 alone or the other SNPs, or their combinations, are linked to obesity-related measures in elderly humans.Cross-sectional analysis of the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) cohort.Neither a single SNP, such as rs9939609, nor a SNP combination was significantly linked to overweight, body composition-related measures, or daily energy intake in elderly humans. Of note, these observations hold both among men and women.Due to the diversity of measurements included in the study, our findings strengthen the view that the effect of FTO on body composition appears to be less profound in later life compared to younger ages and that this is seemingly independent of gender."

https://openalex.org/W2086782170,"Bartonella henselae, a zoonotic agent, induces tumors of endothelial cells (ECs), namely bacillary angiomatosis and peliosis in immunosuppressed humans but not in cats. In vitro studies on ECs represent to date the only way to explore the interactions between Bartonella henselae and vascular endothelium. However, no comparative study of the interactions between Bartonella henselae and human (incidental host) ECs vs feline (reservoir host) ECs has been carried out because of the absence of any available feline endothelial cell lines.To this purpose, we have developed nine feline EC lines which allowed comparing the effects of Bartonella strains on human and feline micro-vascular ECs representative of the infection development sites such as skin, versus macro-vascular ECs, such as umbilical vein.Our model revealed intrinsic differences between human (Human Skin Microvascular ECs -HSkMEC and Human Umbilical Vein ECs - iHUVEC) and feline ECs susceptibility to Bartonella henselae infection.While no effect was observed on the feline ECs upon Bartonella henselae infection, the human ones displayed accelerated angiogenesis and wound healing.Noticeable differences were demonstrated between human micro- and macro-vasculature derived ECs both in terms of pseudo-tube formation and healing. Interestingly, Bartonella henselae effects on human ECs were also elicited by soluble factors.Neither Bartonella henselae-infected Human Skin Microvascular ECs clinically involved in bacillary angiomatosis, nor feline ECs increased cAMP production, as opposed to HUVEC.Bartonella henselae could stimulate the activation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in homologous cellular systems and trigger VEGF production by HSkMECs only, but not iHUVEC or any feline ECs tested.These results may explain the decreased pathogenic potential of Bartonella henselae infection for cats as compared to humans and strongly suggest that an autocrine secretion of VEGF by human skin endothelial cells might induce their growth and ultimately lead to bacillary angiomatosis formation."

https://openalex.org/W2092889437,"The oncogene amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that plays a major role in the progression of various cancers. We previously identified a splice variant of AIB1 called AIB1-Δ4 that is overexpressed in breast cancer. Using mass spectrometry, we define the translation initiation of AIB1-Δ4 at Met224 of the full-length AIB1 sequence and have raised an antibody to a peptide representing the acetylated N terminus. We show that AIB1-Δ4 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, although leptomycin B nuclear export inhibition demonstrates that AIB1-Δ4 can enter and traffic through the nucleus. Our data indicate an import mechanism enhanced by other coactivators such as p300/CBP. We report that the endogenously and exogenously expressed AIB1-Δ4 is recruited as efficiently as full-length AIB1 to estrogen-response elements of genes, and it enhances estrogen-dependent transcription more effectively than AIB1. Expression of an N-terminal AIB1 protein fragment, which is lost in the AIB1-Δ4 isoform, potentiates AIB1 as a coactivator. This suggests a model whereby the transcriptional activity of AIB1 is squelched by a repressive mechanism utilizing the N-terminal domain and that the increased coactivator function of AIB1-Δ4 is due to the loss of this inhibitory domain.

IntroductionGene transcription in eukaryotes is a complex and highly regulated process. One of the major controls of gene transcription is exerted by the coregulator family of proteins. These include both corepressors, which dampen transcription, and coactivators, which potentiate transcription. A subgroup of coactivators has been shown to be critical for the malignant progression of cancer and is known as the p160 steroid receptor coactivators (1Xu J. Wu R.C. O'Malley B.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). One member in particular was identified to be amplified in breast cancer. Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1, SRC-3, NCOA3, ACTR, TRAM-1, pCIP, and RAC3) has been shown to be a gene amplified in breast cancer (2Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M.

More recently, an additional 5′ exon 81,164 bases upstream of the known 5′UTR was identified. Thus, the deleted exon is now exon 4, and we now refer to the splice variant as AIB1-Δ4. We had reported that AIB1-Δ4 mRNA results in an N-terminally truncated isoform of the AIB1 protein that was found to be a more potent coactivator of steroid-dependent transcription on a per mol basis when compared with the full-length AIB1 protein. AIB1-Δ4 mRNA expression was elevated in breast tumor tissue relative to normal breast tissue (17Reiter R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39736-39741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was also shown to increase the efficacy of estrogenic compounds and the agonist effects of the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen in breast and endometrial tumor cells (17Reiter R.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Overexpression of AIB1-Δ4 in mice leads to ductal ectasia in the mammary gland with an increased expression of proliferative markers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, phospho-histone H3, and cyclin D1 (19Tilli M.T.

More recently, AIB1-Δ4 was shown to act as a molecular bridge between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the cytoplasm, and its overexpression increased the invasiveness of the MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cell line (21Long W. Yi P. Amazit L. LaMarca H.L. Ashcroft F. Kumar R. Mancini M.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Because AIB1-Δ4 lacks a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), any function for this protein in cancer to date has been attributed predominantly to its role in the cytoplasm (21Long W. Yi P. Amazit L. LaMarca H.L. Ashcroft F. Kumar R. Mancini M.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We now show that AIB1-Δ4 can enter the nucleus by a noncanonical nuclear import mechanism. AIB1-Δ4 is recruited to estrogen-response elements of endogenous estrogen-regulated genes and increases their expression. We also determined that the N-terminal region absent from the AIB1-Δ4 protein contains an inhibitory domain. Through the use of Scorpion primer technology, we have created the first quantitative assay for the AIB1-Δ4 transcript and found a correlation between AIB1-Δ4 expression and the metastatic phenotype of human cancer cell lines. These data suggest that the nuclear activities of AIB1-Δ4 can contribute to its function in malignancy.DISCUSSIONWe show in this study that AIB1-Δ4 enters the nucleus and has a nuclear function. In accordance with previous data that the NLS is contained in the N terminus of AIB1 (26Li C. Wu R.C. Amazit L. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Qutob M.S. Bhattacharjee R.N. Pollari E. Yee S.P. Torchia J. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 2006; 348: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we found that the majority of AIB1-Δ4, which lacks an NLS, is predominantly in the cytoplasm at steady state levels. This is in contrast to the localization of AIB1, which resides mostly in the nucleus. Coactivation occurs in the nucleus, which raised the question how the mainly cytoplasmic AIB1-Δ4 had such potent effects on transcription. The first question to address was if AIB1-Δ4 enters the nucleus. We observed that AIB1-Δ4 accumulated in the nucleus after blockade of nuclear export suggesting that it was indeed being imported into the nucleus. The next question to address was whether AIB1-Δ4 had a functional role in the nucleus. We saw that AIB1-Δ4 was recruited as efficiently as AIB1 to ERE in estrogen-regulated genes in the nucleus despite significantly lower steady state nuclear levels of AIB1-Δ4. The mainly cytoplasmic location of AIB1-Δ4 is potentially due to either an inefficient nuclear import mechanism or through a rapid nuclear export mechanism. We argue for the former scenario given that AIB1-Δ4 lacks the N-terminal NLS and there is no alteration in the nuclear export sequence of AIB1-Δ4. It is known that molecules larger than 40 kDa have to be actively transported through the nuclear pore complex through interaction of the NLS with nuclear importins (46Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Another potential mechanism for nuclear import termed “piggybacking” was demonstrated for various proteins such as eIF4E, IκBα, and CDK2, and BRCA1 (47Dostie J. Ferraiuolo M. Pause A. Adam S.A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3142-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 48Fabbro M. Rodriguez J.A. Baer R. Henderson B.R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6804-6812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). BRCA1 has a naturally occurring splice variant that lacks an NLS, and it is able to localize to the nucleus through interaction with another protein BARD1, which contains a canonical NLS. We propose that AIB1-Δ4 is able to similarly piggyback onto p300/CBP and/or other NLS-containing proteins and thus enter the nucleus. Alternatively, NLS-containing coactivators could up-regulate genes involved in Ran-independent nuclear import mechanisms such as via calmodulin (53Hanover J.A. Love D.C. Prinz W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12593-12597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, it appears to be an inefficient process likely accounting for the largely cytoplasmic distribution of AIB1-Δ4 in the cell. Also consistent with this hypothesis is the difference in the kinetics of recruitment of AIB1 and AIB1-Δ4. We saw a delay in the recruitment of AIB1-Δ4 to the ERE relative to AIB1 suggesting that the mechanism of nuclear import of AIB1-Δ4 is less efficient than that of AIB1.The fact that we saw more effective coactivation by AIB1-Δ4 despite having much more AIB1 in the nucleus than AIB1-Δ4 suggests that there is a regulation of AIB1 coactivator activity that does not exist for AIB1-Δ4. Because we observed that the levels of AIB1-Δ4 interacting with p300 were higher than the levels of AIB1 associated with p300 (Fig. 4a) and p300 is generally found in active transcriptional complexes, we believe that AIB1-Δ4 is highly recruited to sites of active transcription. The increased coactivator activity of AIB1-Δ4 was confirmed by a higher increase in endogenous estrogen-regulated gene expression in cells transfected with AIB1-Δ4. These data suggest that the large amount of AIB1 that resides in the nucleus is not in active transcriptional complexes, and the reason why AIB1-Δ4 is a more potent coactivator than AIB1 can best be explained by the presence of an inhibitory domain in the N-terminal 223 amino acids of AIB1. Alternatively, loss of the N terminus could cause steric changes that increase the affinity for other coactivators. We conjectured that this N-terminal fragment containing the bHLH and PAS A domains would be able to bind N-terminal repressors of AIB1. We found that the N-terminal fragment containing the bHLH and PAS A domains of AIB1 when cotransfected with AIB1 is able to relieve repression of the coactivator function of the AIB1 protein. This effect was dose-dependent, and the more AIB1 N-terminal fragment added to the cells the less repression there was on the AIB1 protein. Interestingly, transfection of the fragment alone showed an increase in luciferase activity, which is probably not due to an inherent coactivator function of this fragment because most of the transcriptional activity of the AIB1 and AIB1-Δ4 proteins resides in their recruitment of p300/CBP in the C terminus (36Chen H.

This increase in transcription is most likely due to a relief of repression of the endogenous AIB1 in the COS-7 cells because we are able to detect endogenous AIB1 protein by Western blot (17Reiter R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39736-39741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our group and others have suggested that the N-terminal region containing the bHLH and PAS A domains contains an inhibitory domain that represses activity in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (17Reiter R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39736-39741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Reiter R. Oh A.S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T.

Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Our studies and those from Chen et al. (36Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) have shown that the loss of the N-terminal region leads to potent coactivation of nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transcription. Expression of AIB1-Δ4 (loss of amino acids 1–223 of AIB1) or ACTR38 (loss of amino acids 1–447 of AIB1) leads to potent coactivation of nuclear receptor-dependent transcription from estrogen, progesterone, retinoic acid, thyroid, glucocorticoid, vitamin D, and retinoid X receptors. Interestingly, data from Li et al. (26Li C. Wu R.C. Amazit L. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed expression of AIB1 constructs containing mutations in either or both NLS (NLS amino acids 16–19 and 35–38 of AIB1) or with the bHLH domain deleted (amino acids 16–88 of AIB1) had no coactivator activity presumably because of lack of import into the nucleus. The other possibility is that they still retained amino acids 88–224, which would support the evidence that there is an inhibitory domain in this region. Loss of these amino acids in AIB1-Δ4 and ACTR38 allows these proteins to be potent coactivators. A number of proteins have been shown to bind to the bHLH PAS domain of p160 SRC family members. These have been described as having coactivator, corepressor, and phosphatase activity (54Belandia B. Parker M.G. J. Biol.

It remains to be determined if these proteins play a role in repression or loss of activation of AIB1 on endogenous genes or conversely whether they have lost affinity or changed interaction with AIB1-Δ4.Both AIB1 and AIB1-Δ4 have been shown to have effects in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling. Data from our laboratory has shown that loss of both AIB1 and AIB1-Δ4 proteins together can lead to a decrease in EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation (6Lahusen T. Fereshteh M. Oh A. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and AIB1-Δ4 is able to potently coactivate EGF-stimulated transcription (17Reiter R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39736-39741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Long et al. (21Long W. Yi P. Amazit L. LaMarca H.L. Ashcroft F. Kumar R.

They also show that AIB1-Δ4 is phosphorylated by p21-activated kinase (PAK1), which increases the association of AIB1-Δ4 with EGFR and FAK. Intriguingly, in this latter study the N-terminal region of AIB1 inhibited the interaction of AIB1 with FAK and therefore was unable to stimulate the EGF-induced migration of cancer cells, suggesting that even in the cytoplasm the N-terminal region of AIB1 was repressive. Expression of an NLS mutant of AIB1, which resides predominantly in the cytoplasm, showed much weaker interaction with FAK in cells. Another recent publication by Cai et al. (60Cai D. Shames D.S. Raso M.G. Xie Y. Kim Y.H. Pollack J.R. Girard L. Sullivan J.P. Gao B. Peyton M. Nanjundan M. Byers L. Heymach J. Mills G. Gazdar A.F. Wistuba I. Kodadek T. Minna J.D. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6477-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) shows in non-small cell lung cancer that AIB1 expression is correlated with poor prognosis, and knockdown of AIB1 in non-small cell lung cancer cell line resistant to gefitinib treatment restored sensitivity to EGFR inhibition by gefitinib. Taken together, these data indicate that there is a signaling loop existing between AIB1/AIB1-Δ4 and EGFR where EGFR can affect AIB1-Δ4 through PAK1 activation and AIB1/AIB1-Δ4 can affect EGFR signaling and transcription as well. It is unclear if the siRNA used to target AIB1 in the gefitinib study also targeted AIB1-Δ4 as well, so the effects of AIB1-Δ4 on EGFR signaling are not currently known. Overall, the contribution of nuclear versus cytoplasmic function of AIB1-Δ4 to steroid and growth factor signaling needs to be further explored.Given that we have found that the expression of AIB1-Δ4 at the protein level is higher in breast and pancreatic cancer cells (17Reiter R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39736-39741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 61Henke R.T. Haddad B.R. Kim S.E. Rone J.D. Mani A. Jessup J.M. Wellstein A. Maitra A. Riegel A.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6134-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we were interested to investigate if AIB1-Δ4 is regulated at the protein level. We have previously shown that AIB1 protein levels are greatly reduced in response to growth of cells at high confluence and the removal of growth factors (62Mani A. Oh A.S. Bowden E.T. Lahusen T. Lorick K.L. Weissman A.M. Schlegel R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the AIB1-Δ4 isoform is not regulated in the same fashion as AIB1 protein (supplemental Fig. 5). AIB1-Δ4 is resistant to proteasomal degradation induced by high confluence. This is probably due to loss of a site of regulation in the N-terminal 223 amino acids. The proteasomal regulation of AIB1 has been well characterized (57Li C. Liang Y.Y. Feng X.H. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 835-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 62Mani A. Oh A.S. Bowden E.T. Lahusen T. Lorick K.L. Weissman A.M. Schlegel R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T.

Cell. 2006; 124: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Interestingly, regulation of a phospho-degron at Ser102 by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) was shown to be important for regulating the activity of AIB1. PP1 overexpression was able to inhibit the reporter activity as well as the cell proliferative ability of AIB1. The Ser102 site is also a site of regulation by the ubiquitin ligase SPOP (64Li C. Ao J. Fu J. Lee D.F. Xu J. Lonard D. O'Malley B.W. Oncogene. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). This site is lost in AIB1-Δ4 and could explain the high coactivator activity and stability of the AIB1-Δ4 protein.A major question that arises from these studies on AIB1-Δ4 is whether there are distinct biological functions for this isoform. To begin to investigate this, we took advantage of the unique splice junction sequence that exists in the AIB1-Δ4 transcript to develop a new technique to specifically measure the amounts of AIB1-Δ4 mRNA independent of AIB1 transcript. By utilizing Scorpion primer technology, we see higher expression of AIB1-Δ4 in cancer cell lines relative to normal cell lines and higher expression in more metastatic cancer cell lines. Observations on the role of AIB1 in disease do not make the distinction between the relative contribution of AIB1 or AIB1-Δ4 to the phenotype. Studies that analyze mRNA expression of AIB1 utilize primers that detect both AIB1 and AIB1-Δ4. We believe that it will be important to dissect out the contribution to phenotypes attributed to AIB1-Δ4 independent of AIB1 and vice versa in future clinical studies. We have also developed affinity-purified antibodies based on the knowledge of the unique N-acetylated N-terminal sequence of AIB1-Δ4, which will serve as another resource to determine the expression of AIB1-Δ4 at the protein level at various stages of tumorigenesis.The precise role of AIB1-Δ4 in tumorigenesis is not known. It is intriguing that AIB1-Δ4 is not degraded under conditions of low growth (e.g. high confluence), although full-length AIB1 is rapidly lost. AIB1-Δ4 protein expression may provide a selective advantage for a cancer cell to continue to grow in conditions unfavorable for proliferation for both its metastatic and transcriptional function. Therefore, further studies into the regulation and possible targets of AIB1-Δ4 in tumorigenesis need to be pursued. IntroductionGene transcription in eukaryotes is a complex and highly regulated process. One of the major controls of gene transcription is exerted by the coregulator family of proteins. These include both corepressors, which dampen transcription, and coactivators, which potentiate transcription. A subgroup of coactivators has been shown to be critical for the malignant progression of cancer and is known as the p160 steroid receptor coactivators (1Xu J. Wu R.C. O'Malley B.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). One member in particular was identified to be amplified in breast cancer. Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1, SRC-3, NCOA3, ACTR, TRAM-1, pCIP, and RAC3) has been shown to be a gene amplified in breast cancer (2Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M.

Treat. 2001; 68: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Its role in tumorigenesis is attributed to its ability to coactivate both steroid hormone- and growth factor-dependent transcription (3Lahusen T. Henke R.T. Kagan B.L. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T.

Clinically, AIB1 expression in breast cancer cases is correlated with high HER2 levels, larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, and shorter disease-free survival (13Bautista S. Vallès H. Walker R.L. Anzick S. Zeillinger R. Meltzer P. Theillet C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2925-2929PubMed Google Scholar, 14Harigopal M. Heymann J. Ghosh S. Anagnostou V. Camp R.L. Rimm D.L. Breast Cancer Res.

Also, high levels of AIB1 in conjunction with high HER2 levels coincide with reduced disease-free survival in patients treated with tamoxifen, suggesting a role for AIB1 in tamoxifen resistance (16Osborne C.K. Bardou V. Hopp T.A. Chamness G.C. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. Wong J. Allred D.C. Clark G.M. Schiff R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar).We had previously identified a splice variant of AIB1, where exon 3 was spliced from the mature mRNA and the resulting protein named AIB1-Δ3 (17Reiter R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39736-39741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recently, an additional 5′ exon 81,164 bases upstream of the known 5′UTR was identified. Thus, the deleted exon is now exon 4, and we now refer to the splice variant as AIB1-Δ4. We had reported that AIB1-Δ4 mRNA results in an N-terminally truncated isoform of the AIB1 protein that was found to be a more potent coactivator of steroid-dependent transcription on a per mol basis when compared with the full-length AIB1 protein. AIB1-Δ4 mRNA expression was elevated in breast tumor tissue relative to normal breast tissue (17Reiter R. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol.

More recently, AIB1-Δ4 was shown to act as a molecular bridge between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the cytoplasm, and its overexpression increased the invasiveness of the MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cell line (21Long W.

We now show that AIB1-Δ4 can enter the nucleus by a noncanonical nuclear import mechanism. AIB1-Δ4 is recruited to estrogen-response elements of endogenous estrogen-regulated genes and increases their expression. We also determined that the N-terminal region absent from the AIB1-Δ4 protein contains an inhibitory domain. Through the use of Scorpion primer technology, we have created the first quantitative assay for the AIB1-Δ4 transcript and found a correlation between AIB1-Δ4 expression and the metastatic phenotype of human cancer cell lines. These data suggest that the nuclear activities of AIB1-Δ4 can contribute to its function in malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1983426369,"One of the great challenges in the post-genomic era is to decipher the underlying principles governing the dynamics of biological responses. As modulating gene expression levels is among the key regulatory responses of an organism to changes in its environment, identifying biologically relevant transcriptional regulators and their putative regulatory interactions with target genes is an essential step towards studying the complex dynamics of transcriptional regulation. We present an analysis that integrates various computational and biological aspects to explore the transcriptional regulation of systemic inflammatory responses through a human endotoxemia model. Given a high-dimensional transcriptional profiling dataset from human blood leukocytes, an elementary set of temporal dynamic responses which capture the essence of a pro-inflammatory phase, a counter-regulatory response and a dysregulation in leukocyte bioenergetics has been extracted. Upon identification of these expression patterns, fourteen inflammation-specific gene batteries that represent groups of hypothetically 'coregulated' genes are proposed. Subsequently, statistically significant cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are identified and decomposed into a list of critical transcription factors (34) that are validated largely on primary literature. Finally, our analysis further allows for the construction of a dynamic representation of the temporal transcriptional regulatory program across the host, deciphering possible combinatorial interactions among factors under which they might be active. Although much remains to be explored, this study has computationally identified key transcription factors and proposed a putative time-dependent transcriptional regulatory program associated with critical transcriptional inflammatory responses. These results provide a solid foundation for future investigations to elucidate the underlying transcriptional regulatory mechanisms under the host inflammatory response. Also, the assumption that coexpressed genes that are functionally relevant are more likely to share some common transcriptional regulatory mechanism seems to be promising, making the proposed framework become essential in unravelling context-specific transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying diverse mammalian biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1966746682,"In eukaryotic cells, repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is critical for genome stability. In contrast to the complex eukaryotic repair system, bacterial NHEJ apparatus consists of only two proteins, Ku and a multifunctional DNA ligase (LigD), whose functional mechanism has not been fully clarified. We show here for the first time that Sir2 is involved in the mycobacterial NHEJ repair pathway. Here, using tandem affinity purification (TAP) screening, we have identified an NAD-dependent deacetylase in mycobacteria which is a homologue of the eukaryotic Sir2 protein and interacts directly with Ku. Results from an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay suggest that Sir2 interacts directly with LigD. Plasmid-based end-joining assays revealed that the efficiency of DSB repair in a sir2 deletion mutant was reduced 2-fold. Moreover, the Δsir2 strain was about 10-fold more sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) in the stationary phase than the wild-type. Our results suggest that Sir2 may function closely together with Ku and LigD in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway in mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2080283586,"Understanding the processes and conditions under which populations diverge to give rise to distinct species is a central question in evolutionary biology. Since recently diverged populations have high levels of shared polymorphisms, it is challenging to distinguish between recent divergence with no (or very low) inter-population gene flow and older splitting events with subsequent gene flow. Recently published methods to infer speciation parameters under the isolation-migration framework are based on summarizing polymorphism data at multiple loci in two species using the joint site-frequency spectrum (JSFS). We have developed two improvements of these methods based on a more extensive use of the JSFS classes of polymorphisms for species with high intra-locus recombination rates. First, using a likelihood based method, we demonstrate that taking into account low-frequency polymorphisms shared between species significantly improves the joint estimation of the divergence time and gene flow between species. Second, we introduce a local linear regression algorithm that considerably reduces the computational time and allows for the estimation of unequal rates of gene flow between species. We also investigate which summary statistics from the JSFS allow the greatest estimation accuracy for divergence time and migration rates for low (around 10) and high (around 100) numbers of loci. Focusing on cases with low numbers of loci and high intra-locus recombination rates we show that our methods for the estimation of divergence time and migration rates are more precise than existing approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2121162103,"Background In a world limited by data availability and limited funds for conservation, scientists and practitioners must use indicator groups to define spatial conservation priorities. Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of indicator groups, but still little is known about the consistency in performance of these groups in different regions, which would allow their a priori selection. Methodology/Principal Findings We systematically examined the effectiveness and the consistency of nine indicator groups in representing mammal species in two top-ranked Biodiversity Hotspots (BH): the Brazilian Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. To test for group effectiveness we first found the best sets of sites able to maximize the representation of each indicator group in the BH and then calculated the average representation of different target species by the indicator groups in the BH. We considered consistent indicator groups whose representation of target species was not statistically different between BH. We called effective those groups that outperformed the target-species representation achieved by random sets of species. Effective indicator groups required the selection of less than 2% of the BH area for representing target species. Restricted-range species were the most effective indicators for the representation of all mammal diversity as well as target species. It was also the only group with high consistency. Conclusions/Significance We show that several indicator groups could be applied as shortcuts for representing mammal species in the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest to develop conservation plans, however, only restricted-range species consistently held as the most effective indicator group for such a task. This group is of particular importance in conservation planning as it captures high diversity of endemic and endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2155670103,"Alterations in stromal tissue components can inhibit or promote epithelial tumorigenesis. Decorin (DCN) and lumican (LUM) show reduced stromal expression in serous epithelial ovarian cancer (sEOC). We hypothesized that common variants in these genes associate with risk. Associations with sEOC among Caucasians were estimated with odds ratios (OR) among 397 cases and 920 controls in two U.S.-based studies (discovery set), 436 cases and 1,098 controls in Australia (replication set 1) and a consortium of 15 studies comprising 1,668 cases and 4,249 controls (replication set 2). The discovery set and replication set 1 (833 cases and 2,013 controls) showed statistically homogeneous (P(heterogeneity)≥0.48) decreased risks of sEOC at four variants: DCN rs3138165, rs13312816 and rs516115, and LUM rs17018765 (OR = 0.6 to 0.9; P(trend) = 0.001 to 0.03). Results from replication set 2 were statistically homogeneous (P(heterogeneity)≥0.13) and associated with increased risks at DCN rs3138165 and rs13312816, and LUM rs17018765: all ORs = 1.2; P(trend)≤0.02. The ORs at the four variants were statistically heterogeneous across all 18 studies (P(heterogeneity)≤0.03), which precluded combining. In post-hoc analyses, interactions were observed between each variant and recruitment period (P(interaction)≤0.003), age at diagnosis (P(interaction) = 0.04), and year of diagnosis (P(interaction) = 0.05) in the five studies with available information (1,044 cases, 2,469 controls). We conclude that variants in DCN and LUM are not directly associated with sEOC, and that confirmation of possible effect modification of the variants by non-genetic factors is required."
