https://openalex.org/W4206153788,"On 24th November 2021, the sequence of a new SARS-CoV-2 viral isolate Omicron-B.1.1.529 was announced, containing far more mutations in Spike (S) than previously reported variants. Neutralization titers of Omicron by sera from vaccinees and convalescent subjects infected with early pandemic Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta are substantially reduced, or the sera failed to neutralize. Titers against Omicron are boosted by third vaccine doses and are high in both vaccinated individuals and those infected by Delta. Mutations in Omicron knock out or substantially reduce neutralization by most of the large panel of potent monoclonal antibodies and antibodies under commercial development. Omicron S has structural changes from earlier viruses and uses mutations that confer tight binding to ACE2 to unleash evolution driven by immune escape. This leads to a large number of mutations in the ACE2 binding site and rebalances receptor affinity to that of earlier pandemic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W4210727748,"A stable perovskite heterojunction was constructed for inverted solar cells through surface sulfidation of lead (Pb)-rich perovskite films. The formed lead-sulfur (Pb-S) bonds upshifted the Fermi level at the perovskite interface and induced an extra back-surface field for electron extraction. The resulting inverted devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) >24% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.19 volts, corresponding to a low voltage loss of 0.36 volts. The strong Pb-S bonds could stabilize perovskite heterojunctions and strengthen underlying perovskite structures that have a similar crystal lattice. Devices with surface sulfidation retained more than 90% of the initial PCE after aging at 85°C for 2200 hours or operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1000 hours at 55° ± 5°C."
https://openalex.org/W4210649579,"Obtaining a burning plasma is a critical step towards self-sustaining fusion energy1. A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain. After decades of fusion research, here we achieve a burning-plasma state in the laboratory. These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9 megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500 terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4-7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction. These results provide an opportunity to study α-particle-dominated plasmas and burning-plasma physics in the laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W4221049439,"Public databases contain a planetary collection of nucleic acid sequences, but their systematic exploration has been inhibited by a lack of efficient methods for searching this corpus, which (at the time of writing) exceeds 20 petabases and is growing exponentially1. Here we developed a cloud computing infrastructure, Serratus, to enable ultra-high-throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. We searched 5.7 million biologically diverse samples (10.2 petabases) for the hallmark gene RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and identified well over 105 novel RNA viruses, thereby expanding the number of known species by roughly an order of magnitude. We characterized novel viruses related to coronaviruses, hepatitis delta virus and huge phages, respectively, and analysed their environmental reservoirs. To catalyse the ongoing revolution of viral discovery, we established a free and comprehensive database of these data and tools. Expanding the known sequence diversity of viruses can reveal the evolutionary origins of emerging pathogens and improve pathogen surveillance for the anticipation and mitigation of future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4210678178,"Deep neural networks have become a pervasive tool in science and engineering. However, modern deep neural networks' growing energy requirements now increasingly limit their scaling and broader use. We propose a radical alternative for implementing deep neural network models: Physical Neural Networks. We introduce a hybrid physical-digital algorithm called Physics-Aware Training to efficiently train sequences of controllable physical systems to act as deep neural networks. This method automatically trains the functionality of any sequence of real physical systems, directly, using backpropagation, the same technique used for modern deep neural networks. To illustrate their generality, we demonstrate physical neural networks with three diverse physical systems-optical, mechanical, and electrical. Physical neural networks may facilitate unconventional machine learning hardware that is orders of magnitude faster and more energy efficient than conventional electronic processors."
https://openalex.org/W4210546466,"Owing to rapid development in their efficiency1 and stability2, perovskite solar cells are at the forefront of emerging photovoltaic technologies. State-of-the-art cells exhibit voltage losses3-8 approaching the theoretical minimum and near-unity internal quantum efficiency9-13, but conversion efficiencies are limited by the fill factor (<83%, below the Shockley-Queisser limit of approximately 90%). This limitation results from non-ideal charge transport between the perovskite absorber and the cell's electrodes5,8,13-16. Reducing the electrical series resistance of charge transport layers is therefore crucial for improving efficiency. Here we introduce a reverse-doping process to fabricate nitrogen-doped titanium oxide electron transport layers with outstanding charge transport performance. By incorporating this charge transport material into perovskite solar cells, we demonstrate 1-cm2 cells with fill factors of >86%, and an average fill factor of 85.3%. We also report a certified steady-state efficiency of 22.6% for a 1-cm2 cell (23.33% ± 0.58% from a reverse current-voltage scan)."
https://openalex.org/W4220836043,"The effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 on the individual level is well established. However, few studies have examined vaccine effectiveness against transmission. We used a chain binomial model to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination with BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine] against household transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Israel before and after emergence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. Vaccination reduced susceptibility to infection by 89.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 88.7 to 90.0%], whereas vaccine effectiveness against infectiousness given infection was 23.0% (95% CI: −11.3 to 46.7%) during days 10 to 90 after the second dose, before 1 June 2021. Total vaccine effectiveness was 91.8% (95% CI: 88.1 to 94.3%). However, vaccine effectiveness is reduced over time as a result of the combined effect of waning of immunity and emergence of the Delta variant."

https://openalex.org/W4210553032,"Cerebrovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and neurologic disability. Further understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies requires a deeper knowledge of cerebrovascular cells in humans. We profiled transcriptomes of 181,388 cells to define a cell atlas of the adult human cerebrovasculature, including endothelial cell molecular signatures with arteriovenous segmentation and expanded perivascular cell diversity. By leveraging this reference, we investigated cellular and molecular perturbations in brain arteriovenous malformations, which are a leading cause of stroke in young people, and identified pathologic endothelial transformations with abnormal vascular patterning and the ontology of vascularly derived inflammation. We illustrate the interplay between vascular and immune cells that contributes to brain hemorrhage and catalog opportunities for targeting angiogenic and inflammatory programs in vascular malformations."
https://openalex.org/W4210474529,"Drugs that target the human serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) are used to treat neuropsychiatric diseases; however, many have hallucinogenic effects, hampering their use. Here, we present structures of 5-HT2AR complexed with the psychedelic drugs psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) and d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), as well as the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin and the nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analog lisuride. Serotonin and psilocin display a second binding mode in addition to the canonical mode, which enabled the design of the psychedelic IHCH-7113 (a substructure of antipsychotic lumateperone) and several 5-HT2AR β-arrestin-biased agonists that displayed antidepressant-like activity in mice but without hallucinogenic effects. The 5-HT2AR complex structures presented herein and the resulting insights provide a solid foundation for the structure-based design of safe and effective nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analogs with therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W4210452888,"Evolutionary development of the human brain is characterized by the expansion of various brain regions. Here, we show that developmental processes specific to humans are responsible for malformations of cortical development (MCDs), which result in developmental delay and epilepsy in children. We generated a human cerebral organoid model for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and identified a specific neural stem cell type, caudal late interneuron progenitor (CLIP) cells. In TSC, CLIP cells over-proliferate, generating excessive interneurons, brain tumors, and cortical malformations. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition reduces tumor burden, identifying potential treatment options for TSC and related disorders. The identification of CLIP cells reveals the extended interneuron generation in the human brain as a vulnerability for disease. In addition, this work demonstrates that analyzing MCDs can reveal fundamental insights into human-specific aspects of brain development."
https://openalex.org/W4210380316,"Human biology is tightly linked to proteins, yet most measurements do not precisely determine alternatively spliced sequences or posttranslational modifications. Here, we present the primary structures of ~30,000 unique proteoforms, nearly 10 times more than in previous studies, expressed from 1690 human genes across 21 cell types and plasma from human blood and bone marrow. The results, compiled in the Blood Proteoform Atlas (BPA), indicate that proteoforms better describe protein-level biology and are more specific indicators of differentiation than their corresponding proteins, which are more broadly expressed across cell types. We demonstrate the potential for clinical application, by interrogating the BPA in the context of liver transplantation and identifying cell and proteoform signatures that distinguish normal graft function from acute rejection and other causes of graft dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W4210591387,"Children not vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may still benefit from vaccines through protection from vaccinated contacts. We estimated the protection provided to children through parental vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine. We studied households without prior infection consisting of two parents and unvaccinated children, estimating the effect of parental vaccination on the risk of infection for unvaccinated children. We studied two periods separately-an early period (17 January 2021 to 28 March 2021; Alpha variant, two doses versus no vaccination) and a late period (11 July 2021 to 30 September 2021; Delta variant, booster dose versus two vaccine doses). We found that having a single vaccinated parent was associated with a 26.0 and a 20.8% decreased risk in the early and late periods, respectively, and having two vaccinated parents was associated with a 71.7 and a 58.1% decreased risk, respectively. Thus, parental vaccination confers substantial protection on unvaccinated children in the household."
https://openalex.org/W4210278279,"Abstract As the length scales of materials decrease, the heterogeneities associated with interfaces become almost as important as the surrounding materials. This has led to extensive studies of emergent electronic and magnetic interface properties in superlattices 1–9 . However, the interfacial vibrations that affect the phonon-mediated properties, such as thermal conductivity 10,11 , are measured using macroscopic techniques that lack spatial resolution. Although it is accepted that intrinsic phonons change near boundaries 12,13 , the physical mechanisms and length scales through which interfacial effects influence materials remain unclear. Here we demonstrate the localized vibrational response of interfaces in strontium titanate–calcium titanate superlattices by combining advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations and ultrafast optical spectroscopy. Structurally diffuse interfaces that bridge the bounding materials are observed and this local structure creates phonon modes that determine the global response of the superlattice once the spacing of the interfaces approaches the phonon spatial extent. Our results provide direct visualization of the progression of the local atomic structure and interface vibrations as they come to determine the vibrational response of an entire superlattice. Direct observation of such local atomic and vibrational phenomena demonstrates that their spatial extent needs to be quantified to understand macroscopic behaviour. Tailoring interfaces, and knowing their local vibrational response, provides a means of pursuing designer solids with emergent infrared and thermal responses."

https://openalex.org/W4210298343,"The ""sign problem"" (SP) is a fundamental limitation to simulations of strongly correlated matter. It is often argued that the SP is not intrinsic to the physics of particular Hamiltonians because its behavior can be influenced by the choice of algorithm. By contrast, we show that the SP in determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is quantitatively linked to quantum critical behavior. We demonstrate this through simulations of several models with critical properties that are relatively well understood. We propose a reinterpretation of the low average sign for the Hubbard model on the square lattice away from half filling in terms of the onset of pseudogap behavior and exotic superconductivity. Our study charts a path for exploiting the average sign in QMC simulations to understand quantum critical behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4210564284,"The brain’s remarkable ability to learn and execute various motor behaviours harnesses the capacity of neural populations to generate a variety of activity patterns. Here we explore systematic changes in preparatory activity in motor cortex that accompany motor learning. We trained rhesus monkeys to learn an arm-reaching task1 in a curl force field that elicited new muscle forces for some, but not all, movement directions2,3. We found that in a neural subspace predictive of hand forces, changes in preparatory activity tracked the learned behavioural modifications and reassociated4 existing activity patterns with updated movements. Along a neural population dimension orthogonal to the force-predictive subspace, we discovered that preparatory activity shifted uniformly for all movement directions, including those unaltered by learning. During a washout period when the curl field was removed, preparatory activity gradually reverted in the force-predictive subspace, but the uniform shift persisted. These persistent preparatory activity patterns may retain a motor memory of the learned field5,6 and support accelerated relearning of the same curl field. When a set of distinct curl fields was learned in sequence, we observed a corresponding set of field-specific uniform shifts which separated the associated motor memories in the neural state space7–9. The precise geometry of these uniform shifts in preparatory activity could serve to index motor memories, facilitating the acquisition, retention and retrieval of a broad motor repertoire. In rhesus monkeys, learning of a motor task is accompanied by uniform changes in preparatory activity in motor cortex that are orthogonal to the force-predictive neural state subspace."
https://openalex.org/W4210581642,"Hibernation is a mammalian strategy that uses metabolic plasticity to reduce energy demands and enable long-term fasting. Fasting mitigates winter food scarcity but eliminates dietary nitrogen, jeopardizing body protein balance. Here, we reveal gut microbiome-mediated urea nitrogen recycling in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Ureolytic gut microbes incorporate urea nitrogen into metabolites that are absorbed by the host, with the nitrogen reincorporated into the squirrel's protein pool. Urea nitrogen recycling is greatest after prolonged fasting in late winter, when urea transporter abundance in gut tissue and urease gene abundance in the microbiome are highest. These results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiome during hibernation and suggest mechanisms by which urea nitrogen recycling may contribute to protein balance in other monogastric animals."
https://openalex.org/W4210308669,"Although it is known that birds can return to their breeding grounds with exceptional precision, it has remained a mystery how they know when and where to stop migrating. Using nearly a century's worth of Eurasian reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) ringing recoveries, we investigated whether fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field predict variation in the sites to which birds return. Ringing recoveries suggest that magnetic inclination is learned before departure and is subsequently used as a uni-coordinate ""stop sign"" when relocating the natal or breeding site. However, many locations have the same inclination angle. Data from populations with different migratory directions indicate that birds solve this ambiguity by stopping at the first place where the right inclination is encountered on an inherited return vector."

https://openalex.org/W3174958051,"In thermodynamic equilibrium, current in metallic systems is carried by electronic states near the Fermi energy, whereas the filled bands underneath contribute little to conduction. Here, we describe a very different regime in which carrier distribution in graphene and its superlattices is shifted so far from equilibrium that the filled bands start playing an essential role, leading to a critical-current behavior. The criticalities develop upon the velocity of electron flow reaching the Fermi velocity. Key signatures of the out-of-equilibrium state are current-voltage characteristics that resemble those of superconductors, sharp peaks in differential resistance, sign reversal of the Hall effect, and a marked anomaly caused by the Schwinger-like production of hot electron-hole plasma. The observed behavior is expected to be common to all graphene-based superlattices."
https://openalex.org/W4220730782,"Flowering plants alternate between multicellular haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) generations. Pollen actively transcribes its haploid genome, providing phenotypic diversity even among pollen grains from a single plant. In this study, we used allele-specific RNA sequencing of single pollen precursors to follow the shift to haploid expression in maize pollen. We observed widespread biallelic expression for 11 days after meiosis, indicating that transcripts synthesized by the diploid sporophyte persist long into the haploid phase. Subsequently, there was a rapid and global conversion to monoallelic expression at pollen mitosis I, driven by active new transcription from the haploid genome. Genes showed evidence of increased purifying selection if they were expressed after (but not before) pollen mitosis I. This work establishes the timing during which haploid selection may act in pollen."
https://openalex.org/W4210512984,"The evolution and diversification of ancient megathermal angiosperm lineages with Africa-India origins in Asian tropical forests is poorly understood because of the lack of reliable fossils. Our palaeobiogeographical analysis of pollen fossils from Africa and India combined with molecular data and fossil amber records suggest a tropical-African origin of Dipterocarpaceae during the mid-Cretaceous and its dispersal to India during the Late Maastrichtian and Paleocene, leading to range expansion of aseasonal dipterocarps on the Indian Plate. The India-Asia collision further facilitated the dispersal of dipterocarps from India to similar climatic zones in Southeast Asia, which supports their out-of-India migration. The dispersal pathway suggested for Dipterocarpaceae may provide a framework for an alternative biogeographic hypothesis for several megathermal angiosperm families that are presently widely distributed in Southeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W4210703721,Sequence-specific binding of proteins to DNA is essential for accessing genetic information. We derive a model that predicts an anticorrelation between the macroscopic association and dissociation rates of DNA binding proteins. We tested the model for thousands of different lac operator sequences with a protein binding microarray and by observing kinetics for individual lac repressor molecules in single-molecule experiments. We found that sequence specificity is mainly governed by the efficiency with which the protein recognizes different targets. The variation in probability of recognizing different targets is at least 1.7 times as large as the variation in microscopic dissociation rates. Modulating the rate of binding instead of the rate of dissociation effectively reduces the risk of the protein being retained on nontarget sequences while searching.
https://openalex.org/W4210759820,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization1,2. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm-/- cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm-/- cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations2. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W4225528725,"Despite widespread communication of the health risks associated with the COVID-19 virus, many Americans underestimated its risks and were antagonistic regarding preventative measures. Political partisanship has been linked to diverging attitudes towards the virus, but the cognitive processes underlying this divergence remain unclear. Bayesian models fit to data gathered through two preregistered online surveys, administered before (March 13, 2020, N = 850) and during the first wave (April-May, 2020, N = 1610) of cases in the United States, reveal two preexisting forms of distrust--distrust in Democratic politicians and in medical scientists--that drove initial skepticism about the virus. During the first wave of cases, additional factors came into play, suggesting that skeptical attitudes became more deeply embedded within a complex network of auxiliary beliefs. These findings highlight how mechanisms that enhance cognitive coherence can drive anti-science attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W4210644577,"Quantum control of motion is central for modern atomic clocks1 and interferometers2. It enables protocols to process and distribute quantum information3,4, and allows the probing of entanglement in correlated states of matter5. However, the motional coherence of individual particles can be fragile to maintain, as external degrees of freedom couple strongly to the environment. Systems in nature with robust motional coherence instead often involve pairs of particles, from the electrons in helium, to atom pairs6, molecules7 and Cooper pairs. Here we demonstrate long-lived motional coherence and entanglement of pairs of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice array. The common and relative motion of each pair realize a robust qubit, protected by exchange symmetry. The energy difference between the two motional states is set by the atomic recoil energy, is dependent on only the mass and the lattice wavelength, and is insensitive to the noise of the confining potential. We observe quantum coherence beyond ten seconds. Modulation of the interactions between the atoms provides universal control of the motional qubit. The methods presented here will enable coherently programmable quantum simulators of many-fermion systems8, precision metrology based on atom pairs and molecules9,10 and, by implementing further advances11-13, digital quantum computation using fermion pairs14."
https://openalex.org/W4210617035,"Carbon emissions constitute a large portion of greenhouse gases that are responsible for global warming and climate change. This study examines the impact of export variety on carbon emissions along with foreign direct investment (FDI) and technological development as determinants of environmental degradation in Pakistan. Moreover, this study is conducted in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis (EKC). This study applies dynamic ordinary least squares and error correction models for long-term and short-term estimates, respectively. The results indicate that the EKC hypothesis is valid in the long term. This implies that Pakistan's economy reached the threshold level of income, after which an increase in income was not responsible for environmental degradation. Export variety restrains environmental degradation in the short term and is not a significant factor in the long term. Energy consumption has aggravated environmental degradation, while FDI and technological development are restraining environmental degradation. Policy measures are recommended to curb environmental degradation in Pakistan."

https://openalex.org/W4206936397,"ASD-associated genes are enriched for synaptic proteins and epigenetic regulators. How those chromatin modulators establish ASD traits have remained unknown. We find haploinsufficiency of Ash1l causally induces anxiety and autistic-like behavior, including repetitive behavior, and alters social behavior. Specific depletion of Ash1l in forebrain induces similar ASD-associated behavioral defects. While the learning ability remains intact, the discrimination ability of Ash1l mutant mice is reduced. Mechanistically, deletion of Ash1l in neurons induces excessive synapses due to the synapse pruning deficits, especially during the post-learning period. Dysregulation of synaptic genes is detected in Ash1l mutant brain. Specifically, Eph receptor A7 is downregulated in Ash1l+/- mice through accumulating EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 in its gene body. Importantly, increasing activation of EphA7 in Ash1l+/- mice by supplying its ligand, ephrin-A5, strongly promotes synapse pruning and rescues discrimination deficits. Our results suggest that Ash1l haploinsufficiency is a highly penetrant risk factor for ASD, resulting from synapse pruning deficits."
https://openalex.org/W4210539467,"The human cortex contains inhibitory interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), a germinal zone in the embryonic ventral forebrain. How this germinal zone generates sufficient interneurons for the human brain remains unclear. We found that the human MGE (hMGE) contains nests of proliferative neuroblasts with ultrastructural and transcriptomic features that distinguish them from other progenitors in the hMGE. When dissociated hMGE cells are transplanted into the neonatal mouse brain, they reform into nests containing proliferating neuroblasts that generate young neurons that migrate extensively into the mouse forebrain and mature into different subtypes of functional interneurons. Together, these results indicate that the nest organization and sustained proliferation of neuroblasts in the hMGE provide a mechanism for the extended production of interneurons for the human forebrain."

https://openalex.org/W4210604472,"Toxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic protozoan, which widely infects humans and other warm-blooded animals. The type I interferon (IFN) such as IFN-α/β is involved in cGAS-STING signaling to resist T. gondii infection. We found in RAW264.7 cells, that T. gondii virulence factor TgROP18I , inhibited IFN-β production through interacting with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Besides, TgROP18I interacted with p62 and Tumor Necrotic Factor Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6), which resulted in the inhibition of TRAF6-p62 interaction, and phosphorylation of p62. Furthermore, TgROP18I restricted the recruitment of ubiquitin, p62 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) in IFN-γ-stimulated murine cell line L929 cells. In IFN-γ-stimulated human cells, TgROP18I restricted the decoration of PVM with ubiquitin, p62, and LC3, and bound with TRAF2, TRAF6, and p62, respectively. As a result, TgROP18I led to a successful parasitic replication in murine and human cells. Collectively, our study revealed the function of TgROP18I in suppressing host type I interferon responses in T. gondii infection for parasitic immune escape."

https://openalex.org/W4210508153,"The 2D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of transmission conductor is set up to simulate the aerodynamic forces varying with time on the conductor. Taking into account the geometrical nonlinearity of conductor lines, the finite element (FE) models of single span and two-span transmission lines discretized with beam elements are established. By means of the FE models, the aeolian vibrations of the conductor lines excited by the aerodynamic forces under different wind velocities are numerically simulated. The nonlinear resonant characteristics, the amplitude-frequency relations of the conductor lines during aeolian vibration are investigated, and the influences of the span length as well as the initial tension in conductors on the aeolian vibration characteristics are analyzed. Furthermore, a 3D FE model of a conductor segment and the suspension clamp is created to study the stress distributions of the 3D model corresponding to different lines during aeolian vibrations. Finally, based on the stress analysis of the 3D model, the fatigue lives of the transmission conductors during aeolian vibration under different wind velocities are estimated. The jump phenomenon induced by the nonlinear vibration is reflected by the numerical simulation considering the geometric nonlinearity, and it is found that the energy balance principle (EBP) overestimates the vibration amplitudes because it cannot take the influences of the geometrical nonlinearity and span length into account. The obtained results may provide some instructions for the prevention design of aeolian vibration."
https://openalex.org/W4210620394,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the severest form of kidney disease characterized by poor filtration. The magnitude of chronic kidney disease is trending upward in the last few years linked with the rapidly escalating cases of non-communicable chronic diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus. However, little is known about when this problem may occur, the incidence as well as predictors of chronic kidney disease among type-II diabetes mellitus patients. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the incidence, time to the occurrence, and predictors of chronic kidney disease in type-II diabetic patients attending the Amhara region referral hospitals, Ethiopia.A retrospective follow-up study was conducted involving 415 participants with type-II diabetes mellitus that enrolled in the chronic follow-up from 2012 to 2017. Multivariable shared Frailty Weibull (Gamma) survival model was employed considering the hospitals as a clustering variable. Model fitness was checked by both the Akaike information criteria (AIC) and log-likelihood. Factors having a p-value of ≤0.2 in the bi-variable analysis were considered to enter the multivariable model. Variables that had a p-value of <0.05 with its corresponding 95% confidence level were deemed to be significant predictors of chronic kidney disease.The overall cumulative incidence of chronic kidney disease was 10.8% [95%; CI: 7.7-14.0%] with a median occurrence time of 5 years. The annual incidence rate was 193/10,000 [95%; CI: 144.28-258.78].

The median time to develop chronic kidney disease was five years. Hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases have escalated the hazard of developing CKD. Thus, health promotion and education of diabetic patients to optimize cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease is recommended to limit the occurrence of this life-threatening disease."
https://openalex.org/W4210712113,"In conventional superconductors, the phase transition into a zero-resistance and perfectly diamagnetic state is accompanied by a jump in the specific heat and the opening of a spectral gap1. In the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprates, although the transport, magnetic and thermodynamic signatures of Tc have been known since the 1980s2, the spectroscopic singularity associated with the transition remains unknown. Here we resolve this long-standing puzzle with a high-precision angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study on overdoped (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ (Bi2212). We first probe the momentum-resolved electronic specific heat via spectroscopy and reproduce the specific heat peak at Tc, completing the missing link for a holistic description of superconductivity. Then, by studying the full momentum, energy and temperature evolution of the spectra, we reveal that this thermodynamic anomaly arises from the singular growth of in-gap spectral intensity across Tc. Furthermore, we observe that the temperature evolution of in-gap intensity is highly anisotropic in the momentum space, and the gap itself obeys both the d-wave functional form and particle-hole symmetry. These findings support the scenario that the superconducting transition is driven by phase fluctuations. They also serve as an anchor point for understanding the Fermi arc and pseudogap phenomena in underdoped cuprates."

Enamel is formed by ameloblast cells in two main sequential stages known as secretory and maturation. Defining the physiological features of each stage is essential to understand mineralization. Here, we analyzed functional features of mitochondria in rat primary secretory and maturation-stage ameloblasts focusing on their role in Ca2+ signaling. Quantification of the Ca2+ stored in the mitochondria by trifluoromethoxy carbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone stimulation was comparable in both stages. The release of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pools by adenosine triphosphate in rhod2AM-loaded cells showed similar mitochondrial Ca2+ (m Ca2+ ) uptake. However, m Ca2+ extrusion via Na+ -Li+ -Ca2+ exchanger was more prominent in maturation. To address if m Ca2+ uptake via the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) played a role in cytosolic Ca2+ (c Ca2+ ) buffering, we stimulated Ca2+ influx via the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and blocked MCU with the inhibitor Ru265. This inhibitor was first tested using the enamel cell line LS8 cells. Ru265 prevented c Ca2+ clearance in permeabilized LS8 cells like ruthenium red, and it did not affect ΔΨm in intact cells. In primary ameloblasts, SOCE stimulation elicited a significantly higher m Ca2+ uptake in maturation ameloblasts. The uptake of Ca2+ into the mitochondria was dramatically decreased in the presence of Ru265. Combined, these results suggest an increased mitochondrial Ca2+ handling in maturation but only upon stimulation of Ca2+ influx via SOCE. These functional studies provide insights not only on the role of mitochondria in ameloblast Ca2+ physiology, but also advance the concept that SOCE and m Ca2+ uptake are complementary processes in biological mineralization."

Spectroscopic analyses characterized 5 sterols as 29-Hydroperoxy-stigmasta-5,24(28)-dien-3β-ol, saringosterol (24-vinyl-cholest-5-ene-3β,24-diol), 24-methylenecholesterol, fucosterol (stigmasta-5,24-diene-3β-ol), and 24-Hydroperoxy-24-vinyl-cholesterol. The bioactivities of these sterols were tested using lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2) enzyme inhibitory assays. Fucosterol exhibited the highest COX-1 and -2 enzyme inhibitory activities at 59 and 47%, respectively. Saringosterol, 24-methylenecholesterol and fucosterol showed higher LPO inhibitory activity at >50% than the other compounds. In addition, the results of molecular docking revealed that the 5 sterols were located in different pocket of COX-1 and -2 and fucosterol with tetracyclic skeletons and olefin methine achieved the highest binding energy (-7.85 and -9.02 kcal/mol) through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond. Our results confirm the presence of 5 sterols in L. japonica and its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity."

Thus, characterization of early PanIN lesions may reveal markers that can help in diagnosing PDAC at an early stage and allow understanding the pathology of the disease. We performed the molecular and histological assessment of patient-derived PanINs, tumor tissues and pancreas from mouse models with PDAC (KC mice that harbor K-RAS mutation in pancreatic tissue), where we noted marked upregulation of gastrokine (GKN) proteins. To further understand the role of gastrokine proteins in PDAC development, GKN-deficient KC mice were developed by intercrossing gastrokine-deficient mice with KC mice. Panc-02 (pancreatic cancer cells of mouse origin) were genetically modified to express GKN1 for further in vitro and in vivo analysis. Our results show that gastrokine proteins were absent in healthy pancreas and invasive cancer, while its expression was prominent in low-grade PanINs. We could detect these proteins in pancreatic juice and serum of KC mice. Furthermore, accelerated PanIN and tumor development were noted in gastrokine deficient KC mice. Loss of gastrokine 1 protein delayed apoptosis during carcinogenesis leading to the development of desmoplastic stroma while loss of gastrokine 2 increased the proliferation rate in precursor lesions. In summary, we identified gastrokine proteins in early pancreatic precursor lesions, where gastrokine proteins delay pancreatic carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W4210461802,"We devised and assessed open recruitment of host families for medical student homestays in a rural area of Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, so that program organizers would not have to depend on professional and personal connections. The duration of the homestays was one night and two days, and they were conducted in August 2016, 2017, and 2018. The purpose of this community-based medical education program was to promote interactions between medical students and residents of Tamba area. The study asked one family member from each host family to complete a questionnaire after the homestay, and their experiences were evaluated in the study. The questionnaire results were analyzed using a visual analog scale (VAS; 0-100 mm). Thirty-three host families participated in the homestay program over three years. Results showed that VAS scores were high for enjoyment of homestays (VAS; 92.4 ± 13.0), continuation of the homestay program (91.7 ± 12.7), continuation of participation in the homestay program (89.2 ± 16.2), and desire for the homestay students to work in the area in the future (95.4 ± 6.3). The recruitment of host families through advertising was an efficient method for this community-based medical education homestay program. The results indicate that it is possible to attract more host families through open recruitment, which will contribute to the sustainability of the homestay program. Further research, including a follow-up of the students who participated and whether they chose a rural area or Tamba to practice is needed in the future. Since this is an ongoing program, further research in a similar format can be conducted in the future."
