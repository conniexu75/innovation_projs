We tested the hypothesis that myoglobin induces oxidant injury to the kidney and the formation of F2-isoprostanes, potent renal vasoconstrictors formed during lipid peroxidation. In low density lipoprotein (LDL), myoglobin induced a 30-fold increase in the formation of F2-isoprostanes by a mechanism involving redox cycling between ferric and ferryl forms of myoglobin. In an animal model of rhabdomyolysis, urinary excretion of F2-isoprostanes increased by 7.3-fold compared with controls. Administration of alkali, a treatment for rhabdomyolysis, improved renal function and significantly reduced the urinary excretion of F2-isoprostanes by ∼80%. EPR and UV spectroscopy demonstrated that myoglobin was deposited in the kidneys as the redox competent ferric myoglobin and that it’s concentration was not decreased by alkalinization. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the reactivity of ferryl myoglobin, which is responsible for inducing lipid peroxidation, is markedly attenuated at alkaline pH. This was further supported by demonstrating that myoglobin-induced oxidation of LDL was inhibited at alkaline pH. These data strongly support a causative role for oxidative injury in the renal failure of rhabdomyolysis and suggest that the protective effect of alkalinization may be attributed to inhibition of myoglobin-induced lipid peroxidation.

In 1941 Bywaters and Beall (1Bywaters E.G. Beall D. Br. Med. J. 1941; 1: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) described four patients who developed acute renal failure, associated with dark brown urinary granular casts following crush injury. This syndrome has subsequently been termed rhabdomyolysis, since it occurs as a consequence of massive breakdown of muscle. It is usually associated with trauma, but may occur in a variety of clinical settings such as hyperthermia, seizures, muscle ischemia, or exposure to toxins such as alcohol or drug overdose. The associated muscle breakdown releases myoglobin (Mb)1 into the circulation, which then becomes deposited in the kidney causing renal failure in 30% of cases. Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 7% of cases of acute renal failure in the United States (2Better O.S. Stein J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 3Grossman R.A. Hamilton R.W. Morse B.M. Penn A.S. Goldberg M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 291: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the renal failure in rhabdomyolysis has been attributed to both intense renal vasoconstriction and renal tubular necrosis (4Ayer G. Grandchamp A. Wyler T. Truniger B. Circ. Res. 1971; 29: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5Kurtz T.W. Maletz R.M. Hsu C.H. Circ.

Recent studies have suggested a potential role for free radicals in the pathogenesis of myoglobinuria-induced renal failure based on the findings that in rats with rhabdomyolysis, levels of malondialdehyde in the kidney are increased (2–3-fold). There is an induction of antioxidant enzymes and consumption of antioxidants, and administration of antioxidants partially protects against the renal failure (7Shah S.V. Walker P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F438-F443PubMed Google Scholar, 8Salahudeen A.K. Wang C. Bigler S.A. Dai Z. Tachikawa H. Nephrol. Dial.

A. 1991; 88: 9833-9837Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The modest increases of malondialdehyde levels are difficult to interpret, since it is well recognized that measurements of aldehyde lack specificity as a marker of lipid peroxidation, and others have failed to replicate these findings (12Zager R.A. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar). To explain how myoglobinuria could induce an oxidant injury to the kidney, it has been suggested that Mb may release free ferrous (Fe2+) iron, which could then induce lipid peroxidation as a result of the generation of hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction (13Zager R.A. Foerder C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Zager R.A. Burkhart K. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 728-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to demonstrate hydroxyl radical production in the kidneys of animals with myoglobinuria and administration of desferrioxamine at doses that effectively chelate all free iron in the urine is only partially effective in preventing renal failure (15Zager R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism could involve the heme group in Mb itself, which can redox cycle between different oxidation states and promote lipid peroxidation reactions as a consequence of it’s ability to decompose lipid hydroperoxides to peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals (16Patel R.P. Diczfalusy U. Dzeletovic S. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is achieved catalytically by a redox cycle between the ferric (Fe3+) and ferryl ([Fe=O]2+) Mb oxidation states, the latter of which can directly initiate lipid oxidation (17Hogg N. Rice-Evans C. Darley-Usmar V. Wilson M.T. Paganga G. Bourne L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,18Patel R.P. Svistunenko D.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Symons M.C. Wilson M.T. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 25: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In muscle cells, the iron in Mb is maintained predominantly in the reduced ferrous (Fe2+) state, which is unable to participate in such reactions. However, the redox state of Mb in renal tubules has not been determined. We hypothesized that Mb in the extracellular milieu,i.e. in renal tubules, would undergo autooxidation to the ferric form (MetMb), which is then catalytically competent to promote lipid peroxidation reactions. Importantly, unlike the Haber-Weiss/Fenton reactions involving free iron, this reaction is not dependent on the generation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide; it can be driven solely by endogenous lipid hydroperoxides (17Hogg N. Rice-Evans C. Darley-Usmar V. Wilson M.T. Paganga G. Bourne L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Patel R.P. Svistunenko D.A. Darley-Usmar V.M.

Commun. 1988; 5: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Grisham M.B. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This hypothesis may also explain the partial efficacy of desferrioxamine to protect against renal failure in the rat model of rhabdomyolysis, since desferrioxamine is capable of reducing ferryl-Mb and its associated globin radical to the ferric form (21Turner J.J. Rice-Evans C.A. Davies M.J. Newman E.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Cooper C.E. Green E.S. Rice-Evans C.A. Davies M.J. Wrigglesworth J.M. Free Radic. Res. 1994; 20: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nitric oxide also partially protects against the renal failure (23Maree A. Peer G. Schwartz D. Serban I. Blum M. Wollman Y. Cabili S. Laina A. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1994; 9 Suppl. 4: 78-81PubMed Google Scholar). In accord with our hypothesis, this might be explained by an effect of nitric oxide to inhibit heme-dependent lipid peroxidation (24Dee G. Rice-Evans C. Obeyesekera S. Meraji S. Jacobs M. Bruckdorfer K.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mb-induced lipid peroxidation could explain the occurrence of renal tubular necrosis in myoglobinuria, but how this could be causally linked to the reduction in renal blood flow that also characterizes the nephropathy of rhabdomyolysis is not immediately obvious. One hypothesis that could be advanced is that vasoactive products of lipid peroxidation are generated that cause renal vasoconstriction. In this regard, one of the most attractive candidates would be the isoprostanes (IsoPs), which we previously identified as a group of prostaglandin (PG)-like compounds that are formed nonenzymatically in vivoas products of free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid (25Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). PGF2-, E2-, and D2-like compounds are formed in vivo by this process (25Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 26Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J., II J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, two IsoPs formed in abundance, namely 15-F2t-IsoP (27Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (8-iso-PGF2α) and 15-E2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGE2), are very potent renal vasoconstrictors that appear to interact with a unique receptor (25Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar,28Takahashi K. Nammour T.M. Fukunaga M.

Takahashi K. Badr K.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1619-C1624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing question then arises as to whether an effect on oxidant injury could be mechanistically linked with the observation that alkalinization of the urine significantly attenuates the renal dysfunction (2Better O.S. Stein J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12Zager R.A. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar). A plausible and accepted explanation is that alkalinization enhances the solubility of Mb and thus its elimination from the kidney (12Zager R.A. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar). However, we considered an alternative explanation based on the recent demonstration that Mb-induced lipid peroxidation reactions are accelerated at acidic pH (30Rodriguez-Malaver A.J. Leake D.S. Rice-Evans C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, therefore, we examined the role of oxidative injury to the kidney in the pathogenesis of the renal failure associated with rhabdomyolysis in a rat model by measuring the specific marker of lipid peroxidation, F2-IsoPs, which has emerged as one of the most reliable approaches to assess oxidative stress status in vivo (31Roberts L.J., II Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1453: 121-135Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For this purpose, F2-IsoPs were measured both in urine and in renal lipids. A novel aspect of the formation of IsoPs is that they are initially formed in situesterified to tissue lipids and subsequently released (32Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Since IsoPs generated in renal lipids would, in part, be directly released into the urine, measurement of urinary F2-IsoPs can provide an index of lipid peroxidation that occurs in the kidney (31Roberts L.J., II Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1453: 121-135Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). More direct evidence localizing oxidant injury to the kidney can also be obtained by measurement of levels of F2-IsoPs esterified in renal lipids. Furthermore, we explored the hypothesis that the protective effect of alkalinization operates by stabilizing ferryl-Mb, thus reducing its potential to induce lipid peroxidation. Human LDL was isolated by differential centrifugation (33Moore K.P. Darley-Usmar V. Morrow J. Roberts L.J., II Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Horse heart Mb (determined to be MetMb) was purchased from Sigma, Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom. MetMb (0–10 μm final concentration) was added to LDL (50 or 100 μg/ml) in Hanks’ buffered salts solution in which the pH was adjusted as indicated and incubated at 37 °C for the time specified. Ferryl-Mb was prepared immediately before use by mixing 15 μm hydrogen peroxide with 10 μmMetMb. Control experiments involved incubation in phosphate-buffered saline alone or together with hydrogen peroxide (15 μm). The reaction was terminated by addition of butylated hydroxytoluene (100 μm). All experiments were performed in the presence of the iron chelator, DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) (10 μm), to exclude free iron-mediated oxidation. Electrophoretic mobility of LDL was determined using a lipoprotein electrophoresis system (Beckman Co). Gels were fixed, stained with Sudan black B, and results related to mobility of unoxidized LDL (33Moore K.P. Darley-Usmar V. Morrow J. Roberts L.J., II Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The rat model of glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis used has been described previously (12Zager R.A. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were divided into three groups designated as controls, rhabdo, or rhabdo-alk. Control animals (n = 8) were untreated. Animals in the rhabdo group (n = 6) were injected with glycerol (10 ml/kg of a 50% solution in saline), which produces a nonlethal form of renal failure associated with heavy myoglobinuria. The third group (rhabdo-alk, n = 6) was retreated for 24 h with water containing potassium bicarbonate (150 mm) and injected with potassium bicarbonate (2.5 ml/kg of 150 mm potassium bicarbonate) 1 h prior to injection with glycerol. Urine was collected from 0 to 24 h after injection of glycerol, after which the animals were sacrificed and kidneys snap-frozen in liquid N2 for measurement of esterified F2-IsoPs, or frozen in isopentane (at −56 °C), and stored at −80 °C. For the purpose of measuring renal esterfied F2-IsoPs a further three animals in the rhabdo group and a further four animals in the rhabdo-alk group were also studied. Kidney frozen in isopentane was embedded in OCT medium (Tissue-Tek, Miles Inc., IN) and 10-μm frozen sections cut onto glass slides for spectrophotometric analysis. Esterified F2-IsoPs in LDL and kidney and free F2-IsoPs in urine were extracted and quantified by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometric assay as described, except [2H4]8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) was used as the internal standard (34Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Urinary excretion of F2-IsoPs was normalized to creatinine clearance to correct for the widely differing degrees of renal function, i.e. excretion rate/creatinine clearance. This is calculated as shown below and results expressed as pg/ml Cr.Cl. (pg of F2-IsoPs/ml of creatinine clearance):[urinary F2-IsoPs (pg/ml)] × [plasma creatinine (μm)]/[urine creatinine (μm)]. Examination, under a microscope of thin (10 μm) sections of rhabdomyolytic kidney showed, in contrast to normal kidney sections, a red/brown pigment to be located within the tubules. This pigment could easily be obtained from the mounted section by washing the 10-μm sections with 200 μl of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm DTPA. This extract was diluted to 1 ml with the same buffer. The spectrum of the extract from the kidney was compared with purified MetMb. Sodium dithionite (1 mm) was added to produce the deoxy form for comparison with purified deoxy-Mb. Optical spectroscopy was performed using a Varian Cary 5E UV-visible spectrophotometer. Rat kidney was cut into pieces of similar size and frozen in liquid nitrogen. One EPR sample, always made of one kidney, consisted of 20–30 such pieces (∼0.3 g). When placed directly into a Bruker finger Dewar (inner diameter = 4.5 mm) without using an EPR tube, such a sample occupied the volume of the Dewar, the length of which was always greater than the working zone of the cavity, 22 mm. This ensured that an EPR spectrum was always taken of the same volume (the cavity working zone) fully filled with the sample, the packing of this volume with tissue pieces being the only variable factor. This packing factor, however, was not a problem, since an EPR spectrum taken of the same sample after reloading into the Dewar (thus providing a different packing) differed by less than 5% in signal intensity. Furthermore EPR spectra of samples made from different parts of the same kidney differed by less than 10% in signal intensity. The tissue pieces were retained in the finger of the Dewar with a quartz rod to avoid movement of the pieces caused by liquid nitrogen boiling. Since sufficient kidney tissue was used to extend the sample beyond the working zone, the rod did not cause a problem with either frequency tuning or induce any background signals. All EPR measurements were performed at 77 K. The EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker EMX spectrometer with an ER 041XG microwave bridge (X-band). A 4103TM cavity was used. The experimental conditions comprised: microwave frequency, 9.2689 GHz; microwave power, 3.16 milliwatts; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 7 G; time constant, 0.041 s; sweep time, 84 s; receiver gain, 104; number of scans, 4; data points, 2048/scan. Where integration of the EPR signals was possible, the concentrations are quoted in μm by comparing the double integrals to that of known standards separately measured in an EPR tube (35Cammack R. Cooper C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 227: 353-384Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Due to uncertainties in comparing signal intensities from different types of EPR sample (tissue slice placed directly in the Dewar versusfrozen standard in EPR tube), we estimate that the systematic error of these absolute measurements (in terms of μm spins) could be as high as 50%, but the relative intensities of the signals in controls versus rhabdomyolytic kidneys are accurate to within 5%. When integration of the EPR signal was not straightforward due to overlapping signals, the signal intensity was normalized to the average intensity seen in the control rats. It is important to note that it is not the peak intensity, but pure line shape second integral, that is proportional to concentration. The low spin ferric signals are much wider than the rhombic signal at g = 4.3; therefore, at equal concentrations of the two centers, the peak intensity of the low spin signal will be smaller. In addition the EPR absorbance “efficiency” of the paramagnetic centers (EPR signal second integral/concentration) depends on the respective g factors. A solution of MetMb (10 μm) was prepared and the reaction initiated by addition of 40 μm13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(E),11(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE) (Cascade Biochem, Reading, United Kingdom). Consumption of 13-HPODE was followed by monitoring the loss of the conjugated diene chromophore at 234 nm, which occurs as 13-HPODE is converted to an epoxy peroxyl radical (Fig. 1). The single exponential progress curves were fitted by a regression analysis. The pH dependence of the decay of ferryl-Mb was determined by mixing 10 μm MetMb with 20 μm hydrogen peroxide to form ferryl-Mb, and the decay of ferryl-Mb was followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 408 nm due to reformation of MetMb. Urinary F2-IsoP excretion in animals and esterified F2-IsoPs in LDL were compared between groups using the nonparametric Mann Whitney U test and were considered significant when p < 0.05. Where mean values are reported, the S.E. is also indicated. For changes in creatinine clearance, the unpaired t test was used. We initially examined the capacity of Mb to induce the formation of F2-IsoPs using LDL as a model lipid containing system. MetMb (10 μm) caused marked lipid peroxidation of LDL resulting in a ∼50-fold increase over base line in esterified levels of F2-IsoPs (p < 0.01). This was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDL, indicative of significant oxidative modification of ApoB-100 (Table I). In a separate experiment ferryl-Mb (10 μm), MetMb (10 μm), or hydrogen peroxide (15 μm) were incubated with LDL for a period of 8 h to examine the relative efficacy of these redox forms of the heme protein in forming F2-IsoPs (17Hogg N. Rice-Evans C. Darley-Usmar V. Wilson M.T. Paganga G. Bourne L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both ferryl-Mb and MetMb increased esterified F2-IsoP levels in LDL (Table II). However, ferryl-Mb treatment resulted in the formation of approximately 3-fold higher concentrations of F2-isoprostanes than MetMb. Table II also shows that ferryl-Mb treatment resulted in a greater degree of ApoB-100 modification confirming pervious literature reports that ferryl-Mb is a more potent inducer of lipid peroxidation than MetMb (17Hogg N. Rice-Evans C. Darley-Usmar V. Wilson M.T. Paganga G. Bourne L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For comparison with Table I it should be noted that the greater amounts of F2-isoprostanes generated in the first experiment are due to a prolonged incubation period (24 h) compared with the data in Table II (8 h).Table IMb-induced formation of IsoPs in LDL and changes in relative electrophoretic mobility (REM)PreparationBase line F2-IsoPs24-h Mb3+F2-IsoPsn-Fold IncreaseREMng/mg LDL10.949.855.34.820.413.430.42.930.938.042.23.840.612.721.94.050.330.7102.33.8Mean ± S.E.0.6 ± 0.129 ± 750 ± 143.8 ± 0.3Base line REM is 1.0 by definition.

Reactions were stopped by addition of butylated hydroxytoluene (100 μm) and F2-isoprostanes and REM measured as described earlier. H2O2 alone did not result in either F2-isoprostane formation or an increase the REM, indicating that the enhanced oxidative damage observed when H2O2was added to MetMb is due formation of ferryl-Mb. For comparison with Table I it should be noted that the greater amounts of F2-isoprostanes generated in Table I are due to a prolonged incubation period (24 h) compared with the data in Table II (8 h).

Following induction of rhabdomyolysis in the rat, there was a profound reduction (mean 76.4%) in creatinine clearance in the rhabdo group compared with the control group (p < 0.02, Fig. 2). Alkalinization of the urine significantly attenuated the fall in creatinine clearance (p < 0.02, rhabdo versus rhabdo-alk, Fig. 2 A). The urinary excretion of F2-IsoPs was also markedly increased (mean 7.3-fold) in the rhabdo group compared with the control group (p < 0.01, Fig. 2 B). Of considerable interest was the finding that the enhanced urinary excretion of F2-IsoPs in the rhabdo group was markedly suppressed (mean 78%) by alkalinization (p < 0.01, rhabdo versus rhabdo-alk) to an extent that the difference between urinary levels of F2-IsoPs in the control and rhabdo-alk groups were not significant (p = 0.17, Fig. 3 B). Data for urinary F2-isoprostanes were corrected for creatinine clearance, since we have found that urinary excretion rate decreases in parallel to creatinine clearance. 2K. P. Moore, S. G. Holt, R.

By comparison, if corrected for urinary creatinine alone, the mean urinary excretion was 33 ± 6 pg/mg creatinine in the controls and 203 ± 42 and 26 ± 12 pg/mg creatinine in the rhabdo and rhabdo-alk groups, respectively (p < 0.02 for rhabdoversus other groups). Urinary excretion rates of F2-IsoPs were 19 ± 4, 19 ± 6, and 14 ± 2 ng/day in the control, rhabdo, and rhabdo-alk groups, respectively (no significant difference between groups). However, the data when presented as urinary excretion rate alone does not reflect the obvious increase in lipid peroxidation observed in the kidney. Thus, levels of F2-IsoPs esterified in renal lipids were also found to be strikingly elevated (mean 7.5-fold) in the rhabdo group compared with the control group (p < 0.01, Fig. 3) and was significantly attenuated by alkalinization (p < 0.05). These findings unequivocally established the occurrence of oxidant injury in the kidney in this animal model of rhabdomyolysis.Figure 3Levels of F2-IsoPs esterified in renal lipids of rats with rhabdomyolysis (Rhabdo), rhabdomyolysis and alkalinization (Rhabdo-Alk), and controls.

Two distinct CaMKI/IV kinases, CaMKKα and CaMKKβ, were purified from rat brain and partially sequenced (Edelman, A. M., Mitchelhill, K., Selbert, M. A., Anderson, K. A., Hook, S.

We report here the cloning and sequencing of cDNAs for human and rat CaMKKβ, tissue and regional brain localization of CaMKKβ protein, and mRNA and functional characterization of recombinant CaMKKβ in vitro and in Jurkat T cells. The sequences of human and rat CaMKKβ demonstrate 65% identity and 80% similarity with CaMKKα and 30–40% identity with CaMKI and CaMKIV themselves. CaMKKβ is broadly distributed among rat tissues with highest levels in CaMKIV-expressing tissues such as brain, thymus, spleen, and testis. In brain, CaMKKβ tracks more closely with CaMKIV than does CaMKKα. Bacterially expressed CaMKKβ undergoes intramolecular autophosphorylation, is regulated by Ca2+/CaM, and phosphorylates CaMKI and CaMKIV on Thr177 and Thr200, respectively. CaMKKβ activates both CaMKI and CaMKIV when coexpressed in Jurkat T cells as judged by phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent reporter gene expression. CaMKKβ activity is enhanced by elevation of intracellular Ca2+, although substantial activity is observed at the resting Ca2+ concentration. The strict Ca2+ requirement of CaMKIV-dependent phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein, is therefore controlled at the level of CaMKIV rather than CaMKK.

CaMKIV is expressed primarily in the nuclei of cells in thymus, testes, and subanatomical regions of brain, where it is thought to play a role in mediating Ca2+-regulated transcription (reviewed in Ref.15Means A.R.

Activation by CaMKIV occurs via direct phosphorylation of the activating serines of these transcription factors, Ser133 (CREB), Ser63 (ATF-1), and Ser103 (SRF), respectively (17Enslen H. Sun P.

CaMKIV has been suggested to be the physiologically relevant CREB kinase required for the delayed phase of long term potentiation activated in response to synaptic stimulation in hippocampal neurons (22Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Evidence that CaMKIV can function as the CREB kinase required for T cell activation has also been described (23Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Illario M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CaMKIV has been shown to induce transcription from a CREB/AP1-like binding element of the viral BZLF1 promoter in Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells, to promote transition from latency to the lytic phase (24Chatila T. Ho N. Liu P. Liu S. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Speck S.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6560-6567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CaMKIV has been suggested to stimulate transcription by mediating Ca2+-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in NG108 cells (25Enslen H. Tokumitsu H.

CaMKI is expressed throughout the brain and in most nonneuronal tissues (4Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). CaMKI is capable of stimulating transcription by phosphorylating the activating serines of CREB and ATF-1 in transient transfection systems (19Sun P. Lou L. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), although endogenous CaMKI has been detected only cytoplasmically where access to these nuclear transcription factors would not be expected. The expression pattern and relatively broad substrate specificity of CaMKI suggest that this enzyme is likely to have multiple cellular roles. By analogy to the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, in which transient phosphorylation and activation of one kinase by an upstream kinase kinase has been shown to be the physiological mechanism of signal transduction, it has been proposed that there are CaM kinase cascades in cells. Consistent with this, a rapid, transient phosphorylation and activation of endogenous CaMKIV in response to stimuli that elevate intracellular Ca2+ has been demonstrated in Jurkat cells (33Hanissian S.H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Park I.-K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of CaMKK was obtained from transient transfection studies in which overexpressed wild type CaMKIV, but not the CaMKIVT200Amutant, could be activated similarly to the endogenous enzyme (35Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). That CaMKKα can mediate the activation of CaMKIV in vivohas been demonstrated in COS and NG108 cells overexpressing this isoform (25Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J.S. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc.

Rapid CaMKK-catalyzed phosphorylation and activation of CaMKI in PC12 cells in response to increased intracellular Ca2+ induced by depolarization or ionomycin was reported (37Aletta J.M. Selbert M.A. Nairn A.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20930-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has not yet been determined whether signals other than Ca2+ participate in the CaM kinase cascade, although it was recently reported that cAMP is capable of down-regulating this pathway (38Wayman G.A. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16073-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The purification and partial amino acid sequencing of two distinct CaMKI/IV kinases (CaMKKα and CaMKKβ) from rat brain demonstrated that CaMKK comprised a family of activating kinases (39Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10806-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple CaMKKs with multiple substrates suggests a complexity of Ca2+/CaM-regulated signaling cascades. Determining the functional uniqueness of the different activating kinases represents an important question to be addressed, although as of yet, in vitro comparison of CaMKKα and CaMKKβ purified from brain has revealed no differences with respect to specific activity, substrate specificity, or regulation by Ca2+/CaM (39Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We report here the cloning of cDNAs for rat and human CaMKKβ and differential tissue and brain regional distributions of CaMKKα and CaMKKβ. We further characterize the ability of recombinant CaMKKβ to activate CaMKI and CaMKIV through phosphorylation of Thr177 and Thr200, respectively, as well as investigate the basis of control by Ca2+/CaM of this phosphorylation event, both in vitro and in Jurkat T cells. A human partial cDNA clone isolated by the IMAGE Consortium (expressed sequence tag accession number R56818), was previously shown to be homologous to the C-terminal portion of purified rat brain CaMKKβ (39Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10806-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding toR56818 bp 61–80 (5′-TGCTGGACAAGAACCCCGAG-3′) and 391–368 (5′-CGTTACCTTGAAGCTCAAAAC-3′) were used as primers to amplify by PCR a 330-bp product from first strand cDNA that had been synthesized from human brain total RNA. The PCR product was confirmed by sequencing to encode CaMKKβ and radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase by random priming (41Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled, amplified fragment was used as a probe to screen under low stringency conditions, a λZAPII directional rat hippocampus/cerebral cortex cDNA library constructed and provided by N. Nakanishi (Harvard Medical School). Out of 1 × 106 plaques, 15 positive clones were identified. A 1.2-kilobase pair clone, R15, was found to encode residue 302 to the end of the coding region and included 380 bp of 3′ noncoding sequence. A 1.0-kilobase pair clone, R9, encoded residues 144–485. The remaining 13 clones were redundant with R15 and R9. The missing 5′ sequence of recombinant CaMKKβ was obtained using the Life Technologies, Inc. system of rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, rat brain total RNA isolated by the Ultraspec (Biotecx) method was reverse transcribed with a gene-specific primer encoding recombinant CaMKKβ residues EIAILKKL (bp 724–704; 5′-GCTTCTTGAGGATGGCAATTT-3′). After RNA digestion with RNase H, tailing of the first strand cDNA 3′-end was carried out with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and dCTP. Polymerase chain reaction was then performed with poly(dC)-tailed first stand cDNA template, a nested primer corresponding to recombinant CaMKKβ residues SKKKLIR (bp 604–584; 5′-GGATCAAGCTTCTTTTTGGAC-3′) and an anchor primer (5′-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′). This yielded a 522-bp product coding for recombinant CaMKKβ residues 27–201. A second round of 5′ rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends was carried out following the procedure described above, except that the first stand synthesis primer corresponded to recombinant CaMKKb residues HVSITGF (bp 464–444; 5′-AAACCCGTGATGGAGACGTGG-3′), and the nested primer corresponded to residues MNGRCI (bp 362–345; 5′-ATGCAGCGTCCATTCATG-3′). This yielded a 454-bp product that encoded residues 1–121 and 92 bp of 5′ noncoding sequence. A human cortical brain cDNA library provided by A. Roses (Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) (42Alberts M.J. Ioannou P. Deucher R. Gilbert J. Lee J. Middleton L. Roses A.D. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1992; 3: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was also screened. A 2.2-kilobase pair clone, 9A, was found to encode residue 173 to the end of the coding region and 887 bp of 3′ noncoding sequence including a poly(A)-tail. The 0.7-kilobase clone, 6.3, encoded residues 1–185 and 113 bp of 5′ noncoding sequence. Chain termination sequencing was performed with the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA Sequencing kit from U.S. Biochemical Corp. and with the Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit from Amersham Life Science. Oligopeptides (custom synthesized by Research Genetics, Inc.) were based on regions that were non-conserved between CaMKKβ and CaMKKα, an N-terminal region of CaMKKβ (amino acid residues 28–49), and the C terminus of CaMKKα (residues 488–505). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides were injected into rabbits, and antisera were harvested by standard immunological techniques. Antibodies were affinity-purified as follows. Non-keyhole limpet hemocyanin versions of each of the respective immunizing peptides were coupled, using 1 mg of peptide/ml resin, to activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The resin was packed into a 1.5 × 1.6-cm column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl (column buffer). Antibodies were precipitated with 50% (NH4)2SO4 and then resuspended in and dialyzed against column buffer and chromatographed on the affinity column. The column was washed with column buffer and then with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl (to remove nonspecifically bound proteins). The antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, immediately neutralized with 1m Tris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. In the case of CaMKKβ, in addition to the affinity chromatography step, microtubule-Sepharose was employed as a negative chromatographic step to remove a small subpopulation of contaminating anti-tubulin antibodies. To evaluate the specificities of the respective CaMKKα and CaMKKβ antibodies, the following control experiment was performed. CaMKKα and CaMKKβ were purified from rat brain by the procedures described in detail by Edelman, et al. (39Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G.

The purified enzymes were subjected to immunoblotting as described below using both sets of affinity-purified antibodies. Both anti-CaMKKα and anti-CaMKKβ were found to be completely specific for their respective isoforms. 3K. A. Anderson, R. L. Means, Q.-H. Huang, Bruce E. Kemp, E. G. Goldstein, M. A. Selbert, A. M. Edelman, R. T. Fremeau, and A. R. Means, unpublished observations. Freshly dissected rat tissues were frozen on dry ice and homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P40 (Nonidet P-40), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter aprotinin, and 10 mg/liter leupeptin. Homogenates were centrifuged at 49,000 rpm (100,000 × g) for 30 min in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. The supernatants (100 μg of protein/lane) were electrophoresed on a 7.5% acrylamide SDS gel and electrophoretically transferred at 100 V for 1.5 h to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBS, rinsed with deionized water, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS containing primary antibodies, either anti-CaMKKβ at a dilution of 1:40 or anti-CaMKKα at a dilution of 1:4000. The membrane was rinsed three times with PBS, incubated in PBS for 5 min, and then rinsed an additional two or three times with PBS. It was then incubated for 90 min at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS containing 0.6 μCi/ml 125I-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. Following washing 3 × 20 min with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS, the membrane was air-dried and exposed to x-ray film. Brains were removed from decapitated 30-day old rats and placed slowly in −35 °C isopentane, immersed for 2 min, and stored at −80 °C. Sections (12–16 μm) were cut in a −20 °C cryostat, thaw-mounted onto slides, and stored at −80 °C until use, at which point the slides were transferred directly into ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and fixed for 10 min at room temperature. After a 10-min wash in 2× SSC, sections were cross-linked for 5 min with a UV light placed 30 cm from the tissue. The procedure was then followed as described previously in detail (43Fremeau R.T. Popko B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) except that prehybridization buffer contained 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/ml total RNA, 0.05 mg/ml tRNA, 5% Denhardt’s solution, and 50% formamide, and hybridization buffer contained 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.05 mg/ml total RNA, 0.05 mg/ml tRNA, 5% Denhardt’s solution, 20% dextran sulfate (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), 50% formamide, and [35S]UTP-labeled riboprobe (5000 cpm/μl). cDNAs were subcloned into the polylinkers of pCR2 (CaMKKα and CaMKKβ) or pGEM (CaMKIV) vectors. Run-off [35S]UTP-labeled sense and antisense transcripts corresponding to bp 210–1515 of CaMKKα, bp 81–603 of CaMKKβ, and bp 1–820 of CaMKIV were generated using SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by washing the EtOH precipitated RNA pellets with 70% EtOH. The overlapping recombinant CaMKKβ clones were incorporated into one full-length coding sequence in the plasmid pBK by digestion and religation of unique restriction sites within the overlap regions (EcoRI at bp 1413, XhoI at bp 635, and DraIII at bp 162). The entire coding region was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer (5′-GAAGTTTCTAGACACACCATG-3′) that created an XbaI restriction site 11 bases upstream of the ATG initiation codon and a reverse primer (5′-CCCTTTAGTGAGGGTTAATT-3′) complementary to the T3 promoter present in the multiple cloning site of pBK. A 172-bp XbaI/DraIII fragment from the polymerase chain reaction product containing the ATG initiation codon was substituted for the corresponding region of the original clone. DNA sequencing indicated that no mutations had been generated by the procedure. An XbaI fragment containing the full-length coding sequence without the amino-terminal untranslated sequence was then subcloned into the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein,Escherichia coli expression plasmid, pMAL (New England Biolabs). Following induction of MBP-CaMKKβ protein expression in E. coli by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the fusion protein was isolated by passing the cell extract over an amylose-Sepharose column and was eluted from the column with maltose. Recombinant CaMKIV, CaMKIVT200A, CaMKIV1–317, CaMKIV1–317 T200A, CaMKI, and CaMKIT177A were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, which were purified on glutathione-Sepharose columns and eluted with glutathione as described previously (4Haribabu B.

CaMKKβ activity was determined by measuring its ability to activate CaMKI or CaMKIV. CaMKI or CaMKIV was preincubated in the presence or absence of CaMKKβ at 30 °C for varying lengths of time in 50 μl of preincubation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 8 mm MgCl2, 400 μm ATP, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm CaM. The CaM kinase synthetic peptide substrate GS-10 (100 μm) and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP were then added, and the reaction was allowed to continue for an additional 4–6 min at 30 °C. For reactions performed in the absence of CaM, the CaCl2 and CaM were omitted, and 1 mm EGTA was included. Phosphate incorporation into GS-10 peptide was quantitated by its binding to P81 phosphocellulose paper as described previously (35Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CaMKI or CaMKIV by CaMKKβ was assessed following incubation with CaMKKβ in phosphorylation buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 8 mm MgCl2, 400 μm ATP, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm CaM, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, resulting in final concentrations of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Samples were heated 5 min at 95 °C and electrophoresed through SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and exposed to x-ray film. CaMKKβ was incubated in 50 μl of autophosphorylation buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm CaM at 30 °C for the indicated length of time. For reactions carried out in the absence of CaM, the CaCl2 and CaM were omitted, and 1 mm EGTA was included. The reaction (20 μl) was spotted onto p81 filters, which were washed 3 times in 20% trichloroacetic acid and dried. Phosphate incorporation into CaMKKβ was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. CaMKKβ (0.5 μg) was electrophoresed through an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to an Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.) transfer membrane for 2 h at 75 V in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m glycine, pH 8.2, 0.37% SDS, and 20% methanol. The membrane was rocked in 0.1m imidazole, pH 7.0, for 10 min followed by 40 min in CaM overlay buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.2m KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, at which point 125I-labeled recombinant chicken CaM was added at a concentration of 0.2 nm and specific activity of 1 ×"

The effects of androgens are mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), which is a ligand-modulated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. In addition to its ability to activate transcription from androgen response elements, AR can inhibit activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity, composed of Jun and Fos oncoproteins, in a ligand-dependent manner. Conversely, when activated, AP-1 can block AR activity. We found that CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) binding protein (CBP) had a direct role in both of these activities of AR. CBP significantly increased the ability of endogenous AR in LNCaP cells to activate transcription from an AR-dependent reporter construct. On the other hand, repression of AR activity by treatment of LNCaP cells with an activator of AP-1 was largely relieved when CBP was ectopically expressed. AR and CBP can physically interact in vitro as was shown in glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. Whereas both the N terminus and ligand-binding domain of AR can interact with CBP, a short region in the N terminus of CBP is required for these interactions. As opposed to the interaction of CBP with other nuclear receptors studied so far, CBP-AR interactions were not affected by ligand binding to AR in vitro. These data suggest that CBP is a coactivator for AR in vivo and that the transcriptional interference between AR and AP-1 is the result of competition for limiting amounts of CBP in the cell.

Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that possess highly conserved DNA-binding domains and moderately conserved ligand-binding domains (LBDs), whereas they are quite divergent in the N-terminal domain (NTD) (for reviews, see Refs. 3Mangelsdorf D.J.

Transactivation function of nuclear receptors is primarily mediated by sequences in both the NTD and a short region in the LBD, referred to as the activator function-1 (AF-1) and AF-2 domains, respectively. Recent studies suggest that an interaction between the NTD and the LBD may play a role in the transcriptional activities of some nuclear receptors, including AR (5Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J.

These could be mediated through heterodimeric interactions within the nuclear receptor family, such as those between retinoid X receptors and thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, and vitamin D receptors in which the heterodimer has an increased ability to activate transcription (for a review, see Ref. 8Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activator protein-1 (AP-1) complexes, composed of either Jun homodimers or Jun-Fos heterodimers (for a review, see Ref. 9Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar), interfere with ligand-dependent transactivation by some nuclear receptors including AR (for a review, see Ref. 10Saatcioglu F.

Most of these cofactors are expressed in a wide variety of cell types and can interact with more than one type of nuclear receptor. Furthermore, it appears that multiple cofactors may regulate nuclear receptor function at any one time. Therefore, the exact contribution of these cofactors to the activities of different receptors in vivo is still not well understood. In this study we considered the possibility that one of the putative coactivators for nuclear receptors, CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) binding protein (CBP), originally identified as a coactivator for genes that are responsive to cyclic AMP and mitogens (27Arias J.

We found that CBP can increase the transcriptional activity of endogenous AR in LNCaP cells. This is most likely because of a direct physical association of CBP, through its N terminus, with both the AR NTD and LBD, based on in vitrobinding assays. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the transcriptional interference between AR and AP-1 may be mediated through competition for limiting amounts of CBP in the cell. LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The polyethylenimine method (29Boussif O. Lezoualc’h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl solution containing 0.28 μl of 0.1 mpolyethyleneimine (Aldrich) per μg of DNA was mixed with 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl solution, which contained the DNA to be transfected. Transfections were carried out in six-well plates with 3.0 × 105 cells, 0.67 μg of reporter plasmid, and indicated amounts of CBP expression vector, or an empty expression vector and PUC18 to a total of 2 μg of DNA. One hour before transfection, the medium was changed to RPMI 1640 without fetal bovine serum. Four hours after transfection, medium was removed and cells were fed with RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. R1881 (10−7 m, NEN Life Science Products) and/or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 10−7 m, Sigma) were added, and after 18 h, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in Tris-MES solution (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.8), and luciferase activities were determined.

For the generation of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs of the AR N terminus and the ligand-binding domain (C terminus), the fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: AR-N5, 5′-TAATAAAGATCTGGATGGAAGTGCAGTTAGG-3′; AR-N3, 5′-AGTCGTCCAGAAGACCCCACC-3′; AR-C5, 5′-TAATAAAGATCTCCCGGAACTGAAGAAACTTGG-3′; and AR-C3, 5′-AATAATGGATCCTCACTGGGTGTGGAAATAGATGGGCTTGAC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were cleaved with BglII and BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site in pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate GST-AR-N and GST-AR-C. To generate the C-terminal deletion mutants of AR, pSG5-AR was digested with BamHI and one of the restriction enzymes,PmlI, HindIII, KpnI, orSacI. After filling in with Klenow polymerase, the plasmids were religated to generate AR-(1–714), AR-(1–566), AR-(1–503), and AR-(1–333), respectively. To generate pGEX-CBP-(1–452), the N-terminalBamHI-EcoRI fragment of RSV-CBP (28Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H.

To generate pGEX-CBP-(1–271) and pGEX-CBP-(1–117), pGEX-CBP-(1–452) was digested with SalI and either KpnI orNcoI, respectively, filled in with Klenow polymerase, and religated. In vitro interactions between AR and CBP were examined by the GST pulldown assay as described previously (31Saatcioglu F. Lopez G. West B.L. Zandi E. Lu H. Esmaili A. Apriletti J. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4687-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST, GST-CBP, and GST-AR fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified proteins were incubated in the absence or presence of 10−6 m R1881 for 30 min on ice before they were added into binding reactions. CBP and AR and its deletions mutants were in vitro translated using the TNT-coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and were incubated at 4 °C with hormone-treated GST-AR-N and GST-AR-C in NETN buffer (0.01% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 40 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors. After 1–2 h, the beads were washed three times with NETN buffer, resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and size-fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After fluorography, gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To test the possible role of CBP in AR-dependent transactivation, we performed transient transfection experiments in LNCaP cells.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) was transfected into LNCaP cells in the presence of either an empty expression vector or an expression vector encoding CBP (28Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with the synthetic androgen R1881. After 18 h, cells were harvested and luciferase activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, in the absence of R1881 there was no significant level of −286PB-LUC activation when the empty expression vector was cotransfected with the reporter. In the presence of R1881, −286PB-LUC expression was increased by about 15-fold. When an expression vector encoding CBP was cotransfected, the basal levels in the absence of R1881 did not change, but the −286PB-LUC expression in the presence of R1881 was increased approximately 4–5-fold more than observed in the presence of the empty expression vector. Similar results were obtained when AR and CBP were expressed in CV-1 cells, which do not have endogenous AR (data not shown). To assess the validity of these findings using another androgen-dependent reporter, we performed a similar experiment with 2XARE-LUC in which two copies of an androgen response element (ARE) drove expression of the luciferase gene in front of the thymidine kinase promoter (11Palvimo J.J.

LNCaP cells were transfected with 2XARE-LUC in the presence of either an empty expression vector or an expression vector encoding CBP. After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with the synthetic androgen R1881 and after 18 h, cells were harvested and luciferase activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 1 B, in the absence of R1881 there was no significant level of 2XARE-LUC activation when the empty expression vector was cotransfected with the reporter. In the presence of R1881, 2XARE-LUC expression was increased by approximately 3-fold. When an expression vector encoding CBP was cotransfected, the basal levels of 2XARE-LUC expression in the absence of R1881 increased by about 2-fold. In the presence of R1881, reporter expression increased approximately 3-fold further compared with that observed in the presence of the empty expression vector. These data show that the CBP effect observed on −286PB-LUC activity (Fig. 1 A) is not specific for this reporter and suggest that CBP can function as a coactivator for AR in vivo. Previous work has documented an inhibition of AR-mediated activation of transcription by the tumor promoter TPA, most likely through the activation of AP-1 (32Sato N. Sadar M. Bruchovsky N. Saatcioglu F. Rennie P. Sato S. Lange P.H. Gleave M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17485-17494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). CBP was also shown to serve as a coactivator for c-Jun (27Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), a component of the AP-1 complex, and it has been suggested as having a role in the cross-talk between AP-1 and some nuclear receptors (19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss P. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of CBP expression on TPA-induced inhibition of AR activity. To that end, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with the −286PB-LUC reporter construct. After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with R1881 and/or TPA. After 18 h, cells were harvested and luciferase (LUC) activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 A, R1881 treatment increased −286PB-LUC expression by approximately 15-fold, and TPA treatment alone did not significantly affect expression. However, when cells were simultaneously treated with R1881 and TPA, most of the activation by R1881 alone was lost. However, when the same experiment was repeated in the presence of an expression vector encoding CBP, TPA-induced block of R1881-mediated activation of −286PBLUC was restored to levels induced by R1881 alone. These data suggest that CBP is present in limiting amounts in LNCaP cells and that the ability of TPA to inhibit AR activity results from the engagement of CBP by other transcription factors induced by TPA, such as AP-1. To substantiate these findings, the same experiment was repeated with the 2XARE-LUC reporter. LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with the 2XARE-LUC construct. After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with R1881 and/or TPA. After 18 h, cells were harvested and LUC activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, R1881 treatment increased 2XARE-LUC expression by approximately 10-fold. However, when cells were simultaneously treated with R1881 and TPA, about 90% of the activation by R1881 alone was lost. When the same experiment was repeated in the presence of an expression vector encoding CBP, block of R1881-mediated activation induced by TPA on the activity of 2XARE-LUC was restored to approximately 90% of that induced by R1881 alone. These data are consistent with the data described above obtained with −286PB-LUC and suggest that competition for CBP is the mechanism for the inhibition of AR activity by TPA. It was previously shown that CBP can interact with a number of transcription factors including CREB, AP-1, and some nuclear receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar and 34Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To assess the possibility that CBP may physically interact with AR, we used the GST pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 3 A, various fragments of CBP were fused to GST and were expressed in E. coli. These proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads and then used as affinity matrixes for possible interactions with in vitrotranslated, 35S-labeled AR. As shown in Fig. 3 B, whereas no significant binding was observed with GST alone, AR was efficiently retained by GST-CBP-(1–452), corresponding to the N-terminal 452 amino acids of CBP fused to GST. Interestingly, this interaction was equally strong both in the absence and presence of R1881. C-terminal deletion derivatives GST-CBP-(1–271) and GST-CBP-(1–117), or GST-CBP-(720–1678), which spans the middle third of CBP, did not display any significant binding to AR that was different from GST alone. These results suggest that the region between residues 271 and 452 of CBP is required for interaction with AR and that this interaction is not dependent on ligand binding in vitro. To more conclusively assess the interactions between AR and CBP, we performed the GST pulldown experiment in “reverse,” where the AR sequences were fused to GST and used as the affinity matrix. The N-terminal and ligand-binding domains of AR were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins (GST-AR-N and GST-AR-C). These proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads and then used as affinity matrixes for possible interactions with in vitrotranslated, 35S-labeled CBP. The in vitrotranslation of CBP resulted in multiple bands in addition to the expected full-size protein, presumably because of premature termination reactions giving rise to C-terminal truncations, because of the large size of CBP. Western blot analysis of cell extracts expressing CBP with an N-terminal-specific antiserum supports this conclusion. 2K. Frønsdal and N. Engedal, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 3 C, whereas no significant binding was observed with GST alone, most of the CBP-specific bands were retained on both GST-AR-N and GST-AR-C. These interactions were not dependent on R1881 because preincubation of the GST fusion proteins with R1881 did not significantly alter CBP binding. These data suggest that CBP can physically associate with AR through both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains in vitro. To determine which region(s) in AR is sufficient for binding to CBP, we generated C-terminal deletion mutants of AR (Fig. 4 A). These mutants were first tested in a transient transfection assay to assess their transactivation properties from an ARE. To that end, −286PB-LUC was cotransfected into PC-3 cells either with wild-type AR or its C-terminal deletion derivatives. Cells were either left untreated or treated with R1881. After 18 h, cells were harvested and LUC activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 4 B, wild-type AR efficiently activated −286-PB-LUC expression 10-fold in the presence of R1881. The AR-(1–714) deletion mutant increased the basal level of expression of −286PB-LUC by 5-fold even in the absence of R1881, and addition of ligand did not significantly change this activation. On the other hand, the deletion mutants AR-(1–566), AR-(1–503), and AR-(1–333) did not significantly alter expression of the reporter, as expected, because they lack a functional DNA-binding domain. These deletion mutants of AR were then used in the GST pulldown assay with GST-CBP-(1–452) as shown in Fig. 3 B. As shown in Fig. 4 C, when most of the ligand-binding domain or the DNA-binding domain was deleted, AR still interacted efficiently with GST-CBP-(1–452). However, when we used AR-(1–503), in which the C-terminal end of the N-terminal domain of AR is deleted, interaction was substantially decreased, and a further deletion toward the N terminus (in AR-(1–333)) resulted in the loss of almost all CBP-AR interactions. These data suggest that the N-terminal domain of AR is sufficient to interact with CBP in vitro, consistent with the data presented in Fig. 3 C. In light of the ability of CBP to functionally interact with some members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, we assessed its role in AR function. Similar to findings with glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, and retinoid X receptors (for a review, see Ref. 26Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), we found that the transcriptional activity of the endogenous AR in LNCaP cells is significantly increased when CBP is overexpressed. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which CBP or another putative coactivator for nuclear receptors has been shown to affect the activity of an endogenous nuclear receptor rather than receptors that are ectopically expressed. The effect of CBP on AR function is probably the result of direct physical interactions between the two proteins as suggested by the data obtained in GST pulldown assays. Using either GST-CBP or the GST-AR as the affinity matrix, we observed specific interactions between AR and CBP (Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast to previous work on the interactions of other nuclear receptors with CBP in which primarily the LBD has been implicated (for reviews, see Refs. 33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar and 34Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), we have found that CBP can bind to both the NTD and LBD of AR. In light of the observed intramolecular interactions between the N and C termini of some nuclear receptors (5Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J. O’Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1052-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to study the possible role of CBP in these interactions for AR. Interestingly, in contrast to the ligand-induced increase in the association of CBP or various other putative coactivators with other nuclear receptors, hormone binding did not affect CBP-AR interactionsin vitro (Figs. 4 and 5). We did not observe any ligand-mediated effects under different binding conditions tested (data not shown). The ligand-independent interaction between AR and CBP is unexpected because the transcriptional activity of AR is increased only in the presence of R1881 when CBP is ectopically expressed (Fig. 1). There are several possibilities that can account for these data. First, it is possible that the conditions we have used for binding assays do not mimic the in vivo conditions that may be required for hormone-mediated effects. For example, there may be a third protein involved that is yet to be identified, which is responsible for ligand-dependent interactions between AR and CBP. Second, hormone binding to AR may cause a conformational change in AR, which can in turn influence the conformation of CBP, not detectable in the GST pulldown assay, such that it can now act as a coactivator. Further work will be needed to assess this possibility. Third, even though CBP may be bound to AR in the absence of hormone, hormone binding may be required for the recruitment of another cofactor(s), yet to be identified, that is necessary for optimal transcriptional activation by AR. In this regard, it is important to note that other putative cofactors for nuclear receptors (e.g. Refs. 19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss P. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W.

A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) have been shown to interact both with CBP and a number of nuclear receptors. It has therefore been suggested that a trimeric complex composed of the receptor, CBP, and another coactivator may be at work when the receptor is in a liganded and activated conformation (for reviews, see Refs. 33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar and 34Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Further work is needed to assess whether the presence of such a complex also applies to AR. The deletion analysis of GST-CBP-(1–452) in the GST pulldown assay (Fig. 4) indicates that the region of CBP that is required for interaction with AR lies between residues 271 and 452. This is different from findings on the interaction of other nuclear receptors with CBP that have been studied to date, which have been reported to only require the extreme N-terminal 101 residues (19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss P. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 36Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). These data therefore suggest that the interaction domain of AR on CBP is different from the other nuclear receptors studied to date. Alternatively, the apparent differences may result from the different experimental approaches employed: the yeast two-hybrid system in the earlier studies versus the GST pulldown assay in our current work. Further investigation is required to clarify the basis for these differences. Conversely, deletion analysis of AR suggests that its N terminus is sufficient for binding to CBP. Similar to other steroid receptors, AR has a large NTD in which a hormone-independent activation function, AF-1, resides (37Chamberlain N.L. Whitacre D.C. Miesfeld R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26772-26778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). If AF-1 is deleted, AR loses the ability to transactivate (5Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 37Chamberlain N.L. Whitacre D.C. Miesfeld R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26772-26778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, at least for the N-terminal CBP interaction domain, the sequences important for transactivation overlap with those required for interactions with CBP in vitro. It will be interesting to determine whether the activity of AF-1 is mediated through CBP. Further work is needed to clarify the role of CBP on AF-1 activity of AR and whether CBP plays an integrative role between the NTD and LBD of AR. An important way to regulate AR function is through its interactions with other transcription factors. In this regard, the interaction with AP-1 has been studied most extensively. AP-1 is an oncoprotein complex composed of Jun and Fos proteins, and its activity is increased by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including phorbol esters, UV irradiation, cytokines, etc. (9Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). Based on a large amount of data from many different laboratories and involving different nuclear receptors, it has been suggested that the cross-talk between nuclear receptors and AP-1 may be because of competition for limiting amounts of cofactors in the cell (for a review, see Ref. 10Saatcioglu F. Claret F.X. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 347-359PubMed Google Scholar). A later study provided evidence for this hypothesis, showing that overexpression of CBP and the related protein p300 overcomes the transcriptional interference with AP-1 by liganded retinoic acid and glucocorticoid receptors (19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss P. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). However, a recent study on AP-1 and AR cross-talk suggested that the mutual transcriptional inhibition was because of direct protein-protein interactions between AR and AP-1 (32Sato N. Sadar M. Bruchovsky N. Saatcioglu F. Rennie P. Sato S. Lange P.H. Gleave M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17485-17494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data provide evidence that CBP plays a direct role in this cross-talk and that direct physical contacts between AR and AP-1 may not be necessary (Fig. 2). We have also found that the reverse is true: R1881 treatment of LNCaP cells blocks TPA-induced expression of an AP-1-dependent reporter. 3K. Frønsdal, unpublished results. Therefore, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that transcriptional interference between AP-1 and AR is because of competition for a limited amount of CBP in the cell (see Fig. 5 for the proposed mechanism). It is possible, on the other hand, that a ternary complex composed of components of AP-1, AR, and CBP may exist in the cell because Jun and Fos associate with different regions of CBP than AR and other nuclear receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar and 34Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Further work is needed to determine whether indeed such complexes are found in the living cell. CBP was originally identified as a CREB binding protein (27Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X.

Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar) and subsequently shown to bind a large number of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (for reviews, see Refs. 33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar and 34Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). CBP has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and can associate with other proteins that also have histone acetyltransferase activities (for reviews, see Refs. 33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar and 34Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). It is thought that acetylation of histones brings about an “open” conformation of chromatin that is more conducive to the interaction of the transcriptional initiation complex with DNA and therefore results in activation of transcription. However, further work is needed to determine the in vivosignificance of the histone acetyltransferase activity that is associated with CBP for nuclear receptor function and whether it is required for modulation of AR transactivation potential. CBP may have a role in tumorigenesis because a large number of proto-oncogene products can interact with CBP (33Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Moreover, patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, who lack one copy of the CBP gene, have a higher incidence of tumors compared with normal people, and rearrangements have been observed in the CBP gene in leukemias (38Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H.

Given the important role of androgens and AR in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer and the role of CBP in modulating AR function, which is documented in this study, it will be important to determine whether there are changes in the CBP structure, expression, and/or activity profiles at different stages of prostate carcinogenesis. We thank Drs. Richard Eckner, Richard H. Goodman, Steve Harris, and Jorma Palvimo for generous gifts of plasmids. Aarnisalo et al. also found recently that CBP modulates AR action (Aarnisalo, P., Palvimo, J. J., and Janne, O. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 2122–2127)."

In the present work, to address this question, a newly developed approach for measuring the rate of COX activity, either as an isolated step or as a respiratory chain-integrated step, has been applied to a variety of human cell types, including several tumor-derived semidifferentiated cell lines, as well as specialized cells removed from the organism. KCN titration assays, carried out on intact uncoupled cells, have clearly shown that the COX capacity is in low excess (16–40%) with respect to that required to support the endogenous respiration rate. Furthermore, measurements of O2 consumption rate supported by 0.4 mmtetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine in antimycin-inhibited uncoupled intact cells have given results that are fully consistent with those obtained in the KCN titration experiments. Similarly, KCN titration assays on digitonin-permeabilized cells have revealed a COX capacity that is nearly limiting (7–22% excess) for ADP + glutamate/malate-dependent respiration. The present observations, therefore, substantiate the conclusion that the in vivo control of respiration by COX is much tighter than has been generally assumed on the basis of experiments carried out on isolated mitochondria.

Most of the experimental work aimed at answering these questions has been carried out by inhibitor titration experiments on isolated mitochondria and has led to the conclusion that the activity of the various components of the respiratory chain is in excess, sometimes a large excess (2–4-fold), with evidence for a tissue-specific pattern, over the rate required to support the endogenous respiration rate (6Letellier T.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2564-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the issue has been recently raised as to how accurately a metabolic control analysis applied to isolated mitochondria can reflect the in vivo situation, considering the possible loss of essential metabolites during organelle isolation and the disruption of the normal interactions of mitochondria with the cytoskeleton, which may be important for the channeling of respiratory substrates to the organelles (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The use of a novel approach for the analysis of overall electron flux to oxygen and of the control of respiration by cytochrome c oxidase (COX)1 in intact cells has indeed revealed that the two related wild-type cell lines tested exhibited only a slightly higher COX capacity than required to support the endogenous respiration rate (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cells analyzed in these studies were from apparently undifferentiated established cell lines, and the tests were done after uncoupling of respiration with dinitrophenol (DNP). It therefore seemed important to apply the same type of analysis to differentiated or semidifferentiated cell types, and also to apply this analysis under more physiological conditions (state 3). This analysis has now been carried out and, as reported in the present paper, fully supports the conclusion that there is a low reserve of cytochrome c oxidase activity in vivoin the respiratory chain of a variety of human cell types. The osteosarcoma-derived cell line 143B.TK− (13King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine. The SKO-007 (J3) human myeloma cell line (ATCC CRL-8033–2) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 15% FBS, and 20 μg/ml 6-thioguanine. The A-549 human lung carcinoma cell line (ATCC CCL-185) was grown in DMEM with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% FBS. The HepG2 human hepatoma cell line (ATCC HB-8065) was grown in DMEM + 10% FBS. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (thrice-cloned subline of SK-N-SH (ATCC HTB11) was grown in DMEM + 15% FBS. The fibroblast strain GM056059C from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (NIGMS, National Institutes of Health), derived from a 14 month-old human male individual, was grown in DMEM with 20% FBS. Myoblast cultures derived from a normal human individual were grown in DMEM with 15% FBS. Platelets were isolated from 17 ml of blood of a rabbit by differential centrifugation and resuspended in 1.5 ml of TD (see below). Cells were collected, washed once in Tris-based, Mg2+-, Ca2+-deficient (TD) buffer (0.137 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C), resuspended in the same buffer previously air-equilibrated at 37 °C, and transferred into a 1.5-ml water-jacketed Gilson chamber containing a small magnetic bar that was connected to a circulating water bath at 37 °C and a YS model 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instruments). After recording the endogenous respiration rate, the chamber was opened; one sample was removed for cell counting, and, in some experiments, four 20-μl samples were taken for total protein determination by the Bradford procedure (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). For DNP titration, after recording the coupled endogenous respiration rate, DNP was added at different concentrations, and the uncoupled respiratory rate was measured and expressed as percentage of the starting coupled endogenous respiration rate. The KCN titration measurements and the determination of the maximum COX capacity relative to the uninhibited endogenous respiration rate (COXR(max)) from the threshold plots (i.e. the plots of relative endogenous respiration rate against percentage of inhibition of isolated COX activity at the same KCN concentrations) (7Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) in DNP-uncoupled intact cells were made as described previously (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similarly, the measurements of the dependence on concentration of TMPD (0–2 mm), in the presence of a constant concentration of ascorbate (10 mm), of the initial O2 oxygen consumption rate associated with isolated COX activity in DNP- and antimycin A-treated intact cells were carried out as detailed in the above reference. Cells were collected; washed once in permeabilization buffer containing 75 mm sucrose, 20 mm glucose, 5 mm KPi, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm Tris (pH 7.4); resuspended at 3–4 × 106 cells/ml in 1.5 ml of the same medium air-equilibrated at 37 °C; and supplemented with 5 units of hexokinase (type VI from bakers yeast (Sigma)) (in order to promote synthesis of glucose 6-phosphate and thus prevent accumulation of ATP) and 0.5 mm ADP, and transferred into the Gilson chamber. After recording the endogenous respiration rate, 100 nm rotenone was added to block the endogenous O2 consumption, digitonin was added in different amounts from a 10% solution in dimethyl sulfoxide, and after 2 min, 5 mm succinate was added to measure the ADP-stimulated (state 3) rate of respiration of the permeabilized cells. The optimal amount of digitonin was chosen as the one giving the highest succinate-dependent respiration rate. This rate did not increase upon addition of exogenous cytochromec, thus showing that the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane was preserved. Samples of 143B cells, hepatoma cells and fibroblasts were collected by trypsinization and centrifugation and resuspended at about 3–4 × 106 cells/ml in permeabilization buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and digitonin was added at the optimal concentration (15 μg/106 cells for 143B cells, 10–15 μg/106cells for fibroblasts (15Kunz D. Luley C. Fritz S. Bohnensack R. Winkler K. Kunz W.S. Wallesch C.-W. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and 10 μg/106 cells for hepatoma cells). After 1–2 min, digitonin was diluted by adding 5 volumes of the same buffer containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. The cell suspension was then centrifuged, and the cellular pellet was resuspended at 4–6 × 106 cells/ml in the same buffer air-equilibrated at 37 °C and supplemented with hexokinase (5 units) and 0.5 mm ADP. In the case of 143B cells and fibroblasts, the inhibitor of adenylate kinase p1,p5-di(adenosine-5′)pentaphosphate (Ap5A, Sigma) was added, at 0.15–0.3 mm, to prevent dissipation of ADP. This addition was shown, however, not to be necessary for the KCN titration measurements. Finally, two 1.5-ml portions of each cell suspension were transferred into 1.5-ml Gilson chambers attached to the same circulating water bath and the same oxygen monitor. The respiration measurements were then started by addition of 5 mm glutamate and 5 mm malate for KCN titration of the integrated COX activity, or of 20 mmantimycin A and either 10 mm ascorbate and 0.2 mm TMPD (143B cells) or 10 mm ascorbate plus 0.4 mm TMPD (hepatoma cells and fibroblasts), for KCN titration of the isolated COX activity. In the case of the myeloma cell line, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended at 6–8 × 106 cells/ml and two 1.5-ml portions of the suspension were transferred into the Gilson chambers as described above. Digitonin was then added in the chambers at 5 μg/106 cells and, after 3–5 min, O2 consumption measurements were started by addition of 5 mm glutamate and 5 mm malate for KCN titration of the integrated COX activity or of 20 mm antimycin A and 10 mm ascorbate and 0.4 mm TMPD for KCN titration of the isolated COX activity. The cells or cell derivatives chosen for analysis in the present work include several tumor-derived human cell lines, the majority of which retain some or many of the differentiated properties of the original tissue cell, such as the hepatoma HepG2 cell line (16Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), the lung carcinoma A-549 cell line (17Lieber M. Smith B. Szakal A. Nelson-Rees W. Todaro G. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), the neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line (18Biedler J.L. Helson L. Spengler B.A. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2643-2652PubMed Google Scholar), and the SKO-007 (J3) myeloma cell line (19Olsson L. Kaplan H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5429-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differentiated cells removed from normal individuals (myoblasts and fibroblasts) and platelets from a rabbit were also analyzed. Therefore, the cell types investigated covered a wide range of specialized cells, and were expected to allow reasonably general conclusions about the in vivo control of respiration by COX. Previous work had shown that the osteosarcoma-derived 143B.TK− cell line (13King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) respires in a Tris-NaCl-KCl-NaHPO4 buffer (TD buffer) at the same rate as in DMEM lacking glucose (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Table Ishows the endogenous respiration rate in TD of the various cell types investigated in the present work as a function of the cell density reached by the cultures at the time of analysis. It appears that, in all cell lines analyzed, the O2 consumption rate per cell tended to decrease with increasing cell density. That this decrease was due to a great extent to a decrease in size of the cells, presumably associated with an arrest of cell growth in G1 phase, is shown by the observation that the O2 consumption rate, normalized per mg of protein, remained constant at different densities in all cell lines, except for a slight decrease in hepatoma cells. The endogenous respiration rates per mg of protein determined in the different cell types investigated varied over a wide range, from ∼3.8 nmol of O2/min in fibroblasts to ∼15.5 nmol of O2/min in hepatoma cells.Table IEffect of cell concentration in culture on endogenous respiration rate per cellCell concentration in culture1-aMeasured at time of collection.

In the present work, to exclude any effect of proton cycling and oxidative phosphorylation on the respiratory flux, the measurements were made in the presence of DNP. A titration was made of the DNP concentration that produced the highest stimulation of respiration. As exemplified in Fig. 1 for the myeloma and hepatoma cells, striking differences were observed in the titration curves obtained for the various cell types. The values obtained in different cell types for the endogenous respiration rate and for the ratio of uncoupled respiration rate, measured with the optimum DNP concentration, to coupled respiration rate (uncoupled respiration ratio) are shown in Table II. One can see that there is a large variation in uncoupled respiration ratio, ranging between 1.17 for neuroblastoma cells and 1.90 for myeloma cells. It is interesting that two normal cell types, fibroblasts and myoblasts, exhibited uncoupled respiration ratio values falling within the range observed for the various tumor-derived cell lines.Table IIUncoupled to coupled respiration ratio (UCR), relative uncoupled respiration rate at 400 μm TMPD (AT 400/DNP end.resp.), relative COX capacity (COXRmax), and COX threshold (COXT) in intact uncoupled cells (DNP) or in digitonin-permeabilized cells in state 3UCR2-aData derived from two or three independent experiments (three to eight determinations) and from Villani and Attardi (12) for 143B.TK− cells.

Open table in a new tab See under “Experimental Procedures” for details. COX activity in each of the cell types investigated here was titrated, as described previously (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), with the specific inhibitor KCN both as isolated step, using 0.4 mm TMPD and 10 mm ascorbate as electron donors, in the presence of 20 nm antimycin A as upstream inhibitor, and as respiratory chain-integrated step (endogenous respiration). As examples of the analysis performed here, Fig. 2, a and c, shows the KCN titration curves of COX activity as isolated step and as integrated step for the myeloma and hepatoma cell lines, respectively. The data are expressed as percentages of DNP-uncoupled endogenous respiration rate. The differences in the KCN titration curves of COX activity measured as isolated step and as respiratory chain-integrated step are consistent with the occurrence in the myeloma and hepatoma cells of an excess of COX activity over that required to maintain a normal O2 consumption rate, as previously observed for 143B cells (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This excess is best illustrated by the threshold plots of Fig. 2, b and d, i.e. the plots of the relative endogenous respiration rate of myeloma and hepatoma cells, respectively, against the percentage of inhibition of isolated COX activity at the same KCN concentrations. In the plots shown in Fig. 2, b and d, if the least-square regression line through thefilled symbols beyond the inflection point in each curve is extrapolated to zero COX inhibition, the intersection with the ordinate axis should give an estimate of the maximum COX capacity as integrated step, expressed as a percentage of the uninhibited endogenous respiration rate (see also Ref. 8Taylor R.W. Birch-Machin M.A. Bartlett K. Lowerson S.A. Turnbull D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3523-3528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The COXR(max) values thus estimated for myeloma cells and hepatoma cells are ∼1.33 and ∼1.16, respectively. The COXR(max) values estimated for the different cell types investigated in this work and for the previously analyzed 143B cells (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) are shown in Table II. One can see that the excess of maximum COX capacity over the endogenous respiration rates varies between 1.16 times in hepatoma cells and 1.40 times in 143B cells,i.e. is much lower than previously reported for isolated rat tissue mitochondria (6Letellier T. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Biochem.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2564-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The use of the least-square regression lines through the points beyond the inflection in the threshold plots for the calculation of the COX thresholds is discussed below. In previous work (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the dependence on the concentration of TMPD (0–2 mm), in the presence of a constant concentration of ascorbate (10 mm), of the initial O2consumption rate associated with isolated COX activity was measured in DNP- and antimycin A-treated 143B cells. This analysis showed that in these cells, the uncoupled respiration rate supported by 0.4 mm TMPD, expressed relative to the uncoupled endogenous respiration rate, reached a value of 1.39, which was almost identical to the COXR(max) value previously determined by KCN titration for the same cells. This observation and the previous finding that, in beef heart submitochondrial particles, the steady-state level of reduction of cytochrome c reached a maximum at ∼0.4 mm TMPD (20Sagi-Eisenberg R. Gutman M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 97: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility that measurement of the relative uncoupled respiration rate supported by 0.4 mm TMPD in DNP- and antimycin A-treated cells would provide a simplified approach for the estimation of the COXR(max). Fig. 3 shows the dependence on the concentration of TMPD (from 0 to 2 mm), in the presence of a constant concentration of ascorbate (10 mm) of the COX activity, measured as an isolated step, in four of the cell types analyzed here, DNP- and antimycin A-treated (myeloma, hepatoma, lung carcinoma, and neuroblastoma). Although in all curves, as already shown for 143B cells (12Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the TMPD is near-saturating above 2 mm, and starts becoming limiting at ≈0.2 mm, as previously observed for antimycin A-inhibited beef heart isolated mitochondria (21Brand M.D. Vallis B.P.S. Kesseler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), there are some differences in the apparent saturation levels for the different cell types. The relative uncoupled respiration rates in 0.4 mm TMPD were determined for the four human cell lines analyzed in Fig. 3, as well as for human fibroblasts and myoblasts, and are shown in Table II. One can see from Table II that the ratios of ascorbate + 0.4 mm TMPD-dependent respiration rate to endogenous respiration rate vary between 0.97 (for hepatoma cells) and 1.50 (for myoblasts). A comparison with the corresponding COXR(max) values determined by extrapolation of the KCN inhibition data shows a remarkable similarity between the two sets of data (within ∼16%). Table II also shows the results of measurements of the ratio of ascorbate + 0.4 mmTMPD-dependent respiration rate to endogenous respiration rate in rabbit platelets, which gave a value of 1.42. The analysis of relative COX capacity described above was carried out in uncoupled intact cells. It seemed, therefore, important to test whether the conclusion reached about the nearly limiting or low excess of COX activity in the respiratory chain of several different human cell types also applies to cells permeabilized with digitonin and tested in state 3 respiration, i.e. under more physiological conditions. Fig. 4 shows the curves illustrating the succinate-supported respiration rate in hepatoma, myeloma, and 143B cells treated with different amounts of digitonin. A digitonin concentration of 15 μg/106 cells was chosen as optimal for 143B cells, 10 μg/106 cells, for hepatoma cells, and 5 μg/106 cells, for myeloma cells. For fibroblasts, a concentration of 10–15 μg/106 cells, as recommended by others (15Kunz D. Luley C. Fritz S. Bohnensack R. Winkler K. Kunz W.S. Wallesch C.-W. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was adopted. The state 3 (ADP-stimulated) glutamate/malate-dependent respiration rates in digitonin-permeabilized 143B cells, hepatoma cells, myeloma cells, and fibroblasts were found to be very similar to the coupled endogenous respiration rates of intact cells, thus allowing the titration of the same COX activity under different metabolic conditions, but under comparable respiratory fluxes. Fig. 5presents the threshold plots for 143B, myeloma and hepatoma cells in state 3, showing that the extrapolation of the least-square regression lines through the filled symbols beyond the inflection point to zero COX inhibition gives COXR(max) estimates of 1.22, 1.15, and 1.20, respectively. Table II shows the COXR(max) value similarly estimated for fibroblasts. It is clear that the COXR(max)values for state 3 of all cell types analyzed are very similar to the COXR(max) values for the uncoupled state, with a tendency to be somewhat lower (Table II). It has to be stressed, however, that mitochondria (both in situ and as isolated organelles) have, in state 3, a residual steady-state transmembrane electrochemical potential (Δp), which continues to exert its back pressure on the electron flow through the whole respiratory chain or the isolated cytochrome c oxidase. This has been verified, in our experiments, by the observation of further stimulation of oxygen consumption upon exposure to DNP of state 3-respiring permeabilized cells (data not shown). This residual transmembrane electrochemical potential may account for the observation that the least-square regression lines through the symbols beyond the inflection point in the curves of Fig. 5 do not extrapolate to 100% COX inhibition.Figure 5Percent"

Here we report an expanded role of beta-arrestins in promoting clathrin-mediated endocytosis of a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, i.e. the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) receptor. beta-Arrestins bind to the ligand-occupied IGF-1 receptors, promote their endocytosis, and enhance IGF-1-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and DNA synthesis.

TheTyr/albino locus, in which mutations cause a lack of pigmentation, encodes tyrosinase (Tyr), the critical and rate-limiting melanogenic enzyme. Other melanogenic enzymes include Tyrp1 (or TRP1) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-chrome tautomerase (Dct or TRP2) encoded at the Tyrp1/brown and Dct/slaty loci, respectively. Murine Tyrp1 can oxidize 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) produced by Dct, but mutations in Tyrp1 also affect the catalytic functions of Tyr. All three enzymes are membrane-bound melanosomal proteins with similar structural features and are thought to interact within and stabilize a melanogenic complex. We have now further investigated the effect of aTyrp1 b mutation on Tyr stability. Pulse/chase labeling experiments show that Tyr is degraded more quickly in Tyrp1 b mutant melanocytes than in melanocytes wild type at that locus. This reduced stability of Tyr can be partly rescued by infection with the wild type Tyrp1 gene, and this is accompanied by phenotypic rescue of infected melanocytes. In sum, these results suggest that, in addition to its catalytic function in oxidizing DHICA, Tyrp1 may play an important role in stabilizing Tyr, a second potential role in the regulation of melanin formation.

This reduced stability of Tyr can be partly rescued by infection with the wild type Tyrp1 gene, and this is accompanied by phenotypic rescue of infected melanocytes. In sum, these results suggest that, in addition to its catalytic function in oxidizing DHICA, Tyrp1 may play an important role in stabilizing Tyr, a second potential role in the regulation of melanin formation. tyrosinase-related protein 5,6-dihydroxyindole DHI-2-carboxylic acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine tyrosinase DOPAchrome tautomerase. Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1, also known as TRP1 and gp75) is encoded by the Tyrp1/brown locus, one of more than 85 genes that directly or indirectly affect coat color in mice (1Silvers W.K.

Tyrp1 is expressed specifically in melanocytes and functions in melanin synthesis within melanosomes, as do the other members of the tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)1 family, which includes Tyr (also known as tyrosinase), and Dct (also known as DOPAchrome tautomerase and TRP2). Although TRPs have many similar structural features, including a transmembrane region, two metal-binding regions, and a cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor motif, each member of the TRP family has a distinct catalytic activity in the biosynthesis of the melanin biopolymer. Tyr, encoded by theTyr/albino locus, catalyzes the critical and rate-limiting step of tyrosine hydroxylation to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), DOPA oxidation to DOPAquinone, and 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) oxidation to indole-5,6-quinone (5Körner A.M.

Dct, encoded by the Dct/slaty locus, functions as DOPAchrome tautomerase, producing DHI-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) from DOPAchrome rather than the spontaneously decarboxylated product DHI (8Jackson I.J.

Chaudhuri B. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2413-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), its specific function in melanogenesis has been controversial (11Jackson I.J. Proc. Natl.

Recently we have shown that murine Tyrp1 functions as a DHICA oxidase in the melanogenic pathway (16Jiménez-Cervantes C. Solano F. Kobayashi T. Urabe K. Hearing V.J. Lozano J.A. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C.

Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5818-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This catalytic activity of Tyrp1 promotes the oxidation and polymerization of DHICA monomers into melanin, and in fact, melanins in the hair of brown mice are significantly less polymerized than those in black mice (18Orlow S.J. Osber M.P. Pawelek J.M. Pigment Cell Res. 1992; 5: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Ozeki H. Ito S. Wakamatsu K. Hirobe T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). There are other distinct differences in DHI- and DHICA-derived melanins, including their color, size, and solubility. Tyr, Tyrp1, and Dct are localized in the melanosomal membrane and act within the context of a series of reactions in the melanogenic pathway. It has been proposed that TRPs might interact in a multi-enzyme complex (or metabolon), because each of them contains a cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor motif thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions (8Jackson I.J. Chambers D.M. Tsukamoto K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Orlow and co-workers (20Orlow S.J. Zhou B.K.

Tsukamoto K. Urabe K. Kameyama K. Montague P.M. Jackson I.J. Takeuchi T. Quevedo Jr., W.C. Functional Properties of Cloned Melanogenic Proteins.

Res. 1994; 40: 613-626PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we suggested that TRPs might interact in vivo and be stabilized in a multi-enzyme complex, which plays an important role in the regulation of mammalian melanogenesis. Because Tyrp1 is the most abundant glycoprotein expressed in melanocytes (23Tai T. Eisinger M. Ogata S. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2773-2779PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vijayasaradhi S. Houghton A.N. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it may play a key role in forming that multi-enzyme complex. There are various murine mutations at the Tyrp1 locus (e.g. Tyrp1 lt/light orTyrp1 c/cordovan) with known molecular lesions (25Zdarsky E. Favor J. Jackson I.J. Genetics. 1990; 126: 443-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Johnson R. Jackson I.J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Well known among them is theTyrp1 b/brown mutation, which results in the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 86 (C86Y) within the epidermal growth factor domain thought to function in protein-protein interactions. This mutation results in the mislocalization of Tyrp1, which is not delivered to melanosomes correctly (27Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the interaction of Tyrp1 and Tyr within melanocytes, we have investigated the effect of theTyrp1 b mutation on the stability of Tyr in vivo. We used the murine melanocyte line melan-b, which is homozygous for the Tyrp1 b mutation, and the melan-a melanocyte line, wild type at this locus (28Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 29Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Dexter T.H. Devlin L.M. Heasman J. Nester B. Development. 1989; 105: 379-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the stability of Tyr in melan-b cells and in melan-a cells. Pulse labeling and chase experiments showed that Tyr is degraded more quickly in Tyrp1 mutant melan-b cells than in the wild type melan-a cells. Moreover, the lesser stability of Tyr in melan-b cells can be partly rescued by infection with the wild type Tyrp1gene, along with phenotypic rescue of those cells. These results demonstrate that in addition to its catalytic function in DHICA oxidation, Tyrp1 also plays an important role in the stabilization of Tyr in melanocytes and might thus also indirectly contribute to the regulation of melanin production. Melanocyte lines cultured from black (Tyrp1/Tyrp1) and from brown (Tyrp1 b/Tyrp1 b) nonagouti mice (melan-a and melan-b cells, respectively) were cultured as previously reported (28Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 29Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Dexter T.H. Devlin L.M. Heasman J. Nester B.

NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The peptide antibodies used in this study, αPEP1, αPEP7, αPEP8, and αPEP13, were generated in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl termini of murine melanogenic proteins Tyrp1, Tyr, Dct, and Pmel17 (also known as the silver protein), respectively, and specifically recognize each melanogenic protein as described previously (9Tsukamoto K.

Another antibody used in this study, αPEP5, was produced against the amino-terminal peptide of murine Tyr, an epitope recognized only following denaturation, as detailed previously (12Jiménez M.

Briefly, semiconfluent cells were preincubated in methionine-free medium containing dialyzed fetal bovine serum, pulsed for 30 min with [35S]methionine (0.1–1.0 mCi/ml) (NEN Life Science Products) in methionine-free medium, and chased in complete medium for 0–48 h, as detailed in the figure legends. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline without Mg2+ and Ca2+and solubilized at 4 °C for 60 min in Nonidet P-40/SDS buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatants were kept at 4 °C for immunoprecipitation. The resulting 35S-labeled extracts were then precleared with 10 μl of normal rabbit serum and 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two × 106 trichloracetic acid-precipitable cpm of precleared extracts were incubated with 5 μl of antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and were then complexed with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed six times with Nonidet P-40/SDS buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 3 min and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207530) Google Scholar), followed by fluorography. For immunoprecipitation using αPEP5 antibody, labeled cell extracts were denatured before incubation with antibody as reported previously (12Jiménez M. Maloy W.L. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3397-3403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For quantification of immunoprecipitated bands, fluorographs were analyzed with BioImage (Millipore). Retroviral infection of melan-b cells was performed as described previously (33Bennett D.C. Huszar D. Laipis P.J. Jaenisch R. Jackson I.J. Development. 1990; 110: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, psi-2 helper fibroblasts transfected with the Tyrp1 retrovirus (pHS-TRP1) and with pSV2-neo were selected in G418 (200 μg/ml) and were incubated for 12 h in melanocyte medium without 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. The conditioned medium containing virus was harvested, filtered through a 22-μm membrane, supplemented with 200 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and 10 μg/ml polybrene, and placed in melan-b cultures plated the previous day at 2 × 104 cells/ml. The medium was replaced after 12 h with freshly prepared conditioned medium. After three such exposures to the conditioned medium, cells were cultured in fresh melanocyte medium for 2 days and were then subcultured and subcloned. Southern blotting was performed with some modification as described previously (33Bennett D.C. Huszar D. Laipis P.J. Jaenisch R. Jackson I.J. Development. 1990; 110: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was isolated from melanocytes with a Qiagen DNA isolation kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SacI-digested DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with a fluorescein-labeled HindIII-digested pMT4 probe for the murine Tyrp1 gene (10Shibahara S. Tomita Y. Sakakura T. Nager C. Chaudhuri B. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2413-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 34Jackson I.J. Chambers D.M. Budd P.S. Johnson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3799-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), followed by visualization with a Fluorescein Gene Image detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To quantify the degradation of Tyr within melanocytes, we used pulse/chase metabolic labeling. Tyr in the metabolically labeled melan-a melanocyte extract was specifically immunoprecipitated with αPEP7 antibody, separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, visualized by fluorography, and densitometrically analyzed (Fig. 1). An excellent correlation was obtained between the relative intensity of the immunoprecipitated Tyr and the amount of melanocyte cell extract added, showing that the degradation of Tyr can be quantified using such immunoprecipitation analysis. The synthesis and degradation of melanogenic proteins in melan-b (Tyrp1 b/Tyrp1 b) and melan-a (Tyrp1/Tyrp1) melanocytes was compared using peptide antibodies specific for each protein (Fig. 2 A). As found previously (9Tsukamoto K. Jackson I.J. Urabe K. Montague P.M. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar,12Jiménez M. Maloy W.L. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3397-3403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kobayashi T. Urabe K. Winder A.J. Jiménez-Cervantes C. Imokawa G. Brewington T. Solano F. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5818-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), two Tyr bands from melan-a melanocytes were observed, a higher broad band and a lower band, representing glycosylated and de novo Tyr, respectively. In melan-a and in melan-b melanocytes, Dct and Pmel17 (also known as gp100 and the silver protein) were expressed and degraded similarly. In contrast, Tyrp1 in mutant melan-b cells was not glycosylated to a significant degree and disappeared more quickly than in wild type melan-a melanocytes. Tyr was also underglycosylated to some extent and was degraded significantly more quickly in melan-b cells than in melan-a cells, even though both types of cells produce genetically identical Tyr. Densitometric analysis of three independent pulse/chase experiments showed clearly that Tyr and Tyrp1 in melan-b cells were degraded significantly more quickly than in melan-a cells, whereas rates of degradation of Dct and Pmel17 were virtually identical (Fig. 2 B). As the rate of processing of Tyr from thede novo type (i.e. the lower molecular weight band) to the highly glycosylated type (i.e. the higher molecular weight band) was decreased in melan-b cells compared with melan-a cells, we analyzed the degradation of the glycosylated Tyr band in melan-a and melan-b cells (Fig. 2 C). The amount of glycosylated Tyr present at the 1.5-h chase period was adjusted to 100% as a control, and it is clear that even glycosylated Tyr was degraded significantly more quickly in melan-b cells than in melan-a cells. Tyr is inserted and anchored in the melanosomal membrane via its transmembrane region (near the carboxyl-terminal) and can be readily digested proteolytically there to produce a smaller Tyr with a truncated carboxyl terminus but which still retains enzymatic activity (12Jiménez M. Maloy W.L. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3397-3403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Valverde P. Garcı́a-Borrón J.C. Solano F. Lozano J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that only the carboxyl terminus of Tyr might have been lost during the pulse/chase experiments reported above, which might be misleading when using only the αPEP7 antibody (which recognizes that carboxyl terminus). Therefore, we also immunoprecipitated Tyr using αPEP5 (which recognizes the amino terminus of Tyr) and analyzed its degradation in melan-a and melan-b cells. Again, a decrease in glycosylation and a significantly lowered stability of Tyr in melan-b cells was observed (Fig. 3), indicating that the loss of immunoreactivity represents degradation of the entire protein and not just its carboxyl terminus. We next compared the degradation of Tyr in uninfected and in Tyrp1-infected melan-b melanocytes. When melan-b cells were infected with the wild type Tyrp1 gene and cultured for 10 days, some black cells (i.e. phenotypically rescued cells) were observed among the infected cell population, as reported previously (33Bennett D.C. Huszar D. Laipis P.J. Jaenisch R. Jackson I.J. Development. 1990; 110: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar). Such cells represented about 20% of the total infected melan-b cell population. We subcloned these cells by limited dilution cloning in 96-well plates and established several cloned lines. Clones 1 and 2 were produced from mock-infected melan-b cells, whereas clones 3, 4, and 5 were from Tyrp1-infected melan-b cells. The relatively long term culture of clonedTyrp1-infected cell lines without selective pressure caused the emergence of a heterogeneous population, including some cells that appeared brown again. Southern blotting analysis (Fig. 4, inset) demonstrated that uninfected clones 1 and 2 did not contain wild type Tyrp1, as expected, whereas clones 3, 4, and 5 contained the infected wild type Tyrp1 minigene. This is consistent with the phenotypes of their cell pellets, i.e. pellets of clones 1 and 2 were brown, whereas pellets of clones 3, 4, and 5 were black. When degradation of Tyr in these subcloned cells was analyzed with pulse/chase labeling, Tyr was significantly more stable following infection of melan-b melanocytes with the wild typeTyrp1 gene (Fig. 4). This study demonstrates that Tyr (encoded at theTyr/albino locus) is degraded more quickly in melan-b melanocytes, which are homozygous for the brown mutation (Tyrp1 b /Tyrp1 b), than in melan-a melanocytes, wild type at that locus. Moreover, the reduced stability of Tyr and the brown phenotype of melan-b melanocytes could be rescued by infection with the wild type Tyrp1 gene. Thus, the decreased stability of Tyr in melan-b cells is caused by the C86Y point mutation in the Tyrp1 gene. Our previous study (22Winder A.J. Kobayashi T. Tsukamoto K. Urabe K. Aroca P. Kameyama K. Hearing V.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 613-626PubMed Google Scholar) showed clearly that Tyr catalytic function in melan-b cells is only ∼65% that found in melan-a cells, whereas Dct function (as DOPAchrome tautomerase) is identical in both cell lines. Several clues about the important role of Tyrp1 in Tyr function have also been provided by in vivo studies. Tyr catalytic function in the skin of brown mice is only 80% that found in the skin of black mice (36Prota G. Lamoreux M.L. Muller J. Kobayashi T. Napolitano A. Vincenzi R. Sakai C. Hearing V.J. Pigment Cell Res. 1995; 8: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and melanin content of brown mouse hair is only 30–35% that found in black mouse hair (19Ozeki H. Ito S. Wakamatsu K. Hirobe T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 36Prota G. Lamoreux M.L. Muller J. Kobayashi T. Napolitano A. Vincenzi R. Sakai C. Hearing V.J. Pigment Cell Res. 1995; 8: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the only difference between these black and brown melanocytes (and animals) is the point mutation in the Tyrp1 gene, how can the instability of Tyr in Tyrp1-mutant melanocytes be explained? One attractive possibility is that the brown mutation affects the direct interaction between Tyr and Tyrp1 and suppresses the stabilizing influence of Tyrp1 on Tyr. Current studies by our group and others have demonstrated that Tyr and Tyrp1 are localized in a melanosomal enzyme complex and interact with each other (20Orlow S.J. Zhou B.K. Chakraborty A.K. Drucker M. Pifko-Hirst S. Pawelek J.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 196-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Hearing V.J. Tsukamoto K. Urabe K. Kameyama K. Montague P.M. Jackson I.J. Takeuchi T. Quevedo Jr., W.C. Functional Properties of Cloned Melanogenic Proteins. Munksgaard, Copenhagen, Denmark1992: 264-270Google Scholar). The brown mutation (C86Y) results in a structural change in the epidermal growth factor motif of Tyrp1, a domain thought to play an important role in protein-protein interactions (25Zdarsky E. Favor J. Jackson I.J. Genetics. 1990; 126: 443-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation appears to allow the rapid degradation of under-glycosylated Tyrp1, resulting in the absence of Tyrp1 in melanosomes (27Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which would in turn reduce direct interaction of Tyrp1 with Tyr. Decreases in the glycosylation of Tyrp1 and Tyr suggest that these two proteins might interact in some manner in the Golgi apparatus where such glycosylation occurs. The altered glycosylation might affect proper routing of these proteins to the melanosome and might thus also be an important factor in their rapid degradation. Mutations in Tyrp1 also lead to structural changes in melanosomes (36Prota G. Lamoreux M.L. Muller J. Kobayashi T. Napolitano A. Vincenzi R. Sakai C. Hearing V.J. Pigment Cell Res. 1995; 8: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Moyer F.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1963; 100: 584-606Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Moyer F.H. Am.

Phillips P. Lutzner M.A. J. Ultra. Res. 1973; 43: 88-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which might, at least in part, result from the reduced stability of Tyr and Tyrp1 observed in this study. Melanosomes produced in brown melanocytes (i.e. Tyrp1 b/Tyrp1 b) are round, particulate, and relatively disorganized in structure, rather than ovoid, lamellar, and regular structures as normally observed on a eumelanogenic background. Further, other mutations at theTyrp1 locus (e.g. Tyrp1 lt) cause the premature death of follicular melanocytes coordinated with melanogenesis, suggesting that Tyrp1 functions in some manner to protect cells from toxic intermediates during melanin biosynthesis (26Johnson R. Jackson I.J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for Tyr degradation within the melanosome might be its susceptibility to attack and cleavage by melanin intermediates (such as quinones) in melanosomes of Tyrp1 dysfunctional melanocytes. Infection of the wild type Tyrp1 gene into melan-b melanocytes resulted in only a partial rescue of Tyr instability. Even in subcloned Tyrp1-infected cells, Tyrp1 was not fully glycosylated and disappeared relatively quickly, as it did in uninfected melan-b cells (data not shown). Incomplete rescue of Tyr stability in melan-b melanocytes byTyrp1 gene infection might result from insufficient Tyrp1 expression and/or function to fully stabilize Tyr as it does in wild type melan-a cells. A further complication is that reversion to the parental brown phenotype occurs rather quickly, which may result from methylation of viral DNA (33Bennett D.C. Huszar D. Laipis P.J. Jaenisch R. Jackson I.J. Development. 1990; 110: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely that, were it possible to analyze the stability of Tyr solely in cells expressing infected wild type Tyrp1, rescue of Tyr stability would be significantly more dramatic. It is not completely clear how the decreased stability of Tyr in Tyrp1 mutant melanocytes contributes to the brown phenotype. The decrease in Tyr activity necessarily results in a decrease in melanin production, as has been shown for human and mouse brown hair. Failure of routing of Tyrp1 to melanosomes in Tyrp1 mutant melanocytes must eliminate Tyrp1 function(s) in melanosomes, including its catalytic activity. In humans, one type of human TYR-positive albinism, termed OCA3, has been identified recently that maps at the human homolog of theTyrp1//brown locus (41Boissy R.E. Zhao H. Oetting W.S. Austin L.M. Wildenberg S.C. Boissy Y.L. Zhao Y. Sturm R.A. Hearing V.J. King R.A. Nordlund J.J. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1996; 58: 1145-1156PubMed Google Scholar). Melanocytes isolated from that OCA3 patient have no TYRP1 expression, and although the transcription and translation of TYR is detected at normal levels, melanin production is diminished drastically, similar to what is observed in melan-b melanocytes. Human TYRP1 does not seem to have DHICA oxidase activity (42Boissy, R. E., Sakai, C., Zhao, H., Kobayashi, T. & Hearing, V. J. (1998) Exp. Dermatol., in pressGoogle Scholar), and thus the TYR stabilizing function of TYRP1 may in general be even more important to the regulation of mammalian pigmentation than is its catalytic function. Human TYR is significantly less stable than murine Tyr (7Tripathi R.K. Hearing V.J. Urabe K. Aroca P. Spritz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23707-23712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2T. Kobayashi, G. Imokawa, D. C. Bennett, and V. J. Hearing, unpublished results. and the stabilizing role of Tyrp1 on Tyr may play a more active and essential role in the regulation of human pigmentation than in mouse pigmentation. Further studies on TYR stability in OCA3-derived and normal human melanocytes will be necessary to clarify this point. In sum, these results suggest that in addition to its catalytic function(s), the principal function of Tyrp1 may be to stabilize Tyr in melanocytes, and Tyrp1 might thus regulate basal levels of melanin formation."

These barriers are induced by molecules called elicitors that are produced by pathogens. In the present study, the most active elicitors of the hypersensitive response in rice were isolated from the rice pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe grisea, and their structures were identified as cerebrosides A and C, sphingolipids that were previously isolated as inducers of cell differentiation in the fungusSchizophyllum commune. Treatment of rice leaves with cerebroside A induced the accumulation of antimicrobial compounds (phytoalexins), cell death, and increased resistance to subsequent infection by compatible pathogens. The degradation products of cerebroside A (fatty acid methyl ester, sphingoid base, and glucosyl sphingoid base) showed no elicitor activity. Hydrogenation of the 8E-double bond in the sphingoid base moiety or the 3E-double bond in the fatty acid moiety of cerebroside A did not alter the elicitor activity, whereas hydrogenation of the 4E-double bond in the sphingoid base moiety led to a 12-fold decrease in elicitor activity. Furthermore, glucocerebrosides from Gaucher’s spleen consisting of (E)-4-sphingenine and cerebrosides from rice bran mainly consisting of (4E,8E)-4,8-sphingadienine and (4E,8Z)-4,8-sphingadienine showed no elicitor activity. These results indicate that the methyl group at C-9 and the 4E-double bond in the sphingoid base moiety of cerebrosides A and C are the key elements determining the elicitor activity of these compounds.

Sphingolipids are ubiquitous components of the membranes of all eukaryotic cells and are particularly abundant in plasma membranes. In animals, they play important roles in general membrane function, cell-to-cell contact, cell recognition, and regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Hakomori S. Annu. Rev.

Recently, it has been shown that sphingolipid metabolic products, ceramides, function as second messengers in the signal transduction pathway involved in apoptosis (10Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar, 11Hannun Y.A.

Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fungi, sphingolipids are known to function as inducers of cell differentiation. Fungal cerebrosides, including cerebrosides B1 and C, induce cell differentiation in the fungus Schizophyllum commune, with resultant formation of the fruiting body (13Kawai G. Ikeda Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 243-248Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Kawai G. Ikeda Y. Tubaki K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 2137-2146Google Scholar, 15Kawai G. Ohnishi M. Fujino Y. Ikeda Y. J.

Acta. 1989; 1001: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the 8E-double bond and methyl group at C-9 in the sphingoid base moiety are important for the induction of cell differentiation. In animals and fungi, sphingolipids are known to have various biological functions as mentioned above, whereas in the case of plants, no reports have appeared to date demonstrating the involvement of sphingolipids in biological processes, such as the hypersensitive response (HR), cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis. When plants interact with certain pathogens, they protect themselves by generating various chemical and physical barriers called the HR (17Keen N.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). During the HR, recognition of a pathogen triggers the activation of a cell death pathway that results in the formation of a zone of dead cells (necrosis) around the site of infection. This is accompanied by the accumulation of antimicrobial compounds (phytoalexins), the induction of pathogenesis-related proteins (chitinases, β-1,3-glucanases and proteinase inhibitors), increased expression of defense-related genes, the formation of lignin, a burst of active oxygen, and increased resistance to subsequent infection by pathogens (18Dixon R.A. Harrison M.J. Adv. Genet. 1990; 28: 165-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Staskawicz B.J. Ausubel F.M. Baker B.J. Ellis J.G. Jones J.D.G.

The HR is induced by molecules called elicitors that are produced by pathogens (21Keen N.T. Science. 1975; 187: 74-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Elicitors have been studied extensively and, in most cases, have been shown to be oligo- or polysaccharides derived from the mycelia of pathogenic fungi. The chemical structures of some elicitors from pathogens have been determined. An oligosaccharide elicitor of phytoalexin synthesis in soybean has been isolated from the soybean pathogenic fungus Phytophthora megasperma and identified as hepta-β-glucopyranoside (22Sharp J.K. Valent B. Albersheim P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11312-11320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sharp J.K. McNeil M. Albersheim P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11321-11336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid from the potato pathogenic fungus Phytophthora infestans, have been isolated as elicitors of phytoalexin accumulation in potato (24Bostock R.M. Kuc J.A. Laine R.A. Science. 1981; 212: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Syringolides 1 and 2, glycolipid elicitors in soybean, have been isolated as products of avirulence gene D from the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (25Midland S.L. Keen N.T. Sims J.J. Midland M.M. Stayton M.M. Burton V. Smith M.J. Mazzola E.P. Graham K.J. Clardy J. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 2940-2945Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The HR in rice leaves in response to elicitor treatment is highly dependent on environmental conditions, and establishing the right combination of conditions had been difficult. Hence, no bioassay for measuring elicitor activity in rice plants had yet been established. In a previous study, we succeeded in developing a suitable bioassay for measuring elicitor activity in rice leaves by cultivating rice plants under conditions of low temperature, high light intensity, and high humidity (26Koga J. Oshima K. Ogawa N. Ogasawara N. Shimura M. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1998; 64: 97-101Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, the most active elicitors of the HR in rice plants were isolated from the rice pathogenic fungusMagnaporthe grisea, and their structures were identified as cerebrosides A and C, sphingolipids that were previously isolated as inducers of cell differentiation in the fungus S. commune(14Kawai G. Ikeda Y. Tubaki K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 2137-2146Google Scholar). Treatment of rice leaves with cerebroside A induced the accumulation of phytoalexins, cell death, and increased resistance to subsequent infection by compatible pathogens. Structure-activity relationship experiments indicated that the methyl group at C-9 and the 4E-double bond in the sphingoid base moiety are the key elements determining the elicitor activity of cerebrosides A and C. IR spectra were recorded on a Nippondenshi JIR-100 FT-IR spectrophotometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD solutions on a JOEL JNM-GSX 500 spectrometer (500.2 MHz for 1H, 125.8 MHz for13C), using SiMe4 and CD3OD as internal standards. Fast atom bombardment mass spectra (FAB-MS) were recorded on a VG ZAB-HF mass spectrometer usingm-nitrobenzyl alcohol as a matrix. Momilactones (27Cartwright D. Langcake P. Pryce R.J. Leworthy D.P.

Cerebrosides and their derivatives were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a TSKgel ODS-120T (21.5 mm i.d. × 37.5 cm; TOSOH) column at a flow rate of 10 ml/min at 40 °C, a TSKgel ODS-120A (7.8 mm i.d. × 30 cm; TOSOH) column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at 50 °C, a TSKgel ODS-120T (4.6 mm i.d. × 30 cm; TOSOH) column at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min at 55 °C, and a TSKgel CN-80TS (cyanopropyl) column (0.78 cm i.d. × 30 cm; TOSOH) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min at 50 °C. The eluate was monitored with an ultraviolet detector at 280 nm for phytocassanes and at 215 nm for momilactones, cerebrosides, and their derivatives.

Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 2753-2762Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Prof. Masao Ohnishi (Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine). Glucocerebrosides from Gaucher’s spleen and galactocerebrosides from bovine brain were purchased from Funakoshi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. Two rice leaves treated with the elicitor solution were collected and cut into pieces. The sample was shaken with 5 ml of ethyl acetate and 5 ml of 0.1 n Na2CO3(pH 10.5) for 16 h to yield ethyl acetate and aqueous layers. The ethyl acetate layer was evaporated to yield a crude extract, which was dissolved in 0.4 ml of ethanol before adding 0.6 ml of 0.02 N HCl. The solution was mixed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (0.1 ml) was subjected to HPLC on a TSKgel ODS-120T column (4.6 mm i.d. × 30 cm) eluted with 45% acetonitrile. The fractions corresponding to the peaks of phytocassanes and momilactones were collected. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described (28Koga J. Shimura M. Oshima K. Ogawa N. Yamauchi T. Ogasawara N. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 7907-7918Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). M. grisea MAFF 305494 was cultured in a liquid medium that contained potato extract (200 g of potato), 20 g of sucrose, and 5 g of yeast extract per liter. After incubation for 7 days at 28 °C, 1 kg of mycelia was harvested and suspended in 3 liters of H2O. The suspension of mycelia was homogenized for 10 min and sonicated six times for 5 min at intervals of 20 min at 4 °C. The resultant suspension was adjusted to pH 10.5 with Na2CO3 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was evaporated and dissolved in 20% ethanol. To isolate the most active elicitors present in the ethyl acetate extract of mycelia of M. grisea, the 20% ethanol solution from Step 1 was subjected to HPLC using a TSKgel ODS-120T (21.5 mm i.d. × 37.5 cm) column eluted with a linear gradient of 20–100% ethanol. The fractions with the highest elicitor activity were found between the fractions eluting in the range of 85–95% ethanol. These fractions were pooled and evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 86% ethanol. A TSKgel ODS-120T column (21.5 mm i.d. × 37.5 cm) was equilibrated with 86% ethanol. The active fraction from Step 2 was applied to the column, and the column was eluted with 86% ethanol. The resultant two active fractions were pooled and evaporated. These residues were dissolved in 80% ethanol. A TSKgel ODS-120T column (21.5 mm i.d. × 37.5 cm) was equilibrated with a mixture of ethanol, acetonitrile, and water (46:46:8, v/v). The two active fractions from Step 3 were applied to the column, and the column was eluted with a mixture of ethanol, acetonitrile, and water (46:46:8, v/v) to yield the two purified elicitors that were designated elicitor 1 and elicitor 2. 5 mg of cerebrosides A and C were incubated with 5 ml of 0.75n anhydrous methanolic HCl at 80 °C for 12 h to decomposed into d-glucose, fatty acid methyl esters, sphingoid bases, and glucosyl sphingoid bases. The fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane and then purified by TSKgel ODS-120T (21.5 mm i.d. × 37.5 cm) column eluted with 74% ethanol. The structures of the two purified esters were determined by 1H NMR and FAB-MS analysis. The residues extracted with hexane were adjusted to pH 10.7 by the addition of 1 m Na2CO3, and the sphingoid bases were extracted with hexane. 4 ml of H2O were added to these residues, and then the glucosyl sphingoid bases were extracted with ethyl acetate. Furthermore, the sphingoid bases and glucosyl sphingoid bases were purified by HPLC on a TSKgel CN-80TS column eluted with a mixture of acetonitrile and 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (29:71, v/v). The structures of the sphingoid bases and glucosyl sphingoid bases were determined by 1H NMR and FAB-MS analysis. Hydrogenation of the double bonds in cerebroside A was performed according to the procedure developed by Schwarzmann (31Schwarzmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). 30 mg of cerebroside A were dissolved in 3 ml of tetrahydrofuran in a screw-capped vial, and 83 μl of 1 m NaOH were added to the solution. After flushing with N2, the hydrogenation was started by the addition of 42 μmol each of KBH4 and PdCl2, and the sample was immediately mixed for 3 min at room temperature. Next, 83 μl of 1 m NaOH were added to the solution. After flushing with N2, the second hydrogenation was started by the addition of 42 μmol each of KBH4 and PdCl2, and the sample was immediately mixed for 3 min at room temperature. To obtain the cerebroside hydrogenated at the 4E-double bond in the sphingoid base moiety or at the 3E-double bond in the fatty acid moiety, this second hydrogenation procedure was repeated 10 times. To obtain the cerebroside hydrogenated at the 8E-double bond in the sphingoid base moiety, this second hydrogenation procedure was repeated 30 times. Each sample after hydrogenation was centrifuged, and the tetrahydrofuran layer was collected. The tetrahydrofuran layer was partitioned between ethyl acetate and 0.05 m Na2CO3 (pH 11). The ethyl acetate layer was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 76% ethanol. The solution was fractionated by HPLC on a TSKgel ODS-120A column (7.8 mm i.d. × 30 cm) eluted with 76% ethanol, and the resultant fractions corresponding to two peaks atR t 50 and 67 min were collected. The fraction corresponding to the peak at R t 50 min was further fractionated by HPLC on a TSKgel ODS-120T column (4.6 mm i.d. × 30 cm) eluted with a mixture of ethanol, acetonitrile, and water (20:65:15, v/v) to yield two purified cerebrosides. By 1H NMR analysis, the two purified cerebrosides were confirmed to be (8E)-N-d-2′-hydroxy-(E)-3′-hexadecenoyl-1-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-9-methyl-8-sphingenine ((4E) H2-cerebroside A) and (4E,8E)-N-d-2′-hydroxypalmitoyl-1-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine ((3E) H2-cerebroside A). The fraction corresponding to the peak at R t 67 min was further fractionated by HPLC on a TSKgel ODS-120T column (4.6 mm i.d. × 30 cm) eluted with 72% ethanol to yield a purified cerebroside. By1H NMR analysis, the purified cerebroside was confirmed to beN-d-2′-hydroxypalmitoyl-1-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-9-methylsphinganine ((3E,4E,8E) H5-cerebroside A). Because hydrogenation of the 8E-double bond in the sphingoid base moiety was difficult as compared with the other double bonds, the cerebroside hydrogenated only at the 8E-double bond could scarcely be obtained.

A bioassay for measuring elicitor activity was performed as described previously (26Koga J. Oshima K. Ogawa N. Ogasawara N. Shimura M. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1998; 64: 97-101Crossref Google Scholar). Rice seeds (Oryza sativa, L. cv. Akitakomachi) were planted in soils that contained 0.6 mg/g nitrogen, 0.9 mg/g phosphorus, and 0.6 mg/g kalium and grown in a glass case in a phytotron to prevent exposure to air currents. Until the third leaf was fully expanded, the phytotron was operated at 22 °C during the day and 18 °C at night, with cycles of 12 h of light (3000 lux) and 12 h of darkness daily. Humidity was set at 80%. Once the third leaf was fully expanded, the phytotron was operated at 22 °C during the day and 18 °C at night, with cycles of 12 h of more intense light (30,000 lux) and 12 h of darkness daily. When the fifth leaf was fully expanded, the surface of the fourth leaf was wounded slightly by pressure from the tapered end of a Pipetman tip (Gilson). The sample to be assayed was suspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, that contained 0.1% Tween 20 by sonication and rapid agitation on a Vortex mixer. Ten drops (about 20 μl, total) of the sample solution were placed on ten wounded sites per leaf (2 μl per site). After this treatment, plants were grown at 28 °C during the day and 18 °C at night, with cycles of 12 h of high intense light (30,000 lux) and 12 h of darkness daily. Humidity was set at 80%. The two leaves were collected 48 h after treatment with the sample solution, and the amounts of phytoalexins produced were quantitated by HPLC as described above. Because momilactone A was predominantly induced among the various phytoalexins (26Koga J. Oshima K. Ogawa N. Ogasawara N. Shimura M. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1998; 64: 97-101Crossref Google Scholar), induction of larger amounts of momilactone A was taken to be indicative of higher elicitor activity. Concentration curves were prepared for cerebroside A to be assayed, and the amounts of momilactone A induced were plotted. One unit of elicitor activity was defined as the amount of cerebroside A required to induce the half-maximal amount of momilactone A per leaf. The specific elicitor activity of the sample was defined as the number of units per μg of dry weight of the sample. Cell death was assayed by measuring ion leakage from leaf discs as described (32Mittler R. Shulaev V. Seskar M. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1991-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rice plants (O. sativa L. cv. Akitakomachi) were cultivated in a phytotron as described above. For each measurement, 20 leaf discs (3 cm in length) 48 h after treatment with 0.2 mm cerebroside A or after control treatment (20 mm potassium phosphate plus 0.1% Tween 20) were floated on 80 ml of distilled water containing 0.01% Tween 20 and gently mixed. The solution was incubated for 3 h at room temperature, and the increase in conductivity (μS/cm) of the solution was measured with a conductivity meter. Each value presented represents the mean ± S.E. of results from five experiments. Rice plants (O. sativa L. cv. Akitakomachi) were cultivated in a phytotron as described above. Rice leaves (two leaves) were treated with 20 mm potassium phosphate plus 0.1% Tween 20 (control treatment) or with the same solution plus 0.2 mm cerebroside A (cerebroside treatment) at different times before inoculation with M. grisea (compatible race 007) on day 0. After the treatment with the sample solutions, the leaves were sprayed with a spore suspension of a compatible race (007) of M. grisea prepared as described (33Matsumoto K. Suzuki Y. Mase S. Watanabe T. Sekizawa Y. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1980; 46: 307-314Crossref Google Scholar). After the rice plants had been kept in a moist chamber (100% humidity) at 25 °C for 48 h, they were removed and cultivated in the phytotron that was operated at 23 °C during the day and 18 °C at night, with cycles of 12 h of light (3000 lux) and 12 h of darkness. Development of disease was scored by determination of the number of lesions 7 days after inoculation. The number of lesions on control plants was taken as 100%. The data presented are the means ± S.E. of results from 20 measurements for each time point. Inoculation of rice plants with an incompatible race of M. grisea induces the accumulation of momilactones (27Cartwright D. Langcake P. Pryce R.J. Leworthy D.P. Ride J.P. Nature. 1977; 267: 511-513Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and phytocassanes (28Koga J. Shimura M. Oshima K. Ogawa N. Yamauchi T. Ogasawara N.

Phytochemistry. 1997; 44: 249-253Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which are the main phytoalexins found in rice. In our newly established bioassay, an ethyl acetate extract of a sonicated suspension of mycelia of M. grisea (incompatible race 031) also effectively induced the accumulation of momilactones and phytocassanes in rice leaves. These observations suggest that the active material in the mycelial extract has hydrophobic properties. On the basis of these results, we purified elicitors from the ethyl acetate extract by monitoring the ability to induce phytoalexin production. By HPLC fractionation in three steps, two purified elicitors were isolated and designated elicitor 1 and elicitor 2. A balance sheet for elicitor purification is shown in Table I. Elicitor 1 was purified about 60-fold, and 16% of the initial activity was recovered. Elicitor 2 was purified about 59-fold, with a recovery of 10%. The specific activity of elicitors 1 and 2 was 0.86 and 0.84 unit/μg, respectively.Table IPurification of elicitors from the ethyl acetate extract of mycelia of M. griseaStepTotal dry weightTotal elicitor activitySpecific elicitor activityPurification factorElicitor activity recoveredmgunits1-aOne unit of elicitor activity is defined as the amount of the sample required to induce the half-maximal amount of momilactone A per leaf.units/μg1-bThe specific elicitor activity of the sample is defined as the number of units per μg dry weight of the sample.Fold%Ethyl acetate extract1-c1000 g (fresh weight) of mycelia were used as the starting material.333504760000.0141100ODS-120T/20–100% ethanol20842084000.1744ODS-120T/86% ethanol Elicitor 1121813000.674717 Elicitor 268514000.765311ODS-120T/46% ethanol plus 46% acetonitrile Elicitor 187750000.866016 Elicitor 257479000.8459101-a One unit of elicitor activity is defined as the amount of the sample required to induce the half-maximal amount of momilactone A per leaf.1-b The specific elicitor activity of the sample is defined as the number of units per μg dry weight of the sample.1-c 1000 g (fresh weight) of mycelia were used as the starting material.

Molecular cloning of genes whose protein products catalyze the transfer of sialic acid through an α-2,3 linkage has been reported (14Sasaki K. Watanabe E. Kawashima K. Sekine S. Dohi T. Oshima M.

However, none of the gene products so far reported is known to be involved in the synthesis of ganglioside GM3. We demonstrated previously that the level of GM3 synthase activity was dramatically enhanced during the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells (21Nakamura M. Tsunoda A. Sakoe K. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23507-23514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a cDNA library prepared from the differentiated HL-60 cells, we have isolated a cDNA encoding the GM3 synthase by a modified expression cloning method. In the present study, we demonstrate that the GM3 synthase shows some features clearly distinct from those of all the other sialyltransferases so far cloned, although it possesses several features common to members of the sialyltransferase family. The human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60, and the mouse lung carcinoma cell line 3LL-J5 (22Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Kumamoto Y. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which completely lacks acidic glycosphingolipids, and its derivative cell lines, 3LL-HK46, which stably expresses the polyoma virus large tumor antigen, and 3LL-ST28, which is a line permanently transfected with human GD3 synthase cDNA, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. HL-60 cells were inoculated at 2–3 × 105 cells/ml and treated with 24 nm TPA for 48 h, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using a Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). After reverse transcription, followed by double-strand synthesis and blunt-ending of the termini, cDNA was ligated with BstXI adapter (Invitrogen) and cloned into pCEV18, which is a derivative of pCEV7 (24Ito N. Yonehara S. Schreurs J. Gorman D.M. Maruyama K. Ishii A. Yahara I. Arai K. Miyajima A. Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The cDNA library was divided into eight parts, and each part was amplified separately in Escherichia coli DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.). After purification with Qiagen Tip (Qiagen), 100 μg of the plasmid DNA was introduced into 5 × 106 3LL-HK46 cells by electroporation (180 V, 600 μF). Thirty-six to 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS(−), and reacted with anti-GM3 mAb M2590 for 30 min on ice and stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG/A/M (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min on ice. The immunologically stained cells were isolated using an EPICS Elite ESP cell sorter (Coulter), and the plasmid DNA was rescued from the 5% of the cells sorted into the strongest fluorescent fields. After two rounds of the transfection and the sorting, 5 × 1063LL-HK46 cells were co-transfected with both 100 μg of the plasmid DNA rescued from the strongly fluorescent cells and 20 μg of pBKCMVh2,8ST, harboring human GD3 synthase cDNA (19Nara K. Watanabe Y. Maruyama K. Kasahara K. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and GD3 expression on the host cell surface was detected using anti-GD3 mAb R24 as a specific marker for enrichment of the targeted cDNA. The 0.6% of the total cells applied that were distributed into the strongest fluorescent fields were sorted using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). E. coliDH10B cells were electroporated with the plasmid DNA recovered after this sorting and seeded into nine 96-well microplates to yield 100 colonies/well, and the subpool showing the strongest positive signals in the flow cytometric profile was chosen using sibling selection. Finally, using 3LL-ST28 as well as 3LL-HK46 cell lines as host cells, a single candidate cDNA, pCEV4C7, was cloned by seeding 24 96-well microplates with one colony per well. 3LL-HK46 and 3LL-ST28 cells were transfected with 100 μg of either pCEV18 or pCEV4C7 by electroporation. After 36 h, the cells were harvested and used as an enzyme source. The enzymatic activity of GM3 synthase was measured as described previously (19Nara K. Watanabe Y. Maruyama K. Kasahara K. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the Pierce protein assay procedure with bovine serum albumin as a standard. MTN blots (CLONTECH) were used to determine the tissue distribution of GM3 synthase mRNA. A 2,066-bpEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of the pCEV4C7 cDNA was gel-purified, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and used as a probe. The blots were also hybridized with a radiolabeled human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene probe to control for the amount and quality of RNA in each sample. We first found that newly synthesized ganglioside GM3 was barely detectable on the surface of recipient 3LL cells using anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody M2590. We therefore devised a strategy for cloning the GM3 synthase gene on the basis of the facts that anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody R24 is an IgG protein, whereas M2590 mAb is an IgM protein, and that the GD3 synthetic sialyltransferase (sialyltransferase-II, SAT-II) cDNA had been successfully cloned and was available for our use (21Nakamura M. Tsunoda A. Sakoe K. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23507-23514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the polyoma virus large T antigen was first introduced into the mouse lung carcinoma cell line 3LL-J5 (22Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Kumamoto Y. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to produce the 3LL-HK46 cell line, both of which were completely deficient in gangliosides but rich in lactosylceramide (the precursor of ganglioside GM3). Thereafter, transfecting human GD3 synthase cDNA into 3LL-HK46 cells, we successfully established the 3LL-ST28 cell line, which stably expressed ganglioside GD3 synthase activity. 3LL-HK46 cells were used as host cells for the first stage of our expression cloning, in which co-transfection was performed with GD3 synthase cDNA to detect the GD3expression on the cell surface. Then, in the second stage, 3LL-ST28 cells served as recipient cells to efficiently isolate the GM3 synthase gene. The cDNA library was prepared in the vector pCEV18 from poly(A)+ RNA of HL-60 cells that had been differentiated along the monocytic lineage with phorbol ester and was introduced into the host cells by electroporation. For the first two cycles of cell sorting, the transfected cells were stained with M2590 followed by a FITC-conjugated second antibody and subjected to cell sorting. The 5% of the cells sorted into the strongest fluorescent fields was recovered, and the plasmid DNA was rescued by the method of Hirt (25Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Thus enriched plasmid DNA was co-transfected into the host cells with the plasmid pBKCMVh2,8ST (19Nara K. Watanabe Y. Maruyama K. Kasahara K. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which harbors human GD3 synthase cDNA. After sorting the cells that were stained with anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody R24 and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, we obtained a single candidate clone (termed 4C7) via two sequential sibling selections using 3LL-ST28 cells as the hosts. Fig. 1 shows the FACS profile of 3LL cells transiently transfected with clone 4C7. Strongly positive cells were found only when ST28 cells, and not HK46 cells, were used as the hosts. This result of the difficulty in detecting GM3 molecule by FACS suggests different localization or organization of the GM3 on the cell surface in different cell lines (23Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.P. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The insert DNA of clone 4C7 spans 2,359 bp with a single open reading frame of 1,089 bp starting at nucleotide 278, which is compatible with Kozak’s rule (26Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). The predicted primary sequence contains 362 amino acids with a molecular mass of 41.7 kDa, which is very close to that of the deglycosylated form (43 kDa) of the purified GM3 synthase from rat liver microsomes (27Melkerson-Watson L.J. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4448-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by the hydropathy analysis (Fig. 2 B), there exists a single anchor helix led by cationic amino acid residues in the N-terminal portion, suggesting that the 4C7 product might be a type II transmembrane protein (28Klein P. Kanehisa M. Delisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The characteristic sequences found in all the sialyltransferases so far cloned, sialylmotifs L and S (29Drickamer K.

Data base searches revealed that the 4C7 protein shared 27.1–41.2% sequence similarity with other sialyltransferases that catalyze formation of the α-2,3 and α-2,6 linkages of sialic acid to the acceptor galactose moiety, but not with enzymes that catalyze formation of the α-2,8 linkage to the nonreducing terminal sialic acid residue of glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins. These results strongly indicate that the 4C7 protein should be classified into the sialyltransferase family.Figure 2The nucleotide and its deduced amino acid sequences of clone 4C7.

As shown in Fig. 3, both 3LL-HK46 and 3LL-ST28 cells exhibited GM3 synthase activity only when the cells were transfected with pCEV4C7. An additional band with the same Rf value as ganglioside GT3 was observed when transfected 3LL-ST28 cells were used as the enzyme source (Fig. 3, lane 4), which suggests that GD3 synthase might catalyze the synthesis of ganglioside GT3. It is controversial whether or not GD3 synthase is identical with GT3 synthase (9Nara K. Watanabe Y. Kawashima I. Tai T. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Eur. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4448-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat brain (31Preuss U. Gu X. Gu T. Yu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26273-26278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the substrate specificity of the 4C7 product was found to be highly restricted to lactosylceramide as the acceptor. 2A. Ishii, K. Makino, C. Nakamura, and M. Saito, manuscript in preparation. It has not yet been determined whether the 4C7 product is active toward free lactose or N- and O-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins as substrates. However, this strict acceptor specificity for lactosylceramide, and not for the nonreducing terminal galactose moieties of other glycosphingolipids tested, together with previous reports on the substrate specificity of purified GM3synthase, suggest the existence of isozymes having broader substrate specificity than the 4C7 gene product. The glycosphingolipid composition in clone 4C7-transfected 3LL-HK46 cells was analyzed by TLC, and it was clearly demonstrated that the de novosynthesis of GM3 molecules occurred in the transfected cells, along with an observable decrease in neutral lactosylceramide. 2A. Ishii, K. Makino, C. Nakamura, and M. Saito, manuscript in preparation. The hydropathy plot (Fig. 2 B) showed three or four strongly hydrophobic segments in and around sialylmotif S near the C terminus of the enzyme. These results suggest that the enzyme might be anchored to the lumenal side of the Golgi membrane. The expression of GM3 synthase in human tissues was assessed by Northern blot analyses. A major transcript 2.4 kilobases in size was detected at various level in all human tissues tested; it was highly expressed in brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and testis, whereas it was very weakly expressed in liver, kidney, pancreas, and colon. In some tissues, a minor band of 7 kilobases was detected (Fig. 4 A). To characterize in more detail the gene expression of GM3synthase in brain, Northern blotting analysis of various parts of the human brain was performed with the same probe. As shown in Fig. 4 B, GM3 synthase mRNA was widely distributed in human brain, but slightly elevated expression was observed in the cerebral cortex, temporal lobe, and putamen. This study describes the molecular cloning of a new human sialyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of ganglioside GM3. In our expression cloning, it was found that newly synthesized ganglioside GM3 was barely detectable with anti-GM3 antibody M2590 on the surface of transfected 3LL-HK46 cells in FACS analysis (Fig. 1). This problem was overcome by co-transfecting or introducing in advance the GD3 synthase cDNA; the final product ganglioside GD3 was easily detected using its specific antibody R24 (Fig. 1). Such modifications of expression cloning are generally useful, and use of an analogous modification has also been reported (20Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10455-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The human GM3 synthase cDNA cloned in the present study and its product showed some characteristics strikingly different from those of the other sialyltransferases so far cloned. An invariant aspartic acid residue was found in the C-terminal region of the sialylmotif L of all the other sialyltransferases (Fig. 2 C). This acidic amino acid residue was substituted by the basic amino acid (His) in GM3 synthetic sialyltransferase. More interestingly, this amino acid replacement is conserved in the GM3 synthases of mouse, rat, and green monkey origins. 3K. Matsuda, A. Ishii, and M. Saito, manuscript in preparation. Thus, this replacement must be critically relevant to the GM3 synthetic activity. It is, however, still unclear how this substitution effects the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate(s) and whether or not the substitution is limited to GM3 synthases of mammalian origin. Among all the glycosphingolipids tested, only lactosylceramide could serve as an acceptor for the sialylation catalyzed by the cloned human GM3 synthase. In contrast, it has been reported that the purified GM3 synthase from rat liver exhibited a broader substrate specificity (27Melkerson-Watson L.J. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4448-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the enzyme from rat brain could utilize both galactosylceramide and asialoganglioside GM2(GA2) as acceptors as well as lactosylceramide (31Preuss U. Gu X. Gu T. Yu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26273-26278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we cannot rule out differences in the purity of the enzyme preparations, these discrepancies may imply the existence of isozymes with different substrate specificities for glycosphingolipids. Northern analysis indicated that the human GM3 synthase gene was expressed in a tissue-specific manner (Fig. 4 A). The high expression of GM3 synthase messenger RNA in brain (Fig. 4 B) may be responsible for the abundance in brain of GM3 itself and of other gangliosides with more complex oligosaccharide chains, which might be related to axonal (32Schwarz A.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The expression of GM3 synthase was enhanced by the treatment of HL-60 and U937 cells with the differentiation inducer TPA (4Nojiri H. Takaku F. Terui Y. Miura Y. Saito M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although transcriptional regulation of GM3 synthase has not yet been demonstrated, elucidation of the mechanisms controlling expression of the GM3 synthase gene should yield insight into the mechanism(s) by which leukemic cells can be induced to differentiate into monocytoids.

To explore the ability of specific PTPs to regulate cell signaling pathways initiated by stimulation of growth factor receptors, we expressed the receptor-like PTP, PTPα, in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. These cells express high levels of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and proliferate in response to the autocrine production of transforming growth factor-α. Conversely, EGF stimulation of A431 cells in vitro leads to growth inhibition and triggers the rapid detachment of these cells from the substratum. Although PTPα expression did not alter the growth characteristics of either unstimulated or EGF-stimulated cells, this phosphatase was associated with increased cell-substratum adhesion. Furthermore, PTPα-expressing A431 cells were strikingly resistant to EGF-induced cell rounding. Overexpression of PTPα in A431 cells was associated with the dephosphorylation/activation of specific Src family kinases, suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed alteration in A431 cell-substratum adhesion. Src kinase activation was dependent on the D1 catalytic subunit of PTPα, and there was evidence of association between PTPα and Src kinase(s). PTPα expression also led to increased association of Src kinase with the integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK. In addition, paxillin, a Src and/or pp125FAK substrate, displayed increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in PTPα-expressing cells and was associated with elevated amounts of Csk. In view of these alterations in focal adhesion-associated molecules in PTPα-expressing A431 cells, as well as the changes in adhesion demonstrated by these cells, we propose that PTPα may have a role in regulating cell-substratum adhesion.

Protein phosphorylation also controls cytoskeleton organization during cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM)1 or to other cells during processes such as morphogenesis, cell migration, differentiation, and metastases (3Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6355) Google Scholar). Indeed, similar to growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction, engagement of cell adhesion molecules is followed by the rapid activation of specific protein tyrosine kinases and the ensuing assembly of multimeric protein complexes at sites of cell adhesion (4Schwartz M.T. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Moreover, many of the signal transduction molecules activated or phosphorylated in response to ligand binding to growth factor receptors are also regulated by cell adhesion (5Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Due to their ability to regulate protein phosphotyrosine levels, PTPs are undoubtedly essential to such processes as proliferation, differentiation, and cell adhesion (7Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K.

However, the roles of specific PTPs in the regulation of growth factor receptor initiated signal transduction events and cell adhesion remain poorly understood. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of the receptor-like phosphatase PTPα to regulate EGF-receptor-dependent cell signaling processes in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. Structurally, the widely expressed PTPα is composed of a heavilyN- and O-glycosylated 123- or 132-residue alternatively spliced extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and two tandem cytoplasmic phosphatase domains, as is characteristic of the majority of receptor-like PTPs (10Jirik F.R.

These cells express high levels of the EGF receptor on their surface (0.5–3.0 × 106/cell) (14Gill G.N. Lazar C.S. Nature. 1981; 293: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and proliferate in response to autocrine production of transforming growth factor α (15Van de Vijver M. Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although EGF enhances the growth of A431 cell-derived tumors in nude mice, when grown as a monolayer in culture, these cells, similar to squamous cell carcinoma cell lines overexpressing EGF receptors, are inhibited by high concentrations of EGF (14Gill G.N.

Rikimaru K. Horikoshi M. Enomoto S. Kuroki T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1648-1653PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, EGF stimulation of A431 cells causes dramatic change in cell morphology, including extensive membrane ruffling, filipodia extension, and changes in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. These processes culminate in the rounding-up and retraction of these cells from the substratum (22Chinkers M. McKanna J.A. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 23Schlessinger J. Geiger B. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 134: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, A431 cells have proven invaluable to studies of cell growth, differentiation, and cell adhesion as regulated by receptor tyrosine kinase activity. We found that PTPα expression in A431 cells led to a PTPα D1-dependent increase in cell-substratum adhesion and inhibited EGF-induced cell rounding and lift-off. This PTPα-dependent phenotype was not restricted to EGF stimulated A431 cells, as PTPα expression in BHK-IR cells also led to resistance of these cells to insulin-induced cell rounding and detachment from the substratum. These results suggest that PTPα might be capable of regulating the activities of molecules involved in cell-substratum adhesion. In keeping with this hypothesis, we found that in A431 cells PTPα could be co-immunoprecipitated with Src kinase(s). PTPα expression was also associated with the dephosphorylation and/or activation of specific Src kinases. Moreover, Src kinases immunoprecipitated from PTPα-expressing A431 cells were associated with elevated levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a molecule activated by stimuli such as integrin-dependent cell adhesion to the substratum, v-src transformation, and growth factor or neuropeptide stimulation (reviewed in Ref. 25Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). PTPα expression was also associated with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a protein localized to focal adhesions and a putative substrate of FAK and/or Src kinases (26Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J.

Paxillin obtained from PTPα-expressing cells was complexed with increased levels of Csk, suggesting a possible feedback loop in the regulation of Src activity in these cells and supporting previous observations linking the activation of Src kinases with changes in the intracellular localization of Csk (29Sabe H. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4706-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell.

The dephosphorylation of Src kinases, together with the observed PTPα D1-dependent changes in cell adhesion and the tyrosine phosphorylation and association of FAK and paxillin with Src and Csk kinases, support the hypothesis that PTPα may be involved in the regulation of cell-substratum adhesion. A431 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The PTPα cDNA was obtained from a human HepG2 cell line cDNA library (Stratagene) as described previously (10Jirik F.R. Janzen N.M. Melhado I.G. Harder K.W.

The wild type and catalytically inactive forms of PTPα (containing a cysteine-to-alanine mutation at residue 433 within the first catalytic domain, D1 C433A) were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pBCMGNeo. This vector contains the cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter and 79% of the bovine papilloma virus genome, allowing episomal replication of transfected plasmids (34Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into A431 cells by electroporation, and G418 resistant clones were selected. The BHK cell line overexpressing the human insulin receptor (BHK-IR) (35Anderson A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schaffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. Moller N.P.H. J. Biol.

This cell line was used to establish stable BHK-IR cell lines overexpressing PTPα in a functionally dependent way as described previously (36Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A.

BHK-IR/PTPα cells were maintained in complete medium in the presence of 100 nm insulin. PTPα-specific antibodies were produced by immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with recombinant PTPα cytoplasmic domain containing residues 167–793 (PTPα-2) or with N-terminal cysteine-linked keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated synthetic peptides (37Ziltener H.J. Clark-Lewis I. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1099-1104PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to amino acids 20–60 within the extracellular domain of PTPα (PTPα-ext), or residues 512–558, corresponding to the region separating the two catalytic domains (PTPα-1). Antibodies were affinity purified on thiol-Sepharose peptide or CNBr-Sepharose recombinant PTPα specific affinity columns. The anti-Src mAb 327 (provided by J. Brugge, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals), anti-Fyn mAb (provided by R. Perlmutter, University of Washington, Seattle, WA), anti-Yes antiserum (from J. Bolen, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Princeton, NJ), and anti-Csk antiserum (from J. Cooper and B. W. Howell, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) were used to immunoprecipitate each kinase. The antibody SRC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), specific for the C-terminal peptide sequence 509–533 of Src and the conserved sequences of Fyn and Yes, was also used to immunoprecipitate and immunoblot Src, Fyn, and Yes. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10), paxillin, FAK, and Src (GD11) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Lyn kinase antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. A431 cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmsoybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 μm leupeptin. Insoluble cellular debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentrations were estimated with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Src kinase activity from transfected A431 clones was assessed by autokinase and enolase assays. Src kinase was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cell lysate with 1 μg of mAb 327. Immune complexes were collected with 75 μl of a 30% slurry of rabbit anti-mouse IgG preabsorbed protein A-Sepharose. Beads were washed in cell lysis buffer, radioimmune precipitation buffer (lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS), and then kinase buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MnCl2, and 10 μm vanadate) before resuspension in kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmole) with or without 10 μg of acid-denatured enolase. Kinase assays were performed at 25 °C for 15 min before termination by addition of 2× Laemmli buffer. 50% of each immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted with anti-Src antiserum (GD11) to ensure that equal quantities of Src were used in each assay. Regions corresponding to the entire cytoplasmic domain of PTPα (PTPα-D1+D2, amino acids 167–793), the first catalytic domain (PTPα-D1, amino acids 167–555), and the C-terminal phosphatase domain (PTPα-D2, amino acids 510–793), were polymerase chain reaction-amplified with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The cDNA sequence of each PTPα fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing before subcloning into pGex 2T-tag, a modified pGex 2T plasmid, containing an expanded polylinker and sequence encoding the 10-residue hemagglutinin epitope tag derived from influenza virus (38Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K.H. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins generates proteins containing the hemagglutinin epitope at the N terminus. Luria broth cultures (500 ml) of UT5600 bacteria (New England Biolabs) containing the various pGex plasmids were grown to absorbance 0.6–0.9 at 37 °C. Cells were then shifted to 26 °C and induced overnight with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were sedimented and lysed by sonication in buffer composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triton X-100 was then added to 1% final concentration, and cellular debris were removed by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 ×g. The supernatant was removed and incubated with 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. The beads were thoroughly washed before cleavage in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μl of thrombin (400 μg/ml). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% before storage at −80 °C. Phosphatase activity was determined using the malachite green microtiter plate (MGMP) phosphatase assay to detect the release of phosphate from phosphotyrosine-containing synthetic peptides as described previously (38Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K.H. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant PTPα or PTPα immunoprecipitated directly from A431 cell lysates was incubated with phosphopeptides in buffer containing 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 0.1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Enzyme reactions were carried out in half-volume microtiter plates (Costar) in a final volume of 25 μl for the indicated times. Phosphatase reactions were terminated and free phosphate detected by addition of 100 μl of malachite green solution to each well. Changes in absorbance at 620 nm of each well were measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader and phosphate release was determined by comparison to a standard curve (38Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K.H. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides Src-527YTSTEPQpYQPGENL and CSF-1 receptor 708YIHLEKKpYVRRDSG were synthesized as described previously (38Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K.H. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was detected using the MGMP assay as above. Passage number 10 or less control vector alone-transfected and PTPα-overexpressing A431 cell lines were plated at 104 cells/well in quadruplicate in 96-well plates. EGF was added, and cell proliferation was determined 4 days later by WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate) assay (Boehringer Mannheim). The effect of PTPα expression on the growth characteristics of BHK-IR cells was analyzed by comparing growth curves obtained with and without insulin as described previously (36Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In short, five 6-well plates were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, the number of adherent cells per well was determined in one plate (day 0). Three wells in each of the remaining four plates then received insulin at a final concentration of 100 nm (+ insulin) with the other three wells serving as controls (− insulin). The number of adherent cells was determined in one plate after a further 24 h of incubation (day 1), whereas the remaining plates were washed thoroughly three times to remove nonadherent cells. Fresh medium with and without insulin was added. This procedure was repeated every 24 h for the next three days. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. During routine passaging of PTPα-overexpressing A431 clones, we observed that these cells were resistant to removal from the substratum by low concentrations of trypsin (0.05%). To quantitate this characteristic, an adhesion assay was developed to assess cell-substratum adhesion. Cells containing vector alone, PTPα, or PTPα (D1 C433A) were plated in 96-well flat-bottom plates in quadruplicate at 104 cells/well. Cells were allowed to adhere and spread in serum-containing medium to 75–85% confluency (1–2 days). Medium was then carefully removed so as not to disturb the cell monolayer, and the cells were gently washed 3–5 times with 100 μl of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS/well/wash over a period of 20–30 min. During this treatment, control cells rounded and lifted off the substratum in a manner that was dependent on the number and duration of the PBS washes. To be able to discern the lower adherence of control and PTPα (D1 C433A)-transfected A431 cells, the number and duration of PBS washes was reduced. Wash solutions were then discarded, and 100 μl of culture medium was added to each well. One hour later, 25 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (5 mg/ml) was added, and the cells remaining in each well were stained for 2.5 h. Medium was then carefully removed, 100 μl of Me2SO was added to each well to dissolve the precipitated 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide crystals, and the absorbance at 550 nm was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay allowed linear detection of between 1000 and 70,000 cells/well. The absorbance of each well was compared with untreated wells to determine the percentage of cells removed by each washing protocol. For each cell line, the percentage difference in absorbance was found to be equivalent to the percentage of cells removed. To analyze adherence changes in response to agents known to alter cell-substratum adhesion, EGF (100 ng/ml), pervanadate (100 μm vanadate, 2 mmH2O2), and EDTA (10 mm) were added to the PBS washes, and the cells were treated as above. Lysates from A431 cells containing vector alone or from PTPα-expressing or PTPα (D1 C433A)-expressing cells were incubated for 1 h with Src Tyr527phosphopeptide immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose. Beads were thoroughly washed in cell lysis buffer before resuspension in Laemmli buffer. Src family kinases precipitated by the beads were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Duralose membrane (Stratagene) and immunoblotted with SRC2 antisera or the Src-specific antibody (GD11). Immobilized nonphosphorylated Src Tyr527 peptide was used as a control. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antiserum and the ECL system (Amersham). To investigate the effects of PTPα expression, A431 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the 123-residue extracellular domain-containing isoform of PTPα, as well as a catalytically inactive mutant form of PTPα (PTPα D1 C433A), using the expression vector pBCMGNeo (34Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were obtained with similar frequency in all three instances. Three vector alone transfected control A431 lines and 10 clones of PTPα-transfected and PTPα (D1 C433A)-transfected cells were examined for PTPα expression. Three clones of each, in the case of PTPα and PTPα (D1 C433A) transfectants, were then selected based on their having similar levels of PTPα expression. Results presented are representative examples of each group of clones. A431 cells normally express relatively low levels of endogenous PTPα (Fig. 1 A). PTPα expression was determined by immunoblot analysis of A431 total cell lysates with polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies (anti-PTPα-1) (Fig. 1 A) or with anti-recombinant PTPα-specific antibodies (anti-PTPα-2) (data not shown). Both of these antibodies recognized proteins of approximately 130–150, 100, 85, and 68 kDa. N- and O-glycosylation of the predicted 85-kDa PTPα polypeptide chain results in a mature protein of between 130 and 150 kDa (11Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 100-kDa form of PTPα, observed in immunoblots of lysates derived from PTPα-expressing cells (Fig. 1 A), was also immunoprecipitated from these lysates with antibodies specific for the extracellular region of PTPα (Fig. 1 B) and likely corresponds to an N-glycosylated precursor of the larger form. This is in agreement with Daum et al. (11Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that antibodies against baculovirus-expressed PTPα recognized a glycosylation-dependent epitope in the extracellular domain of PTPα. The anti-PTPα-extracellular domain antibodies used in our study were generated against residues 20–60 of the extracellular domain, a region containing multiple potentialN- and O-glycosylated residues. Thus, the PTP-extracellular domain antiserum likely recognized an incompletely glycosylated PTPα species. This antibody, however, bound to the surface of PTPα-overexpressing cells with little or no binding observed to vector alone transfected control cells, demonstrating PTPα cell-surface expression in the transfected clones (data not shown). To assess whether PTPα expression would alter the EGF-induced growth inhibition response of A431 cells, we treated vector alone control cells and PTPα-transfected clones with various concentrations of EGF. Cell numbers were then determined by WST-1 assay (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Maximal inhibition of vector control transfected cell growth was observed at EGF concentrations between 5–10 ng/ml (Fig. 2 A). The response of two PTPα-expressing A431 clones (PTPα-1 and PTPα-2) to EGF are shown in Fig. 2 A. The expression of PTPα in A431 cells was unable to rescue these cells from the growth inhibitory effects of EGF. However, a dramatic change in cell morphology was evident following exposure of A431 cells to EGF in serum-free conditions. Whereas EGF caused control A431 cells to round-up and lift-off the substratum within 5–10 min (Fig. 2, B and C, rounded phase-bright cells in A431-Ctr 1 and A431-Ctr 2 EGF-treated panels) clones expressing PTPα remained adherent and spread following exposure to EGF (Fig. 2, B and C, clones PTPα-1 and PTPα-3). This phenotype was observed in all of the PTPα-expressing clones and was dependent on the catalytic activity of PTPα D1 (data not shown). A previously established BHK-IR cell line (35Anderson A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schaffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. Moller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) responds to insulin stimulation with growth inhibition, cell rounding, and detachment from the substratum of cell culture dishes (36Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These cells round up quickly after addition of insulin, with detachment being detectable as early as 1 h after the addition of insulin. The optimal insulin concentration required to bring about this effect was approximately 100 nm, with the half-maximal effect being observed at a concentration of approximately 1 nm. In contrast, stable BHK-IR cell lines overexpressing PTPα failed to round up and remained attac"

The genetic analysis of the late steps of cobalamin (Cbl)1 biosynthesis (also known as nucleotide loop assembly) in Salmonella typhimurium(1Rondon M.R. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. & Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has raised important questions about the biochemical capabilities of the enzymes involved (2Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chen P. Ailion M. Weyand N. Roth J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific step of the nucleotide loop assembly pathway that we address in this paper is the activation of the lower ligand base 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (Me2Bza). This step is catalyzed by the CobT enzyme, which converts Me2Bza to its 5′-mononucleotide (also known as α-ribazole-5′-phosphate) by transferring the phosphoribosyl group from NaMN to Me2Bza (Fig. 1) (2Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As predicted by the biochemistry of the CobT reaction, cobalamin biosynthesis in mutants lacking CobT can be restored by providing α-ribazole-5′-phosphate in the medium (4Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). What was unexpected, however, was the finding that all previously reported Me2Bza auxotrophs (5Escalante-Semerena J.C. Johnson M.G. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 24-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were alleles of cobT (2Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including insertions that eliminated CobT completely from cell-free extracts (6Trzebiatowski J.R. BacteriologyPh.D. thesis. University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI1998Google Scholar). This phenotype was difficult to explain in light of the documented biochemical activity of CobT as the NaMN:Me2Bza phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) (EC 2.4.2.21) (4Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This finding basically said that increasing the substrate for CobT would circumvent the lack of this enzyme. To help explain this paradox, we postulated the existence of an alternative enzyme that could perform the CobT reaction, with the qualification that such an enzyme would have less affinity for Me2Bza than CobT to explain the requirement for additional Me2Bza (2Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

All genetic crosses were performed with the high transducing mutant phage P22 HT105 int-201 (8Schmieger H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1971; 100: 378-381Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9Schmieger H. Bakhaus H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 120: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (7Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 201-208Google Scholar). Crosses that selected for kanamycin-resistant (Kmr) or chloramphenicol-resistant (Cmr) transductants were first preincubated nonselectively for 2 h at 30 °C without shaking (10O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations in cobB were isolated by localized chemical mutagenesis using hydroxylamine as described elsewhere (7Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 201-208Google Scholar, 11Hong J.-S. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A P22 phage lysate grown on strain JE2761 was mutagenized for 51 h which achieved an ∼2 log reduction of the lysate titer from 2.5 × 1011 to 2.6 × 109 (pfu/ml). Mutagenized lysate was used as donor to transduce strain JE1857 (cobT109::MudJ) to chloramphenicol resistance on NB medium containing Cm (20 μg/ml) and EGTA (10 mm). Transductants were replica-printed onto E minimal medium (12Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing glucose and either dicyanocobinamide ((CN)2Cbi, 20 nm) and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (Me2Bza, 300 μm) or cyano-cobalamin (CNCbl), 20 nm. cobB mutants were identified by their failure to grow on medium containing (CN)2Cbi and Me2Bza and by their growth on medium containing CNCbl,i.e. a nucleotide loop assembly (Nla−)phenotype. The propionate (Prp) phenotype of cobB mutants was assessed as described elsewhere (13Hammelman T.A. O'Toole G.A. Trzebiatowski J.R. Tsang A.W. Rank D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 233-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tsang A.W. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7016-7019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transposable elements inserted in cobB were isolated. One Tn10d(Tc) element inserted in cobB was isolated from a pool of strains (∼80,000) each of which was assumed to carry one Tn10d(Tc) element inserted randomly in the genome. P22 phage grown on this pool was used as donor to transduce strain JE1857 (cobT109::MudJ) to tetracycline (Tc) resistance on NB medium containing Tc (20 μg/ml) and CaCl2 (1 mm). Strain JE2445 carrying insertioncobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) was identified as described above for the point mutants. A similar strategy was used to isolate MudJ (Casadaban's MudI1734 (15Castilho B.A. Olfson P. Casadaban M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 488-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) elements inserted in cobB. For this purpose a phage lysate grown on a pool of strains (∼50,000) each carrying a MudJ element in their genome was used as donor to transduce strain JE1856 (cobT111::Tn10d(Tc)) to kanamycin resistance on NB medium containing Km (50 μg/ml) and EGTA (10 mm). Replica printing to E minimal medium with glucose and appropriate supplements (see above) was used to identify strains carrying cobB::MudJ insertions. Four independently isolated mutants displaying Kmr Tcr and nucleotide loop assembly− phenotypes were obtained. Deletions of cobB were isolated in vivo by the method of Bochner et al. (16Bochner B.R. Huang H.-C. Schieven G.L. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Maloy and Nunn (17Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 0.3-ml sample from an overnight culture of strain JE2501 (cobT109::MudJcobB1176::Tn10d(Tc)) grown in NB medium containing tetracycline was spread on freshly prepared Bochner plates and incubated 12–16 h at 42 °C. Tc-sensitive (Tcs) and kanamycin-resistant (Kmr) clones that retained the inability to grow on minimal medium containing (CN)2Cbi and Me2Bza were assumed to carry a deletion of cobB. The extent of the deletions was not determined. The general location of cobB in the chromosome was determined by using the Mud-P22 mapping kit of Benson and Goldman (18Benson N.R. Goldman B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schwarz J.J. Berget P.B. Genetics. 1989; 121: 635-649PubMed Google Scholar). Strain JE2445 was grown in NB medium containing Tc and plated on freshly prepared Bochner plates (16Bochner B.R. Huang H.-C. Schieven G.L. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to increase the frequency of isolation of Tcs strains. Phage P22 lysates were prepared from a collection of 72 strains each containing one MudP or MudQ insertion in a known site of the chromosome. Lysates were prepared after mitomycin C induction as reported (20Youderian P. Sugiono P. Brewer K.L. Higgins N.P. Elliott T. Genetics. 1988; 118: 581-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and delivered onto plates by means of a multiprong device. Each prong delivered approximately 10 μl of lysate. A more accurate location of cobB was obtained by 2- and 3-factor crosses with genetic markers within the region suggested by the Mud-P22 mapping experiments to contain cobB. Separate 2-factor crosses were performed using phage lysates grown on strain TN2757 (leuBCD485 pepT7::MudJ oxrB + zhb-1624::Tn10d(Tc)) as donor and strain JE2445 (cobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) as recipient, selecting for Kmr transductants, patching 500 transductants on NB, Km, EGTA, and replica-printing onto NB, Km, Tc, EGTA, and NB, Km plates to assess the frequency of loss of the cobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) element. All strains used for 3-factor crosses carried mutations metE205 ara-9 and were derived from strain TR6583. E minimal medium containing glucose (11 mm) was used in all crosses (12Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (CN)2Cbi and CNCbl were at concentrations described above. The direction of transcription of cobB was determined to be clockwise by the method of Hughes and Roth (21Hughes K.T. Roth J.R. Genetics. 1985; 109: 263-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (22Escalante-Semerena J.C. Suh S.-J. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 273-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The titer of phage lysates (pfu/ml) grown on the appropriate strains was determined as described (7Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 201-208Google Scholar). The cobB1206::MudJ element was converted to cobB1206::MudA as reported (15Castilho B.A. Olfson P. Casadaban M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 488-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to increase the homology between insertions and increase the frequency of recombination between co-infecting Mud elements.cobT mutant JE1857 (cobT cobB + his +) was co-infected with phage lysates grown on JE3231 (cobB1206::MudA) and JE1391 (hisF9951::MudA) or JE1392 (hisF9954::MudA) each at an approximate multiplicity of infection of 1. Ampicillin-resistant (Apr) transductants were selected on NB medium containing Ap (30 μg/ml), incubated overnight at 37 °C, and replica-printed to E minimal medium containing glucose (11 mm) as carbon/energy source and methionine (0.5 mm). A plasmid carrying the wild-type allele of cobB was recovered from a sized pool of Sau3A fragments (∼9 kb) obtained by partial digestion of the S. typhimurium. The Sau3A fragments were cloned into the BamHI site of the tetA gene of plasmid pBR328 (kindly provided by C. G. Miller, University of Illinois, Urbana). This plasmid is referred to hereafter as pCOBB1, and it is shown in Fig. 2. Phage P22 grown on the clone bank was used to transduce strain JE2607 (cobB1176::Tn10d(Tc)cobT109::MudJ recA1) to Cm resistance on NB, Cm, and EGTA medium. Cmr transductants were replica-printed to E minimal medium supplemented with glucose, (CN)2Cbi, Me2Bza, Cm, and EGTA. Transductants able to grow on this medium were rid of phage (23Chan R.K. Botstein D. Watanabe T. Ogata Y. Virology. 1972; 50: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from strains carrying putative complementing plasmids using a Magic Mini-Prep KitTM (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA was electroporated into strain JE2607 to verify that complementation of the phenotype correlated with inheritance of the plasmid. Conditions for electroporation of plasmids into S. typhimurium LT2 were as reported (24O'Toole G.A. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26503-26511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying cobB + were identified by their ability to grow on minimal medium supplemented with (CN)2Cbi and Me2Bza. An ∼5.5-kb EcoRI fragment of plasmid pCOBB1 was cloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pSU19 (25Martı́nez E. Bartolome B. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI. This plasmid complemented strain JE2607. A derivative of plasmid pCOBB2 carrying the cobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) element was constructed by transduction. Phage P22 grown on strain JE2445 (cobB1176::Tn10d(Tc)) was used to transduce strain JE2600 (DEL1184cobB/pCOBB2cobB +) to Tc resistance. Insertion of thecobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) element intocobB on the plasmid prevented strain JE2600 from growing on minimal medium containing (CN)2Cbi and Me2Bza. The new plasmid carrying thecobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) allele is referred to as plasmid pCOBB3. An ∼1.8-kb SalI fragment of plasmid pCOBB2 was cloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pSU19 cut with SalI. This plasmid complemented strain JE2607. Plasmid pCOBB4 was digested withSalI and NdeI. The resulting ∼1.3-kb fragment was cloned into plasmid pSU19 cut with the same enzymes. The NdeI—NruI fragment of plasmid pCOBB5 (∼1 kb) was cloned into the overexpression vector pT7-7 cut with the same enzymes. Plasmid pCOBB6 (cobB +) was moved by electroporation into strain JE2587 which carried plasmid pGP1-2 (T7 rpo +). The resulting strain, JE4349, was grown at 30 °C in LB broth containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml ampicillin to a cell density of ∼2 × 108 colony-forming units/ml. Cultures were then incubated for 2 h in a 42 °C water bath with shaking, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. One-liter cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker (LabLine Instruments, Melrose, IL) rotating at 220 rpm; cultures were cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,415 × g, Sorvall RC-5B, GSA rotor; Dupont, Wilmington, DE) at 4 °C for 10 min. Two oligonucleotide primers complementary to each end of the tetA gene were used to sequence the flanking regions of the cobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) element. Primer 1 was 5′-TCAACAGCTCGCATGCATAT-3′, and primer 2 was 5′-TGAGCAGCAGTCGCAGCGAG-3′. Plasmid pCOBB4 DNA was isolated fromE. coli strain DH5αF′ using Promega's Wizard Mini-Prep KitTM (Promega, Madison, WI). Sanger's dideoxy sequencing method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) was used to sequence using Sequenase kit version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) as per manufacturer's directions. Additional primers were designed as the sequence flanking thecobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) element was obtained. This strategy was used to obtain the entire sequence of the region containing cobB. The nucleotide sequence of cobB is available from GenBankTM under the accession number U89687. Two-liter cultures of strain JE4349 grown under overexpression conditions (see above) were harvested by centrifugation (10,415 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min with a Sorvall GSA rotor and RC-5B refrigerated centrifuge (DuPont). Cell-free extracts were obtained by sonication using a Sonic Dismembrator model 550 (Fisher). For this purpose, cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, and sonicated twice at 50% duty at a setting of 3 for 5 min. Cell-free extracts were allowed to cool for 2 min on ice after the first 5-min sonication period. Cell debris was discarded by centrifugation at 43,140 ×g at 4 °C using a Sorvall SS34 rotor (DuPont). In vitro experimental conditions described by Trzebiatowski and Escalante-Semerena (4Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for assaying the activity of the CobT protein were used to test for PRTase activity in cell-free extracts enriched for CobB. Cell-free extracts containing high amounts of the CobB enzyme (Fig. 4) were obtained from strain JE4349, a strain carrying a deletion of cobT and the overexpression plasmid pCOBB6. The typical reaction mixture contained NaMN (20 nmol) [2-14C]Me2Bza (40 nmol, specific activity = 31.5 μCi/μmol) glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10, crude cell-free extract (∼63 μg of protein) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and terminated by heating to 100 °C for 10 min. Denatured protein was pelleted at room temperature at 4,800 × g for 5 min in a Marathon 13K/M microcentrifuge. Products and reagents in the mixture were resolved by TLC on silica using a CHCl3:MeOH (3:2) solvent system. The product of the reaction, α-ribazole-5′-phosphate, was retained at the origin and was clearly separated from radiolabeled Me2Bza (R F = 0.86) (data not shown). Detection and quantitation of radiolabeled α-ribazole-5′-phosphate was performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager model 4451 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein concentrations were determined by the methods of Kunitz (27Kunitz M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 35: 423-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Protein mixtures were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli system (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) (30Sasse J. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 10.6.1-10.6.8Google Scholar). In these bioassays, growth of the indicator strain JE2607cobB1176::Tn10d(Tc)cobT109::MudJ) depended on the activity of the Cbl-dependent methionine synthase (MetH) enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine to methionine (31Taylor R.T. Weissbach H. Enzymes. 1973; 9: 121-165Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Cbl in strain JE2607 was only restored when the medium was supplemented with α-ribazole-5′-phosphate, Cbl, or methionine. An overnight culture of strain JE2607 grown in nutrient broth was used to test if CobB could synthesize α-ribazole-5′-phosphate from NaMN and Me2Bza in vitro. Cells were resuspended in 3 ml of 0.7% molten agar and overlaid on E minimal glucose medium (12Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose (11 mm) and (CN)2Cbi (20 nm). A 15-μl sample of the reaction mixture was applied directly onto the overlay, and the plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C. A 5-μl sample of a 0.015 mm CNCbl stock solution (i.e. 75 pmol) was applied elsewhere on the plate as positive control; a 5-μl sample of a 60 mm stock solution of Me2Bza (i.e. 300 nmol) was applied onto the overlay as negative control. A total of 30 cobBmutants were isolated. Of these, 10 carried independently isolatedcobB deletions, 1 carried acobB::Tn10d(Tc) insertion, 4 carried acobB::MudJ insertion, and 15 carried independently isolated, hydroxylamine-generated point mutations. Data presented in Table II illustrate the effect of cobB mutations on Cbl-dependent growth of cobT mutants of S. typhimurium. Unlike strain JE1857 (cobB + cobT −), strain JE2501 (cobB− cobT−) was unable to synthesize Cbl from (CN)2Cbi and Me2Bza, hence it became a Cbl auxotroph. The fact that strains with this phenotype were isolated strongly supported our hypothesis for the existence of an alternative phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that can compensate for the lack of CobT in the assembly of the nucleotide loop of cobalamin in cobT mutants (2Trzebiatowski J.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3568-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When thecobB1176::Tn10d(Tc) mutation was introduced into the Cbl-proficient strain TR6583 (cbi + cob +), the resulting strain JE2445 was still able to synthesize Cbl from (CN)2Cbi in the absence of exogenous Me2Bza. This result suggested that cobB function may only be required for AdoCbl biosynthesis under some physiological conditions. We noted, however, a <2-fold but reproducible effect of a mutation in cobB on the doubling time of cultures of cobBmutants even when Cbl was provided in the medium (compare the doubling times of strains JE2445 and TR6583, Table II).Table IIPhenotypes of cobB mutantsStrainRelevant genotypeDoubling time (min) on min"
https://openalex.org/W2013289541,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl) transferase (ADPRT) is a nuclear protein that modifies proteins by forming and attaching to them poly(ADP-ribose) chains. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation represents an event of major importance in perturbed cell nuclei and participates in the regulation of fundamental processes including DNA repair and transcription. Although ADPRT serves as a positive cofactor of transcription, initiation of its catalytic activity may cause repression of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. It is demonstrated here that ADPRT-dependent silencing of transcription involves ADP-ribosylation of the TATA-binding protein. This modification occurs only if poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is initiated before TATA-binding protein has bound to DNA and thereby prevents formation of active transcription complexes. Specific DNA binding of other transcription factors including Yin Yang 1, p53, NFκB, Sp1, and CREB but not c-Jun or AP-2 is similarly affected. After assembly of transcription complexes initiation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation does not influence DNA binding of transcription factors. Accordingly, if bound to DNA, transcription factors are inaccessible to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Thus, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation prevents binding of transcription factors to DNA, whereas binding to DNA prevents their modification. Considering its ability to detect DNA strand breaks and stimulate DNA repair, it is proposed that ADPRT serves as a molecular switch between transcription and repair of DNA to avoid expression of damaged genes.

Therefore, after genotoxic treatment of mammalian cells, the greatly enhanced activity of ADPRT may cause depletion of the intracellular NAD+ pool (4Durkacz B.W. Omidiji O. Gray D.A. Shall S. Nature. 1980; 283: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). It was concluded that this effect is part of a defense mechanism, because DNA repair after γ-irradiation is stimulated by ADPRT activity (5Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 6Molinete M. Vermeulen W. Bürkle A. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Küpper H. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The target proteins of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation include the enzyme itself as well as a limited number of nuclear proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 131: 127-174PubMed Google Scholar). ADPRT has also been shown to participate in the regulation of transcription and appears to exert a dual function. On the one hand, the active component of transcription factor IIC was identified as the enzyme ADPRT (7Matsui T. Segall J. Weil P.A. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11992-11996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Slattery E. Dignam J.D. Matsui M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5955-5959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of its substrate, NAD+, ADPRT has been demonstrated to be an enhancer of activator-dependent transcription (9Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was reported recently that protein modification with poly(ADP-ribose) was an efficient means of reversibly silencing general polymerase II-dependent transcription (9Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Consequently, the activating or repressing influence of ADPRT on transcription depends on the catalytic activity of this enzyme and appears to be mediated by direct interactions with basal and gene-specific transcription factors. Transcription factors TFIIF (11Rawling J.M. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and p53 (12Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have been reported to be acceptors of poly(ADP-ribose) chains. Transcription factors YY1 and Oct-1 were found to tightly associate with ADPRT (13Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Babich V. Kropotov A. Tomilin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Nie J. Sakamoto S. Song D. Qu Z. Ota K. Taniguchi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because silencing of transcription by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (9Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was observed in a system requiring only the basal transcriptional complex, the influence of ADPRT on gene expression may be more general rather than restricted to a small number of genes. In the present study the molecular mechanism of the ADPRT-dependent silencing of transcription was investigated. It was found that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction prevented specific transcription factors from binding to DNA, thus excluding the formation of an active transcription complex. The specific DNA binding of some transcription factors (YY1, TBP, and p53) was prevented by covalent modification with poly(ADP-ribose). No ADP-ribosylation of transcription factors was detected if they had bound to DNA before the modification reaction was initiated. The results suggest that when activated, ADPRT may modify certain general and other transcription factors and thereby prevent their binding to DNA. After overexpression in Escherichia coli cells the human His-tagged ADPRT was purified as described previously (15Griesenbeck J. Oei S.L. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Ziegler M. Buchlow G. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7297-7394Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant human His-tagged YY1 (plasmid pHisYY1) produced in E. coli cells was purified as described by Seto et al. (16Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Recombinant human p53 was obtained from E. coli cells transformed with the plasmid pET-8c-p53H-47 (17Foord O. Navot N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1378-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recombinant TBP and TFIIB were purchased from Promega. 32P labeling of the oligonucleotides (YY1 (18Yant S.R. Zhu W. Millinoff D.

DNA Seq. 1990; 1: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), GCAGAGCATATAAGGTGAGGTAGGA) and EMSAs with HeLa nuclear extracts (Promega) were performed as described previously (13Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Babich V. Kropotov A. Tomilin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, in a binding reaction nuclear HeLa extracts (4 μg of protein) or recombinant proteins were incubated with 5 ng of32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 500 ng of poly (dI-dC) in a final volume of 10 μl. If EMSAs were carried out with nuclear extracts, the binding reaction contained in addition 400 ng of an unrelated oligonucleotide as unspecific competitor DNA to inhibit unspecific oligonucleotide binding activities present in the extracts (13Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Babich V. Kropotov A. Tomilin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). If EMSAs were carried out with recombinant proteins, the binding reaction contained as unspecific inhibitor 200 ng of a promoter-less plasmid p(C2AT)n (22Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Following the binding reaction protein-DNA complexes were separated in a 4% polyacrylamide gel. EMSA with TATA oligonucleotide was performed according to the protocol of Promega. 20 ng of TBP and 50 ng of TFIIB were incubated with 5 ng of32P-labeled TATA duplex oligonucleotide for 15 min at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol in a final volume of 10 μl. Following the binding reaction 10 ng of poly(dI-dC) was added, and samples were subjected to electrophoretic separation on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the gels were autoradiographed. Recombinant purified ADPRT was incubated in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7 mm MgCl2, 50 μmZnCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin). Reactions were started by the addition of 32P-labeled NAD+ and 10 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Boehringer, Mannheim) at 25 °C. Incubations were stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid to give a final concentration of 20%. After centrifugation trichloroacetic acid precipitates were washed two times with 5% trichloroacetic acid and with ethanol. Incorporation of32P-labeled ADP-ribose units was determined by Cerenkov counting. Purified recombinant ADPRT was incubated with transcription factors in the presence of 32P-labeled NAD+ at 25 °C in a final volume of 10 μl under conditions indicated in the legends to the figures. Incubations were stopped by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis gels were dried, and modification of proteins with32P-labeled ADP-ribose was detected by autoradiography. Standard transcription reactions (10Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) contained HeLa nuclear extracts (18 μg of protein/reaction mixture) and 200 ng of the supercoiled plasmid pML(C2AT)n (22Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Following preincubation for 20 min at ambient temperature in transcription buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 7 mmMgCl2) the reaction was started by adding NTPs (0.6 mm ATP, 0.6 mm UTP, 25 μm[α-32P]CTP, 10,000 cpm/pmol, and 0.1 mm3′-O-methyl-GTP) in a final reaction volume of 15 μl. All data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Because it was the goal of the present study to understand how activation of ADPRT may cause repression of transcription, the effect of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on transcription factors was analyzed. The ability of transcription factors to bind to their cognate sequences was tested in EMSAs following incubation with catalytically inactive (in the absence of NAD+) or active (in the presence of NAD+) ADPRT. The experiments were first carried out with YY1, which is known to be a partner protein of ADPRT and to be sensitive to ADPRT in EMSAs (13Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Babich V. Kropotov A. Tomilin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). EMSAs were carried out with a YY1 consensus oligonucleotide (18Yant S.R. Zhu W. Millinoff D. Slightom J.L. Goodman M. Gumucio D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4353-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and purified recombinant proteins. The addition of unmodified ADPRT did not affect specific DNA binding of YY1 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), whereas in the presence of ADPRT and NAD+ DNA binding of YY1 was strongly suppressed (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The possibility that the repression of DNA binding was mediated solely by the produced poly(ADP-ribose) polymers was ruled out by experiments using isolated ADP-ribose polymers instead of NAD+. Addition of deproteinized ADP-ribose polymers (detached from automodified ADPRT) did not influence the retention of the specific oligonucleotide by YY1 (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Similar results were obtained (Fig. 1 B) in EMSA with YY1 consensus oligonucleotide using cell-free HeLa nuclear extracts (23Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucl. Ac. Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Specific YY1 DNA binding was abolished in the presence of NAD+ (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). This repression of DNA binding was prevented (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) by adding a potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, 3-aminobenzamide (24Purnell M.R. Whish W.J.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The presence of an amount of ADP-ribose polymers (4 nmol of ADP-ribose units), which by far exceeded the maximum that was produced in the HeLa extracts by the endogenous ADPRT in the presence of 1 mmNAD+ (not shown), did not exert any influence on DNA binding of YY1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Therefore, NAD+-dependent prevention of DNA binding of YY1 was mediated by the enzymatic activity of ADPRT present in the HeLa nuclear extract. However, if YY1 was allowed to bind to its specific oligonucleotide prior to the addition of NAD+, DNA binding remained unaffected (Fig. 1, A, lane 5, and B, lane 5). A similar sensitivity to ADPRT activity was observed with a Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 1 C, lane 2) as well as with a NFκB consensus oligonucleotide (not shown). Using a CREB consensus oligonucleotide the effect of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was detectable but less pronounced (not shown). In contrast, retention of AP-1 (Fig. 1 C, lane 5) or AP-2 (not shown) oligonucleotides in the EMSA was insensitive to ADPRT activity. Addition of deproteinized ADP-ribose polymers did not influence DNA binding of Sp1 or AP-1 (not shown). As has been observed with YY1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), repression of Sp1 DNA binding was prevented by the addition of 3-aminobenzamide (not shown). Again, binding of the proteins to their consensus sequences was unaffected if it had taken place prior to the addition of NAD+ (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). Importantly, TBP (in complex with TFIIB) exhibited also a similar response to ADPRT activity, which is of significance with regard to the ADPRT-dependent silencing of transcription (see below). The interference of ADPRT activity with specific DNA binding as described above has also been observed with purified recombinant p53 (12Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a known partner of ADPRT (25Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S. Wu Y.S. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and target protein of modification with poly(ADP-ribose) (12Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As opposed to the observations with YY1 (Fig. 1, A, lane 4 and B, lane 4) or Sp1, specific p53 DNA binding was also repressed in the presence of small amounts of deproteinized ADP-ribose polymers (not shown). This high affinity of p53 to isolated polymers is in accordance with a recent report by Malanga et al. (26Malanga M. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 111843-118434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, it is concluded that the catalytic activity of ADPRT prevents specific DNA binding of some transcription factors. However, it is important to point out that initiation of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction does not cause the dissociation of preformed complexes between DNA and transcription factors. The conditions under which the DNA binding of some transcription factors was influenced implicated an interaction of ADPRT with these factors that depended on the functional state of the enzyme. To gain insight into whether transcription factors in turn exert an effect on the catalytic activity of ADPRT, we compared the rate of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation with or without the addition of transcription factors. Addition of purified recombinant YY1 resulted in a substantial acceleration of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction (Fig. 2 A). The observed enhancement of [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis was attributable to both the stimulated auto(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the enzyme and the occurrence of heteromodification of YY1 with poly(ADP-ribose) (Fig. 2 A). Remarkably, ADP-ribosylation of YY1 was not detectable if this transcription factor bound to DNA before the addition of NAD+ (Fig. 2 B). This finding holds important implications for the ability of ADPRT to repress transcription (see also below for TBP). Similarly to YY1, addition of TBP or p53 also resulted in a stimulation of the auto(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction (Table I), although less efficiently. Nevertheless, these effects appear to be specific, because other known partner proteins of ADPRT, XRCC1 (x-ray repaircross-complementing 1) (27Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Müller S. Ménissier-de Murcia J de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) or DNA-dependent protein kinase (28Ruscetti T. Lehnert B., E. Halbrook J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14461-14467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), inhibited the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction. The AP-1-binding protein c-Jun whose specific DNA binding was insensitive to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (cf. Fig. 1 C, lane 5) had no effect on the rate of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis (Table I). The stimulating effect of the basal transcription factor TFIIB on ADPRT activity was rather weak. Still, if, in addition to TBP, TFIIB was present, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was further enhanced (Table I).Table IStimulation of ADPRT activity by transcription factorsTranscription factor addedRelative activity of ADPRTNone 1YY18.3TBP2.3TFIIB1.6TBP+TFIIB4.5p532.5c-Jun1.12 μg/ml ADPRT, 1 μm of 32P-labeled NAD+, and 10 μg/ml of sonicated DNA were incubated with the transcription factors indicated at the following concentrations: 10 μg/ml YY1, 5 μg/ml TBP, 5 μg/ml TBP, 10 μg/ml TFIIB, 10 μg/ml p53, and 10 μg/ml c-Jun. Incubations were continued for 5 min and then stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Incorporated radioactivity was related to the value obtained for ADPRT in the absence of other transcription factors (40 pmol of ADP-ribose units/μg of ADPRT). Open table in a new tab 2 μg/ml ADPRT, 1 μm of 32P-labeled NAD+, and 10 μg/ml of sonicated DNA were incubated with the transcription factors indicated at the following concentrations: 10 μg/ml YY1, 5 μg/ml TBP, 5 μg/ml TBP, 10 μg/ml TFIIB, 10 μg/ml p53, and 10 μg/ml c-Jun. Incubations were continued for 5 min and then stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Incorporated radioactivity was related to the value obtained for ADPRT in the absence of other transcription factors (40 pmol of ADP-ribose units/μg of ADPRT). As mentioned before, TBP (in complex with TFIIB) exhibited a behavior resembling that of YY1 in the assays presented above (Figs. 1 and 2), indicating a specific physical interaction between these transcription factors and ADPRT. This is of considerable interest, because TBP and TFIIB, known to tightly associate for initiation of transcription (29Lee S. Hahn S. Nature. 1995; 376: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), are essential components of the basal transcriptional machinery. The results are presented in Fig. 3(A and B). EMSAs were performed using TATA oligonucleotides and recombinant TBP and TFIIB. As shown in Fig. 3 A, complex formation of TBP/TFIIB with the TATA oligonucleotide was sensitive to ADPRT activity (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). However, the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction did not influence preformed complexes of TBP/TFIIB with DNA (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Thus, DNA binding and formation of transcription complexes are only prevented if the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction is accomplished before the basal transcription factors have bound to DNA. Analysis of protein modification with poly(ADP-ribose) revealed that only TBP and not TFIIB is a specific target for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, modification of TBP occurred only under conditions that greatly diminished specific DNA binding of TBP/TFIIB (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). That is, when the transcription factors had bound to DNA prior to the addition of NAD+, there was no detectable ADP-ribosylation of TBP (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), and complex formation as visualized in EMSA remained unaffected (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). These findings provide strong support for the conclusion that TBP may be prevented from binding to its cognate sequence by modification with poly(ADP-ribose). It is proposed, therefore, that the mechanism underlying ADPRT-dependent silencing of transcription (10Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) includes modification of TBP causing the inability of this essential factor to bind to the TATA box. Indeed, the conditions required to observe ADPRT-dependent silencing of Pol II-dependent transcription (Fig. 3 C, lane 2) parallel those found to be crucial for modification of TBP (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 4) and prevention of its DNA binding (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). In a recent report (11Rawling J.M. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) the transcription factor TFIIF was shown to be an acceptor of poly(ADP-ribose), whereas TBP was not modified. It would appear from the data presented here that TBP escaped modification (11Rawling J.M. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), because it had already bound to DNA prior to the initiation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (cf. Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Several lines of evidence demonstrate the specificity of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation for some transcription factors. For example, in HeLa nuclear extracts transcriptional silencing caused by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was accompanied by selective modification of primarily ADPRT itself and a rather limited number of nuclear proteins (10Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, in the presence of other proteins, e.g.albumin or TFIIB (Figs. 2 A and 3 B), only ADPRT and the specific acceptor proteins, YY1 or TBP, respectively, were detected to be modified. Furthermore, although TBP and YY1 were readily ADP-ribosylated (Figs. 2 A and 3 B), modification of c-Jun, which binds specifically to AP-1 sites, was detectable only after prolonged incubation (not shown). The observation that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation did not affect AP-1 binding in the EMSA (Fig. 1 C, lane 5) suggests that the rate of modification by ADPRT might be crucial for prevention of DNA binding. This supposition was corroborated by EMSA using NAD+analogs that permit only very slow rates of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction (30Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Buchlow G. Jorcke D. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Wons T. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). None of these analogs influenced the retention of oligonucleotides in experiments similar to those presented in Fig. 1(not shown). In this respect it is important to note that ADPRT-dependent silencing of transcription as shown in Fig. 3 C is achieved within less than 5 min following the addition of NAD+ (10Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Ziegler M. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, this study provides evidence for the suggestion that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of TBP is a crucial step in ADPRT-dependent silencing of transcription. It also underlines the important conclusion that when initiated, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation prevents formation of new transcription complexes without interrupting ongoing transcription. That is, once transcription preinitiation complexes have been formed, the transcription factors are inaccessible for ADP-ribosylation. In essence, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation prevents their binding to DNA, whereas DNA binding of transcription factors prevents their poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. According to the role of ADPRT as a survival factor following genotoxic stress, participation of this enzyme in the regulation of transcription may be of importance during recovery from DNA damage. In addition, selective poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of transcription factors represents a novel means of controlling gene expression by covalent protein modification. We thank Drs. T. Shenk, T. C. Lee, W. M. Yang, B. Lüscher, and V. Rotta for kindly providing plasmids for overexpression of recombinant YY1 and p53 and G. Buchlow for expert technical assistance."

By exploiting protein kinase inhibitors, we further analyzed the possible participation of specific protein kinases in the above processes. It was found that induction of HSP70 in cells treated with a high concentration of cadmium (i.e. 100 μm) is preceded by the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), while that in cells treated with a low concentration (60 μm) is accompanied by the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). In 100 μm cadmium-treated cells, both HSP70 induction and HSF1 activation are eliminated in the presence of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38MAPK. By contrast, in 60 μm cadmium-treated cells, the processes are not affected by SB203580 but are significantly suppressed by PD98059, which indirectly inhibits ERK1/2 by acting on MAPK-ERK kinase. Taken together, we demonstrate that p38MAPK and ERK1/2 can be simultaneously or independently activated under different concentrations of cadmium and that the signaling pathways participate in the induction of HSP70 by acting on the inducible phosphorylation of HSF1. We thus provide the first evidence that both p38MAPKand ERK signaling pathways can differentially participate in the activation of HSF1, which leads to the induction of HSP70 by cadmium.

Transactivation of the heat shock genes has been centered on the interaction of the HSFs with the HSEs, which are found in all heat shock genes (3Morimoto R.I.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Although several members of HSF have been characterized, HSF1 has been demonstrated to be the most crucial transcription factor activated in mammalian cells responding to classical inducers of the heat shock response (5Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 6Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

Under normal growing conditions, HSF1 may exist as a latent monomeric form, with neither DNA binding nor transcription activity. Activation of HSF1 is through a multistep pathway, a nuclear localization and trimerization step by which HSF1 acquires the properties of a stable trimer, which correlates with the DNA binding activity, and a phosphorylation step by which HSF1 becomes transcriptionally active (5Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 8Hoj A. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HSF1 may also be constitutively phosphorylated, which represses its transcription activity (10Knauf U. Newton E.M. Kyriakis J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2782-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 11Kline M.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, HSF1 may be constitutively or inducibly phosphorylated, and only inducible phosphorylation of this factor can confer the transcription activity. Several phosphorylation sites in HSF1 have been identified to contain the consensus sequence for proline-directed kinases including ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and SAPKs, which can efficiently phosphorylate HSF1 in vitro(11Kline M.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Kim J. Nueda A. Meng Y.-H. Dynan W.S. Mivechi N.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear whether the MAPKs phosphorylate HSF1 in vivo. MAPKs are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases and are themselves activated through phosphorylation on specific tyrosine and threonine residues in response to signaling pathways induced by mitogens or stress conditions. Several members of the MAPK family have been identified, including ERK1/2 (13Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1355-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Marshall C.J. Curr.

Interestingly, these distinct MAPK cascades can be activated independently or simultaneously (25Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Recently, protein kinase inhibitors with distinct substrate specificity have been employed to unravel the roles of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 in cellular responses in a variety of experimental systems. SB203580, which belongs to a group of pyridinyl imidazole compounds that specifically bind to or near the ATP binding pocket of p38MAPK, inhibits the kinase with an IC50 of 0.6 μm. However, it does not affect, even at 100 μm, the activities of 12 other protein kinases, including ERK1/2 and SAPKs (26Lee J.C. Badger A.M. Griswold D.E. Dunnington D. Truneh A. Votta B. White J.R.

PD98059, on the other hand, is a flavonoid and a potent inhibitor of MAPK-ERK kinase. The drug is only weakly cytostatic and does not affect overall ERK contents at concentrations ≥10 μm; however, exposure to PD98059 results in a rapid loss (>95%) of the dually phosphorylation (active) form of ERKs (IC50 = 1 μm) (30Alessi D.R.

We previously reported that treatment of 9L RBT cells results in the induction of a battery of HSPs, including HSP70, and that HSF-HSE interaction is involved in this process (33Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J. Chang M.D.-T. Chen K.-D. Huang H.-L. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we have employed SB203580 and PD98059 to investigate whether activation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 are necessary for cadmium-induced HSP70 expression. We have focused on the effects of the protein kinase inhibitors on the induction of HSP70 as well as the activation of HSF1 in cadmium-treated 9L RBT cells. Herein we demonstrate that p38MAPK and ERKs can be simultaneously or distinctly activated under different concentrations of cadmium and that the signaling pathways may participate in the induction of HSP70 by acting on the inducible phosphorylation of HSF1. We thus provide the first evidence that both p38MAPK and ERKs may differentially participate in the activation of HSF1, which leads to the induction of the heat shock genes. The differential role of each of these two signaling pathways under stress is also discussed. Cultureware was obtained from Corning, and culture medium components were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [35S]methionine (specific activity >800 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol), [32P]orthophosphate (5,000 Ci/mmol), antibodies against HSP70, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection kits were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies against p38MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK (Tyr182), ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, c-Jun, and phospho-c-Jun (Ser63, Ser73) were from New England Biolabs. Synthetic oligonucleotides were ordered from Life Technologies, Inc. Chemical reagents for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. Other chemicals were obtained from Merck or Sigma. The 9L RBT cells (34Weizsaecker M. Deen D.F. Rosenblum M.L. Hoshino T. Gutin P.H. Baker M. J. Neurol. 1981; 224: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium plus 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2 and 95% air. Prior to each experiment, stock cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks or six-well plates at a density of 4−6 × 104 cells/cm2. Exponentially growing cells at 80−90% confluency were used. Cadmium chloride was dissolved in water at a concentration of 100 mm and added to the culture medium to the desired concentrations for treatment. The cells were treated at 37 °C for 2 h and allowed to recover for various durations as specified. For the studies concerning the effects of protein kinase inhibitors, the cells were preincubated with respective inhibitors, at various concentrations for 1 h, followed by treatment with cadmium in the presence of the inhibitors. De novo protein synthesis was revealed by [35S]methionine labeling at a concentration of 20 μCi/ml. After various treatments, the cells were labeled for 1 h, washed in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and lysed in sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). The gels were then fixed, dried, and processed for autoradiography as described (33Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J. Chang M.D.-T. Chen K.-D. Huang H.-L. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein bands of interest were quantified by densitometric scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The relative synthesis rate of HSP70 was presented as sum of pixel values of each band divided by that of actin in the same lane (internal control). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 9L RBT cells by a rapid fractionation protocol (36Hannighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Approximately 107 cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation at 100 × gfor 8 min at 4 °C, washed once with PBS, and centrifuged as above. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of nuclear extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 msucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then homogenized by three strokes with a Dounce grinder. The samples were briefly centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was lysed in 0.5 ml of nuclear extraction buffer supplemented with 0.5m NaCl and 5% glycerol at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant fractions were collected. The nuclear extracts obtained were dialyzed for 3–4 h against at least 50 volumes of dialysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 17% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kept frozen at −70 °C until use. HSE binding activities of the nuclear extracts were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using double-stranded oligonucleotides as probes. The synthetic HSE oligonucleotide probe was prepared by annealing 5′-CTAACAGACCCGAAACTGCTGGAAGATTCTTGG-3′ (corresponding to 152–184 of the genomic sequence of rat hsp70 (37Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Dillmann W.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) with its complementary strand, followed by end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction mixture consisted of 2 μg of nuclear extract and 1 ng of oligonucleotide (approximately 2 × 104 cpm) in 15 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 12% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 μg of poly(dI-dC)). The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were subsequently resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (50 mmTris, 50 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. Whole cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in TBE buffer by using a semidry transfer apparatus according to the manufacture's protocols (OWL scientific, Woburn, MA). After blocking with 3% nonfat milk in TTBS (0.5% Tween 20, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl) for 90 min and washing once with TTBS, the membranes were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of respective antibodies against phospho-p38MAPK, p38MAPK, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, phospho-c-Jun, and c-Jun at room temperature for 12 h. Subsequently, the membranes were washed three times with TTBS, for 10 min each time, and incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 60 min. After washing three times for 5 min each time with TTBS, the immune complexes were detected by the ECL system and quantified by densitometric scanning. Cells were stressed by 0, 60, 100 μm CdCl2 for 2 h and then lysed in kinase lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C). The cell lysate was mixed with 5 μl (200 ng) of glutathione S-transferase-MAPKAPK-2 or MBP, 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μl of magnesium/ATP mixture and then incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with agitation. The solution was finally mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. For the determination of HSF1 phosphorylation, cells were incubated with 1 mCi of32Pi in 1 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. After treatment, cells were rapidly chilled on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 μg/ml microcystin LR, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 m KCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) for 10 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C). The protein content of the cell lysate was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and an equal amount of protein was used in each reaction. After preclearing by incubation with 1 μg of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation to remove pellets, the cell lysates were incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-HSF antibodies (Affinity Bio-reagents Inc., Golden, CO) for 12 h. Immune complexes were further precipitated with 1 μg of protein G-Sepharose, washed five times with lysis buffer, and finally mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. Flow cytometry was performed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA), using CellQuest and Modfit LT software. For cell cycle analysis, aliquots of 1 × 106 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol on ice for 2 h and collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS buffer containing 20 μg/ml RNase A and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. RNase was removed by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the fixed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS followed by incubation with 100 μl of 10 μg/μl propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min. The labeled cells were analyzed with FACScan according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA extraction procedure was carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Approximately 108 cells treated with or without CdCl2 were collected by centrifugation (1,000 ×g, 5 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS buffer, and the pellet was collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 5 min). The cells were resuspended in 3.6 ml of proteinase K buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% SDS), and 0.4 ml of 10 mg/ml proteinase K was added. The mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 15 min and 37 °C overnight. The solution was extracted three times with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and finally one time with an equal volume of chloroform followed by centrifugation (2,500 ×g, 10 min). One-tenth volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol were both added to the aqueous layer with gentle mix to precipitate the genomic DNA. The DNA pellet was rinsed with 5 ml of 80% ethanol and recollected by centrifugation (2,500 × g, 5 min). To dissolve the precipitated DNA, 4.5 ml of proteinase K buffer without SDS was added, and the solution was incubated at room temperature overnight. Subsequently, 25 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase A was added, and the solution was further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, extracted with 5 ml of phenol/chloroform (1:1), and separated by centrifugation (2,500 ×g, 10 min). The genomic DNA was precipitated by the addition of 9 ml of ethanol, rinsed with 80% ethanol, and collected by centrifugation (2,500 × g, 10 min). The isolated DNAs were loaded and separated on a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer and stained with ethidium bromide for examination with a UV transilluminator. As a first step to elucidate the possible involvement of protein kinases in the induction of HSP70 under cadmium treatment, several protein kinase inhibitors, including staurosporine, SB203580, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), and H89, which inhibit general kinases, p38MAPK, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A, respectively, were employed. Cells were respectively incubated with the above inhibitors for 1 h, treated with 100 μm CdCl2 for 2 h along with each inhibitor, and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h. De novo protein synthesis was monitored by autoradiography (Fig. 1 A). Staurosporine appeared to inhibit the induction of HSP70, indicating that certain protein kinase(s) are involved in the process (Fig. 1,lane 3). Furthermore, SB203580, but not BIM or H89, was found to be able to significantly suppress the induction of HSP70 in cadmium-treated cells (Fig. 1, lane 4). The results indicated that the p38MAPK, but not the protein kinase A or protein kinase C, signaling pathway is involved in this process. We have previously demonstrated the formation of HSE·HSF complexes during the induction of HSPs in cadmium-treated 9L RBT cells (33Hung J.-J. Cheng T.-J. Chang M.D.-T. Chen K.-D. Huang H.-L. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Herein we further analyzed the effects of the protein kinase inhibitors on the HSE binding activities of the nuclear proteins extracted from both the treated and untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 2, two slowly migrating complexes, designated as complexes I and II, were detected (Fig. 2,lane 2). In the untreated cells, staurosporine could completely abolish the formation of complex I (Fig. 2,lane 3), while SB203580, BIM, and H89 could only reduce the binding intensity but did not affect the binding patterns (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). Enhanced binding activity toward HSE was found in the cadmium-treated cells (Fig. 2,lane 7); however, both staurosporine and SB203580 eliminated the formation of complex I (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9), which could still be detected in cells preincubated with BIM or H89 (Fig. 2, lanes 10and 11). These observations supported the notion that there are constitutive as well as inducible phosphorylation processes of HSFs and indicated that complex I may represent the presence of the inducible phosphorylation form. Moreover, the effects of the protein kinase inhibitors on the formation of complex I (inducible phosphorylation form) closely correspond to those on the induction of HSP70 shown in Fig. 1. Taken together, the data indicated that in cells treated with 100 μm CdCl2 for 2 h, the p38MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the cadmium-induced activation of HSF, which in turn confers the induction of HSP70. To study the relationship between HSP70 induction and p38MAPK activation, the levels of p38MAPK, tyrosine phosphorylation of p38MAPK, and HSP70 were determined by immunoblotting analysis. The anisomycin-treated cell lysates, supplied by the manufacturer, were also used as additional controls to assure the authentic detection of p38MAPK and phospho-p38MAPK. The results clearly demonstrated that Tyr182 of p38MAPKunderwent phosphorylation in cells treated with 100 μmCdCl2 (Fig. 3,lane 5) despite no observable changes in the levels of p38MAPK with or without cadmium treatment. Furthermore, it was found that phosphorylation of p38MAPKwas completely abolished and inductive accumulation of HSP70 was significantly suppressed in cells preincubated with SB203580 (Fig. 3,lane 6). The correlation between p38MAPK activation and HSP70 induction was further examined in cells treated with 100 μm CdCl2 for 2 h followed by different recovery durations (Fig. 4). The synthesis of HSP70 was evaluated by metabolic labeling followed by autoradiography, while the alterations in the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and total expression of p38MAPK were determined by immunoblotting using respective antibodies. Fig. 4 A showed that synthesis of HSP70 was induced immediately after treatment, reached its maximum after 2 h, and diminished after 8 h of recovery. Consistently, p38MAPK remained unphosphorylated in the untreated cells, but the phosphorylated form of p38MAPK appeared immediately after treatment. The protein kinase was found to be phosphorylated until 4 h but completely dephosphorylated after 8 h of recovery (Fig. 4 B). Quantitative analysis of the data showed that phosphorylation of p38MAPK appeared to precede the induction HSP70 (Fig. 4 C). These experiments clearly demonstrated that treatment with cadmium would result in phosphorylation of p38MAPK, which subsequently led to HSP70 induction in the treated 9L RBT cells. The correlation between the HSP70 induction and MAPK activation was further investigated in cells treated with different concentrations of cadmium for 2 h followed by 2 h of recovery. Induction of HSP70 was determined by metabolic labeling, and levels of p38MAPK and phospho-p38MAPK were determined by immunoblotting as in the previous experiments. The results clearly revealed that HSP70 was induced under all concentrations being applied (Fig. 5 A). Surprisingly, phosphorylat"

To inhibit cadmium-induced damage, cells respond by increasing the expression of genes encoding stress-response proteins. In most cases, the mechanism by which cadmium affects the expression of these genes remains unknown. It has been demonstrated in several instances that cadmium activates gene transcription through signal transduction pathways, mediated by protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or calmodulin. A codicil is that cadmium should influence the expression of numerous genes. To investigate the ability of cadmium to affect gene transcription, the differential display technique was used to analyze gene expression in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Forty-nine cDNAs whose steady-state levels of expression change 2–6-fold in response to cadmium exposure were identified. The nucleotide sequences of the majority of the differentially expressed cDNAs are identical to those of C. elegans cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, expressed sequence tags, or predicted genes. The translated amino acid sequences of several clones are identical to C. elegansmetallothionein-1, HSP70, collagens, and rRNAs.

The transition metal cadmium is considered to be a serious occupational and environmental toxin. Cadmium was ranked number 7 on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/Environmental Protection Agency “Top 20 Hazardous Substances Priority List” in 1997 (1Fay R.M. Mumtaz M.M. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1997; 34: 1163-1165Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, it is a frequently found contaminant at Superfund sites (1Fay R.M. Mumtaz M.M. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1997; 34: 1163-1165Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cadmium is used primarily in metal coatings, nickel-cadmium batteries, and pigments (2Friberg L. Kjellstrom T. Nordberg G.F. Friberg L Nordberg G.F. Vouk V. Handbook of the Toxicology of Metals. Elsevier/North-Holland, Amsterdam1986: 130-237Google Scholar, 3Aylett B.J. Webb M. The Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biology of Cadmium. Elsevier/North-Holland, New York1979: 1-43Google Scholar). It is also continuously introduced into the atmosphere through the smelting of ores and the burning of fossil fuels (2Friberg L. Kjellstrom T. Nordberg G.F. Friberg L Nordberg G.F. Vouk V. Handbook of the Toxicology of Metals. Elsevier/North-Holland, Amsterdam1986: 130-237Google Scholar, 3Aylett B.J. Webb M. The Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biology of Cadmium. Elsevier/North-Holland, New York1979: 1-43Google Scholar). It has been suggested that increased industrialization has resulted in higher levels of accumulated cadmium in humans (4Fortoul T.I. Osorio L.S. Tovar A.T. Salazar D. Castilla M.E. Olaiz-Fernandez G. Environ. Health Perspect. 1996; 104: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The primary routes of nonoccupational exposure in humans are via inhalation and via ingestion of cadmium-containing food (5Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Humans are continuously exposed to cadmium and accumulate the metal throughout their lives in liver, lung, and kidney tissue (3Aylett B.J. Webb M. The Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biology of Cadmium. Elsevier/North-Holland, New York1979: 1-43Google Scholar, 6Bernard A. Lauwerys R. Experientia Suppl. 1986; 50: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Toxicological responses of cadmium exposure include kidney damage, respiratory diseases such as emphysema, and neurologic disorders (5Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar,7Chmielnicka J. Cherian M.G. Biol. Trace Elements Res. 1986; 10: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cadmium has been classified as a group 1 human carcinogen (8International Agency for Research on Cancer Beryllium, Cadmium, Mercury and Exposures in the Glass Manufacturing Industry. 58. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1993: 377Google Scholar). It induces lung, kidney, prostate, and testicular cancers in rats and mice (5Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Human epidemiological data suggest that it causes tumors of the male reproductive system and induces respiratory tumors (5Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Oberdorster G. Scand. J. Work Environ. Health. 1986; 12: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Intracellular damage associated with cadmium exposure includes protein denaturation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA strand breaks. Proposed mechanisms by which cadmium induces this damage involve (a) metal binding to reduced cysteine residues and (b) the generation of reactive oxygen species, possibly by lowering reduced glutathione levels (10Abe T. Konishi T. Katoh T. Hirano H. Matsukuma K. Kashimura M. Higashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Manca D. Ricard A.C. Trottier B. Chevalier G.

To prevent cadmium-induced intracellular damage, cells respond to metal exposure by inducing the transcription of genes that encode defense and repair proteins. These proteins (a) chelate the metal to prevent further damage, (b) remove reactive oxygen species, (c) repair membrane and DNA damage, and (d) renature or degrade unfolded proteins. Cadmium has been shown to affect the steady-state levels of the mRNAs encoding metallothionein (13Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), heme oxygenase (14Adam J. Shibahara S. Smith A J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6371-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (15Hatcher E.L. Chen Y. Kang Y.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), low and high molecular weight heat shock proteins (16Wiegant F.A. Souren J.E. van Rijn J. van Wijk R. Toxicology. 1994; 94: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin (17Muller-Taubenberger A. Hagmann J. Noegel A. Gerisch G. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities are observed following cadmium exposure in cultured cells and whole animals (18Kostic M.M. Ognjanovic B. Dimitrijevic S. Zikic R.V. Stajn A. Rosic G.L. Zivkovic R.V. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Salovsky P. Shopova V. Dancheva V. Marev R. Hum. Exp. Toxicol. 1992; 11: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which this metal modulates the levels of expression of most of these genes remains unknown. Cadmium-activated transcription may occur through specific metal-responsive upstream regulatory elements found in the promoters of cadmium-responsive genes. These may include MRE sequences, found in most metallothionein genes (20Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7322-7381Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Searle P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4690-4863Google Scholar, 22Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell.

Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 265: 14061-14064Google Scholar). Cadmium may also affect gene expression by influencing signal transduction pathways. Cadmium affects the activities of protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and calmodulin (24Wang Z. Templeton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 73-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cadmium-induced transcription of the proto-oncogenes jun and fos is mediated via protein kinase C and calmodulin (25Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Thus, cadmium can modulate the activities of complex signal transduction pathways that in turn can influence the expression of a myriad of genes. However, relatively few cadmium-responsive genes have been identified. In addition, there is a paucity of information on the influence of cell-specific and developmental factors on metal-inducible gene expression. We have used the reverse transcriptase-PCR1 protocol of differential display to identify new cadmium-responsive genes from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The nonparasitic nematode C. elegans provides an excellent model system for obtaining an integrated picture of cellular, developmental, and molecular aspects of the regulation of cadmium-responsive gene expression. The adult hermaphrodite is composed of 959 somatic cells but contains highly differentiated muscle, nervous, digestive, and reproductive systems (26Sulston J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 123-155Google Scholar, 27Kenyon C. Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The developmental and cellular biology of C. elegans is thoroughly understood in exceptional detail (26Sulston J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 123-155Google Scholar, 27Kenyon C. Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). High levels of evolutionary conservation between C. elegans and higher organisms are observed in many signal transduction, gene regulatory, and developmental pathways (28McGhee J.D. Krause M.W. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 147-184Google Scholar, 29Han M. Sternberg P.

In addition, homologues of many of the proteins induced as part of metal-activated stress responses in vertebrates have been identified in C. elegans. These include metallothionein (31Slice L.W.

Genet. 1996; 18: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). With the exception of metallothionein, the effect of cadmium on the transcription of theseC. elegans genes remains unknown. C. elegans also contains homologues to many of the signal transduction proteins that have been implicated in modulating the cellular/molecular response to metal exposure (40Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Lu X. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6896-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lu X-Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the major advantages in using C. elegans as a model system to identify new metal-responsive genes is the magnitude of cDNA and genomic DNA sequence data currently available. The nematode genome is relatively small (∼108 bp), and an abundance of information is available on the genetic and physical maps of its chromosomes (44Waterston R.H. Sulston J.E. Coulson A.R. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 23-46Google Scholar). Currently, sequencing of the entire C. elegans genome is >80% completed, and >50,000 ESTs have been cloned and sequenced. Megabases of genomic and cDNA sequence data are readily available through GenBankTM, the C. elegans Genome Project (45Coulson A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the C. eleganscDNA Sequencing Project. 2Sequence data and information about the C. elegans cDNA Project can be obtained on the World Wide Web athttp://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/c-elegans/html/CE_INDEX.html. We have identified 53 differentially expressed DNA fragments from a mixed stage population (i.e. a population at all stages of development) of cadmium-exposed C. elegans. Subsequent analysis confirms that the steady-state level of expression of 48 of these clones increases 2–6-fold following cadmium exposure. In addition, a single clone was isolated whose level of expression decreased ∼2-fold. Sequence analysis has identified C. elegans cosmids, predicted structural genes, and ESTs that are identical to the differentially expressed mRNAs. Furthermore, the cadmium-responsive cDNAs are the products of 32 independent genes. The N2 strain of C. elegans was grown in liquid S medium (0.1 mNaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 10 mm potassium citrate, 3 mmCaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 25 μm FeSO4, 10 μm MnCl2, 10 μmZnSO4, and 1 μm CuSO4) usingEscherichia coli OP50 as a food source (46Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments where nematodes were exposed to cadmium, the medium was supplemented with 100 μm CdCl2 (32Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C. eleganswere grown in the presence of metal for 8 or 24 h at ∼20 °C. Nematodes were then collected following centrifugation at 800 ×g for 5 min. Pellets were suspended in 50 mmNaCl containing 35% sucrose (final concentration), and viable nematodes were collected from the top of the solution following centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nematodes were then washed three times by suspension in M9 buffer (22 mm KH2PO4, 42 mmNa2HPO4, 85 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4) followed by sedimentation at 800 × g. Washed nematode pellets were finally suspended in a small volume of M9 buffer, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from mixed stage populations of C. elegans exposed to 100 μmCdCl2 for 8 and 24 h and control, nonexposed nematodes. Frozen worms were first ground into a fine powder using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle. Powdered C. elegans (200 mg) were then homogenized in 2 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was then collected from the aqueous phase following the addition of chloroform, precipitated by adding isopropyl alcohol, and then air-dried. The dried RNA pellet was then dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. For some experiments, poly(A+) RNA was subsequently isolated using the Poly(A)Tract® mRNA isolation system following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Differential display was performed following the protocol of Liang and Pardee (47Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4698) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of total RNA isolated from either of three populations of C. elegans, controls, or those grown in the presence of cadmium for 8 or 24 h, was treated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) in 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 50 mm KCl and 1.5 mmMgCl2. The DNA-free RNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. First-strand cDNAs were generated in reverse transcriptase reactions containing 0.2 μg of DNA-free total RNA, reverse transcriptase buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 38 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol), a 5 μm concentration of each dNTP, and a 1 μmconcentration of one of four 3′-degenerate anchored oligo(dT) primers. The 3′-degenerate anchored oligo(dT) primers have the following sequences: T12MG, T12MA, T12MT, and T12MC, where M is 3-fold degenerate for G, A, and C. Primers were annealed to the RNA template by incubating the reaction mixture for 5 min at 65 °C and then for 10 min at 37 °C. First strand cDNA synthesis was achieved following the addition of 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) and incubation at 37 °C for 50 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, which inactivates the reverse transcriptase. Amplification of cDNA fragments was performed in 20-μl reactions. Each PCR mixture contained 2 μl of the products from one of the four reverse transcriptase reactions above and 18 μl of a solution containing Taq-PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin), a 1 μm concentration of the same 3′-degenerate anchored oligo(dT) primer used in the first-strand synthesis reaction, four dNTPs (2 μm each), 10 μCi of [α-35S]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), and a 0.2 μmconcentration of one of 20 5′-arbitrary decamers. The sequences of the 5′-arbitrary primers used in these reactions are presented in Table I. Reaction mixtures were subjected to 40 cycles of the PCR using the following parameters: denature at 94 °C for 30 s, anneal at 42 °C for 2 min, elongate at 72 °C for 30 s. All PCRs were performed in duplicate. The amplified cDNAs produced from duplicate reactions of RNA isolated from control, 8-h treated and 24-h treated C. elegans were size-fractionated in parallel by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 6% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels.Table ISequences of the 5′-arbitrary decamer primers used in differential displayPrimer designationSequenceAP-3AGGTGACCGTAP-4GGTACTCCACAP-6GCAATCGATCAP-7CCGAAGGAATAP-8GGATTGTGCGAP-9CGTGGCAATAAP-10TAGCAAGTGCAP-13AGTTAGGCACAP-15AGGGCCTGTTAP-18CTGAGCTAGGRT-1TACAACGAGGRT-2TGGATTGGTCRT-3CTTTCTACCCRT-4TTTTGGCTCCRT-5GGAACCAATCRT-6AAACTCCGTCRT-7TCGATACAGGRT-8TGGTAAAGGGRT-9TCGGTCATAGRT-10GGTACTAAGC Open table in a new tab Following electrophoresis, gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to Kodak X-AR film for 24 h. Differentially expressed cDNAs were visualized by autoradiography. To isolate differentially expressed cDNA fragments, regions of dried gels corresponding to the cDNAs were excised. Gel slices were rehydrated in 100 μl of distilled H2O following a 10-min incubation at room temperature. The cDNA was then extracted from the rehydrated gels by incubating at 100 °C for 15 min in tightly capped microcentrifuge tubes. cDNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate and 50 μg of glycogen (Boehringer Mannheim). The eluted cDNA was reamplified in a 40-μl reaction with the identical pair of primers used in the mRNA differential display reaction. PCR reaction conditions were similar to those above, except the concentration of the dNTPs was increased to 20 μm, and the [α-35S]dATP was omitted. Amplified cDNA fragments were resolved by gel electrophoresis using 1.5% agarose gels and then purified using QIAEXII kits (QIAGEN). Gel-purified cDNAs were directly inserted into the T-A cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega). DNA inserts were subsequently sequenced using T7 and SP6 primers by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedures of Sanger et. al (48Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52655) Google Scholar) (U.S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase Kit, version 2.0). Analysis of cDNA sequence data including sequence comparisons, alignments, and assembly of cDNA sequences were performed using PC/GENE-Intelli-Genetics software. BLAST analysis (49Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70663) Google Scholar) was carried out through the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the C. elegans Genome Project Internet servers using the nonredundant, C. elegans genome and C. elegans EST data bases. For some sequence analysis, the “A C. elegans data base” (ACeDB) software was used (50Eeckman F.H. Durbin R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Predicted C. elegans genes were identified by theC. elegans Genome Project using the GENEFINDER program (51Favello A. Hillier L. Wilson R.K. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 551-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA (20 μg) or poly(A+) RNA (2 μg) were denatured in a 2.2 mformaldehyde, 50% (v/v) formamide buffer and then subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde gel. Size-fractionated RNAs were then transferred to Nytran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were probed with32P-labeled cDNA fragments of the differentially expressed mRNAs. cDNAs to be used as probes were generated by the PCR from the cloned DNA fragments recovered from differential display gels, as described above. cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random-primed labeling. Membranes were hybridized in 6× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1.25× Denhardt’s solution, 0.5% SDS, 300 ng of denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and heat-denatured probe at 42 °C for 16 h. Following hybridization, membranes were washed at a high stringency of 50 °C for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The amount of probe hybridizing to the RNA was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). After images were obtained, membranes were incubated at 95 °C for 1 h in 0.1% SDS to remove the bound probe. They were then hybridized with a32P-labeled C. elegans myosin light chain probe, which served as a loading control (32Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a positive control, membranes were also hybridized to a 32P-labeled C. elegans metallothionein-2 (mtl-2) cDNA probe (32Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of radioactivity was performed using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). Steady-state levels of mRNA expression were all normalized to that of the constitutively expressed myosin light chain mRNAs (32Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Cummins C. Anderson P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5334-5349Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Changes in the steady-state levels of differentially expressed mRNAs in C. elegans following cadmium exposure were also determined by reverse Northern dot-blot analysis by the modified procedure of Zhang et al. (53Zhang H. Zhang R. Liang P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2454-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentially expressed cDNAs that were previously cloned into pGEM-T were amplified using primers that anneal to the T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase binding sites, which flank the cDNA insert. cDNAs were amplified and subsequently purified using PCR spin columns (QIAGEN). Approximately 100 ng of each amplified cDNA were denatured by mixing with 0.1 n NaOH (final concentration) and incubating at 100 °C for 5 min. The solution was neutralized following the addition of 3× SSC (final concentration), and then the volume was adjusted to 700 μl with distilled H2O. 200 μl of each sample was applied to one of three Nytran membranes in a Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then baked for 30 min at 80 °C under vacuum. As positive and loading controls, 100 ng of mtl-1 cDNA and myosin light chain DNA were also applied to each membrane, respectively. Three pools of single-stranded 32P-labeled cDNA probes were prepared from poly(A+) RNA isolated from control and 8- and 24-h cadmium-treated nematodes. cDNAs were generated from a mixture of mRNAs in 25-μl reverse transcriptase reactions, which contained 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA; 1 μg of oligo(dT)18 primer; reverse transcriptase buffer; 800 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 4.5 μm dCTP; 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol); 20 units of RNase inhibitor; and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then at 95 °C for 5 min to terminate the reaction. Unincorporated nucleotides were separated from the labeled cDNAs by using a G-25 spin column (Boehringer Mannheim). Equal amounts (5 × 106 cpm/ml) of each radioactive cDNA mixture were heat-denatured and then hybridized separately to one of the three membranes at 42 °C for 16 h in hybridization buffer (see above). Membranes were washed at a high stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. The amount of 32P-labeled probe bound to each differentially expressed cDNA was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, and levels of expression of the cognate mRNAs were normalized to that of the myosin light chain mRNA, as described above. The level of theC. elegans mtl-2 mRNA was measured by Northern blot analysis to confirm that the cadmium exposure protocol outlined above affects gene expression (32Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe that is specific for the 3′-end of the mtl-2 mRNA was hybridized to a membrane that contained RNA prepared from controlC. elegans or nematodes exposed to 100 μmCdCl2 for 24 h (Fig. 1). The steady-state level of mtl-2 mRNA increased in response to cadmium exposure to that previously reported (32Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This verified that the cadmium treatment protocol alters gene expression in C. elegans and can be used for the differential display analysis. mRNA expression patterns of nontreated C. elegans and those exposed to cadmium for 8 and 24 h were compared by mRNA differential display in order to identify new genes whose transcription is regulated by cadmium. A total of 20 5′-arbitrary decamers, including five that have sequences that are homologous to the mtl-1 cDNA, were used. Each of the 20 decamers was paired with one of four 3′-degenerate anchored oligo(dT) primers and used to amplify cDNAs prepared from control and cadmium-treated C. elegans. All amplification experiments were performed in duplicate using RNA prep"
https://openalex.org/W2074885149,"In T cells, triggering of the T cell antigen receptor or of the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 can direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the signaling protein Vav. We investigated the role played by the protein tyrosine kinases Fyn, Lck, and ZAP-70 in these processes in a T cell hybridoma after physiological stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. A dominant-negative mutant approach based on overexpression of catalytically inactive alleles of these kinases showed that CD28-induced Vav phosphorylation preferentially requires Fyn, whereas ZAP-70 had no role. Consistently, Vav was strongly phosphorylated in Lck-deficient JCAM-1 cells after CD28 ligation. In contrast, ZAP-70 appeared to control TCR-directed Vav phosphorylation. However, overexpression of ZAP-70 carrying a mutated Tyr<sup>315</sup>, contained within a motif previously suggested to be a Vav Src homology 2 domain binding site, had little or no effect. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that phosphorylated Vav associated with Fyn after CD28 triggering and that this interaction, likely to involve binding of Fyn Src homology 2 domain to Vav, was more strongly detectable after concomitant CD28 and TCR stimulation. These data suggest that Fyn plays a major role in controlling Vav phosphorylation upon T cell activation and that the mechanism implicating ZAP-70 in this process may be more complex than previously anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W2153284630,"Irreversible tyrosine modifications by inflammatory oxidants such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−) can affect signal transduction pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the c-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, is involved in regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation, and possible modulation of EGFR-dependent signaling by ONOO− was studied. Exposure of epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells to 0.1–1.0 mm ONOO− resulted in tyrosine nitration on EGFR and other proteins but did not significantly affect EGFR tyrosine autophosphorylation. A high molecular mass tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (∼340 kDa) was detected in A431 cell lysates after exposure to ONOO−, most likely representing a covalently dimerized form of EGFR, based on immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting with α-EGFR antibodies and co-migration with ligand-induced EGFR dimers cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Covalent EGFR dimerization by ONOO− probably involved intermolecular dityrosine cross-linking and was enhanced after receptor activation with epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, irreversibly cross-linked EGFR was more extensively tyrosine-phosphorylated compared with the monomeric form, indicating that ONOO− preferentially cross-links activated EGFR. Exposure of A431 cells to ONOO− markedly reduced the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of a downstream EGFR substrate, phospholipase C-γ1, which may be related to covalent alterations in EGFR.

Inflammatory conditions are associated with increased production of reactive oxygen metabolites, such as superoxide anion (O⨪2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as induction of nitric oxide (NO⋅) synthesis, which is thought to play major roles in host defense but is also presumed to contribute to the development of tissue injury associated with chronic inflammation. The nearly diffusion-limited reaction between nitric oxide (NO⋅) and superoxide (O⨪2) produces peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a powerful oxidant and cytotoxic species that has been proposed to importantly contribute to the pathophysiology of a large variety of diseases associated with inflammation (1Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite is reactive toward all classes of biomolecules, including lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, and oxidative reaction products in proteins primarily include modifications of cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine residues (2Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar). Irreversible covalent modifications of tyrosine residues by ONOO− include the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine and 3,3′-dityrosine, which represent characteristic “markers” for inflammatory (NO⋅-derived) oxidants (5Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 6van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Kaur H. Cross C.E. Halliwell B.

Chemical studies with the nitrating agent tetranitromethane have shown that nitration of critical tyrosine residues inactivates a wide variety of enzymes (9Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Miersza S. Chan S.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Haddad I.Y. Zhu S.

Studies with isolated tyrosine kinases have demonstrated that substrate tyrosine residues are not phosphorylated when they are nitrated (12Kong S.-K. Yim M.B. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3377-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 13Gow A.J. Duran D. Malcolm S. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), which implies that tyrosine nitration may interfere with signal transduction pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation. Alternatively, formation 3,3′-dityrosine by inflammatory oxidants such as ONOO− can result in inter- or intramolecular covalent cross-linking in e.g. membrane proteins (7Giulivi C Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

Malcolm S. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 14Mondoro T.H. Shafer B.C. Vostal J.G. Free Radical Biol.

De Sarno P. Song L. Beckman J.S. Jope R.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the potential pathophysiological significance of such protein modifications has, however, not been demonstrated conclusively in intact cellular systems. One group of proteins that may be significantly affected by inflammatory oxidants are membrane receptors for various growth factors or cytokines that are induced and/or activated during inflammation to promote wound healing processes. Among these is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),1which is overexpressed and activated in response to epithelial injury to promote epithelial repair processes (17Rappolee D.A. Mark D. Banda M.J. Werb Z. Science. 1988; 241: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 18Van Winkle L.S. Isaac J.M. Plopper C.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 443-459PubMed Google Scholar). The EGFR is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily and is involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of primarily epithelial cell types (19Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). The EGFR is a 170-kDa glycoprotein that spans the membrane via one α-helical segment of 23 amino acids connecting a large, heavily glycosylated extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Stimulation of EGFR by its endogenous ligands (transforming growth factor-α or epidermal growth factor (EGF)) involves ligand-induced receptor dimerization (21Cochet C. Kashles O. Chambaz E.M. Borrello I. King C.R. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3290-3295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sorokin A. Lemmon M.A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is now recognized as a general activation mechanism common to a large number of receptors for growth factors, cytokines, and hormones (20Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 23Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The activated EGFR-ligand complex is then internalized and eventually degraded in lysosomes or dissociated for EGFR recycling. Activation of EGFR causes phosphorylation on intracellular serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and activation of tyrosine kinase activity, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of various effector proteins, ultimately leading to stimulation of DNA replication and cell division. Recently, the signaling mechanism of EGFR has been demonstrated to involve generation of hydrogen peroxide (24Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), and various reports have indicated that oxidative modification of a cysteine residue in EGFR may reversibly affect its activation (25Clark S. Konstantopoulos N. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Estrada C. Gomez C. Martin-Nieto J. De Frutos T. Jimenez A. Villalobo A. Biochem. J. 1977; 326: 369-376Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Woltjer R.L. Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9911-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other covalent modifications by ONOO−, such as nitration of one or more of the tyrosine residues involved in the EGFR signaling cascade or the formation of intra- or intermolecular 3,3′-dityrosine cross-links within EGFR could more irreversibly interfere with EGFR signaling pathways. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential consequences of ONOO−-induced tyrosine modifications on tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of EGFR in intact cells. The results indicate that exposure of A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells to ONOO− causes irreversible dimerization of EGFR, most likely via dityrosine cross-links, which appears to be related to the extent of EGFR activation. Formation of ONOO− during inflammatory processes may thereby alter EGFR-mediated signaling pathways in target cells and affect cell proliferation or differentiation, which may have implications in wound repair or tumor formation. Experiments were performed using the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431, which overexpresses EGFR and contains 1–3 × 106 EGF receptors/cell (28Haigler H. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A431 cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 100-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1.2 g/liter NaHCO3 and 7 ml/liter penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma) and 5% newborn bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Before experimentation, cells were serum-starved for 2 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and subsequently placed in 2 ml of modified PBS (50 mm Na2HPO4, 90 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4). This modified PBS was used to avoid interfering reactions of ONOO− and other oxidant systems used in our experiments with media constituents and to provide sufficient buffering capacity to avoid pH changes after the addition of alkaline solutions of ONOO−. Peroxynitrite was prepared via quenched-flow reaction of H2O2 with HNO2 and subsequently passed over MnO2 to remove residual H2O2, and quantitated spectrophotometrically prior to experimentation (ε302 = 1,670 m−1 cm−1; Ref. 29Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 10-min preincubation of A431 cells in modified PBS, ONOO− was added in small aliquots (<6 μl) on the side of the culture dish and immediately mixed with the incubation buffer by rapid swirling, in order to assure optimal exposure of the cells to ONOO− before decomposition. In control experiments, cells were treated in a similar fashion with equal volumes of 1.2m NaOH (vehicle control) or with aliquots of ONOO− stock solutions that were allowed to decompose completely by overnight storage at room temperature but still contain contaminants such as nitrite and nitrate (29Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments were performed with reagent H2O2 or sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (Sigma), which were quantitated spectrophotometrically before experimentation, using ε240of 43.6 m−1 cm−1 and ε290 of 350 m−1cm−1 at pH 12, respectively. For experiments involving horseradish peroxidase (HRP, type I; Sigma), this enzyme was added to the incubation medium shortly before the addition of H2O2. EGFR activation was performed by the addition of EGF (20 nm; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) either before or after oxidant treatments. In experiments with the chemical cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-carbodiimide (EDAC), cells were incubated with 10 mm EDAC for 40 min at 37 °C following other treatments. To remove surface-bound EGF, cells were rinsed twice for 2 min at 4 °C with acid wash buffer (0.1m NaAc, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 4.5), after which the cells were washed twice with PBS. After the various cell treatments, culture dishes were placed on ice, and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 250 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 250 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5). Dishes were kept on ice for 20 min on a rocker platform to allow complete solubilization of EGFR, and cell lysates were collected and centrifuged (10 min at 10,000 ×g) to remove insoluble cellular debris. Aliquots of cell lysates (100 μl) were mixed with 20 μl of 6× sample reducing buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min to denature proteins. Proteins were separated on 4% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P; Sigma) membranes for Western analysis. Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (PY-20; Upstate Biotechnology), a polyclonal antibody against 3-nitrotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology) or polyclonal antibodies against the intracellular domain of EGFR (kindly donated by Drs. D. Cadena and G. N. Gill (clone 1964) and by Dr. J. Schlessinger (RK-2)), followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Antibodies were detected by diaminobenzidine staining (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). A431 plasma membranes were prepared from approximately 108 cells, which were washed with PBS and homogenized in 20 ml of HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4) at 4 °C by brief sonication. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unlysed cells, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 30 min, and the pellet containing plasma membranes was washed with PBS and finally resuspended in PBS at approximately 10 mg/ml protein (determined according to Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard) and stored at −80 °C until use. Plasma membranes were diluted to 1 mg/ml protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2 and 100 μm ATP, reacted with ONOO− or other oxidants, and solubilized for SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Similar experiments were performed with EGFR, purified from A431 cells by affinity chromatography (Sigma), which was suspended to 20 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 100 μm ATP. Aliquots of 50 μl were reacted with ONOO− (500 μm) before or after receptor stimulation with 20 nm EGF. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 6× sample reducing buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of EGFR from A431 cell lysates was performed using monoclonal α-EGFR antibody 528 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Mendelsohn), which was complexed with protein A-Sepharose (PAS; Sigma). The preformed PAS·mAb complex was washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5), and aliquots of the PAS·mAb (containing 4 μg of mAb 528) were incubated overnight with 200 μl of A431 cell lysate (up to 1 mg of protein) at 4 °C (31Goldkorn T. Mendelsohn J. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). The PAS·mAb receptor complex was washed three times with HNTG and mixed with 3× sample reducing buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. After treatment of A431 cells with EGF and/or ONOO–, cells were solubilized, and aliquots containing 2 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 2 μg of a monoclonal antibody against PLC-γ1 (clone D-7-3; Upstate Biotechnology) followed by incubation for 2 h with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The PAS-antibody complex was washed three times with HNTG buffer, boiled for 5 min in sample reducing buffer, and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with α-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) or with a polyclonal antibody against PLC-γ1 (Upstate Biotechnology). Cellular proteins were precipitated from cell lysates with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and washed twice with ethanol/ethyl acetate 50/50 (v/v) to remove contaminating lipids. Protein pellets were dissolved in 6 mHCl and hydrolyzed under vacuum for 24 h at 110 °C, after which hydrolysates were dried under N2 and reconstituted in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 3.0)/methanol (93/7) (v/v). Tyrosine and its oxidation products were analyzed by HPLC with tandem UV (274 nm) and fluorescence detection (excitation, 284 nm; emission, 410 nm) (3van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and quantitated by comparison with external standards. A431 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in six-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% newborn bovine serum and incubated for 24 h before the addition of ONOO−(after replacing the medium with modified PBS as described above; final volume 1 ml) or 20 nm EGF. Cell proliferation was assessed on four consecutive days after these treatments by collection of cells by trypsinization and cell counting using a hemocytometer. In separate experiments, cell viability was assessed 1 h after the addition of ONOO− using Alamar Blue® (Alamar Bioscience, Sacramento, CA), which is metabolized by respiring cells, resulting in increased absorbance at 600 nm. Cell viability was assessed by comparing A 600 for untreated cells (100% viable) with those of ONOO−-treated cells. The addition of 0.25–1.0 mmONOO– to subconfluent A431 cells in six-well plates (50,000 cells/well) caused only marginal loss of cell viability as determined using Alamar Blue®. Cell viability was decreased by 20–30%, measured 24 h after the addition of 1 mm ONOO–. As illustrated in Fig. 1, ONOO– causes inhibition of cell proliferation only when added at concentrations higher than 0.5 mm. Continuous stimulation of A431 cells with 5 nm EGF also resulted in inhibition of cell growth, as shown previously (32Gill G.N. Lazar C.S.

Thus, overstimulation of EGFR and the addition of ONOO– both cause a stress response in A431 cells that results in growth arrest and/or apoptosis (33McLeod C.L. Luk A. Castagnola J. Cronin M.

The addition of 0.1–1.5 mmONOO− to confluent A431 cells in 100-mm culture dishes caused a dose-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration of cellular proteins as detected by both HPLC and immunoblotting with an α-nitrotyrosine antibody. The 3-nitrotyrosine content in cellular proteins increased from <0.02 to 0.23 ± 0.06, 0.32 ± 0.06, and 0.65 ± 0.19 mmol/mol of tyrosine residues (n= 4) after the addition of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mmONOO−, respectively. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with α-nitrotyrosine also demonstrated dose-dependent nitration of various proteins including EGFR. Nitration of EGFR was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of EGFR (using mAb 528) followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with α-nitrotyrosine (Fig. 2 A). The EGFR in nonstimulated A431 cells is partly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, as detected with an α-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the extent of this basal autophosphorylation was only marginally but not significantly affected after exposure to ONOO− for 30 min (Fig. 2 B). Stimulation of A431 cells with 20 nm EGF for 10–30 min caused a dramatic increase in EGFR autophosphorylation, but EGF-induced autophosphorylation was not significantly affected after treatment of A431 cells with up to 1.5 mm ONOO− (not shown). Together, these results suggest that the extent of protein tyrosine nitration by nontoxic concentrations of ONOO− is not sufficient to cause significant alteration in EGFR autophosphorylation. Moreover, EGFR tyrosine residues other than the intracellular phosphorylation substrates may have been nitrated. Hence, unless certain tyrosine residues are preferentially nitrated, tyrosine nitration to an extent that is feasible in vivo (37Leeuwenburgh C. Hardy M.M. Hazen S.L. Wagner P. Oh-ishi S.

In similar recent studies, exposure of various cell types to ONOO− was found to cause variable changes in tyrosine phosphorylation as well as nitration of tyrosine residues, although these events could not be directly related (13Gow A.J.

Analysis of cell lysates of ONOO- exposed A431 cells by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of a large phosphorylated protein (approximately 340 kDa) that was not detected in untreated cells (Fig. 3). This protein was also detected by various polyclonal antibodies against EGFR (Fig. 3), indicating that this protein is a covalent aggregate of EGFR with one or more other proteins and most likely represents a homodimer of EGFR. The presumed EGFR dimer was also detected after immunoprecipitation of A431 lysates with mAb 528, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with PY-20 or α-EGFR antibodies. Control experiments showed that formation of this putative EGFR dimer was not due to pH changes after the addition of alkaline ONOO− solutions or to contaminating components in the ONOO− stock solution, since similar additions of either 1.2 m NaOH, previously decomposed ONOO−, or H2O2 were ineffective (Fig. 3). The putative EGFR homodimer was detectable within 1 min after the addition of ONOO− to A431 cells, and the extent of dimerization did not change significantly for at least 60 min after the addition of ONOO− (not shown), suggesting that EGFR dimerization occurs by direct chemical modification of EGFR, rather than via secondary intracellular pathways induced by ONOO−. This notion was confirmed by similar experiments with (partially) purified EGFR; the addition of ONOO− to either A431 plasma membranes or to purified EGFR also resulted in the formation of dimeric EGFR, as assessed by SDS-PAGE (not shown). Furthermore, EGFR dimerization was also detected after the addition of ONOO− to A431 cells at 4 °C, conditions that would have minimized metabolic pathways. The extracellular domain of EGFR contains cysteine-rich motifs (19Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and thiol-reactive reagents have been demonstrated to affect EGFR activation by modification of one or more cysteine-residues in the intracellular domain (25Clark S. Konstantopoulos N. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Estrada C. Gomez C. Martin-Nieto J. De Frutos T. Jimenez A. Villalobo A. Biochem.

Since cysteine residues represent important targets for ONOO− (29Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds might have been involved in EGFR cross-linking by ONOO−. However, SDS-PAGE analyses were performed under reducing conditions that would have cleaved intermolecular disulfide bonds. Furthermore, neither H2O2 (Fig. 3) nor the inflammatory oxidant HOCl (not shown), oxidants capable of oxidizing cysteine residues to the disulfide, were able to induce similar EGFR cross-linking, indicating that ONOO− acts by a unique mechanism distinct from these other oxidants. Characteristic products from reaction of ONOO− with cysteine residues may includeS-nitrosothiols (40Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Goodwin D.A. Read N.G. Zamora-Pino R. Feelisch M. Radomski M.W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30255-30262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which may somehow have been involved in ONOO−-induced EGFR cross-linking. However, the addition of 1 mm S-nitrosoglutathione to subconfluent A431 cells, which would be expected to cause the formation of protein S-nitrosothiols by transnitrosation reactions, did not result in EGFR dimerization, nor did it significantly affect EGFR autophosphorylation (not shown). ONOO−-induced EGFR dimerization and tyrosine nitration were both effectively inhibited in the presence of 1 mm GSH, although depletion of intracellular GSH by overnight preincubation of A431 cells with 100 μm buthionine sulfoximine to inhibit GSH synthesis (43White A.C. Das S.K. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) did not significantly affect the extent of EGFR cross-linking by ONOO−. This latter finding further substantiates that ONOO− causes EGFR cross-linking by direct receptor modification at the cell surface rather than by modifications of intracellular targets, which would be prevented by intracellular GSH. The EGF receptor contains 15 tyrosine residues in its extracellular region, some of which are exposed and involved in ligand binding (44Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Liberman T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar,45Woltjer R.L. Lukas T.J. Staros J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and hence may represent susceptible targets for oxidation by ONOO−. A major product of reaction of ONOO−with tyrosine residues is 3,3′-dityrosine, formed via combination of two tyrosyl radicals (3van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 4Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar); hence, EGFR could theoretically be covalently dimerized via intermolecular dityrosine cross-links. Proteins recovered from ONOO−-treated A431 cells were found to have increased levels of 3,3′-dityrosine, and protein 3,3′-dityrosine content and the extent of EGFR cross-linking were both found to increase proportionately with increasing concentrations of ONOO− (Fig. 4, Aand B), consistent with the notion that EGFR cross-linking is due to intermolecular dityrosine formation. Moreover, irreversible EGFR cross-linking was also observed after incubation of A431 cells with 100 μm H2O2 in the presence of HRP (Fig. 4 C), or other heme peroxidases such as myeloperoxidase (not shown). In the presence of these heme peroxidases, H2O2 is known to be capable of oxidizing tyrosine via a one-electron mechanism to form 3,3′-dityrosine (46Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 89-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no detectable covalent EGFR cross-linking was observed in response to H2O2 or HOCl, oxidants that are unable to cause significant oxidation of tyrosine to 3,3′-dityrosine. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest involvement of intermolecular 3,3′-dityrosine cross-links in covalent EGFR dimerization by ONOO− and HRP/H2O2. Formation of protein tyrosyl radicals was recently demonstrated in human blood plasma after reaction with ONOO− using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (47Pietraforte D. Minetti M. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As protein tyrosyl radicals can be relatively long lived with half-lives of up to several minutes, protein cross-linking by combination of two protein tyrosine radicals is highly feasible. Ligand-induced activation of EGFR is known to be mediated via receptor dimerization, which enhances ligand affinity (48Hurwitz D.R. Emanuel S.L. Nathan M.H. Sarver N. Ullrich A. Felder S. Lax I.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5258-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), which stimulates autocrine receptor activation and cell proliferation. The formation of dimerized EGFR during receptor activation has been visualized with the use of chemical cross-linking agents such as disuccinimidyl suberate, EDAC, or glutaraldehyde (21Cochet C.

The addition of 10 mm EDAC to unstimulated A431 cells was found to result in cross-linking of a small fraction of the EGFR population, reflecting basally activated EGFR by autocrine receptor stimulation. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that EDAC-cross-linked EGFR comigrates with the ONOO−-induced EGFR dimer, and EGFR-cross-linking by ONOO− and EDAC were found to be additive (Fig. 5 A). These findings indicate that both agents act by covalently cross-linking ligand-induced EGFR dimers. Similar results were also obtained with A431 plasma membranes treated with ONOO−, HRP/H2O2, or EDAC (not shown). Increased EGFR dimerization by cell stimulation with EGF has been demonstrated with the use of various cross-linking agents (21Cochet C. Kashles O. Chambaz E.M. Borrello I. King C.R. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3290-3295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Fanger B.O. Austin K.S. Earp H.S. Cidlowski J.A.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and was confirmed in the present study. The extent of ONOO−-induced EGFR cross-linking was similarly found to be enhanced after prestimulation of A431 cells with 20 nm EGF (Fig. 5 B). Additionally, significantly less EGFR cross-linking by ONOO− was detected after prolonged serum starvation of A431 cells, which diminishes EGFR activation and autophosphorylation. Finally, experiments in which receptor-bound ligands were removed by acid wash treatment revealed that, whereas EGF-dependent receptor autophosphorylation and dimerization was diminished after acid wash treatment, ONOO–-induced EGFR cross-linking could not be reversed (not shown). The apparent relationship between ligand-induced EGFR activation/dimerization and irreversible cross-linking by ONOO− or HRP/H2O2 suggests that these oxidant systems preferentially cross-link activated EGFR. Consistent with this notion, determination of the extent of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, by quantitation of immunostaining of monomeric and dimeric EGFR with either PY-20 or α-EGFR antibodies, demonstrated that covalently cross-linked EGFR, by either ONOO− or HRP/H2O2, was more extensively tyrosine-phosphorylated than the monomeric form (Fig. 6). Similarly, covalently cross-linked EGFR using EDAC has also been found to have a higher degree of autophosphorylation and possesses higher tyrosine kinase activity than the monomeric form (21Cochet C. Kashles O. Chambaz E.M. Borrello I. King C.R. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3290-3295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sorokin A. Lemmon M.A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is recognized, however, that this argument is based on assumed similar binding affinities of these antibodies to both the monomeric and dimeric form of EGFR. To study potential changes in EGFR signaling by exposure of A431 cells to ONOO–, we investigated the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of a downstream substrate for EGFR, PLC-γ1. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation displayed similar kinetics before or after exposure of A431 cells to ONOO–. At the same time, the kinetics of PLC-γ1 phosphorylation by EGF stimulation was dramatically affected by ONOO– preexposure, indicating significant changes in downstream signal propagation. As shown, thet 1/2 of EGF-induced phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 is increased from <1 min to 2–5 min after exposure to ONOO–. Analysis with an α-nitrotyrosine antibody indicated that exposure of A431 cells to up to 1 mmONOO– did not result in detectable tyrosine nitration of PLC-γ1, indicating that the altered kinetics of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to tyrosine nitration within the enzyme (not shown). Recently, H2O2 has also been shown to affect the kinetics of PLC-γ1 activation and its downstream signaling (54Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), indicating a general susceptibility of EGFR-mediated signaling pathways to oxidant stress. Therefore, the change in the kinetics of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation may be independent of covalent EGFR cross-linking by ONOO– and may represent additional effects of ONOO– on EGFR. Future studies are under way to more rigorously investigate the possible routes by which ONOO– and related oxidants may affect EGFR and its downstream signaling. In summary, the results in this study demonstrate that exposure of A431 cells to nontoxic concentrations of ONOO− or other oxidizing systems, such as H2O2 in the presence of heme peroxidases, causes formation of covalent EGFR dimers, most likely via intermolecular dityrosine cross-linking. Moreover, these oxidant systems appear to preferentially cross-link activated EGFR, as indicated by the enhanced degree of oxidant-induced covalent cross-linking after EGFR activation and by the increased extent of tyrosine autophosphorylation in covalent EGFR dimers. Hence, formation of inflammatory oxidants such as ONOO− or reactive intermediates formed by peroxidase-dependent mechanisms (55van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 56Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) may result in significant covalent modification and dimerization of EGFR. Although it is too early to speculate on the potential implications of such EGFR modifications by inflammatory oxidants, covalent EGFR dimerization may be of particular significance in conditions of increased EGFR expression and activation, such as after epithelial injury or in malignant tumors (57Hendler F.J. Ozanne B.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 58Veale D. Kerr N. Gibson J. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1313-1317PubMed Google Scholar), situations that are also commonly associated with increased production of NO⋅ and/or inflammatory oxidants. Irreversible EGFR dimerization may conceivably affect receptor activation and downstream signaling and could thereby alter epithelial repair processes or tumor development."

Translational control plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. The initiation phase of translation is one of the points at which changes in the rate of protein synthesis occur (1Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 1-29Google Scholar). Initiation of translation begins with dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into 40 and 60 S subunits. The 40 S subunit then binds a ternary complex consisting of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2),1 GTP, and methionyl-tRNAi (Met-tRNAi). This 40 S preinitiation complex recognizes the m7G-capped 5′ end of a mRNA, binds to the mRNA, and scans toward the 3′ end until it forms a stable complex at the first AUG initiation codon. Subsequently, the 60 S subunit joins to form the 80 S initiation complex. The various reactions in the initiation pathway are promoted by 11 or more soluble proteins called eIFs (2Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar, 3Pain V.M. Eur. J.

It binds to 40 S ribosomal subunits, thereby preventing 60 S association and promoting dissociation of 80 S ribosomes (4Goumans H. Thomas A. Verhoeven A. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Biochim. Biophys.

Similarly, the genes for the eight subunits of yeast eIF3 have been identified (22Hershey J.W.B. Asano K. Naranda T. Vornlocher H.-P. Hanachi P. Merrick W.C. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cloning of the cDNAs or genes encoding eIF3 subunits provides structural information about the factor and enables researchers to develop tools to better characterize its structure/function. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of the cDNAs encoding eIF3-p44 and eIF3-p35, provide evidence that these subunits are part of the eIF3 complex, and show that the p44 subunit, which contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), binds RNA. This report completes descriptions of the cloning of cDNAs encoding the 10 eIF3 subunits, thereby providing a firm base for further structural work on this important initiation factor. eIF3 was purified from HeLa S3 cells essentially as described (14Brown-Luedi M.L. Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Yau M.-P.P. Corbett S. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4202-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bands corresponding to the p44 and p35 subunits were excised and digested with Lys-C protease in the gel. Following high performance liquid chromatography fractionation, N-terminal sequences of internal peptides were obtained by automated Edman degradation in the Protein Structure Laboratory (University of California, Davis). The sequences (shown byblack overlines in Figs. 1 and 4) were used to search for matching sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information EST (expressed sequence tag) data base using the TBLASTN program (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar).Figure 4Comparison of the human eIF3-p35 amino acid sequence with its homolog in yeast. The amino acid sequence of human eIF3-p35 is aligned with its yeast homolog (SwissProt identification no. Q05775) by procedures described in the legend to Fig. 1. Identical and similar residues are shown with blackand gray backgrounds, respectively. Theblack bars indicate peptides used for BLAST searches.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mouse ESTs matching p44 peptide sequences were found and used to identify overlapping EST clones (GenBank accession numbers AA109090,AA270800, and W18370), and a hypothetical cDNA for mouse eIF3-p44 was assembled. The deduced amino acid sequence was used in a TBLASTN search to identify matching human EST clones. The longest clone (identification no. 293583) was purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD) as a 1,237-bp insert in pT7T3D-PAC and sequenced. The length of the open reading frame and comparison to the closely related mouse cDNA sequence suggested that the clone lacked about 100 codons from the N-terminal coding region. To obtain the missing coding sequences, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was used with a Marathon Ready cDNA library from pancreas (CLONTECH) as template and primers AP1 (CLONTECH) and 1 (Table I). A PCR product of ∼650 bp containing the amplified 5′ end was ligated into pNoTA (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and sequenced. To obtain full-length cDNA for eIF3-p44, the insert in pNoTA was cut with ApaI and HindIII and the ApaI/HindIII fragment from pT7T3D-PAC was inserted into the pNoTA vector to yield pNo44–7. The sequence was submitted to GenBank as human eIF3-p44 cDNA (accession number U96074).Table IPrimers used in cloning and analysis of eIF3-p44 and -p35Primer numberPrimer sequence1GGCTCTAGCTCTCCCGGCAGCTT2CCCGAATTCCATATGCCTACTGGGGACTTTGA3CCCGAATTCCCATGGCTACTGGGGACTTTGATTC4CCCCTCGAGTTAGTTGGTGGACGGCTTGG5TCATCTCTTGAAGATGGGTTCATAGCA6TAGCAGATAAACTGCGGCTAAAGA7CCCGAATTCCATATGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCG8CCCGAATTCCCATGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCG9CCCAAGCTTTCACATGAAGTCTTCATAGTCTT10CCCCTCGAGTACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGTAGC11CCCGGTACCTAATGATCCTTCCGCAGGTTCACC Open table in a new tab For eIF3-p35, searching the EST data base with the C-proximal peptide (Fig. 4) identified a human clone with 12 of 15 amino acids matching, namely Z25214 (clone identification no. HSBA6A022). By searching with the cDNA sequence, a human clone, W05832 (clone identification no. 299811), was identified and purchased from ATCC as an insert in pT7T3D-PAC. The 2,223-bp insert was sequenced on both strands. To obtain a full-length coding region, 5′-RACE was employed as described above with primers AP1 and 5 (Table I) to yield DNA encoding the 5′ region. PCR was used with primers AP2 (CLONTECH) and 5, and with primers 6 and M13 univ, to amplify 530 and 2,088 bp overlapping DNAs, which together extend from the 5′ end of the RACE product to the 3′-terminus of the insert in pT7T3D-PAC. Amplification of the two PCR products (100–200 ng each) resulted in a 2,443-bp PCR product that was ligated into pNoTA to yield pNo35F2. The sequence was submitted to GenBank as human eIF3-p35 cDNA (accession numberU97670). Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells using the RNeasy Midi total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). RNA was subjected to 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, New York1987Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a 1-h downward capillary blot procedure (25Chomczynski P. Mackey K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Probes corresponding to the coding regions of eIF3-p44 (bp 420–829) and eIF3-p35 (bp 307–824) were obtained by PCR amplification and were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) using the Multiprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were pre-hybridized 4 h at 42 °C in hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS), hybridized overnight (hybridization buffer plus 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and ∼1 × 107 cpm probe), and washed once in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, twice in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, and twice in 0.25× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min. RNA binding was visualized by autoradiography. The 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. For expression of His-tagged p44 and p35 in E. coli, the initiation codon regions were modified via PCR to contain the restriction site NdeI at the 5′ end (p44, primer 2; p35, primer 7; see Table I) and XhoI (p44, primer 4) orHindIII (p35, primer 9) restriction sites downstream of the stop codon, respectively. PCR-amplified full-length DNAs were digested (NdeI/XhoI for p44 and NdeI/HindIII for p35) and subcloned into pET28c (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate pET-NHp44 and pET-NHp35. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with each of the plasmids, and synthesis of the tagged protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. N(His)6-p44 and N(His)6-p35 were purified from the corresponding lysates using His-bind resin (Novagen) under native conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. The 5′ ends of the inserts in pNo44–7 and pNo35F2 were modified via PCR to containNcoI sites at their initiation codons (p44, primer 3; p35, primer 8) and XhoI and HindIII sites, respectively, at the 3′ ends (as described above). When subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI or HindIII sites of pET28c, no (His)6 tag is added, but the upstream T7 RNA polymerase promoter allows for efficient transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. One microgram each of the resulting plasmids, pET-T7p44 and pET-T7p35, was transcribed and translated in vitro at 30 °C for 60 min with the T7 TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) containing translation grade [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). Radiolabeled products (1–2-μl aliquots) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and exposure to X-Omat film for 16–24 h. Purified N(His)6-p44 and N(His)6-p35 (50–100 μg) subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE were used to affinity-purifiy specific antibodies from 200 μl of crude goat anti-eIF3 antiserum (26Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) essentially as described previously (19Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For affinity purification of eIF3-p170 and eIF3-p66 antibodies, the p170 and p66 bands from ∼25 μg of purified HeLa eIF3 were used. HeLa S3 cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm KCl, 1.3 mm magnesium acetate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Equal amounts of protein (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane, and the blots were incubated with either crude goat serum containing anti-eIF3 antibodies (1:1,000) or affinity-purified antibodies (1:100). Bands were revealed by incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat IgG, Cappel/Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) followed by subsequent colorimetric (nitro tetrazolium blue and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) or chemiluminescent (Immun-Star substrate, Bio-Rad) detection. The untagged or N(His)6-p44 and N(His)6-p35 proteins were radiolabeled with the in vitro transcription and translation system described above. HeLa lysate, purified human eIF3, and individual recombinant eIF3 subunits were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were washed repeatedly with Protein Binding Buffer (PBB = 20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 50 or 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), incubated for 3 h with PBB containing 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C, and probed overnight at 4 °C with the radiolabeled reticulocyte lysates in 10 ml of PBB containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Blots were washed eight times for 10 min each with 10 ml of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBB (28Yao F. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8158-8168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to film. HeLa S3 cells from six 100-mm tissue culture dishes were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (described above) and clarified. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were pre-incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the appropriate antibody in lysis buffer. After removing unbound antibody, 500 μg of the HeLa lysate was incubated with 10 μl of the pre-incubated protein G beads for 2 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. Beads were removed from the “supernatant” by centrifugation and washed three times with an equal volume of 300 mm KCl lysis buffer. Bound proteins (“eluate”) were obtained by heating at 90 °C for 5 min in 20 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins in the supernatant were concentrated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The eluate and aliquots of supernatant containing 75 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting as described above. Full-length human rDNA was PCR-amplified with primers 10 and 11 (Table I) from genomic DNA prepared from BJAB cells (a B cell lymphoma cell line). The PCR product was cloned into pNoTA to yield pNo18Sh, sequenced from both ends, and a 1.8-kbXhoI/Asp718I fragment was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pSP73 (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield pSP18Sh. This plasmid was linearized with Asp718I for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Maxiscript SP6/T7 kit, Ambion, The Woodlands, TX) and [α-32P]UTP. In addition to full-length 18 S rRNA, the transcript carries eight additional nucleotides at the 5′ end encoded by pSP73. Xenopusβ-globin mRNA was prepared as described previously (29Wei C.-L. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5764-5771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and transcribed with SP6 as described above. Purified eIF3 (∼5 μg), rc-eIF3-p44, and rc-eIF3-p66 were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF. The membrane was prehybridized in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 75 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS (pH 7.5)) plus 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA for 20 min. The blot was then hybridized in binding buffer plus yeast tRNA and RNase inhibitor with the 32P-labeled 18 S rRNA or β-globin mRNA (107 cpm) for 30 min, washed three times for 5 min each in binding buffer, and subjected to autoradiography, and subsequently to staining or Western immunoblotting. To clone the cDNA encoding the p44 subunit of eIF3, a preparation of purified HeLa eIF3 was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and the band corresponding to eIF3-p44 was excised and used to obtain partial peptide sequences. As described in detail under “Experimental Procedures,” the peptide sequences were used to search the EST data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and finally, three overlapping human ESTs encoding one of the partial peptides were identified. The longest of these, clone 293583, was sequenced but lacked DNA encoding the N-terminal ∼100 amino acids, as concluded from comparison to the mouse protein sequence deduced from overlapping ESTs. The missing 5′-region of the cDNA was obtained by the 5′-RACE procedure with a human pancreas cDNA library to yield DNA that codes for the N-terminal region and the putative initiator codon. DNA encoding the entire eIF3-p44 was constructed in pNoTA to yield pNo44–7, and the nucleotide sequence was deposited in the GenBank data base. The cloned cDNA insert in pNo44–7 comprises 1,115 bp with a 963-bp open reading frame that encodes a putative 35,694 Da protein of 320 amino acids (Fig. 1). The two peptide sequences mentioned above are found within the p44 sequence (identified with black overlines in Fig. 1). The 5′-UTR of the cDNA contains 9 bp, whereas the 3′-UTR contains 96 bp plus another 47 A residues that are preceded by the sequence AATAA 20 bp upstream. This sequence presumably serves as the polyadenylation signal. Northern blot analysis of HeLa total RNA identifies a major RNA species migrating at ∼1.4 kb (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the cloned cDNA is not full-length, lacking a substantial portion likely at the 5′ end. Nevertheless, the putative AUG initiation codon (residues 10–12) is very likely correctly identified, as the next in-frame AUG codon is far downstream, corresponding to amino acid residue 128. In addition, a nearly identical mouse cDNA (GenBank accession no. AA109090) corresponding to the 5′ end of eIF3-p44 DNA contains an in-frame termination codon 4 codons upstream from the putative initiator AUG. Comparison of the human eIF3-p44 amino acid sequence with translated overlapping mouse EST sequences, using the GAP program (GCG, Madison, WI), indicates that the mouse and human proteins share 97% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1). The human eIF3-p44 amino acid sequence is also homologous to the eIF3-p33 subunit from the yeast S. cerevisiae, sharing 33% sequence identity and 42% similarity. As seen from Fig. 1, eIF3-p44 shares a fair amount of sequence identity and similarity with its homologs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Caenorhabditis elegans, where highly conserved regions are potentially important for function or structure. A Prosite search identifies several potential phosphorylation sites and a consensus RRM (30Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) in the C-terminal quarter of the protein. The RNP1 and RNP2 motifs are located between residues 280–287 and 241–246, respectively, and are identified with gray linesabove them in Fig. 1. Two experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that the cloned cDNA encodes the p44 subunit of eIF3. The coding region of pNo44–7 was inserted into pET28c (an E. coli expression vector) such that the final product contains an N-terminal 6-histidine tag. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” N(His)6-p44 was expressed and the tagged protein was purified by Ni2+affinity chromatography. The resulting recombinant tagged p44 subunit was used to affinity-purify anti-p44 antibodies present in crude goat serum containing anti-eIF3 antibodies. After SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of purified eIF3 and HeLa lysate, the affinity-purified anti-p44 antibodies generate a band corresponding to the p44 subunit in purified eIF3 (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2) and a weak band with the same mobility in a HeLa lysate (data not shown). Furthermore, coupledin vitro transcription of pET-T7p44 (no His6tag) with T7 RNA polymerase and translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate with [35S]methionine, results in a radiolabeled protein of 44 kDa that comigrates with eIF3-p44 (Fig. 3 C, lane 1). Together with the finding that eIF3-p44 is homologous to yeast eIF3-p33, these results provide strong evidence that the cloned cDNA encodes eIF3-p44. When eIF3 was first purified from rabbit reticulocytes in the mid-1970s, the p35 subunit was recognized as a protein only weakly bound to the complex (12Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not p35 is a true subunit of eIF3, we sought to clone its cDNA by reverse genetics as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” A 2.4-kb DNA was obtained that contains a long open reading frame and putative AUG initiation codon. A 32P-labeled 517-bp probe derived from the coding region of the DNA sequence (bp 367–898) was used in Northern blot analysis. A major RNA species migrating at ∼2.4 kb hybridizes to the probe (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the constructed cDNA encodes essentially the entire mRNA. The cDNA was inserted into pNoTA to yield pNo35F2. pNo35F2 contains a 2,443-bp insert with a 774-bp open reading frame that encodes a putative 28,989-Da protein of 258 amino acids (Fig. 4). All three sequenced peptides (indicated by black bars in Fig. 4) are found within the amino acid sequence. The 5′-UTR of the cDNA insert contains 60 bp, whereas the 3′-UTR is unusually long, containing 1,584 bp. The insert ends with a string of 21 A residues preceded by two overlapping potential polyadenylation signals (AATAA) 22–25 bp upstream. The nucleotide sequence was deposited in the GenBank data base as human eIF3-p35 cDNA. Identification of the initiation codon indicated in Fig. 4 is based on the fact that the next in-frame AUG occurs 148 codons downstream, whereas no in-frame AUG is found upstream in the 5′-UTR. Furthermore, as shown below, translation originating at this AUG generates a protein that co-migrates with authentic eIF3-p35 during SDS-PAGE. A data base search at the EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute, EMBL Outstation, Hinxton, United Kingdom), using the BLITZ program and eIF3-p35 as query, identifies a yeast protein of 265 amino acids (SwissProt identification no. Q05775), which shows 26.7% identity and 42% similarity to p35 when analyzed with the GCG GAP program. The uncharacterized yeast protein is similar to GVPD (gas vesicle protein D) from Halobacterium halobium. A Prosite search of eIF3-p35 identifies several potential phosphorylation sites (not shown). To prove that the cloned eIF3-p35 cDNA encodes the p35 subunit, the coding region was inserted into the pET28c vector, expressed in E. coli, and the (His)6-tagged protein was Ni2+ affinity-purified. The recombinant protein was then used to affinity-purify anti-p35 antibodies present in the crude goat serum containing anti-eIF3 antibodies. Immunoblot analysis of both purified eIF3 and HeLa lysate (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively) shows a single reactive band that comigrates with the p35 subunit of eIF3. To demonstrate that the cloned cDNA contains the full-length coding region for p35,in vitro transcription/translation of the cDNA was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of pET-T7p35 yields a single radiolabeled protein that precisely comigrates with eIF3-p35 (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). The results show that the cloned p35 cDNA encodes the p35 subunit of eIF3. Even though the eIF3-p44 and -p35 subunits co-purify with other eIF3 subunits, it is necessary to show that they are indeed components of the eIF3 complex as opposed to contaminants that co-purify. Toward this end, we have used co-immunoprecipitation and Far Western analyses to examine whether or not p44 and p35 are part of the complex or can bind other eIF3 subunits in vitro. eIF3 complexes were immunoprecipitated from a HeLa cell lysate with anti-eIF3 serum and with affinity-purified anti-p170 antibodies. The high specificity of the affinity-purified anti-p170 antibodies is shown in Fig. 5 (lanes 8 and 9, which contain eIF3 and HeLa lysate, respectively). As shown in Fig. 5 A (lane 3), the affinity-purified anti-p170 antibodies clearly immunoprecipitate p170, p116, p110, p47, p40, and maybe p35. Because the titer of antibodies to p44 is low in the crude anti-eIF3 serum, detection of p44 was problematic. Therefore, aliquots of the immunoprecipitated sample were subjected to Western blotting and incubation with affinity-purified antibodies to p44 and p35. As shown in Fig. 5, B (lane 4) and C(lane 2), affinity-purified p170 antibodies co-immunoprecipitate p44 and p35, respectively, from HeLa lysates. These results indicate that p44 and p35 are part of the eIF3 complex. The presence of p35 in both the eluate and supernatant fractions suggests that p35 partially dissociates from the eIF3 complex under the stringent assay conditions. A demonstration that a putative subunit interacts directly with an authentic eIF3 subunit supports the view that it may be a part of the eIF3 complex. Far Western analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to look for possible direct protein-protein interactions of p44 and p35 with eIF3 subunits. Radiolabeled p44 and p35 probes were prepared by in vitrotranslation and were incubated with blots containing eIF3 subunits fractionated by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 6 A (lane 2), recombinant 35S-labeled p44 binds most strongly to the p170 subunit, less so to p116/110 and p66, and most weakly to itself (p44) and p40. Comparable analysis of a HeLa lysate shows that 35S-labeled p44 binds specifically to a 170-kDa protein (lane 3). The other bands in lane 3 also are seen when the lysate is probed with a radioactive reticulocyte lysate lacking mRNA template (lane 7) and therefore are considered artifacts. To confirm interactions of eIF3-p44 with some of the other eIF3 subunits, 35S-labeled p44 was incubated with a membrane containing purified, recombinant, His-tagged p40 and p44 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4). The probe binds to both recombinant proteins, confirming that p44 binds both to itself and to p40 under these conditions. To check for specificity, green fluorescent protein was used as a probe against purified eIF3 (Fig. 6 C, lane 1) and yielded no interactions. In addition, Novex markers were run as a negative control. For all experiments, except those using p35 as a probe (see paragraph below), no interactions are detected, as shown in Fig. 6 C (lane 2). Far Western analysis showed that 35S-labeled p35 binds to nearly all the subunits of eIF3 (Fig. 6 A, lane 4), and to a vast number of proteins in the HeLa lysate (lane 5). Analyses under more stringent conditions, such as higher salt concentrations or increasing the amount of detergent, do not result in fewer bands (data not shown). The results indicate that eIF3-p35 is a very “sticky” protein, making the Far Western blotting approach unfeasible for this subunit. Nevertheless, it is possibly significant that especially strong binding to p170 and p66 occurs, whereas no binding to p48, p47, or p36 is detected. Since eIF3-p44 contains a consensus RRM and other eIF3 subunits and initiation factors have been shown to bind RNA, we wished to determine whether or not p44 binds RNA in vitro. To accomplish this aim, we employed Northwestern blot analysis. rc-eIF3-p66, rc-eIF3-p44, and purified eIF3 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and incubated with32P-labeled 18 S rRNA or β-globin mRNA. eIF3-p66 had been shown previously to bind 18 S rRNA (31Nygard O. Westermann P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and was therefore regarded as a positive control. Proteins in purified eIF3 corresponding to p170, p66, and p44 bind to both 18 S rRNA and β-globin mRNA (Figs. 7, A and B, lane 1). Recombinant p66 and p44 also bind to either of the radiolabeled probes (lanes 2 and 3). The identities of the three RNA-binding subunits seen with purified eIF3 are established by immunoblotting the membrane used in panel A with affinity-purified antibodies to eIF3-p170, -p66, and -p44 (Fig. 7 C). Proteins in the gel that bind RNA also react with the appropriate antibodies. Recombinant p44 appears to bind the 18 S ribosomal RNA ∼4 times more strongly than recombinant p66 (as calculated using a PhosphorImager (STORM 860; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA)), whereas rc-p44 and rc-p66 bind β-globin mRNA with equal intensity, comparable to what is seen when eIF3 subunits are probed (lane 1). It is noteworthy that p170 binds both RNAs, since the p170 sequence contains no discernible RNA-binding motif. The RNA binding activities appear to be specific because other proteins on the membrane do not bind to the RNA probe. However, one cannot determine absolute affinities with the Northwestern blotting procedure because this method may yield similar extents of binding even when binding affinities differ substantially. We have cloned and characterized cDNAs encoding human eIF3-p44 and eIF3-p35. The following facts indicate that the cloned cDNAs indeed encode the two subunits of human eIF3. In vitrotranscription and translation of the cDNAs in reticulocyte lysates result in radiolabeled protein products that comigrate in SDS-PAGE with the corresponding subunits in a purified preparation of eIF3. Antibodies from a crude anti-eIF3 goat antiserum that were affinity-purified with recombinant p44 and p35 overexpressed in E. coli specifically recognize the cognate protein in purified eIF3 and in HeLa lysates (Fig. 3 B). In addition, partial peptide sequences for p44 and p35 match regions in the amino acid sequences deduced from the cloned cDNAs. Two different approaches were used to prove that p44 and p35 are part of the eIF3 complex. First, co-immunoprecipitation of eIF3 subunits with affinity-purified antibodies to the p170 subunit was performed. The results show that both p44 and p35 are co-immunoprecipitated with the p170 antibodies. Far Western analyses were then used to demonstrate that p44 and p35 interact with other eIF3 subunits.35S-Labeled p44 binds strongly and specifically not only to the p170 subunit in purified eIF3, but also to a 170-kDa protein in a HeLa lysate. The labeled probe also appears to bind unresolved p116/p110, p66, and more weakly to itself and to p40 (Fig. 6 A). The weak interactions were confirmed with purified recombinant p44 and p40. Further support for these findings comes from preliminary yeast two-hybrid data, which show human eIF3-p44 interacts with p170, p116, p110, p44, and p40. 2H.-P. Vornlocher, unpublished observations. Unfortunately, Far Western analysis is not a useful tool for studying proteins interacting with p35, because the protein is unusually sticky and binds to nearly everything on the membrane, even at high stringency. A Prosite search with eIF3-p44 identifies several potential protein kinase C and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, myristoylation sites, and glycosylation sites (not shown). An RRM consensus sequence (30Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) close to the C terminus of the protein also is apparent. Northwestern analysis shows that p44 binds 18 S rRNA and β-globin mRNA (Fig. 7) and therefore appears to be a nonspecific RNA-binding protein. Our Northwestern analyses show for the first time that eIF3-p170 also binds RNA even though no RNA-binding motif is discernible, and confirms that eIF3-p116, the human homolog of yeast eIF3-p90 (Prt1), does not bind RNA (18Méthot N. Rom E. Olsen H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) under these conditions. eIF3-p44 is homologous with yeast eIF3-p33, with which it shares 33% sequence identity and 42% similarity, especially in the region containing the RRM (Fig. 1). Yeast eIF3-p33 binds RNA and this activity is destroyed when the RRM is deleted. 3P. Hanachi, J. W. B. Hershey, and H.-P. Vornlocher, submitted for publication. Although yeast eIF3 functionally replaces human eIF3 in a methionyl-puromycin synthesis assay (15Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), p44 does not complement a p33 yeast knock-out.3Similar failures to complement have been reported for the human p170 (32Valasek L.

Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) subunits, suggesting that there is considerable divergence in the overall structures of yeast and human eIF3. Yeast eIF3-p33 has been shown to interact with both the p39 (homolog of human p36) and p90 (homolog of human p116) subunits (34Verlhac M.H. Chen R.H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R.

L. Block, unpublished observations. The interaction of p44 with p116 seen by both the Far Western and two-hybrid analyses appears to be conserved, however. A precise determination of the composition and subunit stoichiometry of both human and yeast eIF3 remains to be made. The identification of subunit-subunit interactions, some of which are defined above, contributes to elucidating the structure of eIF3. Further such experiments are in progress and exploit the availability of the cloned cDNAs reported here.

The clamp in turn loads DNA polymerases (pol) δ and ε to form the corresponding holoenzymes, which play an essential role in replication of eukaryotic chromosomal DNA and in several DNA repair pathways.

Neither of these modifications impaired the clamp loading activity of the recombinant RF-C. Using gel filtration techniques, we demonstrated that RF-C dissociated from the DNA after clamp loading or pol δ holoenzyme assembly, while PCNA or PCNA·pol δ complex remained bound to DNA. PCNA catalytically loaded onto the template-primer was sufficient by itself to tether pol δ and stimulate DNA replication. The readdition of RF-C to the isolated PCNA·DNA complex did not further stimulate pol δ DNA synthesis.

Many of these proteins bind to the same “front” side of PCNA trimer (32Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol.

Biochemical studies on the roles of RF-C and PCNA in DNA replication suggest that PCNA is loaded onto DNA by RF-C in a reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis. The resulting complex, called sliding clamp, in turn tethers pol δ or pol ε to form the corresponding holoenzymes that are capable of efficient DNA synthesis (34Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3883-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Lee S.-H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since pol δ and pol ε, as well as PCNA and RF-C, have been implicated in both DNA replication and repair, the same mechanism used to assemble rapid processive DNA replication machinery (39Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) is also used for short patch repair synthesis, where processivity of pol does not seem to be essential. The terms “sliding clamp” and “pol holoenzyme” are borrowed from studies of prokaryotic DNA replication factors (41Huang C.-C. Hearst J.E. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4087-4094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 43Young M.C.

The exact protein composition of the eukaryotic complexes has not been determined. RF-C itself has a significant affinity for DNA (35Lee S.-H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 37Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Podust V.N. Georgaki A.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As a result, previous studies did not resolve unambiguously whether, after the clamp-loading reaction, PCNA and RF-C form a tertiary complex with DNA or whether these proteins bind independently to the same template (PCNA topologically and RF-C directly through its affinity for DNA). Consequently, the potential role of RF-C, bound to the same template as PCNA, in tethering pol δ core to the DNA and facilitating the activity of pol δ holoenzyme remains unknown. The DNA binding activity of RF-C has been mapped, at least in part, to the p140 subunit. Numerous laboratories have reported cDNA clones encoding DNA-binding proteins (see e.g. data base accession numbers L14922, U01222, U07157, U36441, and X72711), all of which turned out to encode the large subunit of RF-C (46Bunz F. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11014-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One DNA binding domain of p140 has been mapped to the ligase homology domain (47Burbelo P.D. Utani A. Pan Z.Q. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the N-terminal half of the p140 subunit, including this domain, was found to be dispensable for assembly of the five-subunit RF-C complex and for clamp loading activity (49Uhlmann F. Cai J.

Two modifications of recombinant human RF-C have been designed that enable us to track the fate of RF-C after loading of PCNA onto DNA. First, the RF-C subunit p37 was tagged with a protein kinase A recognition motif (55Li B.-L. Langer J.A. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), so that the recombinant five-subunit RF-C complex could be32P-labeled and quantitatively detected in femtomolar amounts. Second, the RF-C complex was assembled with a truncated p140 subunit lacking the N-terminal DNA binding domain to reveal whether specific protein-protein interactions retain RF-C on DNA. The results presented below demonstrate that RF-C dissociates from PCNA after loading and is not required to tether pol δ to the clamp. Purification procedures for calf thymus pol δ (56Weiser T.

Recombinant baculoviruses encoding nonfused RF-C subunits (called v140, v40, v38, v37, and v36) and N-terminal His tag-fused subunits (v40-his and v36-his) have been described (53Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An N-terminal truncation of p140 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using forward primer dCCGCGGATCCGCCATGGATTTCAAGGAGCAGG, backward primer dGTGAGAATCAGCTTTGGC, and pSK/RFC140 as a template. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting 550-base pair fragment was ligated into pVL1393 plasmid, followed by the insertion of the 2058-base pairEcoRI/PstI fragment of RFC140. The resulting plasmid encoded the C-terminal p140 open reading frame, beginning with an engineered Met start codon immediately preceding the codon for Asp554 of the p140 subunit. Baculovirus derived from this plasmid was called v140-Δ. An artificial sequence phosphorylatable by protein kinase A was introduced at the N terminus of p37 using the same strategy as for PCNA-ph (58Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The plasmid pVL1393/RFC37 was partially digested with NdeI and dephosphorylated, and the linearized DNA was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Two oligonucleotides, dTATGAGAAGAGCAAGTGT and dTAACACTTGCTCTTCTCA, were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed to each other, and ligated into the linearized pVL1393/RFC37 plasmid. The plasmid DNA from transformed clones was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with primers dTATGAGAAGAGCAAGTGT (sense strand of the insert) and dACACGGCTTCCCATCTGAG (antisense strand of the p37 cDNA). A positive clone yielding a polymerase chain reaction product of 477 base pairs was further analyzed by sequencing. It encoded the p37 subunit fused to 18 amino acids MRRASVNTCSSHMRRASV carrying two potential phosphorylation sites (underlined). A recombinant baculovirus derived from this plasmid was called v37-ph. Growth and maintenance of Sf9 and High Five insect cells (ITC Biotechnology GmbH) in monolayer cultures, preparation of recombinant baculoviruses, and infection of the cells were performed as described (53Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RF-C and RF-C-Δ were expressed by infection of insect cells with v140 (or v140-Δ), v40-his, v38, v37, and v36. RF-C-ph and RF-C-Δ-ph were expressed by infection of insect cells with v140 (or v140-Δ), v40-his, v38, v37-ph, and v36-his. 4.2 × 108 High Five cells were infected for 48 h with the five corresponding viruses, harvested, and lysed in 12 ml of buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) containing 0.35 m NaCl. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction bound to 300 μl of Ni-NTA resin. The suspension was mixed for 2 h at 4 °C, and the resin was pelleted by centrifugation, packed into a column, and washed with 4 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm imidazole-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted with 1.5 ml of buffer C (300 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.3 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The eluate was diluted 6-fold with buffer Q (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of NaCl from 0 to 350 mm in buffer Q and collected in 0.4-ml fractions. Reaction mixtures (final volume of 25 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 0.2 mg/ml BSA; 1 mm DTT; 10 mm MgCl2; 1 mm ATP; a 50 μm concentration each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 15 μm [α-32P]dCTP (5000 cpm/pmol); 100 ng of primed ssDNA; 100 ng of PCNA; 1.2 μg of E. coli SSB; 0.3 units of pol δ; and RF-C as indicated in the figures. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and acid-insoluble material was analyzed by scintillation counting. For product length analysis, the reactions were terminated by treating them with proteinase K (60 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS and 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis on an alkaline 1.5% agarose gel, followed by autoradiography. Reaction mixtures (final volume of 40 μl) contained 30 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9); 0.25 mg/ml BSA; 1 mm DTT; 7 mm magnesium acetate; 40 mm creatine phosphate; 4 mm ATP; a 0.2 mm concentration each of UTP, GTP, and CTP; a 50 μm concentration each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 15 μm [α-32P]dCTP (11,000 cpm/pmol); 250 ng of pUC-HS; 1 μg of creatine kinase; 300 ng of PCNA; 280 ng of RP-A; 100 ng of topoisomerase I; 3 μg of T antigen; 0.1 unit of pol α-primase; 0.3 units of pol δ; and RF-C as indicated in the figures. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by treating them with proteinase K in the presence of SDS and EDTA. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis on an alkaline 1.5% agarose gel, followed by autoradiography. For nonradioactive phosphorylation, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 20 μm ATP, 10 units of PK, and 800 fmol of RF-C-Δ-ph. For32P labeling of proteins, reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.5 units of PK, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 4.2 pmol of PCNA-ph or 800 fmol of RF-C-ph. The mixture with PCNA-ph was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, while the mixture with RF-C-ph was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. 5 μl (2.1 pmol) of [32P]PCNA-ph and 1 μl (80 fmol) of [32P]RF-C-ph were immediately used for gel filtration experiments. The rest of the reaction mixture was treated by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1% and heating at 95 °C. This material, containing known concentrations of PCNA-ph and RF-C-ph, was used to determine the specific radioactivity of these proteins. The clamp-loading reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mmDTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 168 fmol (400 ng) of primed ssDNA, 4.8 μg of E. coli SSB, 2.1 pmol of [32P]PCNA-ph, and 80 fmol of [32P]RF-C-Δ-ph (or 500 fmol of [32P]RF-C-ph). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 4 min at 37 °C and immediately loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-15 m column (0.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer G (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Chromatography was performed at room temperature (23–25 °C) with buffer G, and three-drop fractions (∼180 μl) were collected. Aliquots of these fractions and standard amounts of [32P]PCNA-ph and [32P]RF-C-ph were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Reaction mixtures (final volume of 100 μl) contained 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 400 ng of primed ssDNA, 4.8 μg of E. coli SSB, 4.9 pmol of PCNA, and 80 fmol of RF-C-Δ. Samples were incubated for 4 min at 37 °C and then loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-15m column (0.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer G. Collected fractions were immediately placed on ice. 100-μl aliquots of these fractions were supplemented to give a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml BSA; a 50 μmconcentration each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 15 μm[α-32P]dCTP (5000 cpm/pmol); and 1.2 units of pol δ. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and products were analyzed by scintillation counting or alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined by densitometric scanning of Coomassie-stained protein bands in denaturing polyacrylamide gels using Image Store 7500 (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc.). As protein standards, known amounts of BSA were loaded onto the same gel. We demonstrated previously that the N termini of three RF-C subunits, p40, p37, and p36, could be His-tagged without interfering detectably with assembly and activity of RF-C complexes (53Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 63Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Ott R. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12935-12942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fusion of a His tag to the p40 subunit was found to be the most convenient for analytical purposes. The RF-C complex assembled with p40-his and purified using Ni-NTA resin and Mono Q chromatography could be resolved by SDS-PAGE into five distinct equimolar bands (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 3). Assembly of RF-C with p37-his or p36-his resulted in a minor analytical disadvantage, in that the small RF-C subunits overlapped on SDS-PAGE (Ref. 53Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and data not shown). Therefore, we prepared p140·p40-his·p38·p37·p36 complex as a minimally modified RF-C (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Radiolabeling of proteins bearing an artificial phosphorylatable tag has been shown to be an efficient technique for biochemical studies (58Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 64Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We designed an RF-C complex that could be32P-labeled in vitro, as well as isolated by affinity chromatography. For this purpose, a protein kinase A recognition motif (55Li B.-L. Langer J.A. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was fused to the N terminus of the p37 subunit (p37-ph). By testing various combinations of baculoviruses, we found that the best yield of the five-subunit RF-C upon expression in insect cells and purification on Ni-NTA-resin was achieved when the baculoviruses encoding p140 wild type, p38 wild type, and p37-ph were combined with v40-his and v36-his (data not shown). Expression of RF-C complex containing p37-ph together with p40-his and p36-his resulted in a high yield of RF-C-ph complex (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Natural RF-C displays significant binding to DNA templates (35Lee S.-H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 44Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One DNA binding domain of RF-C was mapped in the N terminus of the p140 RF-C subunit (47Burbelo P.D. Utani A. Pan Z.Q. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11543-11547Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 48Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hübscher U. Fotedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but the N-terminal half of p140 was found to be dispensable for assembly as well as for activity of RF-C, at leastin vitro (49Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this N-terminal DNA binding domain might interact with DNA nonspecifically and obscure analysis of essential interactions among RF-C, PCNA, and DNA. Therefore, we engineered an N-terminally deleted p140 subunit, p140-Δ (see “Materials and Methods”). As predicted from the data of Uhlmannet al. (49Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), p140-Δ efficiently assembled into stoichiometric RF-C-Δ and RF-C-Δ-ph complexes in the baculovirus expression system (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3and 4). First, we tested whether p37-ph subunit assembled into the five-subunit complex is accessible to the protein kinase. Incubation of RF-C complexes with [γ-32P]ATP and PK resulted in efficient and specific labeling of p37-ph subunit (Fig. 1 B). No phosphorylation was observed in any other RF-C subunit, confirming that the protein labeling was specific to the phosphorylation tag. Next, we tested whether modification of small RF-C subunits might adversely affect the enzymatic activity of RF-C complexes. Analysis of RF-C-dependent pol δ holoenzyme DNA synthesis showed that the unphosphorylated tagged p37-ph in RF-C-ph did not impair the activity of RF-C (Fig. 2 A, compare RF-C-ph with RF-C; Fig. 2 B, compare RF-C-Δ-ph with RF-"

Differentiation of fibroblastic preadipocytes to mature lipid-filled adipocytes involves an extensive array of changes in gene expression. The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line is a highly faithfulin vitro model system in which to delineate mechanisms governing differentiation-dependent adipocyte gene expression and consequently adipose cell and tissue development (1Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 2Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 3Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the expression levels of several hundred genes are dramatically altered during this process, the majority of these remain unidentified (4Sadowski H.B. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanisms governing transcriptional regulation during adipocyte differentiation have been addressed for only a handful of these genes. To date, these studies have centered on activation, as opposed to repression, of gene transcription. In this regard, detailed studies of the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein gene aP2 have identified a role for c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer binding to an AP-1 site and involvement of the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1 in aP2gene activation during adipocyte conversion (5Herrera R.

Studies onaP2 have also determined that binding of the nuclear receptor PPARγ as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor directs adipocyte-specific gene expression (7Tontonoz P. Hu E.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Overall, these findings lead to the conclusion that PPARγ and C/EBPs function cooperatively to transactivate adipocyte genes and to bring about adipocyte differentiation (9Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 10Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 11Mandrup S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). It has only recently become evident that suppression of gene expression in differentiation is of equal importance as activation, permitting the specialization of cells for new functions. Whether similar families of transcription factors, or novel molecules and molecular mechanisms, function in the repression of genes during adipocyte differentiation is currently unknown. Defining these mechanisms will allow a thorough integration of the regulatory events and signals that govern the complex array of changes in gene expression during adipogenesis and those that may control the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes in vivo. Preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) is a novel transmembrane EGF repeat domain-containing protein of 385 amino acids identified in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that functions in the maintenance of the preadipose state (13Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 14Smas C.M. Green D. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9257-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1996; 20 Suppl. 3: S65-S72PubMed Google Scholar). Only a few genes have been identified that are down-regulated during adipose conversion. During in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, pref-1 is highly expressed in preadipocytes, but is completely absent in mature fat cells (13Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar).pref-1 therefore provides a unique opportunity to address the differentiation-dependent down-regulation of preadipocyte genes during adipocyte differentiation. Studies to date point to Pref-1 as a unique inhibitor of the adipose conversion process in either a permissive or instructive manner. Adipose conversion was severely inhibited in stably transfected 3T3-L1 cells that constitutively expressed Pref-1 (13Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Addition of the Pref-1 ectodomain, expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, was also effective in inhibiting adipose conversion when added to culture media during 3T3-L1 differentiation (16Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The presence of Pref-1 inhibited expression of both PPARγ and C/EBPα, the regulatory molecules that transactivate adipocyte genes and lead to adipogenesis (16Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the concept that the down-regulation of pref-1 is a prerequisite for C/EBPα and PPARγ expression and subsequent adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, Pref-1 belongs to that class of proteins that can act as either transmembrane or soluble molecules. We recently reported that membrane-associated Pref-1 is cleaved at two sites in the extracellular domain, thereby extending its potential range of function (16Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed thatpref-1 expression is also abolished during the adipose conversion of primary cultures of rat preadipocytes and that their differentiation is inhibited by the Pref-1 ectodomain (17Hansen L.H. Madsen B. Teisner B. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 8: 1140-1149Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data and the detection of soluble Pref-1 in circulation (18Jensen C.H. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P. Clausen P.P. Skjodt K. Larsson L.I. Enghild J.J. Teisner B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Jensen C.H. Krogh T.N. Stoving R.K. Holmskov U. Teisner B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1997; 268: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggests a possible role for Pref-1 in adipocyte differentiation in vivo. The inhibitory role identified for Pref-1 in the adipose conversion process indicates that detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing pref-1 regulation will lend insights to general mechanisms of control of differentiation and serve to link transcriptional and cell-surface events. The presence of EGF-like domains in the Pref-1 ectodomain, a protein motif demonstrated to mediate protein-protein interaction to control cell growth and differentiation in a variety of biological settings (20Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar, 21Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21393-21396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that transmembrane and/or soluble Pref-1 may function by interaction of its EGF-like domains with EGF-like domains present in cell-surface or extracellular matrix molecules to maintain the preadipose phenotype. We have begun characterization of the molecular details underlyingpref-1 down-regulation during adipocyte differentiation. These studies will afford clarification of the specific mechanisms governing the expression of this unique adipo-inhibitory molecule and may also form a framework for addressing common mechanisms employed in the differentiation-dependent down-regulation of gene expression during adipocyte differentiation. In this report, we show that pref-1 expression is suppressed during adipose conversion at the transcriptional level. We identify the DNA sequence element involved in this differentiation-dependent down-regulation and characterize nuclear protein binding to this element. Here, we report that a distinct negative element that we map to −183 to −170 is responsible for the differentiation-dependent suppression of thepref-1 gene in adipocytes and that this element is distinct from sequences between −93 and −43 involved in the basal promoter activity. Within this sequence, a core element of−183AAAGA−179 is involved in the formation of a specific DNA-protein complex. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (1Green H. Kehinde O.

Cultures for transfection were inoculated at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating confluent cells with 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and 1 μmdexamethasone for 2 days, and adipocytes were harvested after maintenance in drug-free medium for 3–5 days (3Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) extraction. RNA was electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels in 2.2 mformaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS buffer, and 1 mm EDTA; stained with ethidium bromide; and transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After UV cross-linking, filters were incubated at 42 °C for at least 4 h in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 50 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. Following prehybridization, filters were hybridized under identical conditions to 32P-labeled random-primed cDNA probes for at least 16 h. Post-hybridization washes were for 30 min at room temperature in 1× SSC and 1% SDS and then in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C. After exposure to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C, autoradiograms were scanned using an imaging densitometer (GS670, Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) or Alpha Innotech digital imaging software. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes differentiated according to the procedure described above were harvested, and nuclei were isolated according to Zechner et al.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2394-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 40% glycerol. Run-on transcription was carried out at 25 °C for 45 min in a reaction mixture containing 107 nuclei and 100 μCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Labeled RNA was isolated and hybridized to 5 μg of denatured plasmids fixed on nitrocellulose as described previously (24Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Pref-1 −2100LUC plasmid was generated by ligating an AlwNI restriction fragment, containing sequences from ∼2100 to +110 of the murinepref-1 gene, into the BglII cloning site of the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). This construct served as the basis for the generation of reporter constructs containing various 5′-deletions of the pref-15′-flanking sequence. The deletion constructs −45LUC, −93LUC, −170LUC, −193LUC, and −1300LUC were made using convenient restriction sites in the −2100LUC plasmid and each extended through +110 at the 3′-end. For −45LUC, the −2100LUC plasmid was digested with SacII at −45 in the pref-1 promoter and with SmaI, which cuts 5′ to the pref-1 insert in the multicloning site of −2100LUC. The restriction fragment corresponding to the plasmid backbone and the adjoining −45 to +110 of the pref-1 promoter sequence was purified, blunt-ended, and self-ligated to yield −45LUC. Likewise, to generate −193LUC, −2100LUC was cut with KpnI at −193 in thepref-1 promoter sequence and in the plasmid multicloning site. −170LUC was prepared by digestion of −2100LUC withXhoI at −170 and in the plasmid multicloning sites, and similarly, −93LUC was generated by digestion of −2100LUC withBstEI. −2100LUC was cut at the PvuII site at ∼1300 in the pref-1 promoter and with SmaI in the plasmid multicloning site, blunt-ended, and self-ligated to create −1300LUC. For the generation of Pref-1/LUC constructs extending farther 5′ than −2100, all but −175 of the pref-1 5′-flanking region was removed from the −2100LUC construct by digestion at theNotI site at −175 in the pref-1 promoter sequence and at the MluI site in the plasmid multicloning site. An ∼6000-bp pref-1 genomic fragment withMluI-NotI ends was ligated into this plasmid backbone. −6000LUC was used as the starting point to generate the −4000LUC and −3000LUC constructs by cutting −6000LUC in the multicloning site with MluI and with HindIII orBglII, respectively, followed by re-ligation of the plasmid backbone and adjacent pref-1 5′-flanking sequences. The −183LUC, −300LUC, and −692LUC constructs were made using the promoterless pGL2-Basic vector and polymerase chain reaction fragments generated using primers containing a 5′-XbaI and a 3′-SacI cloning site; each of these constructs extended to +25 in the pref-1 sequence. The heterologous Pref-1/SV40LUC construct, SAD/SV40LUC, was created using oligonucleotides containing one copy of the −193 to −154 pref-1 sequence. The oligonucleotides were annealed to their complementary strand and ligated into the SmaI site of the pGL-promoter plasmid (Promega). The insert sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing using the Sequenase® kit (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52495) Google Scholar). For stable transfection, exponentially growing 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with 20 μg of the indicated Pref-1/LUC fusion construct plasmids and 5 μg of SV2neo plasmid DNA/100-mm dish via the calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation method (26Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 9.1.4-9.1.11Google Scholar). Cells were selected for 3 weeks in 400 μg/ml G418. Resistant colonies were pooled and grown without the drug and collected as preadipocytes or adipocytes after differentiation. For transient transfection, 3T3-L1 cells were transfected as described previously (27Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 10 μg of the indicated Pref-1/LUC plasmid by the calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation method (26Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 9.1.4-9.1.11Google Scholar). To normalize for the efficiency of transient transfection, 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase was cotransfected with the test plasmids. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. At least two independent plasmid preparations were used in three separate experiments. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mmglycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell extracts were prepared by a 5-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g. Luciferase activity was assayed according to a previously reported procedure (28Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar) using a luminometer (Berthold, Nashua, NH). The reaction mixture contained 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 15 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically as described previously (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). In transient transfections, luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to adjust for transfection efficiency. In stable transfections, the data were normalized by total protein content of the cell extracts. Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (30Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). The following pairs of single-stranded oligonucleotides (only the coding strand sequence is shown below) were synthesized for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutant oligonucleotides of Pref-1 SADa containing randomly altered bases as listed below are underlined and were used for competition in electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies: Pref-1 SAD (−193 to −154), 5′-CCGTCTAGCCAAAGAGTGCGGCCGCGTGCTCGAGCCGCTT-3′; Pref-1 SADa (−193 to −174), 5′-CCGTCTAGCCAAAGAGTGCG-3′; Pref-1 SADa (−193 to −174) mutations (underlined), MUT1: 5′-AAACTTAGCCAAAGAGTGCG-3′, MUT2: 5′-CCGTCCGTAAAAAGAGTGCG-3′, MUT3: 5′-CCGTCTAGCCCGCTGGTGCG-3′, and MUT4: 5′-CCGTCTAGCCAAAGAAGTAT-3′; Pref-1 SADb (−173 to −154), 5′-GCCGCGTGCTCGAGCCGCTT-3′; and Pref-1 SADm (−183 to −164), 5′-AAAGAGTGCGGCCGCGTGCT-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (31Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 32Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary strands of oligonucleotides, shown above, were annealed by combining equal amounts of each oligonucleotide in buffer (50 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl), heating to 70 °C for 10 min, and cooling to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Gel shift binding reactions were performed at room temperature in 30 μl of 150 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 14 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 12.5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Each reaction contained 20,000 cpm (0.5–1 ng) of oligonucleotide and the indicated amount of nuclear extracts. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of nuclear extracts. After a 30-min incubation, samples were subjected to 4% nonreducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 50 mm Tris, 375 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.2). Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C with intensifying screen. 20 μl of the gel mobility shift binding reaction using the 20-nucleotide SADm sequence shown above was exposed to UV light in a Bio-Rad Gene-Linker for 20 min at a distance of 10 cm from the UV source. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer was added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min and then applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed with 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol, dried, and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen. Pref-1 is a novel plasma membrane protein containing six EGF-like repeats in the extracellular domain. We have previously reported that Pref-1 protein and mRNA levels are expressed at a high level in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, but are not detectable in mature fat cells (13Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of Pref-1 inhibits adipogenesis, demonstrating that the down-regulation of pref-1 is required for preadipocytes to undergo adipose conversion (13Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The inverse relationship between Pref-1 mRNA levels and the capacity for adipocyte differentiation is clearly shown in Fig. 1 A (upper panel). Preadipocytes at confluence (day 0) expressed easily detectable levels of Pref-1 mRNA, but not molecular markers of early adipocyte differentiation (PPARγ or C/EBPα) or the terminal differentiation marker adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein. Following adipocyte differentiation (day 6), Pref-1 mRNA was reduced to undetectable levels, whereas the adipocyte-expressed C/EBPα, PPARγ, and fatty acid-binding protein mRNAs were readily detected. To more closely address the regulation of the pref-1 gene during adipocyte differentiation, we used Northern analysis to examine the level of Pref-1 mRNA at specific times during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Fig. 1 A(lower panel) shows the level of Pref-1 mRNA detected at confluence and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 days post-induction of adipocyte differentiation. The Pref-1 mRNA level decreased to ∼50% of the levels in untreated confluent preadipocytes after 1 day post-induction of differentiation, the earliest time point examined. By 6 days post-induction, when most of the cell population consisted of mature adipocytes, Pref-1 mRNA was not detectable. The Pref-1 mRNA level did not change with prolonged incubation since similar levels were present at confluence (0c) and in preadipocytes not induced to differentiate, but kept in culture 6 days post-confluence (6pc). To address whether the decrease in Pref-1 mRNA levels during adipocyte differentiation is due to the changes in transcription of thepref-1 gene, we carried out nuclear run-on assays using nuclei isolated from confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and cells differentiated into adipocytes by dexamethasone/MIX treatment. As shown in Fig. 1 B, pref-1 gene transcription was easily detectable in preadipocytes and was markedly decreased to undetectable levels in adipocytes. Actin transcription, as previously reported (33Spiegelman B.M. Farmer S.R. Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), was somewhat decreased during differentiation. Transcription of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase gene, previously shown to be expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner in adipocytes (62Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not detectable in preadipocytes, but increased during adipocyte differentiation. These results clearly demonstrate that the down-regulation of pref-1 expression during adipocyte differentiation is primarily at the transcriptional level. The transcriptional down-regulation of the pref-1 gene determined by run-on assays indicates that DNA sequences within the pref-15′-flanking region may contain a cis-element governing the differentiation-dependent suppression of thepref-1 gene in adipocytes. To identify these sequence(s), we transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with a series of luciferase reporter constructs with nested deletions of the pref-1 5′-flanking region. We observed that transfection efficiency was much higher in preadipocytes than in adipocytes; this difference made it difficult to compare promoter activity via transient transfection even after correction for pCMV-β-galactosidase. We therefore chose to employ multiple pools of stable transfectants. In addition, by employing stable pools of many independent clones, the effects of the integration site of the plasmid in cellular DNA could be alleviated. Luciferase activity was measured in the same pool of stably transfected preadipocytes at confluence and following their differentiation to adipocytes by dexamethasone/MIX treatment. Fig. 2 depicts the relative activity of the various Pref-1/LUC reporter constructs in preadipocytesversus adipocytes. A value of 1 indicates an equal level of activity of the Pref-1/LUC reporter construct in preadipocytes and adipocytes, and the indicated negative values are the ratio of activity in preadipocytes/adipocytes. As reported below, the luciferase activity of −45LUC was extremely low in both adipocytes and preadipocytes. The luciferase activity in preadipocytes in comparison to that in adipocytes was similar in cells transfected with the −93LUC and −170LUC constructs. On the other hand, cells transfected with constructs that contain longer pref-1 5′-flanking sequence, including −183LUC, −193LUC, −235LUC, −300LUC, −692LUC, −1300LUC, −2100LUC, and −6000LUC, showed ∼4-fold higher luciferase activity in preadipocytes as compared with adipocytes. These data indicate that sequences between −183 and −170 include sequence important for Pref-1suppression in adipocyte d, which we designate herein as a SAD element. We next determined if the down-regulation of pref-1 in adipocytes occurs via an element that controls pref-1promoter activity in preadipocytes. In this case, the pref-1SAD element would overlap with the element required forpref-1 expression in preadipocytes. We used transient transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes employing various 5′-deletion promoter constructs. For comparison purposes, the luciferase activity of −4000LUC was assigned the value of 100% (Fig. 2,inset). Transfection of the −45LUC plasmid produced extremely low levels of promoter activity. On the other hand, −93LUC produced >2 orders of magnitude higher promoter activity, and this high level was maintained through −4000 bp of the pref-15′-transcription start site. This indicates that regulatory sequences important for the high level of pref-1 promoter activity in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are present within −93 to −45 of the transcription start site. Furthermore, these data indicate that the SAD element that governs pref-1 suppression in adipocytes, between −183 and −170 that we defined above, is distinct from the element from −93 to −45 that contributes to pref-1promoter activity in preadipocytes. To demonstrate a definitive role of thepref-1 SAD sequence in differentiation-dependent down-regulation of gene expression, we tested whether this sequence could function to repress the activity of a heterologous promoter in a differentiation-dependent manner. The SAD region of thepref-1 5′-flanking region, defined"

We demonstrated FJ-cell interactions in fluid phase by flow cytometry experiments using the cell lines Jurkat, K562, JY, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. FJ bound to plastic plates was able to induce in vitro adhesion of these cells with potency equivalent to fibronectin. As evidence for the specificity of this reaction, the adhesion was blocked by MAJ2, an anti-FJ monoclonal antibody, and by soluble FJ. Attachment of the cells required active metabolism and cytoskeletal integrity. The glycosaminoglycans heparin, heparan sulfate, or chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C inhibited to varying degrees the binding of FJ to cells, as did treatment with chondroitinase ABC. In the search for a putative receptor, a protein of 110 kDa was isolated by affinity chromatography, and microsequence analysis identified this protein as nucleolin. Confocal microscopy evidenced the presence of nucleolin in cell membrane by immunofluorescence with monoclonal (D3) and polyclonal anti-nucleolin antibodies in Jurkat cells. The interaction FJ-nucleolin was evidenced by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, purified nucleolin and D3 inhibited adhesion of Jurkat cells to immobilized FJ, suggesting that the interaction was specific and that nucleolin mediated the binding.

Factor J (FJ)1 is a complement inhibitor that is able to regulate both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement (1López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. Rivard M. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26017-26024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FJ was initially found as a soluble molecule in urine and serum (1López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. Rivard M. Nicholson-Weller A.

Biochem. 1994; 27: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). FJ is a peculiar protein having a high sugar content and a pI ≥ 9.6 (4Jiménez Clavero M.A. González Rubio C. Fontán G. López-Trascasa M. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 42: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, the existence of FJ-related molecules has been described on the surface of human circulating cells and lymphoid cell lines (5Jiménez-Clavero M.A. González-Rubio C. Larrucea S. Gamallo C. Fontán G. López-Trascasa M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2143-2150PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analysis with an anti-FJ monoclonal antibody (mAb) has revealed staining in a small but consistent population of lymphocytes (mean: 11%) but not in monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, or platelets. Moreover, we have also found that anti-FJ stained several cell lines (Jurkat, U937, K562, and Ramos) at varying percentages.Relationships between complement and adhesion processes have been described previously; moreover, complement regulators such as vitronectin (VN) (6Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clusterin (7Silkensen J.R. Skubitz K.M. Skubitz A.P.N. Chmielewski D.H. Manivel J.C. Dvergsten J. Rosenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2646-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and more recently, factor H-like protein 1 (8Hellwage J. Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and factor H (9DiScipio R.G. Daffern P.J. Schraufstatter I.U. Sriramarao P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4057-4066PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in adhesion processes. Affinity purification identified Mac1 (CD11b/CD18) as a factor H binding receptor (9DiScipio R.G. Daffern P.J. Schraufstatter I.U. Sriramarao P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4057-4066PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CD11b/CD18 (Mac1) binds several soluble ligands including the complement fragment iC3b (10Beller D.I. Springer T.A. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Some characteristics of FJ resemble VN. Among them are the ability to regulate complement, the tendency to form aggregates, and the potential to bind heparin (11Høgásen K. Mollnes T.E. Harboe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23076-23082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VN is a ligand for β1 and β3 integrins. Clusterin, a different complement regulator, is capable of promoting the aggregation and adhesion of renal epithelial cells.FJ also strongly binds heparin (12Nicholson-Weller A. Rivard M. López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 121: 201-212Google Scholar). Heparin-binding proteins constitute a diverse group that includes extracellular matrix molecules, growth factors, degradative and lipolytic enzymes, protease inhibitors, nuclear proteins, and lipoproteins. The molecular characteristics of FJ and its presence on cell membranes could make this protein a candidate for cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions.The aim of this work was to investigate whether FJ could interact with different cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). We analyzed FJ-cell interactions by flow cytometry and in adhesion assays using FJ immobilized on plastic plates. We observed that soluble FJ binds to several cell lines and PBL. Furthermore, immobilized FJ was able to induce cell adhesion in vitro. We isolated an FJ receptor protein by affinity chromatography and identified it by microsequencing analysis as nucleolin. In addition, competition experiments with nucleolin, its fragments, and with an anti-nucleolin mAb were performed. Metabolic requirements for FJ-cell interactions were also investigated.DISCUSSIONFor the first time, our results described the ability of FJ, a complement inhibitor, to induce cell adhesion. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition with anti-FJ mAbs or with soluble FJ. This adhesion was not mediated by many of the presently known adhesion molecules, including β1, β2, or β3 integrins, and CD62L, CD43, or CD44 molecules. Temperature dependence and the requirement for cytoskeletal integrity make FJ adhesion similar to that meditated by FN-β1integrin interaction (13Arroyo A.G. Sánchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Martı́n-Padura I. Dejana E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the percentages of attachment of several cell lines were similar for both molecules (Fig. 2 B). The interaction was inhibited to varying degrees by several glycosaminoglycans including heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C, as well as by the treatment of the cells with chondroitinase ABC. The interaction of FJ and cells was also evident in fluid phase as assessed by FJ binding to cells in flow cytometry experiments. Moreover, in these experiments, a dose-dependent effect was observed.To characterize the molecule(s) involved in FJ-cell interaction we detected, by elution from immobilized FJ, a major protein band of approximately 110 kDa. This protein was able to bind FJ when immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. Microsequence analysis identified it as nucleolin. Nucleolin, also known as C23, is a major nucleolar protein in eukaryotic cells (23Olson M.O.J. Guetzow K. Busch H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1981; 135: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and one of the proteins associated with the nucleolar organizer region (22Ochs R.L. Busch H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1984; 152: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Lischwe M.A. Smetana K. Olson M.O.J. Busch H. Life Sci. 1979; 25: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Nucleolin contains RNA recognition motifs and has been demonstrated to bind to RNA (24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Bugler B. Bourbon H. Lapeyre B. Wallace M.O. Chang J.H. Amalric F. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10922-10925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA (27Dickinson L. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is phosphorylated by casein kinase II during interphase (28Schneider H.R. Reichert G.H. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and by Cdc2 kinase during mitosis (29Peter M. Nakagawa J. Moree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The nucleolin sequence data suggest a modular organization in functional domains. The first N-terminal domain contains repeated motifs (TPXKK) surrounded by acidic stretches and is the site of multiple phosphorylation (24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 30Schwab M.S. Dreyer C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar). This domain also interacts with chromatin (31Erard M. Belenguer P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Pantaloni A. Amalric F. Eur. J.

The FJ-nucleolin interaction also seems to be mediated by this domain since p40, p50, or GAR domains do not block the adhesion.Despite being a nuclear protein, nucleolin may be located at other unexpected sites, including the cell surface (16Deng J.S.

Res. 1995; 42: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggest that nucleolin binding to the IKVAV site of laminin may play a role in neurite differentiation, while Gillery et al. (39Gillery P. Georges N. Randoux A. Lefèvre F. Maquart F.X. Borel J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest that extracellular matrix interactions with nucleolin may directly affect protein synthesis. Thus, experimental studies indicate a functional role for nucleolin at the cell surface. Deng et al. (36Deng J.-S. Ballou B. Hofmesiter J.K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrate cell surface nucleolin on Hep-2 and HepG2 cell lines and show that antibody to surface nucleolin is rapidly internalized; therefore, a pathway exists for cellular uptake of molecules bound to nucleolin.We showed that nucleolin was biotinylated in intact cells using a method reported to give selective biotinylation of the cell surface proteins of leukocytes (40Cole S.R. Ashman L.K. Ey P.L. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we evidenced nucleolin on the cell membrane by confocal microscopy so our data agree with previous reports of cell surface nucleolin. Many putative cell surface receptors are identical to abundant intracellular multifunctional proteins (32Smalheiser R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); while some of the proposed receptor activities may be artifactual, many such proteins appear to be truly expressed at the cell surface and to exhibit developmentally regulated patterns of cell surface expression.The specificity of FJ-nucleolin interaction was evidenced by several experiments such as ligand blot and ELISA. We also showed that some GAGs can modify this interaction. The association of nucleolin to casein kinase 2 was also inhibited by heparin, an inhibitor of the enzyme (41Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We showed that FJ-nucleolin interaction was also modified for several GAGs. The FJ-nucleolin interaction may also be involved in cell control mechanisms. There are many similarities between basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and FJ. bFGF is a cationic protein involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. FGFs are a family of heparin-binding polypeptides that play a role in a wide array of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and transformation (42Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Baird A. Klagsbrun M. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 239-243PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, Maher (44Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) has found nuclear translocation of FGF receptors in response to bFGF. Different sequences containing basic amino acids have been implicated in protein transport to the nucleus (45Silver P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). FJ is a cationic protein; attempts to sequence it have been unsuccessful, probably because this protein is resistant to proteolytic enzymes. Other strategies, including different purification schemes or its digestion in biological fluids, are in progress. If the analogy to bFGF holds, FJ may also be internalized after membrane interactions. This hypothesis is currently being tested.The cellular distribution of receptors for FJ in cell lines supports the analogy of FJ receptors with FGF receptors. FGF receptor expression in human leukemia cell lines is heterogeneous as shown by mRNA analysis (46Armstrong E. Vainikka S. Partanen J. Korhonen J. Alitalo R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2004-2007PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytic cell lines U937 and RC-2A do not express mRNA for FGF receptors (FGFR-1, FGFR-2, FGFR-3, FGFR-4). U937 also binds FJ to a lower extent than other cell lines (Fig. 1 B). FGFs interact with two classes of FGF receptors, a low and a high affinity (47Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 48Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). bFGF interacts with cells through heparan sulfate, and the interaction is mediated by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. The interaction of FJ with cells also induces an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). However, we have ruled out the identity of these two molecules, FJ and bFGF, by ELISA using anti-FJ and anti-bFGF mAbs (data not shown). A regulatory relationship between bFGF expression and nucleolin phosphorylation is demonstrated by Bonnet et al. (49Bonnet H. Filhol O. Truchet I. Brethenou P. Cochet C. Amalric F. Bouche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24781-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The reduction on cell adhesion induced on cells after chondroitinase treatment suggests that other molecules, probably involving more than one receptor, are implicated in the cell adhesion.FJ might act as an extracellular matrix protein similar to FN, since FJ also strongly binds both heparin (12Nicholson-Weller A. Rivard M. López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 121: 201-212Google Scholar) and heparan sulfate and is highly glycosylated. Although initially described as a complement inhibitor, FJ may mediate cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. Therefore, adhesion might act in the regulation of complement inhibition, sequestering FJ in a functionally inert form until it is required by the body. Data from our laboratory indicate the presence of high levels of FJ in synovial fluid from patients having different inflammatory arthropathies (50González-Rubio C. Saboya-Palero A Pascual-Salcedo D. Balsa A. Fontán G. López-Trascasa M. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). FJ could modify cell traffic to synovial tissue as other adhesion molecules do (51Laffón A. Garcı́a-Vicuña R. Humbrı́a A. Postigo A.A. Corbı́ A.L. Landázuri M.O. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Clin.

Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Clusterin, Factor H, and Factor H-like protein 1 can simultaneously regulate complement and are involved in the adhesion mechanism (7Silkensen J.R. Skubitz K.M. Skubitz A.P.N. Chmielewski D.H. Manivel J.C. Dvergsten J. Rosenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2646-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Hellwage J. Kühn S. Zipfel P.F.

Cellular adhesion induced by complement regulators could contribute to focal tissue repair at sites of complement activation. Interactions of cells with components of the extracellular matrix, such as a FN, laminin, or tenascin, play an important role in morphogenesis, tissue repair, regeneration, or metastasis; by analogy FJ may also play a role in these processes. Factor J (FJ)1 is a complement inhibitor that is able to regulate both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement (1López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. Rivard M. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16214-16221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2González-Rubio C. Jiménez-Clavero M.A. Fontán G. López-Trascasa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26017-26024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FJ was initially found as a soluble molecule in urine and serum (1López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. Rivard M. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16214-16221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jiménez Clavero M.A. González-Rubio C. Fontán G. López Trascasa M. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 27: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). FJ is a peculiar protein having a high sugar content and a pI ≥ 9.6 (4Jiménez Clavero M.A. González Rubio C. Fontán G. López-Trascasa M. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 42: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, the existence of FJ-related molecules has been described on the surface of human circulating cells and lymphoid cell lines (5Jiménez-Clavero M.A. González-Rubio C. Larrucea S. Gamallo C. Fontán G. López-Trascasa M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2143-2150PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analysis with an anti-FJ monoclonal antibody (mAb) has revealed staining in a small but consistent population of lymphocytes (mean: 11%) but not in monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, or platelets. Moreover, we have also found that anti-FJ stained several cell lines (Jurkat, U937, K562, and Ramos) at varying percentages. Relationships between complement and adhesion processes have been described previously; moreover, complement regulators such as vitronectin (VN) (6Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clusterin (7Silkensen J.R. Skubitz K.M. Skubitz A.P.N. Chmielewski D.H. Manivel J.C. Dvergsten J. Rosenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2646-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and more recently, factor H-like protein 1 (8Hellwage J. Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and factor H (9DiScipio R.G. Daffern P.J. Schraufstatter I.U. Sriramarao P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4057-4066PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in adhesion processes. Affinity purification identified Mac1 (CD11b/CD18) as a factor H binding receptor (9DiScipio R.G. Daffern P.J. Schraufstatter I.U. Sriramarao P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4057-4066PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CD11b/CD18 (Mac1) binds several soluble ligands including the complement fragment iC3b (10Beller D.I. Springer T.A. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Some characteristics of FJ resemble VN. Among them are the ability to regulate complement, the tendency to form aggregates, and the potential to bind heparin (11Høgásen K. Mollnes T.E. Harboe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23076-23082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VN is a ligand for β1 and β3 integrins. Clusterin, a different complement regulator, is capable of promoting the aggregation and adhesion of renal epithelial cells. FJ also strongly binds heparin (12Nicholson-Weller A. Rivard M. López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 121: 201-212Google Scholar). Heparin-binding proteins constitute a diverse group that includes extracellular matrix molecules, growth factors, degradative and lipolytic enzymes, protease inhibitors, nuclear proteins, and lipoproteins. The molecular characteristics of FJ and its presence on cell membranes could make this protein a candidate for cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. The aim of this work was to investigate whether FJ could interact with different cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). We analyzed FJ-cell interactions by flow cytometry and in adhesion assays using FJ immobilized on plastic plates. We observed that soluble FJ binds to several cell lines and PBL. Furthermore, immobilized FJ was able to induce cell adhesion in vitro. We isolated an FJ receptor protein by affinity chromatography and identified it by microsequencing analysis as nucleolin. In addition, competition experiments with nucleolin, its fragments, and with an anti-nucleolin mAb were performed. Metabolic requirements for FJ-cell interactions were also investigated. DISCUSSIONFor the first time, our results described the ability of FJ, a complement inhibitor, to induce cell adhesion. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition with anti-FJ mAbs or with soluble FJ. This adhesion was not mediated by many of the presently known adhesion molecules, including β1, β2, or β3 integrins, and CD62L, CD43, or CD44 molecules. Temperature dependence and the requirement for cytoskeletal integrity make FJ adhesion similar to that meditated by FN-β1integrin interaction (13Arroyo A.G. Sánchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Martı́n-Padura I. Dejana E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the percentages of attachment of several cell lines were similar for both molecules (Fig. 2 B). The interaction was inhibited to varying degrees by several glycosaminoglycans including heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C, as well as by the treatment of the cells with chondroitinase ABC. The interaction of FJ and cells was also evident in fluid phase as assessed by FJ binding to cells in flow cytometry experiments. Moreover, in these experiments, a dose-dependent effect was observed.To characterize the molecule(s) involved in FJ-cell interaction we detected, by elution from immobilized FJ, a major protein band of approximately 110 kDa. This protein was able to bind FJ when immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. Microsequence analysis identified it as nucleolin. Nucleolin, also known as C23, is a major nucleolar protein in eukaryotic cells (23Olson M.O.J. Guetzow K. Busch H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1981; 135: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and one of the proteins associated with the nucleolar organizer region (22Ochs R.L. Busch H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1984; 152: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Lischwe M.A. Smetana K. Olson M.O.J. Busch H. Life Sci. 1979; 25: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Nucleolin contains RNA recognition motifs and has been demonstrated to bind to RNA (24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Bugler B. Bourbon H. Lapeyre B. Wallace M.O. Chang J.H. Amalric F. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10922-10925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA (27Dickinson L. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is phosphorylated by casein kinase II during interphase (28Schneider H.R. Reichert G.H. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and by Cdc2 kinase during mitosis (29Peter M. Nakagawa J. Moree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The nucleolin sequence data suggest a modular organization in functional domains. The first N-terminal domain contains repeated motifs (TPXKK) surrounded by acidic stretches and is the site of multiple phosphorylation (24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 30Schwab M.S. Dreyer C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar). This domain also interacts with chromatin (31Erard M. Belenguer P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Pantaloni A. Amalric F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and is likely to be implicated in protein-protein interactions. The FJ-nucleolin interaction also seems to be mediated by this domain since p40, p50, or GAR domains do not block the adhesion.Despite being a nuclear protein, nucleolin may be located at other unexpected sites, including the cell surface (16Deng J.S.

Data from our laboratory indicate the presence of high levels of FJ in synovial fluid from patients having different inflammatory arthropathies (50González-Rubio C. Saboya-Palero A Pascual-Salcedo D. Balsa A. Fontán G. López-Trascasa M. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). FJ could modify cell traffic to synovial tissue as other adhesion molecules do (51Laffón A. Garcı́a-Vicuña R. Humbrı́a A. Postigo A.A. Corbı́ A.L. Landázuri M.O. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Clin.

Skubitz K.M. Skubitz A.P.N. Chmielewski D.H. Manivel J.C. Dvergsten J. Rosenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2646-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Hellwage J. Kühn S. Zipfel P.F.

Cellular adhesion induced by complement regulators could contribute to focal tissue repair at sites of complement activation. Interactions of cells with components of the extracellular matrix, such as a FN, laminin, or tenascin, play an important role in morphogenesis, tissue repair, regeneration, or metastasis; by analogy FJ may also play a role in these processes. For the first time, our results described the ability of FJ, a complement inhibitor, to induce cell adhesion. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition with anti-FJ mAbs or with soluble FJ. This adhesion was not mediated by many of the presently known adhesion molecules, including β1, β2, or β3 integrins, and CD62L, CD43, or CD44 molecules. Temperature dependence and the requirement for cytoskeletal integrity make FJ adhesion similar to that meditated by FN-β1integrin interaction (13Arroyo A.G. Sánchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Martı́n-Padura I. Dejana E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the percentages of attachment of several cell lines were similar for both molecules (Fig. 2 B). The interaction was inhibited to varying degrees by several glycosaminoglycans including heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C, as well as by the treatment of the cells with chondroitinase ABC. The interaction of FJ and cells was also evident in fluid phase as assessed by FJ binding to cells in flow cytometry experiments. Moreover, in these experiments, a dose-dependent effect was observed. To characterize the molecule(s) involved in FJ-cell interaction we detected, by elution from immobilized FJ, a major protein band of approximately 110 kDa. This protein was able to bind FJ when immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. Microsequence analysis identified it as nucleolin. Nucleolin, also known as C23, is a major nucleolar protein in eukaryotic cells (23Olson M.O.J. Guetzow K. Busch H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1981; 135: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and one of the proteins associated with the nucleolar organizer region (22Ochs R.L. Busch H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1984; 152: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Lischwe M.A. Smetana K. Olson M.O.J. Busch H. Life Sci. 1979; 25: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Nucleolin contains RNA recognition motifs and has been demonstrated to bind to RNA (24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Bugler B. Bourbon H. Lapeyre B. Wallace M.O. Chang J.H. Amalric F. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol.

It is phosphorylated by casein kinase II during interphase (28Schneider H.R. Reichert G.H. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and by Cdc2 kinase during mitosis (29Peter M. Nakagawa J. Moree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The nucleolin sequence data suggest a modular organization in functional domains. The first N-terminal domain contains repeated motifs (TPXKK) surrounded by acidic stretches and is the site of multiple phosphorylation (24Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 30Schwab M.S. Dreyer C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar). This domain also interacts with chromatin (31Erard M. Belenguer P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Pantaloni A. Amalric F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and is likely to be implicated in protein-protein interactions. The FJ-nucleolin interaction also seems to be mediated by this domain since p40, p50, or GAR domains do not block the adhesion. Despite being a nuclear protein, nucleolin may be located at other unexpected sites, including the cell surface (16Deng J.S. Ballou B.T. J. Invest.

Res. 1995; 42: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggest that nucleolin binding to the IKVAV site of laminin may play a role in neurite differentiation, while Gillery et al. (39Gillery P. Georges N. Randoux A. Lefèvre F. Maquart F.X. Borel J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest that extracellular matrix interactions with nucleolin may directly affect protein synthesis. Thus, experimental studies indicate a functional role for nucleolin at the cell surface. Deng et al. (36Deng J.-S. Ballou B. Hofmesiter J.K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrate cell surface nucleolin on Hep-2 and HepG2 cell lines and show that antibody to surface nucleolin is rapidly internalized; therefore, a pathway exists for cellular uptake of molecules bound to nucleolin. We showed that nucleolin was biotinylated in intact cells using a method reported to give selective biotinylation of the cell surface proteins of leukocytes (40Cole S.R. Ashman L.K. Ey P.L. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we evidenced nucleolin on the cell membrane by confocal microscopy so our data agree with previous reports of cell surface nucleolin. Many putative cell surface receptors are identical to abundant intracellular multifunctional proteins (32Smalheiser R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); while some of the proposed receptor activities may be artifactual, many such proteins appear to be truly expressed at the cell surface and to exhibit developmentally regulated patterns of cell surface expression. The specificity of FJ-nucleolin interaction was evidenced by several experiments such as ligand blot and ELISA. We also showed that some GAGs can modify this interaction. The association of nucleolin to casein kinase 2 was also inhibited by heparin, an inhibitor of the enzyme (41Li D. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15662-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We showed that FJ-nucleolin interaction was also modified for several GAGs. The FJ-nucleolin interaction may also be involved in cell control mechanisms. There are many similarities between basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and FJ. bFGF is a cationic protein involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. FGFs are a family of heparin-binding polypeptides that play a role in a wide array of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and transformation (42Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Baird A. Klagsbrun M. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 239-243PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Maher (44Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) has found nuclear translocation of FGF receptors in response to bFGF. Different sequences containing basic amino acids have been implicated in protein transport to the nucleus (45Silver P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). FJ is a cationic protein; attempts to sequence it have been unsuccessful, probably because this protein is resistant to proteolytic enzymes. Other strategies, including different purification schemes or its digestion in biological fluids, are in progress. If the analogy to bFGF holds, FJ may also be internalized after membrane interactions. This hypothesis is currently being tested. The cellular distribution of receptors for FJ in cell lines supports the analogy of FJ receptors with FGF receptors. FGF receptor expression in human leukemia cell lines is heterogeneous as shown by mRNA analysis (46Armstrong E. Vainikka S. Partanen J. Korhonen J. Alitalo R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2004-2007PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytic cell lines U937 and RC-2A do not express mRNA for FGF receptors (FGFR-1, FGFR-2, FGFR-3, FGFR-4). U937 also binds FJ to a lower extent than other cell lines (Fig. 1 B). FGFs interact with two classes of FGF receptors, a low and a high affinity (47Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 48Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). bFGF interacts with cells through heparan sulfate, and the interaction is mediated by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. The interaction of FJ with cells also induces an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). However, we have ruled out the identity of these two molecules, FJ and bFGF, by ELISA using anti-FJ and anti-bFGF mAbs (data not shown). A regulatory relationship between bFGF expression and nucleolin phosphorylation is demonstrated by Bonnet et al. (49Bonnet H. Filhol O. Truchet I. Brethenou P. Cochet C. Amalric F. Bouche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24781-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The reduction on cell adhesion induced on cells after chondroitinase treatment suggests that other molecules, probably involving more than one receptor, are implicated in the cell adhesion. FJ might act as an extracellular matrix protein similar to FN, since FJ also strongly binds both heparin (12Nicholson-Weller A. Rivard M. López-Trascasa M. Bing D.H. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 121: 201-212Google Scholar) and heparan sulfate and is highly glycosylated. Although initially described as a complement inhibitor, FJ may mediate cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. Therefore, adhesion might act in the regulation of complement inhibition, sequestering FJ in a functionally inert form until it is required by the body. Data from our laboratory indicate the presence of high levels of FJ in synovial fluid from patients having different inflammatory arthropathies (50González-Rubio C.

https://openalex.org/W2070736121,"Glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD-1) is a group of genetic disorders caused by a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. (G6Pase). GSD-1a and GSD-1b, the two major subgroups, have been confirmed at the molecular genetic level. The gene responsible for GSD-1b maps to human chromosome 11q23 and a candidate human GSD-1b cDNA that encodes a microsomal transmembrane protein has been identified. In this study, we show that this cDNA maps to chromosome 11q23; thus it is a strong candidate for GSD-1b. Furthermore, we isolated and characterized candidate murine and rat GSD-1b cDNAs. Both encode transmembrane proteins sharing 93-95% sequence homology to the human GSD-1b protein. The expression profiles of murine GSD-1b and G6Pase differ both in the liver and in the kidney; the GSD-1b transcript appears before the G6Pase mRNA during development. In addition to G6Pase deficiency, GSD-1b patients suffer neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and recurrent bacterial infections. Interestingly, although the G6Pase mRNA is expressed primarily in the liver, kidney, and intestine, the GSD-1b mRNA is expressed in numerous tissues, including human neutrophils/monocytes."

In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction coupling involves the interaction between two important proteins, the α1-subunit of theL-type Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor or DHPR),1 located in the transverse tubular membrane, and the Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor or RyR), located in the junctional terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The DHPR acts as a voltage sensor in response to depolarization of the transverse tubule, whereas RyR responds as a release channel for Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ channel function of the DHPR is probably irrelevant for excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle (1Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Among these, Glu4032, Asp4815, and Asp4917 are absolutely conserved (Fig. 1), suggesting that these amino acids might play an important role in structure/function relationships in Ca2+ release channels. In this study, we mutated 14 negatively charged and amidated amino acids (plus vicinal Gly and Ala residues), which were conserved among 11 members of the RyR and IP3R families. These residues are located in M1, M2, M5, M7, and M10 of RyR1. We used Ca2+microfluorimetry to measure Ca2+ release in response to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol for wild type and mutant RyR1 proteins transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells. We also measured [3H]ryanodine binding by wild type and mutant RyR1 proteins, and sedimentation was used to assess the oligomeric status of the expressed receptors. Our results indicate that residues in M2, M7, and M10 are involved in channel function.

A microfluorimetry system (Photon Technologies Inc.) was used to monitor the fluorescence changes before and after addition of caffeine or 4-chloro-m-cresol to the surface of HEK-293 cells that had been transfected with wild type or mutant RyR1 cDNA, as described previously (25Tong J.

Cells were cultured and loaded with Fura-2AM on a glass coverslip. The coverslip was then inserted into a chamber mounted on the stage of a Zeiss inverted Diaphot microscope. The chamber was used in the open bath configuration so that solution changes could be made at a rate of ∼2.5 ml/min from a pipette tip placed near the target cells. A vacuum line was placed on the side of the chamber opposite to the pipette tip and adjusted so that the volume was maintained at ∼0.5 ml. For each mutant, clusters of about 30 cells were monitored in 3–4 fields in each coverslip, and 4–6 different transfections were carried out. Wild type RYR1 cDNA was included in each transfection. Data were averaged and expressed as mean ± S.E. Microsome preparations were carried out as described previously (31Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Microsome preparations (0.3 mg/ml) were incubated with 60 nm[3H]ryanodine for 2 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm Na-Pipes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mKCl, 0.2 m sucrose, 10 mm ATP, 0.8 mm CaCl2, and a mix of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml E64). Nonspecific binding was determined using 30 μm unlabeled ryanodine. Aliquots of the samples were placed on Whatman GF/B membrane filters prewetted with distilled water. Filters were washed 3 times with 6 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m KCl, and 0.25 mm CaCl2. The radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine. All binding assays were carried out in triplicate. Transfected HEK-293 cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS (147 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and harvested in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. Cell pellets were washed with PBS and centrifuged again. Cell pellets from 100-mm dishes were then solubilized on ice for 45 min in 1 ml of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% CHAPS, 5 mg/ml l-phosphatidylcholine, and the protease inhibitor mix described above. Solubilized proteins were obtained by removing the debris through centrifugation at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Microsome preparations were solubilized as described previously (31Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant from cells or microsomes was placed on the top of a 7.5–25% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient solution containing 50 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.3% CHAPS, 0.15%l-phosphatidylcholine, and protease inhibitor mix and was centrifuged at 28,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 40 rotor for 18–20 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 1.0 ml each were collected from bottom to top and measured for immmunoreactivity. Immunoreactivity in the sucrose density gradient fractions was determined by direct enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay using monoclonal antibody 34C (24Airey J.A. Beck C.F. Murakami K. Tanksley S.J.

Glu4032, Asp4815, and Asp4917 are 100% conserved in the RyR/IP3R family, but Asn4662 is poorly conserved and was not analyzed. Conserved, negatively charged amino acids, Asp3987, Glu4032, Asp4815, and Asp4815, amidated residues Asn4034, Asn4937, Asn4575, Asn4805, Asn4806, Gln4933, and Ala3988, and small residue Gly4033 were selected for mutagenesis. Two absolutely conserved residues Asp4938 in the COOH terminus and Asp4938 and Asp4969, located on the predicted cytoplasmic junction of M10, were also included. In initial studies, most residues were mutated to the small, non-polar residue Ala, whereas Ala3988 was mutated to Val. Wild type and mutant RyR1 proteins were expressed in HEK-293 cells. Western blotting of whole cell lysates with monoclonal antibody 34C showed no expression of RyR1 in non-transfected or vector-transfected HEK-293 cells, but wild type and all of the mutants were expressed at readily detectable levels (Fig. 2). Although the extent of staining of Western blots of whole cell lysates varied from lane to lane, the differences averaged out over 5 independent experiments, so that we did not observe any significant differences in the expression level of any of the mutants described in this study. There was also no significant difference in apparent molecular mass between wild type and mutant RyR1 proteins (Fig. 2). Caffeine releases Ca2+from internal stores through RyR, by sensitizing the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release process (33Ehrlich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), whereas 4-chloro-m-cresol stimulates the Ca2+ release channel through an unknown mechanism (34Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar). The peak amplitude of fura-2 fluorescence following each application of caffeine or 4-chloro-m-cresol was measured to estimate the function of each expressed wild type or mutant RyR1. Fig. 3 A shows an example of the fluorescence changes elicited in wild typeRyR1-transfected cells in response to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol. Fura-2-loaded cells were first challenged with 20 mm caffeine. This caused a significant upward shift in the fluorescence ratio, indicating that Ca2+ stored internally was released into the cytosol. After peak fluorescence was reached, caffeine was washed away by perfusion, allowing Ca2+ to return to the internal store before 4-chloro-m-cresol was added to obtain a second peak of Ca2+ release. We did not observe any changes in the 340/380 nm ratio after application of either 20 mm caffeine or 0.3 mm 4-chloro-m-cresol to either non-transfected or vector-transfected HEK 293 cells. We did, however, observe that concentrations of 4-chloro-m-cresol higher than 0.5 mm could induce a slow Ca2+ release phase in non-transfected cells. Fig. 3 B shows the results of fluorescence measurements for control, wild type, and mutant RyR1 proteins. Mutation to Ala of three absolutely conserved residues, Glu4032, Asp4815and Asp4917, and of the less well conserved Asn4806, led to the loss of response to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol. Two mutants, N4805A and Q4933A, showed decreased response to both agents. The response of other mutants, to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol, including control mutants Asp4938 and Asp4969, was not different from wild type RyR1. Mutants A3988V and G4033A were also normally responsive to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol. The location of Gly vicinal to an acidic amino acid, a critical feature in the formation of Ca2+-binding sites in Ca2+-ATPase molecules (12Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), is obviously not critical to RyR1 function. Since mutation to Ala changed size and charge for acidic residues, and size and polarity for amidated residues, it was of interest to determine the consequences of less drastic mutations. Asp was mutated to Asn and Glu, Glu to Gln and Asp, Asn to Gln and Asp, and Gln to Asn and Glu. These included Glu4032 in M2; Asn4805, Asn4806 and Asp4815 in M7; and Asp4917 and Gln4933 in M10. In addition, Asp4938 in the COOH terminus was again included as a control. The response of these mutants to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol is presented in Fig. 3 C. When Glu4032 in M2 was mutated to Asp, wild type function was retained, but this was not the case for mutation to Gln, indicating that charge is important for RyR1 function. In M5, mutation of Asn4805 to Gln and Asp and mutation of Asp4815to Asn and Glu did not result in any significant defect in response to caffeine or 4-chloro-m-cresol, implying that the size of these residues is more important than charge. Mutation of Asp4917 in M10 to Ala, Asn, and Glu led to loss of caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol responses, implying that retention of Asp at position 4917 is essential. When Gln4933 was mutated to Ala, a decrease in the peak amplitude of the fluorescence ratio was observed, but mutation to Asn and Glu, of similar size and polarity, abolished responses to both caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol. When Asp3938 was mutated to Asn, the mutant response to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol was not different from wild type, and when mutated to Glu, the response was diminished. Binding of ryanodine to the single high affinity binding site on the ryanodine receptor requires channel opening (35Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Meissner G. el-Hashem A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Microsomes from cells expressing each of the mutant RyR1 proteins were incubated with 60 nm [3H]ryanodine under conditions promoting Ca2+ release channel opening. As shown in Fig. 4, those mutants lacking response to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol also had no significant [3H]ryanodine binding, indicating that the channels were either closed, that they did not form a tetrameric complex, or that they did not fold and assemble properly and were vulnerable to proteolytic digestion. Western blotting of wild type and nonfunctional mutant proteins in cell lysates (Fig. 2) or in microsomal membranes (not shown) revealed bands of comparable content and molecular mass. Therefore, the defective [3H]ryanodine binding in microsome preparations from those mutants that were not responsive to caffeine was not due to their poor expression in HEK-293 cells. The fact that the proteins were located in the microsomal fraction indicated that the mutations did not affect membrane insertion. Mutants Q4933A and D4938E, which were weakly responsive to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol, retained normal [3H]ryanodine binding capacity, confirming that an active tetrameric channel was formed. In order to determine whether ryanodine binding deficient channels were tetrameric, sedimentation assays in linear sucrose gradients were carried out. The location of wild type RyR1 proteins in gradient fractions was determined using monoclonal antibody 34C. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the expressed RyR proteins in a linear sucrose density gradient. A single peak of immunoreactivity in the position corresponding to an oligomer in the gradient fractions was found in solubilized preparations from wild type RyR1, mutants G4033A and Q4933A, and all the non-functional mutants in M2, M7, and M10 (Fig. 5 and Table I). These expressed proteins clearly formed an oligomeric complex of similar size to that formed by the native receptor (31Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating that they have normal structure but abnormal function.Table ICaffeine/4-chloro-m-cresol response, [3H]ryanodine binding, and tetramer formation for RyR1 mutantsLocationAmino acid changeCaffeine/cresol responseRyanodine bindingTetramer formationM1D3987A++ND1-aND, not determined.A3988V++NDM2E4032A−−+E4032Q−+/−+E4032D++NDG4033A+++1-bDetermined with solubilized microsomes.N4034A++NDN4037A++NDM5N4574A++NDM7N4805A++NDN4806A−−+N4806Q++NDN4806D++NDD4815A−−+D4815N++NDD4815E++NDM10D4917A−−+D4917N−−+D4917E−−+Q4933A+/−++1-bDetermined with solubilized microsomes.Q4933N−−+Q4933E−+/−+COOH terminusD4938A++NDD4938N++NDD4938E++NDD4969A++ND1-a ND, not determined.1-b Determined with solubilized microsomes. Open table in a new tab In this study, alterations in function were observed following mutation of individual amino acid residues in transmembrane sequences M2, M7, and M10 of RyR1, as summarized in Figs. 3 and 4 and in Table I. In M2, mutation of Glu4032 to Ala or Gln, but not to Asp, led to loss of channel response to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol and to loss of [3H]ryanodine binding, but tetramer formation was retained. In M7, mutation of Asn4806 to Ala, but not to Gln or Asp, and mutation of Asp4815 to Ala, but not to Asn or Glu, had similar deleterious effects. It is of special interest that neither M2 nor M7 are among the 4 most hydrophobic sequences first identified by Takeshima et al. (4Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Clearly these sequences do play a role in functions associated with transmembrane sequences (38Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). In M10, mutation of Asp4917 to Ala, Asn or Glu, and of Gln4933 to Asn or Glu led to loss of Ca2+release channel function, whereas tetramer formation was retained. Asp4917 seemed to be irreplaceable, since change to Ala, Asn, or Glu abolished channel function. These observations highlight M10 as an interesting sequence for further detailed analysis of channel pore formation. The reasons for the defects in caffeine response and [3H]ryanodine binding in our mutant channels are not known. The physical structure of the ion-conduction pathway may be altered in these mutants. Since transmembrane sequences of the Ca2+ release channel are likely to form the pore of the channel, substitutions of critical amino acids in the pore region may cause narrowing or distortion of the interior of the pore and thus not allow Ca2+ ions to pass through. It is well known that ryanodine binding to Ca2+ release channels requires opening of the channel. Thus our [3H]ryanodine binding data indicate that those mutant channels that are inactive and do not respond to caffeine are closed. Channel opening is associated with a 4° rotation of the transmembrane region with respect to the cytosolic region (39Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Disruption of the channel pore might prevent the rotation of the transmembrane region that leads to channel opening. A second possibility is that transmembrane sequences M2, M7, and M10 form part of the ion selectivity filter (40Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stuhmer W. Imoto K. Numa S. Nature. 1992; 356: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 41Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W.

Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) in the Ca2+ release channel and that alterations in ion selectivity occur in [3H]ryanodine binding deficient mutants. A third possibility is that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the mutant channels is decreased. Activation of the Ca2+release channel by Ca2+ is mediated through high affinity Ca2+-binding sites that are likely to be located within the channel. Although several Ca2+-binding sites have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated (3Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), none of them has been confirmed as the critical site of Ca2+ activation. Strong evidence has been presented to show that negatively charged amino acids in transmembrane sequences are major contributors to the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites in SERCA molecules (10Clarke D.M.

Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In fact, the high affinity binding site determines the selectivity of L-type Ca2+ channels for Ca2+ over other ions (41Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Support for the view that negatively charged amino acids in transmembrane sequences might be major contributors to the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites in RyR1 comes from the work of Chen et al. (43Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) who reported that the mutation E3885A in M2 in RyR3 (equivalent to E4032A in RyR1) resulted in the loss of caffeine response in transfected HEK-293 cells, in agreement with our observations. They used single channel recordings in planar bilayers to show that the mutant RYR3 forms a functional channel with normal conductance in which Ca2+ sensitivity for activation is reduced by 10,000-fold. The mutant channel retained normal modulation by ryanodine, caffeine, and ATP. Formation of heterotetramers of wild type and mutant channels by coexpression led to channels with intermediate Ca2+ sensitivity. These observations led Chenet al. (43Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to propose that Glu3885 is a key residue in formation of the Ca2+ sensor of RyR3. Our data for mutant E4032A in RYR1 are consistent with the observations of Chenet al. (43Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and extend them to mutants N4806A, D4815A, and D4917A, which also did not respond to either caffeine or 4-chloro-m-cresol when expressed in HEK-293 cells. A potential inconsistency lies in the fact that Chen et al.(43Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrated a response of the E3885A mutant to ryanodine, suggesting that the ryanodine-binding site is intact in activated channels, whereas we could not detect [3H]ryanodine binding to our E4032A or E4032Q mutants in the presence of 10 mm ATP and 100 μm free Ca2+, recreating conditions that activate the E3885A mutant channel. We also tested the E4032A and E4032Q mutants for [3H]ryanodine binding in a novel assay 2G. G. Du and D. H. MacLennan, unpublished observations. using a series of Ca2+ concentrations, ranging frompCa 8 to 1.5 in the presence of 5 mm caffeine and 1 mm ATP, but we did not find any specific [3H]ryanodine binding in either of these two mutants (data not shown). It is possible that the E4032A and E4032Q mutations are even more insensitive to Ca2+ than the E3885A mutant so that they do not open under the conditions defined. Alternatively, it is possible that these mutations in RyR1 also affect ryanodine binding directly. Single channel recordings across a planar lipid bilayer provide an excellent assay for mutant RyR1 function. However, some mutants may not form functional channels in the bilayer system (44Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and, since only a tiny fraction of molecules is sampled, errors can arise from inadvertent assay of endogenous channels. In unpublished studies using Ca2+ imaging, 3J. Tong, T. V. McCarthy, and D. H. MacLennan,J. Biol. Chem., in press. we have noted that caffeine or halothane-stimulated Ca2+release occurs in less than 3% of untransfected cells, in line with the observation that RyR1 is not detectable through Western blotting of whole cell lysates (45Gromada J. Rorsman P. Dissing S. Wulff B.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ca2+ photometry and ryanodine binding, in which fluorescence or binding data are gathered from a large number of intact cells, are very useful assays for the screening and partial characterization of RyR1 proteins carrying mutations. In earlier studies, we and others (25Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Thus Ca2+photometry and [3H]ryanodine binding provide a relatively rapid and efficient first screen for the detection of interesting mutants that can then be subjected to more time-consuming, detailed analyses. Although there is no consensus regarding the number of transmembrane sequences in the COOH-terminal region of RyR1, hydrophobicity of four predicted transmembrane sequences is obvious. They are referred to as M1–M4 in the sequence of Takeshima et al. (4Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S.

Transmembrane sequences are believed to be key determinants of both tetramer formation and channel pore formation (3Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol.

Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). Attempts have been made to analyze the function of the COOH terminus of RyR1, containing transmembrane sequences. A truncated RyR1transcript is expressed in brain (48Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is probably initiated at Met4382, resulting in the expression of the COOH-terminal 656 amino acid residues of RyR1, and would be missing M1 and M2, as defined in Fig. 1. This protein has been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, where it was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. However, neither caffeine response nor [3H]ryanodine binding activity could be detected in the expressed, truncated protein. A longer truncated COOH-terminal fragment of RyR1, containing M1 and M2 (see Fig. 1), has also been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This expressed protein formed a functional channel that was shown in single channel recordings to be responsive to ryanodine, but to be otherwise unregulated. This fragment must form a functional tetramer and a channel pore, but regulation may involve other upstream sequences. The NH2-terminal portion of RyR1 clearly contributes additional regulatory sites, exemplified by the two MH domains (49Loke J.C.P. MacLennan D.H. Am. J. Med. 1998; 104: 470-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper lend support to the notion that M2, M7, and M10 are transmembrane sequences that participate in tetramer assembly and channel pore formation. We thank J. Tong, P.

https://openalex.org/W2031419602,"Human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) introduced into yeast undergoes alpha-secretase-type cleavage, suggesting that yeast have alpha-secretase-like protease(s). Here we report that two structurally and functionally related glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked yeast aspartyl proteases, Mkc7p and Yap3p (collectively termed yapsin), are responsible for alpha-secretase-type cleavage of APP expressed in yeast, resulting in release of soluble APP into the extracellular space. Disruption of MKC7 and YAP3 in a vacuolar protease-deficient strain abolished this APP cleavage/release, and APP cleavage/release could be restored by introduction of MKC7 or YAP3 on a single copy plasmid. Purified Mkc7p cleaved an internally quenched fluorogenic APP peptide substrate at the alpha-secretase cleavage site. Measurement of proteolytic activity either in yeast homogenates or on the yeast cell surface revealed that most Mkc7p and Yap3p activities were localized at the cell surface. These results establish a molecular basis for alpha-secretase-type cleavage in yeast and support the generally held concept that alpha-secretase cleavage of APP occurs at the cell surface."

The active cell proliferation and turnover of the intestinal epithelium makes this tissue a good experimental model for investigating the nature of regulatory networks that control events such as cell lineage commitment and differentiation. All mature epithelial cell types found in the adult intestine are derived from a nonmigratory stem cell pool located at the base of the crypts of Lieberkühn (see Ref. 1Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar for a review). The enterocytes are the most abundant cells in the intestine, accounting for approximately 95% of the mucosal cells of the small intestine. As the enterocyte precursors migrate from the crypts, they stop proliferating and acquire differentiated functions, governed by specific patterns of gene expression, that depend on the cell lineage, state of proliferation or differentiation, and spatial location along the crypt-villus and cephalocaudal (duodenum/colon) axes. But the molecular basis of this diversity is still poorly understood. Determining the sequences involved in the regulation of genes expressed in a subset of intestinal epithelial cells is a first step toward defining these factors. Traber and co-workers (2Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) used this approach to identify Cdx2, a homeoprotein involved in the control of the sucrase-isomaltase gene. Cdx2 is one of the very few transcription factors that is active only in the adult intestinal epithelium (3James R. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3246-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it appears to be a key element controlling the differentiation of the intestinal epithelium (4Chawengsaksophak K. James R.

The complexity of the architecture of the intestinal epithelium is such that transgenic mouse technology is a powerful tool for characterizing the complexity of the cis-acting elements involved in the regulation of intestinal gene transcription (for reviews, see Refs.7 and 8). We have used the calbindin-D9K(CaBP9K) gene as a marker of intestinal differentiation in studies on the regulatory elements involved in its intestine-specific pattern of expression. The CaBP9K gene is expressed only in the differentiated enterocytes of the proximal region of the small intestine (mainly in the duodenum) and the large intestine (mainly in the cecum) (9Thomasset M. Parkes C.O. Cuisinier-Gleizes P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: E483-E488PubMed Google Scholar, 10Perret C. Desplan C. Thomasset M. Eur. J.

We have shown that the CaBP9K gene expression is under positive transcriptional control of the vitamin D3 active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D3, in the intestine (10Perret C. Desplan C. Thomasset M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Dupret J.M. Brun P. Perret C. Lomri N. Thomasset M. Cuisinier-Gleizes P. J. Biol.

Gene. 1991; 108: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The proximal region contains a major intestine-specific DNase I HS,1 HS4, close to the promoter. In vitro footprinting and gel shift assays showed that a combination of an ubiquitous factor (NF1), liver-enriched factors (HNF1, C/EBP, and HNF4), and the Cdx2 homeoprotein bind to this region and may be important for controlling CaBP9K gene transcription in the intestine (14Lambert M. Colnot S. Suh E. L’Horset F. Blin C. Calliot M.E. Raymondjean M. Thomasset M. Traber P.G. Perret C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The distal region, HS1, is a duodenum-specific HS located 3.5 kbp upstream from the start site. We have recently shown by transient transfection assays (14Lambert M. Colnot S. Suh E. L’Horset F.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as by creating different transgenic mouse lines (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), that 9K/−4580 sequences of the CaBP9K gene (from −4580 to +365) containing the two potential HS are necessary to direct active transgene expression in the duodenum in a vitamin D3dependent manner. In addition, a short construct, 9K/−117 (from −117 to +365), containing only HS4, is not sufficient to direct expression of the transgene in the intestine (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M.

The present study further examines the mechanisms that restrictCaBP9K gene transcription to the epithelium of the villus and shows that the 9K/−4580-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct confers a correct crypt-villus pattern of transgene expression. We have identified the minimal regulatory elements needed to confer this intestinal expression on the CaBP9K gene and demonstrated that there must be cooperation between the HS1 distal activator and the minimal promoter containing a Cdx2-binding site for the correct targeting of cephalocaudal transgene expression and vitamin D responsiveness in the small intestine. Last, we have described a potential second Cdx2-binding site in the distal activator HS1 and tested in vivo the functional relevance of this site by mutagenesis in transgenic mice. The plasmid (9K/−4400-CAT) has been previously described (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has revealed that it contained 4580 base pairs of the 5′ regulatory sequences of the rat CaBP9K gene (−4580 to +365) placed in front of the coding sequences of the CAT gene. Therefore, this plasmid has been termed 9K/−4580-CAT in this report. The transgene 9K/−117-CAT was isolated by HindIII digestion of the plasmid 9K/−4580-CAT. This fragment contains the promoter region (beginning at −117), the first exon, the first intron, and the beginning of the second exon in front of the CAT gene. ASmaI-PvuII CaBP9K fragment (−3735 to −2891) was inserted upstream of a blunted BamHI site of pBLCAT2 to generate 9K/HS1-thymidine kinase-CAT, and insertion upstream of a blunted HindIII site of 9K/−117-CAT generated 9K/HS1–117-CAT. The Kunkel method (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) was used for oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis after subcloning the 4580 to −2200 CaBP9K fragment in the KS Bluescript phagemid and transformation in RZ1032 host cells (Promega). The oligonucleotide primer used was 5′-AAACATGCCCATAGGTGCAGGGTGTGT-3′. The entire wild type and mutant regions were sequenced on both strands (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) to verify that only the desired mutation was present. The mutant fragment was then subcloned in 9K/−4580-CAT-KS instead of the wild type fragment to obtain the −4580Cdxmut-CAT plasmid. Microinjection fragments were linearized and purified. Transgenic mice were generated, identified, and propagated (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. J. Biol.

The effect of the vitamin D3-depleted diet was verified by Northern blotting using duodenal mRNA hybridized with a CaBP9K probe (data not shown). Various tissues were dissected out from young adult (5–7-week-old) F1 transgenic mice for CAT assays. Cell lysates were obtained (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T.

CAT activity was measured according to TLC standard protocols, with 5–300 μg of protein and reaction times of up to 4 h to keep the enzyme activity in a linear range. CAT activity was revealed immunocytochemically using an anti-rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified antibody to CAT (5 Prime – 3 Prime, Inc., Paoli, PA) (18Sabourin J.-C. Kern A.-S. Gregori C. Porteu A.

The duodena and colons from 9K/−4580-CAT transgenic mice were removed, cut into small pieces and rapidly frozen. Frozen sections (7 μm) were cut with a cryostat and incubated with the anti-CAT antibody (dilution, 1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h. The sections were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-digoxigenin plus F(ab′)2 fragment (dilution, 1:400; Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at room temperature, and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were then incubated with anti-digoxigenin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (dilution, 1:400; Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted, and examined under a Zeiss microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Control sections were processed as above but without the anti-CAT antibody. Total RNA was prepared from several tissues of young adult B6/CBA mice by the guanidium thiocyanate single-step procedure (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Northern blotting (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M.

Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting assays were performed as before. The DNA fragments used as probes for footprinting assays were prepared by subcloning polymerase chain reaction products from the −3537 to −3281 region of 9K/−4580-CAT and −4580Cdxmut-CAT plasmids to generate wild type (WT HS1) and mutated probe (MUT HS1). The annealed oligonucleotides used as probes or competitors were as follows: SIF1 (−59 to −31), 5′-GAGGGTGCAATAAAACTTTATGAGTAGGT-3′ from human sucrase-isomaltase promoter (20Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); 9KCdxd (−3441 to −3422), 5′-TGCATTTATGGGCATGTTTCC-3′; and MUT9KCdxd 5′-TGCACCTATGGGCATGTTTCC-3′. The complementary oligonucleotides used for gel shift assays were hybridized and end-labeled using [γ-32P]T4 polynucleotide kinase. For supershift assays, binding reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with anti-Cdx2 antibody (a gift from P. G. Traber) with gentle agitation. The radiolabeled DNA was then added (14Lambert M. Colnot S. Suh E. L’Horset F. Blin C. Calliot M.E. Raymondjean M. Thomasset M. Traber P.G. Perret C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mouse and rat CaBP9K genes are mainly expressed in the proximal region of the small intestinal epithelium (duodenum) and only in the enterocytes (11Warembourg M. Perret C. Thomasset M. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Bruns M.E. Vollmer S. Wallshein V. Bruns D.E. J. Biol.

Rev. 1989; 10: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2 E). The CaBP9K gene is expressed in the cecum and weakly in the proximal colon of the large intestine (10Perret C. Desplan C. Thomasset M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2 E). The 9K/−4580 sequences of the rat CaBP9Kgene contain the information necessary for correct transgene expression along the cephalocaudal axis in the small intestine, but this gene causes also ectopic expression of the transgene in the distal colon (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical studies on 9K/−4580-CAT mice showed that the transgene was expressed along the crypt-villus axis within the duodenum and the colon (Fig. 1). Analysis of several sections of duodena from transgenic mice revealed that CAT transgene is expressed along the length of the villus, in the epithelial layer but not in the crypt (Fig. 1 A). The staining intensity is consistent with the amount of the CaBP9K in the enterocytes, which constitute 95% of the cellular population in the villus epithelium. But the difficulty of immunolocalizing the CAT transgene made it difficult to be sure that transgene expression was restricted to the enterocytes. The same gradient of CAT expression occurred in the distal colon (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the 9K/−4580 regulatory sequences of the CaBP9K gene contain the information needed for expression of the transgene in the differentiated epithelial cells in the small and large intestine.Figure 1Immunohistochemical detection of the CAT protein in the duodenum and colon of 9K/−4580-CAT transgenic mice.

We created new transgenes with various deletions. As there is a distal intestine-restricted DNase I hypersensitive site (HS1) 3500 bp upstream of the transcription start site (13Perret C. L’Horset F. Thomasset M. Gene. 1991; 108: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we explored its activating potential by generating two types of transgenic mouse lines (Fig. 2 A). The 9K/−117-CAT construct was prepared to confirm results previously obtained using the 9K/−117-AgT construct, in which 9K/−117 sequences of theCaBP9K promoter (the minimal promoter) were unable to target expression of the SV40 large T antigen in the intestine (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. J. Biol.

We prepared the 9K/HS1–117-CAT construct containing an internal deletion that placed the distal HS1 box just in front of the minimal promoter. We generated seven lines of mice with the 9K/−117-CAT transgene and six lines with the 9K/HS1–117-CAT transgene (Table I and Fig. 2, B and C). The CAT activities in the duodenum and other parts of the intestine were compared with those obtained with mouse transgenic line 94 harboring the 9K/−4580-CAT construct (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F.

Differences between individuals in each transgenic line were relatively large, so that we were obliged to examine many mice from each transgenic line (Table I).Table ICAT activity in intestinal tissues from 9K/CAT transgenic miceVitamin D status1-aNorm D mice were fed a standard diet, not supplemented in vitamin D3, −D mice were fed a vitamin D3 deficient diet, and +D mice were fed a vitamin D3-deficient diet and were injected with 1,25(OH)2D3 16 h before sacrifice.−D+DNorm DConstructLineCopy nb1-bNumber of transgene copies integrated.n 1-cNumber of mice analyzed.Duodenumn 1-cNumber of mice analyzed.Duodenumn 1-cNumber of mice analyzed.DuodenumJejunumIleumCecumProximal colonDistal colon9k/-4580-CAT9430420.3 ± 9.351643 ± 6215130 ± 1076.3 ± 2.77.9 ± 4.02.3 ± 1.60.9 ± 0.683.4 ± 37.59k/−117-CAT920ND1-dND, not determined.ND2≤0.0011-e≤0.001: no detectable CAT activity.≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.00175NDND2≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0015560NDND3≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0016520NDND3≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0017510NDND2≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0016120NDND2≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0019k/HS1–117-CAT42031.8 ± 1.542.8 ± 2.3472.3 ± 2.10.005 ± 0.0080.1 ± 0.310.4 ± 15.90.2 ± 0.40.03 ± 0.052440329.3 ± 9.7248.0 ± 20.0730.0 ± 15.30.2 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.377.5 ± 64.015.0 ± 10.84.1 ± 6.9204096.2 ± 3.7734.6 ± 24.727.3 ± 0.70.4 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.422.8 ± 19.716.3 ± 4.30.9 ± 0.4431573.1 ± 2.2881.6 ± 40.4106.4 ± 7.50.8 ± 0.62.6 ± 4.08.0 ± 6.38.3 ± 7.04.3 ± 4.6255NDND60.2 ± 0.2≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0010.005 ± 0.0060.004 ± 0.00633100NDND51.0 ± 0.90.1 ± 0.010.2 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.21.2 ± 1.30.1 ± 0.13920NDND7≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001Mean1-fThe means ± S.D. of the CAT activities of individual mice from various mouse lines carrying the same construct.6.7 ± 9.90.2 ± 0.30.8 ± 1.315.9 ± 26.35.7 ± 6.60.8 ± 1.49k/HS1TK-CAT112NDND3≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001165NDND2≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0017215NDND2≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0017320NDND2≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0019k/−4580 Cdxmut-CAT615NDND60.1 ± 0.1≤0.001≤0.001≤0.001≤0.0010.009 ± 0.0141615NDND60.3 ± 0.20.01 ± 0.020.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.0394150NDND65.7 ± 4.52.1 ± 0.90.7 ± 0.50.5 ± 0.70.2 ± 0.26.4 ± 1.810515NDND50.2 ± 0.20.03 ± 0.030.01 ± 0.010.3 ± 0.50.2 ± 0.30.03 ± 0.052005NDND60.05 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.020.04 ± 0.020.06 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.0421220NDND30.2 ± 0.20.04 ± 0.0200.04 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.020.02 ± 0.010.4 ± 0.1Mean1-fThe means ± S.D. of the CAT activities of individual mice from various mouse lines carrying the same construct.1.1 ± 2.00.4 ± 0.80.1 ± 0.30.1 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.11.2 ± 2.3Values for each line are mean ± S.D.1-a Norm D mice were fed a standard diet, not supplemented in vitamin D3, −D mice were fed a vitamin D3 deficient diet, and +D mice were fed a vitamin D3-deficient diet and were injected with 1,25(OH)2D3 16 h before sacrifice.1-b Number of transgene copies integrated.1-c Number of mice analyzed.1-d ND, not determined.1-e ≤0.001: no detectable CAT activity.1-f The means ± S.D. of the CAT activities of individual mice from various mouse lines carrying the same construct.

In agreement with our previous data obtained with 9K/−117-AgT, the 9K/−117-CAT construct did not target any detectable CAT expression in any part of the intestine studied, whatever the transgene copy number (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table I). By contrast, juxtaposition of HS1 box and the minimal promoter restored CAT activity in the duodenum, but the activity was weaker than that obtained with the 9K/−4580-CAT construct (Fig. 2 B). A compilation of our previous (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and present data clearly shows that except for one low transgene copy number mouse line (line 84, two copies) that had little CAT activity in the duodenum, the mice of all the transgenic lines harboring the 9K/−4580-CAT construct had high CAT activity in the duodenum, the distribution of which was relatively uniform (Fig. 2 B and Table I). By contrast, the CAT activity in the duodena of the mice of the HS1–117-CAT transgenic lines was more dispersed and independent of the transgene copy number, which is consistent with an integration site effect on transgene expression (Table I and Fig. 2 B). This result suggests that the region between −2894 and −117 is required to establish an open chromatin structure for high activity, but not for the duodenal specificity. The anterior-posterior distribution of transgene activity in 9K/−4580-CAT mice (line 94 was representative of the other lines tested (Ref. 15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and data not shown) was maximal in the duodenum and distal colon (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, transgene expression in the 9K/HS1–117-CAT mice was maximal in the duodenum and the cecum (Fig. 2 D), which correlated more closely with the expression of the endogenous CaBP9K gene (Fig. 2 E). We obtained no data on the expression of the transgene along the crypt-villus axis with the 9K/HS1–117-CAT construct; the duodenal CAT activity was below the threshold of the immunocytochemical assay used. Thus, the distal element HS1 contains sequences that cooperate with the proximal CaBP9K promoter to stimulate specific transcription in the intestine; hence, the HS-1 box can be defined as an intestinal activator region. We measured the activity of this distal activator element on a heterologous promoter. For this, we cloned the distal HS1 element in front of the ubiquitous minimal promoter of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, to obtain the HS1/thymidine kinase-CAT construct (Fig. 2 A). The four transgenic lines obtained showed no CAT activity in the intestine or in the other tissues tested (Fig. 2, Table I, and data not shown). Thus the distal activator HS1 did not confer intestinal expression on a heterologous promoter in vivo and acts only on its own promoter. This suggests that there must be cooperation between the distal HS1 box and the minimal promoter to activate the CaBP9K promoter in vivo in the intestine. As the responsiveness of the CaBP9K gene to vitamin D3 is an important feature of its intestinal expression, and as the 9K/−4580 sequences confer vitamin D3-inducible intestinal expression (15Romagnolo B. Cluzeaud F. Lambert M. Colnot S. Porteu A. Molina T. Tomasset M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we have looked for a response to this hormone in four transgenic mouse lines harboring the 9K/HS1–117-CAT construct. The 9K/HS1–117 sequences conferred responsiveness to vitamin D3 on transgenic mice (Table I and Fig. 3). A single injection of 25 ng of 1,25(OH)2D3 caused vitamin D3-deficient transgenic mice to increase their duodenal expression of CAT 1.5–26-fold (Fig. 3). The CAT activities obtained with the “norm D” mice fed a standard diet were in the same range as those for the “−D” mice fed a vitamin D3-deficient diet (Table I). This is probably because the standard chow diet (norm D) is naturally deficient in vitamin D3, because the amount of CaBP9K mRNA in the duodena of mice fed a standard chow diet was similar to that of the duodena of mice fed a vitamin D3-deficient diet (data not shown). The degree of vitamin D3 inducibility in each transgenic line was not correlated with the level of transgene expression (Table I). A mouse line with a high intestinal transgene activity (line 24) was poorly vitamin D3-inducible (1.5-fold), whereas a line with less intestinal transgene activity (line 43) was very vitamin D3-inducible (26-fold). This probably reflects an integration position effect. The position effects on both the basal expression and hormonal inducibility of transgenes are well documented and probably reflect variegation-type phenomena (i.e. the influence of the chromatin structure around the integration site) and the presence of regulatory elements near the integrated transgene (23Guy L.G. Kothary R. Wall L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4400-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Grange T. Roux J. Fromont-Racine M. Pictet R. Exp.

A. 1995; 92: 7197-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The 9K/HS1–117 sequences thus contain all of the information needed to direct the correct intestinal expression of the CaBP9K gene along the horizontal axis of the small intestine and to mediate responsiveness to vitamin D3. However, a computer sequence analysis of the entire 9K/HS1–117 region (Fig. 4) does not indicate the presence of a consensus vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE), as previously established by an in vitro approach (26Colnot S. Lambert M. Blin C. Thomasset M. Perret C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or a VDRE similar to other previously identified VDREs (for a review, see Ref. 27Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A.

The HS1cis-acting sequences that can cooperate with the minimal promoter in stimulating the intestinal activity of theCaBP9K gene promoter were identified by sequencing theCaBP9K DNA regulatory sequences from −4580 to −2232.

In this investigation we have used ribonuclease probing to study wild-type and mutant RNA substrates to derive biochemical evidence for the presence of a stem loop at the apoB mRNA editing site. In addition we have characterized a series of AU-rich binding proteins that copurify with editing activity and UV cross-link to the secondary structures identified by ribonuclease probing. Proteins of 43/45 kDa have been shown to bind to a region of the apoB mRNA substrate that forms the loop and stem. This may represent the RNA-binding component of the holoenzyme or function to present the RNA to APOBEC-1 for C6666 editing through chaperone actions. Ribonucleases T1, U2, and V1 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and ribonucleases A and C were from Boehringer Mannheim and Sigma, respectively. Carrier tRNA was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Chemical inhibitors PG, NEM, FMA, and pCMB were from Sigma. Autoradiography was performed at −70 °C using Biomax MR film (Kodak) and intensifying screens (DuPont). The alignment of the 11 apoB mRNA species was performed using the program PILEUP, which is part of the University of Wisconsin GCG package version 9.1 (43Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) and was shaded using BOXSHADE (ISREC Bioinformatics Group, HGMP-RC). The program FoldRNA (44Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 262-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) was used to generate optimal foldings of RNA sequences. Extracts were prepared as described previously from chick intestinal epithelium (26Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fugino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. S100 extract was fractionated by adding crystalline ammonium sulfate while stirring on ice, and the precipitate from the 10–70% fraction was collected (25,000 × g, 30 min) and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmmercaptoethanol, and 0.05% ThesitTM). The 10–70% (NH4)2SO4 fraction (800 mg) was chromatographed on a 25-ml blue Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The resin was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A followed by 4 column volumes of a 0–2 m NaCl linear salt gradient in buffer A. The column was then eluted with 1.5 column volumes of 2 m NaCl followed by 4 column volumes of buffer A containing 2 mNaCl and 2 m urea. 10-ml fractions were collected and individually dialyzed against 300 volumes buffer A for 12 h with two changes. Aliquots were then assayed for in vitrocomplementation activity and apoB mRNA cross-linking. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (45Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin for a standard curve. APOBEC-1 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells with a hemagglutinin tag as described previously (26Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fugino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conversion and primer extension assays were performed as described previously (39Shah R.-R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N. Greeve J.C. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16301-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 55-base scrambling mutant human apoB mRNAs (nucleotides 6649–6703), a 208-base (nucleotides 6510–6717) rat apoB mRNA, or 3′-truncated A–I apoB mRNAs. ApoB transcripts were edited in the presence of APOBEC-1 (typically 1 μg) and complementing extract (10–100 μg). Quantification of editing was performed by laser densitometric scanning (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics). Wild-type (A–I), deletion (A–C, A–D, A–E, A–F, A–G, A–H, B–D, B–E, D–H,D–I, E–G, E–H, and G-I), and control (anti-A-I, AU3, Apobrev3, and anti-FG) RNA transcripts used in the cross-linking studies were synthesized by T7-directed in vitro transcription (Ambion) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (26Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fugino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Apobrev3 template was synthesized by two rounds of PCR. The first PCR product was generated using primers ApaI apobrev and Apobrev mid. This was then purified and subjected to a second round of PCR using primers ApaI apobrev and NsiI apobrev. Actin template was supplied with the labeling kit (Ambion). UV cross-linking studies were performed as before (29Navaratnam N. Shah R.-R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cross-linked products were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels which were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Inhibition of conversion or UV cross-linking assays with phenylglyoxal (PG), fluorescein mercuric acetate (FMA), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pCMB) were performed as described previously (29Navaratnam N. Shah R.-R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The RNAs used in this study were synthesized by T7-directed in vitro transcription using reagents and instructions from Ambion Biotechnology Ltd. The wild-type 46-nucleotide apoB mRNA was transcribed from a PCR-generated template (46Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The 55-nucleotide apoB mRNA and scrambling mutant mRNAs (39Shah R.-R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N.

Transcripts were dephosphorylated at their 5′ ends and then radioactively labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Ehresmann (47Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The labeled RNAs were gel-purified from a 10% polyacrylamide-urea denaturing gel and eluted overnight at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2% phenol, and 100 μg of tRNA. The RNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in water and tRNA such that samples yielded 25,000 cpm and 10 μg of tRNA per μl. Sequencing ladders were prepared using non-limiting dilutions of RNase A (5 × 10−2 units/μl), C (1 × 10−2 units/μl), T1 (1 × 10−2units/μl), and U2 (0.1 units/μl). In structure-probing reactions RNAs were digested with RNase C (2 × 10−3units/μl), T1 (0.1 units/μl), and V1 (8 × 10−2 units/μl). Digestions were performed at 30 °C in structure-probing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl) for 1, 5, and 10 min as described previously (48Lee M.-C. Knapp G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3108-3115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxide ladders were generated by RNA hydrolysis at 94 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of hydroxide stop dye as described previously (49Knapp G. Method. Enzymol. 1989; 180: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Structure-probing reactions (4 μl) were terminated by the addition of 2 μl of structure-probing stop dye (9 m urea, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and freezing immediately on dry ice.

Note, all oligonucleotides are in the 5′ to 3′ direction. A comparison of the apoB mRNA sequence (nt 6645–6703) surrounding the edited C6666 of 11 mammalian species is shown in Fig. 1. The sequence around the editing site is 73% AU-rich and highly conserved between species. The level of homology over the entire region is around 94% between all species. To identify regions of apoB mRNA required for editing in the presence of chick auxiliary editing proteins, mutant apoB RNAs were studied. A series of nine scrambling mutants (A to I) spanning the editing site (nt 6649–6703) were generated in which six nucleotides were converted to their complementary sequence for each mutant. Mutant RNAs were tested for editing with chick intestinal S100 extract supplemented with APOBEC-1. A 55-nucleotide wild-type transcript (WT55-mer) was used as an internal standard. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. The efficiency of editing of mutant RNAs is given in terms of percentage of wild-type. Mutations of 12 nucleotides downstream of the edited C, corresponding to mutants D and E (nt 6667–6678), all but abolished editing (7 and 11% WT, respectively). Similarly, mutation of six nucleotides further downstream (mutant G, nt 6685–6690) reduced editing to 7% of WT, demonstrating the requirement of these regions for efficient in vitro editing. Mutants C (nt 6660–6665) and F (nt 6679–6684) supported 25 and 23% WT editing, respectively, indicating the importance of these regions in editing. Mutation of nucleotides further downstream (nt 6691–6703), corresponding to mutants H and I, show elevated editing (225 and 249% WT, respectively). Overall these results demonstrate the importance of nucleotides 6660–6690 (−6 to +24) for editing in vitro in the presence of chick auxiliary proteins. Computer modeling analysis, using the FoldRNA program (44Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 262-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), predicts a stem loop structure for human apoB mRNA, with C6666 localized in the loop. This predicted stem loop is highly conserved throughout all species sequenced. To define the secondary structure of apoB RNA at the editing site, synthetic transcripts were probed with sequence specific ribonucleases. Structure probing was first performed on a shorter human WT46-mer transcript, containing a 6-nucleotide T7 promoter linker and a 40-nucleotide apoB transcript (nt 6645–6684). This transcript contains the sequences present in WT42-mer (62% WT editing) (39Shah R.-R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N. Greeve J.C. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16301-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 5 nt absent from the 3′ end and demonstrates UV cross-linking to APOBEC-1 (data not shown). The computer-predicted secondary structure of WT46-mer is shown, and probing results are summarized in Fig. 3. The cleavage sites for the single-stranded specific ribonucleases A, C, T1, and U2 and duplex-specific ribonuclease V1 are illustrated, with nucleotide number starting at the edited C. The 3rd to 6th lanescorrespond to non-limiting digestions of WT46-mer with RNase A, C, T1, and U2, respectively. These sequencing ladders, along with the hydroxide ladder, serve to identify each specific cleavage site, verify RNA sequence, and enable orientation of structure-probing hits within the RNA molecule produced through limiting digestions (7thto 15th lanes). In ribonuclease structure-probing experiments using ribonucleases C, T1, and V1, only the first hit is informative. Here each ribonuclease was titrated until limiting and reactions were performed at 1, 5, and 10 min. Digestion of the WT46-mer with RNase V1 resulted in cleavage at residues C+9, A−3, G−4, U−5, and G−13, illustrating duplex or stacked regions at these positions (47Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Based on these digestions, a schematic diagram was constructed showing cleavage sites drawn onto the proposed secondary structure (Fig. 3 C). In the model, as in the computer prediction, C6666 is localized in the loop. The primary cleavage sites of RNase C (C0, C−11, and C−15) and RNase T1 (G+11, G+6, G−4, G−13, and G−16) are, in general, located in single-stranded regions, consistent with duplex digestions. Exceptions to this are those cleavages at sites G−4 and G−13 in which both single- and double-stranded specific ribonucleases appear to cleave. A possible explanation for this is the dynamic nature of the structure, moving in and out of this stem loop conformation. These structure-probing results demonstrate the formation of a stem loop for human apoB mRNA at the editing site, with the edited C6666 localized in the loop. We next probed the structure of the WT55-mer transcript used in editing and as an internal standard for the scrambling mutants. Structure-probing results for WT55-mer are shown in Fig. 4. Limiting structure-probing cleavages are shown to the right of the gel, and sequencing ladders and control are positioned to the left. Digestion with RNase V1 resulted in cleavage at residues C+9, U+6, G−4, U−5, U−9, and A−10. The structure accommodated by this information is schematically represented, and, as similarly depicted by the computer predicted model, shows localization of substrate C6666within the loop. The structure of WT55-mer is consistent with that of the stem loop co"

The working model for this work has been an assumption that the epoxide-containing side chain of PS-A, which has the same carbon skeleton as l-isoleucine, occupies the same enzyme binding site as the amino acid substrate. In the same way, the tetrahydropyran ring has been considered as a possible mimic for the ribose in the activated amino acid reaction intermediate, Ile-AMP. As a result, these features have been relatively invariant in PS-A analogues, although a naturally occurring derivative in which the epoxide is replaced with a carbon-carbon double bond retains high potency for IleRS (e.g. ethyl monate C). In contrast, the other side chain of PS-A (i.e. the right-hand side of the structures shown in Fig. 1) has no obvious similarity to the substrates or intermediates of the IleRS reaction. This part of the PS-A molecule has therefore been the subject of most modification (e.g. Refs. 5Crimmin M.J. O’Hanlon P.J. Rogers N.H. Sime F.M. Walker G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1989; 1: 2059-2063Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Walker G. Brown P. Crimmin M.J. Forrest A. O’Hanlon P. Pons J.E. Bently P.H. Ponsford R.

However, the consequences of modification to this portion of the molecule on the interaction of this class of compound with IleRS have not, until now, been studied in any detail. One of the key target organisms for PS-A is Staphylococcus aureus, which is often the cause of upper respiratory tract and nasal infections, and which may be resistant to other classes of antibiotic (e.g. Ref. 1Dobson, R. L., Leyden, J. J., Noble, W. C., and Price, J. D. (eds) (1985) Bactroban: Proceedings of an International Symposium, Nassau, May 21-22, 1984, Excerpta Medica, Elsevier, AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). S. aureus strains resistant to PS-A itself have been identified and the resistance mechanism, at least in some cases, shown to be attributed to mutations in IleRS (e.g. Refs. 9Farmer T.H. Gilbart J. Elson S.W. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Slocombe B. Perry C. J. Hosp.

Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our ultimate goal is to investigate how a more rational approach could be taken to inhibitor design, particularly with respect to overcoming resistance. We have characterized in detail the kinetics and mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis by S. aureus IleRS (12Pope A.J. Lapointe J. Mensah L. Benson N. Brown M.J.B. Moore K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31680-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and, in the present paper, inhibition by PS-A analogues. Understanding the detailed structure-activity relationships for this class of inhibitor has subsequently led to the development of even more potent compounds. 2A. J. Pope, M. J. B. Brown, K. J. Moore, N. Benson, L. Mensah, M. Doyle, A. Forrest, R. Jarvest, P. O’Hanlon, manuscript in preparation. In addition, we wanted to develop the models for binding of PS-A analogues outlined above by relating their interaction with IleRS to those of the substrates and, more importantly, reaction intermediates. We therefore compared the properties of PS-A analogues with non-hydrolyzable derivatives of the normal activated amino acid intermediate, Ile-AMP. Amino-alkyl adenylates such as isoleucinyl adenylate (Ile-ol-AMP; Fig. 1) have long been recognized as potent inhibitors of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (e.g. Refs. 13Cassio D. Lemoine F. Walker J.P. Sardin E. Biosonnas R.A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 14Southgate C.C.B. Dixon H.B.F. Biochem J. 1978; 175: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Compounds in which the phosphate group is replaced by a sulfamate (e.g. Ile-NHSO2-AMP; Fig. 1) have more recently been used in co-crystallisation experiments with a number of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (e.g. Ref. 15Cusack S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The analogy of these compounds to Ile-AMP is, of course, much more obvious than that of PS-A. In this paper, we have compared the kinetics, thermodynamics, and effect upon IleRS conformation (reported by changes in tryptophan fluorescence; see Ref. 12Pope A.J. Lapointe J. Mensah L. Benson N.

Perry C. J. Hosp. Infect. 1991; 19: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This work was given extra impetus by the recent solution of the crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus IleRS·PS-A complex (16Nureki, O., and Yokohama, S. (1997) Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases and Disease, Keystone Symposium, Taos, NM, February 1997Google Scholar, 17Francklyn C. Musier-Forsyth K. Martinis S.A. RNA. 1997; 3: 954-960PubMed Google Scholar). IleRS from S. aureuswas purified (to >98% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or reverse phase HPLC) from Escherichia coliDH1 cells carrying the pDB575 plasmid (18Chalker A.F. Ward J.M. Fosberry A.P. Hodgson J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and shown to be fully active by active-site titration performed either through the measurement of a burst of Mg·ATP utilization (19Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman & Company, New York1984Google Scholar) or the measurement of the stoichiometric IleRS·[14C]Ile-AMP complex by gel-filtration. Except where otherwise stated, reagents were of the highest grade available and purchased mainly from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom). PS-A and ethyl monate-A (Et-A) were isolated from producing Pseudomonas fluorescens strains as described by Fuller et al. (20Fuller A.T. Mellows G. Woodford M. Banks G.T. Barrow K.D. Chain E.B. Nature. 1971; 234: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). SB-205952 was prepared as described by Broom et al. (8Broom N.J.P. Cassels R. Cheng H.Y. Elder J.S. Hannan P.C.T. Masson N. O’Hanlon P.J. Pope A.J. Wilson J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3596-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fermentatively produced3H-labeled PS-A was a kind gift from Dr. Brian Ford (SmithKline Beecham) and was prepared as described by Cassobiancoet al. (21Cassobianco J.O. Doran C. Goldman R.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). tRNA aminoacylation and PPi/ATP exchange assays were performed using modifications to previously described methods (22Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at 22 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). Aminoacylation assays (200 μl) were performed using 0.2–5 nm IleRS,l-[U-14C]isoleucine (Amersham; specific activity = 11.5 MBq/mmol) and 4 mg/ml (final concentration)E. coli MRE 600 tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim; equivalent to ∼4 μm tRNAIle). After specific intervals, 50-μl aliquots (× 3) were quenched using 100 μl of 7% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 10 min. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was harvested using Millipore Multiscreen 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride 96-well plates (Millipore, Watford, Herts, UK) and counted by liquid scintillation. Steady-state PPi/ATP exchange was monitored using 1 nm IleRS, 2 mm 32P-labeled sodium. PPi (specific activity about 3 TBq/mmol) and 2 mm ATP and 2 mm l-isoleucine in buffer A. All reactants (IleRS, PPi, ATP etc.) were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C prior to initiation of32P-labeled isotopic exchange by the addition of a small amount of [32P]PPi, perturbing the total chemical concentration of PPi by less than 1%. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min, quenched, and counted as described above. Reactions were quenched after 10 min using 0.2 mpyrophosphate in 7% perchloric acid. The reaction mixture was harvested by adsorption onto activated charcoal (Sigma, Poole, UK) which was subsequently collected on Millipore Multiscreen 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride 96-well plates. Following desorption of [32P]ATP from the charcoal using ethanolic ammonia, the incorporation of 32P into ATP was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In all experiments shown, reaction rates were shown to be linear with respect to protein concentration and time (<50% tRNA acylation). Reversal rate constants for inhibitor complexes were measured by pre-forming the inhibitor complex with the desired inhibitor, isolation by rapid gel filtration (Pharmacia Fast desalt column), followed by addition of a large excess of 3H-labeled PS-A (10 μm; 1.2 TBq/mmol). After predetermined incubation times at 22 °C, samples were removed and 3H-labeled enzyme isolated by gel filtration, followed by scintillation counting. A Model SX17MV stopped-flow spectrophotomer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) fitted with a 150 W Xe arc lamp was used for all stopped-flow experiments with excitation at 290–295 nm (2 mm excitation slits). Fluorescence emission from enzyme Trp residues was observed through a Corion 300-nm cut on filter. All reactions were performed at 22 °C in buffer A. The reported concentrations of reactants are those in the reaction chamber subsequent to mixing. Typically, each trace shown is the average of at least four individual experiments, and the observed rate constants reported represent the mean and standard deviation of that data set. Measurements of steady-state (or time course greater than 2 min) IleRS fluorescence were performed using an SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 Spectrometer using excitation wavelengths of 290 and emission at 350 nm (2–10 nm slit widths). Stopped-flow kinetic time courses were analyzed using the non-linear least-squares fitting routines supplied by Applied Photophysics. All other least squares fitting was performed using GRAFIT (23Leatherbarrow, R. (1992) Erithacus Software Ltd., LondonGoogle Scholar). Kinetic simulation was performed using the MS-DOS version of KINSIM (24Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Freiden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) or the Windows NT version of GESPASI (25Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar,26Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In this study, examples from two structural classes of potent IleRS inhibitor were characterized (Fig. 1). The properties of PS-A analogues were studied by comparing this compound to one natural (Et-A) and one semi-synthetic analogue (SB-205952). The latter compound was of particular interest as it has been shown to have an extended spectrum of antibacterial action (8Broom N.J.P. Cassels R. Cheng H.Y. Elder J.S. Hannan P.C.T. Masson N. O’Hanlon P.J. Pope A.J. Wilson J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3596-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Wilson J.M. Oliva B. Cassels R. O’Hanlon P.J. Chopra I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and possessed a nitrofuryl chromophore that had the potential to undergo energy transfer interactions with IleRS tryptophan residues upon binding. We compared these PS-A derivatives with two non-hydrolyzable analogues of Ile-AMP, Ile-ol-AMP and Ile-NHSO2-AMP (Fig. 1). A major difference between the inhibition of IleRS by the two classes of inhibitor studied here was that PS-A analogues showed slow-binding behavior. Inhibition of IleRS by Ile-ol-AMP or Ile-NHSO2-AMP was at steady-state within the sampling time of either tRNA aminoacylation of PPi/ATP exchange assays (data not shown; see also Ref. 12Pope A.J. Lapointe J. Mensah L. Benson N. Brown M.J.B. Moore K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31680-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, time course experiments with monic acid analogues showed that inhibition of IleRS activity was time-dependent, resulting in curvature of enzyme progress curves. An example of a typical such experiment, examining the effect of varying concentrations of the nitrofuryl oxazole monic acid analogue, SB-205952, on IleRS tRNA aminoacylation activity (initiated by adding enzyme) is shown in Fig. 2 A. This type of time-dependent inhibition may originate from a number of mechanisms, including enzyme modifying agents (e.g. Ref. 28Ratkitzis E.T. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), however, independent experiments confirmed that the inhibition by this class of compounds was reversible (see also below). It therefore seemed likely that PS-A analogues inhibit IleRS via a slow-binding competitive mechanism that is most commonly described by Scheme 1 (29Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sculley M.J. Morrison J.F. Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).E+J ⇌k−jk+j[J] E·J ⇌k−j*k+j* E*·J SCHEME 1 This model (Scheme 1) assumes that inhibition can be described by a discrete two-step process in which the initialE·J complex undergoes a relatively slow isomerization to form a tightenedE *·J complex (29Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). 3Simple competitive inhibitors are typically referred to in the text as I and time dependent/slow binding inhibitors as J. Kj * refers to the apparent overall equilibrium dissociation constant forJ, Kj the initial binding step, and K* the subsequent isomerization equilibrium constant for the tightening step (in the forward direction). Working on this assumption, we fitted individual tRNA aminoacylation progress curves obtained in the presence of inhibitor (e.g. Fig. 2 A) to Equation 1 (30Sculley M.J. Morrison J.F. Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), [Product]=vs·t+(vo−vs)·(1−e−kobst)kobs(Eq. 1) where vo and vs represent initial and steady-state velocities of IleRS aminoacylation and k obs is the apparent rate constant for the progression of E·J toE *·J at any particular inhibitor concentration. Methods to determine the relevant kinetic parameters for this type of mechanism directly from enzyme progress curves have been described (e.g. Ref. 30Sculley M.J. Morrison J.F. Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, such experiments have invariably been performed using continuous spectrophotometric assays which allow considerable precision in determining enzyme progress kinetics. In particular, these methods depend upon the accurate measurement of both k obs and the final steady-state inhibited rates (i.e. at overall equilibrium for formation of E *·J). Existing assays for both aminoacylation and the partial PPi/ATP exchange reaction routinely only allow single time point sampling which limits their utility in this type of approach. In addition, both assays have a rather limited dynamic range in relation to their inherent signal/noise (determined by the radiolabeled amino acid specific activity and tRNA concentration). We made considerable efforts to improve these assays (e.g. Refs. 31Chang C. Pan F. Yeh C. Huang T. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and 32Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), but the data shown in Fig. 2 A probably represents close to the maximum level of precision available. From Scheme 1 (assuming k−j ≫k +j *;i.e. equilibrium for formation of E·J is rapid compared with subsequent steps), the effect of increasing inhibitor concentrations onk obs should be described by Equation 2, kobs=k+j*·[J]Kj+[J]+k−j*(Eq. 2) and so would therefore be predicted to be hyperbolic, with intercept and asymptote values of k −j * and (k −j * +k +j *), respectively. However, the time and signal amplitude resolution of manual sampling assays for IleRS aminoacylation activity was such that the limiting value of k obs could not be approached (e.g. see Fig. 2 B). As a result, for all monic acid analogues that we have tested, plots of k obs versus [I] are linear within the operating limits of the assays and therefore yield only a very approximate estimate of k −j *(e.g. Fig. 2 B) and a pseudosecond-order rate constant (k on) for progression of E·J to E * J(when k obs ≪k +j *), described by Equation 3, kobs=kon·[J]+k−j*(Eq. 3) where kon=k+j*Kj(Eq. 4) The mean (± S.E.; n = 3) values fork on for SB 205952 and PS-A measured in time course experiments similar to that shown in Fig. 2 A were, SB 205952, k on = 6 ± 0.5 × 104 s−1 M−1;k −j * = 8 ± 3 × 10−4 s−1; PS-A,k on = 5 ± 0.6 × 105s−1 M−1;k −j * = <8 × 10−4 s−1. The value of k −j * (Scheme 1) dictates the kinetic stability of the tightenedE*·J complex but experiments such as those shown in Fig. 2 could only yield approximations to this parameter. In many cases (e.g. PS-A), the intercept in plots such as those shown in Fig. 2 B were not significantly different to zero. However, secondary plots for SB 205952 yielded an estimate for the intercept consistently greater than zero (8 ± 3 × 10−4 s−1; n = 3). These data therefore suggested that the E*·J complex was appreciably less kinetically stable with SB 205952 (t 1/2,off predicted to be around 15 min) than with PS-A (see below). The slope of k obs versus(J) secondary plots, k on, was used to predict reaction conditions in which there was <50% progression fromE·J to E*·J, thus making a negligible contribution to the analysis. The validity of the above assumptions is demonstrated by our ability to calculate reasonable estimate of kj * of 200 pm using the foregoing data (cf. 50 pm, Table I). Under these conditions, PS-A analogues behave as simple linear competitive inhibitors and could therefore be described by Equation 5, v=Vmax1+Km,Ile[Ile]1+[J]Kj,app(Eq. 5) Fig. 3 shows an example of such an analysis applied to the interaction between IleRS and SB 205952 measured in tRNA aminoacylation reactions that were started with enzyme and quenched after 20 s. The lines shown in Fig. 3 were obtained from global fits to Equation 5, yielding the following parameters; K j ,app = 130 ± 10 nm, K m ,Ile = 1.1 ± 0.06 μm. Fits to other models of inhibition (e.g. non-competitive, uncompetitive, mixed) either did not converge, or were statistically less valid.Table ISummary of equilibrium and kinetic parameters for inhibition of S. aureus IleRSInhibitor classIC50 ( a )Ki ,app ( b )Ki ( c )k+i ( d )k−i ( e )ΔF( f )K* j ( g )K*( h )k*−j ( i )nmnmnms−1· M−1(×10−6)s−1%pms−1× 104Adenylates Ile-ol-AMP780 ± 20274 ± 3090 (30)2.4 ± 0.30.0716.1 ± 0.5 Ile-NHSO2-AMP4.0 ± 110 ± 23 (0.4)9.0 ± 0.60.00416.0 ± 0.7Monates PS-A1.6 ± 0.360 ± 52010.2 ± 1.0<0.11.7 ± 0.323 ± 0.1.38700.9 (3.4)(9.6 ± 0.3) Et-A2.5 ± 0.2120 ± 6402.1 ± 0.2<0.12.3 ± 0.5178 ± 172256.8(1.9 ± 0.3) SB-2059524.0 ± 0.2135 ± 1451.7 ± 0.3<0.1−37 ± 1.5404 ± 3.11104.2 (8.8)For clarity, the relevant parameters describing inhibition by Ile-AMP analogues (adenylates, I) and PS-A analogues (monates, J) are shown in relation to the minimal kinetic scheme for IleRS constructed by Pope et al.

The data for these compounds are summarized in Table I.

The ribosomal region involved in the hydrolysis of the elongation factor-bound GTP molecule upon its interaction with the ribosome during translation is generally called the ribosomal GTPase domain. In bacteria, a number of elements, RNA and proteins, have been shown to participate in this process to a different extent (see Ref. 1Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar for a review). At least two RNA components have been identified, which include the α-sarcin loop in domain VI of the 23 S rRNA and a highly conserved double hairpin in domain II, frequently referred to as the RNA GTPase center (2Schmidt F.J. Thompson J. Lee K. Dijk J. Cundliffe E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12301-12305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Egebjerg J. Douthwaite S.D. Liljas A. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Two proteins, L10 and L11, which bind to partially overlapping sites in the conserved domain II region, are also structural components of this active domain. On the other hand, protein L10 forms a very stable association with two dimers of the acidic protein L7/L12, the 6 m urea-resistant pentameric complex L10-(L7/L12)4, which is the main component of a typical protuberance of the large ribosomal subunit called the ribosomal stalk. The stalk is directly involved in the interaction of the elongation factors, as has been clearly shown by electron microscopy (4Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Rinke A.J. Brimacombe R. Wintermeyer W. van Heel M. Nature. 1997; 389: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), participating in the translocation mechanism. Protein L11, which binds to the rRNA in a cooperative way with pentameric protein complex L10-(L7/L12)4 (5Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), is important for the GTPase activity, and in determining the right conformation of the GTPase center (6Xing Y. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This protein also has a key role in the mechanism by which thiostrepton and similar antibiotics block the elongation factor functions (7Cundliffe E. Dixon P. Stark M. Stöffler G. Ehrlich R. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Cannon M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Porse B.T. Leviev I. Mankin A.S. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Protein L11 is not essential for cell viability, and L11-defective bacterial strains have been obtained that are also resistant to thiostrepton (7Cundliffe E. Dixon P. Stark M. Stöffler G. Ehrlich R. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Cannon M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Despite the large amount of data accumulating on its structure and function, we are still far from understanding the molecular mechanism supporting the bacterial GTPase center function. Much less is obviously known in the case of the eukaryotic organisms. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes carry out the same basic functions, and, consequently, data obtained about the former have usually been extrapolated to the latter. Although the individual components show substantial differences (P0 is larger than L10, and L7/L12 has evolved to two families of closely related proteins, P1 and P2), they play similar roles. In fact, some of the data available on the structure of the eukaryotic GTPase domain fit nicely with those from bacterial ribosomes. Thus, there is a pentameric complex, P0-(P1)2-(P2)2 (9Uchiumi T. Wahba A.J. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5580-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a L11-like protein (10Juan-Vidales F. Sanchez-Madrid F. Saenz-Robles M. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), presently called L12 (11Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Ballesta J.G. Lee J.C. Mizuta K. Suzuki K. Warner J.R. Woolford J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4872-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), both binding to the 26 S/28 S GTPase RNA domain at sites that are equivalent to those found in bacteria (12El-Baradi T.T.A.L. de Regt V.C.H.F. Einerhand S.W.C. Teixido J. Planta R.J. Ballesta J.P.G. Raué H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, both components are required for the correct conformation of the rRNA as determined by in vitro binding studies (13Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, the eukaryotic organisms have developed new regulatory elements missing from less evolved systems. In this sense, the GTPase domain, and more specifically the ribosomal stalk, might be a paradigmatic example. In eukaryotes, the stalk also seems to be involved in the interaction and activity of the elongation factors, but, in addition, a number of interesting features not present in the bacterial ribosome strongly suggest its implication in a regulatory mechanism of the ribosomal activity (see Ref. 14Ballesta J.P.G. Remacha M. Progr. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 157-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a recent review).In general, the data underline the lower stability of the eukaryotic stalk as compared with the equivalent bacterial structure, and this feature is in the base of the mechanism that eukaryotes seem to have developed to regulate the ribosome translational activity in certain conditions (15Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Santos C. Zambrano R. Briones E. Rodriguez Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The structural differences existent between bacterial L10 and eukaryotic P0 must be to a great extent responsible for the dissimilar stability of their respective ribosomal stalks. In fact, it has been found that the eukaryotic specific C-terminal extension plays an important role in the formation of the pentameric complex (16Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, the evolution from a unique L7/L12 bacterial protein to a family of proteins, P1 and P2, apart from introducing potentially useful structural diversity into the system, seems to have affected the self-association properties of these eukaryotic proteins, which, in contrast to the bacterial equivalents, can be found as monomers in solution (17Zurdo J. Sanz J.M. Gonzalez C. Rico M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9625-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The two other components of the active domain, the rRNA and protein L12, although not directly forming part of the stalk, can obviously affect its stability. In the first case, however, the full in vivo functional interchangeability of the bacterial and yeast domain II GTPase RNA (18Musters W. Gonzalves P.M. Boon K. Raué H.A. van Heerikhuizen H. Planta R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1469-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Thompson J. Muster W. Cundliffe E. Dahlberg A.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) excludes this component as being important in order to explain their functional differences. The second component, protein L12, has an important role in determining thein vitro RNA GTPase center structure (13Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein L12, formerly called L15, is encoded by an intron-less duplicated gene (20Pucciarelli M.G. Remacha M. Vilella M.D. Ballesta J.P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other yeast GTPase domain components, protein L12 has been studied in less detail. As a way to carry out an in vivo analysis of its function, especially its role in the GTPase structure and function, the obtention of S. cerevisiae strains defective in protein L12 was undertaken. The results of this study are shown in this report.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsDimethyl sulfate (DMS)1was from Merck, kethoxal (2-keto-3-ethoxybutyraldehyde) was from U. S. Biochemical Corp., and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT) was from Sigma.Strains and Growth ConditionsEither S. cerevisiae W303 (a/α, leu2–3, 112/leu2–3, 112, trp1–1/trp1–1, ura3–1/ura3–1, his 3–11, 15/his 3–11, 15, ade2–1/ade2–1, can1–100/can1–100) or S. cerevisiae W303–1b (α, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, ura3–1, his 3–11, 15, ade2–1, can1–100) was used as a wild-type strain in the experiments performed in this report. Yeasts were grown in either YEP medium or minimal SD medium (21Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) supplemented with the appropriate nutritional requirements. The carbon source was either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. When required, 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) and G418 were present at 1 mg/ml and 200 μg/ml, respectively.Escherichia coli DH5α was used for handling cloning vectors and was grown in LB medium. Bacteria were transformed according to standard procedures (22Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 109-136Google Scholar).Genetic ManipulationsS. cerevisiae mating, sporulation, and tetrad analysis were performed following published methods (21Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar).Recombinant DNA TechniquesRestriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow DNA polymerase I fragment, and other enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestions, agarose gel electrophoresis, ligation of DNA fragments, Southern blots, etc., were carried out according to standard techniques (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using universal primers and complementary oligonucleotides. Probes were labeled by the random initiation method using Klenow DNA polymerase fragment and [α-32P]dCTP.PCR was performed in 100–50-μl reaction mixtures in the conditions optimal for the used polymerase. The PCR products were purified by electrophoresis in agarose gels.Gene Disruption StrategiesInactivation of the rpL12 genes was performed by transforming S. cerevisiae with appropriate disruption cassettes following the methods described by Philippsen and co-workers (24Wach A. Brachat A. Pölhmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 25Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Transformation was carried out by the lithium acetate method as described previously (26Gietz R. Woods R. Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 121-134Google Scholar).The disruption cassettes contained either the KanMX4 or theSchizosaccharomyces pombe HIS3 genes as selection markers, flanked by DNA fragments homologous to regions next to the fragment that has to be deleted. Cassettes with either 40–45-bp flanking fragments (SFH) or 400–560-bp flanking fragments (LFH) were obtained by PCR using chimeric oligonucleotides (24Wach A. Brachat A. Pölhmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 25Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar).PlasmidspUG7-L12AA 1.4-kilobase pair fragment, including the coding region, 528 bp from the 5′ flanking region and 367 bp from the 3′ flanking region of the rpL12A gene, was obtained from genomic S. cerevisiae W303 DNA by PCR using PfuDNA polymerase. The PCR fragment was subcloned by blunt end ligation into the EcoRV site of the pUG7 polylinker. The absence of PCR induced mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing.pFL36-L12A SacI-XhoI 1.4-kilobase pair insert containing the rpL12A gene was cut from pUG7-L12A and inserted in the corresponding sites of plasmid pFL36 (27Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).pYES2-L12A 498-bp XhoI-BamHI PCR fragment containing the rpL12A gene coding region was inserted in the corresponding sites of plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the GAL1 promoter.DNA Blots (Southern)Yeast DNA was prepared as described (21Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). DNA, after digestion with restriction enzymes, was resolved by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels, and blotted to nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed according to standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).RNA FootprintingRibosomes (20 μg) were preincubated at 30 °C for 20 min in 100 μl of 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 15 mmKCl, 15 mm NH4Cl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA (buffer 1). As a control, 12 μg of naked renatured RNA were preincubated in the same conditions in 70 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 270 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were treated as described previously (28Christiansen J. Egebjerg J. Larsen N. Garrett R.A. Speding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 229-252Google Scholar) with one of the following chemical probes: 1 μl of DMS (1:1 dilution in absolute ethanol), 5 μl of kethoxal (35 mg/ml in 20% ethanol), and 100 μl of CMCT (42 mg/ml in buffer 1), and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min (DMS and kethoxal) or 20 min (CMCT).Primer extension was performed according to Ref. 29Moazed D. Stern S. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar. The end-labeled oligonucleotide primer 5′-TGCCTACTCGTCAGGGC-3′, complementary to residues 1356–1372 of S. cerevisiae 26 S rRNA, was used as primer.Cell FractionationCells were broken with glass beads in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, including a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin). The extracts were centrifuged for 15 min. at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor, producing a S-30 fraction.The S-30 was centrifuged to obtain the ribosomes and supernatant fractions as described previously (30Sanchez-Madrid F. Reyes R. Conde P. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As a source of supernatant factors for in vitro protein synthesis, the fraction precipitated between 20% and 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate, and called S-100, was used. The acidic P proteins (SP fraction) were extracted from the ribosomes by ammonium-ethanol treatment (30Sanchez-Madrid F. Reyes R. Conde P. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); the extracted fraction was dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and concentrated by filtration through Centricon SR3 membranes (Amicon).Electrophoretic MethodsProteins were analyzed by either SDS-PAGE or by isoelectrofocusing. SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard procedures. Isoelectrofocusing was carried out on vertical 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea isoelectrofocusing gels in the 2.5–5.0 pH range as described previously (31Zambrano R. Briones E. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14439-14446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Proteins were either detected by silver staining or blotted to either PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes by electrophoresis in a semidry system using Novablot LKB buffer. Proteins in membranes were immunodetected following standard procedures (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar) and using specific antibodies. Antibodies to L11, L12, and P proteins have been previously described (10Juan-Vidales F. Sanchez-Madrid F. Saenz-Robles M. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Saenz-Robles M.T. Vilella M.D. Pucciarelli G. Polo F. Remacha M.

Biochem. 1991; 196: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Activity Tests: Polyphenylalanine SynthesisThe reaction was performed in 50-μl samples containing 10 pmol of 80 S ribosomes, 5 μl of S-100, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 0.3 mg/ml polyuridylic acid, 40 mm [3H]phenylalanine (120 cpm/pmol), 0.5 mm GTP, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm phosphocreatine, and 40 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 15 mmMgCl2, 90 mm KCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, boiled for 10 min, and filtered through glass fiber filters.DISCUSSIONProtein L12 is encoded in S. cerevisiae by a duplicated gene, rpL12A and rpL12B, which express identical polypeptides (20Pucciarelli M.G. Remacha M. Vilella M.D. Ballesta J.P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Sporulation and tetrad analysis of a heterozygous diploid strain carrying a plasmidic L12 gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter yielded haploid strains carrying either one or both L12 gene copies simultaneously inactivated and a galactose-inducible copy.Expression of both L12 gene copies is required for optimal growth indicating that none of them provides enough ribosomal protein and suggesting the absence of a compensatory regulatory mechanism reported in other instances (37Woolford J.J. Adv. Genet. 1991; 29: 63-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is interesting, however, that the absence of rpL12A can be almost completely compensated by increasing the growth temperature of the corresponding disrupted strain. This might indicate that either a real temperature-dependent regulatory process takes place or, simply, that the expression of rpL12B copy is temperature-sensitive. Further experimental work, now in progress, is required to clear up different pending questions related to the expression of the two yeast protein L12 genes.Transfer of the cells to a glucose medium to repress the plasmidic L12 gene expression drastically reduced but did not abolish the growth of the double L12 disruptant. In fact, it was possible to obtain viable double disrupted strains in which the L12 carrying plasmid had been cured by growing in 5′-FOA. It seems, therefore, clear that protein L12 is not an absolute requirement for ribosome activity and cell viability. However, the protein must have an important role in ribosome function as cells lacking L12 have a doubling time close to 6 h.In contrast to E. coli, in which a significant number of ribosomal proteins are dispensable for cell viability (38Dabbs E.R. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function, and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 733-748Google Scholar), most proteins seem to be essential in the yeast ribosome. Excluding the exchangeable acidic proteins P1/P2, out of 32 proteins so far studied, only three, S31 (UBI3) (39Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), L24 (formerly L30) (40Baronas-Lowell D.M. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5235-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and L39 (UBI1/UBI2) (41Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Science. 1990; 247: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), are shown to be dispensable for cell viability. These results indicate that eukaryotic ribosomes have tighter structural requirements than the bacterial one, and the changes resulting from the protein absence are lethal for the ribosome activity.Protein L11 is also dispensable for viability in bacteria (7Cundliffe E. Dixon P. Stark M. Stöffler G. Ehrlich R. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Cannon M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are, however, significant differences in the role played by bacterial L11 and eukaryotic L12, the most important being the different involvement in the stability of the stalk. Thus, although the bacterial mutants lacking protein L11 contain standard amounts of L7/12 (42Stöffler G. Cundliffe E. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Dabbs E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10517-10522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the L12-defective yeast strains two of the four acidic proteins, P1α and P2β, are missing from the ribosomes. These results indicate that protein L12 is either directly or indirectly involved in the interaction of the 12-kDa acidic proteins with the eukaryotic ribosome. Physical proximity of the C-terminal domain of bacterial L7/12 to protein L11 has been reported, confirming the high flexibility of the acidic proteins (43Traut R.R. Dey D. Bochkarlov D.E. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Hamman B. Jameson D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, these interactions are probably irrelevant to the binding of the acidic proteins to the ribosome, which takes place only through the N-terminal domain of the proteins in bacteria (44Marquis D.M. Fahnestock S.R. Henderson E. Woo D. Schwinge D. Clark M. Lake J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as well as in yeast (45Payo J.M. Santana-Roman H. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Zinker S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7941-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In any case, although the acidic proteins have been cross-linked to protein P0 (46Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Terao K. Ogata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5675-5682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a direct interaction between L12 and proteins P1/P2 has not been so far reported in the ribosome, although they have been shown to be able to associate in solution (33Saenz-Robles M.T. Vilella M.D. Pucciarelli G. Polo F. Remacha M. Ortiz B.L. Vidales F. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The preferential release of P1α and P2β from L12-defective ribosomes indicates the asymmetrical structure of the yeast stalks as compared with the bacterial one, and stresses the different structural role of each protein of the same type, P1α/P1β and P2α/P2β. Previously, the analysis of different disrupted mutants had shown that the effects caused by the absence of one of the proteins cannot be suppressed by an excess of the other one (47Remacha M. Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2182-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 48Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4754-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the functional and structural data confirm, therefore, that the two members of the same protein family are performing specific functions.Independent of its physiological meaning, which is not obvious, the existence of four acidic proteins in yeast ribosomes together with the assumed dimeric character of these proteins raises some interesting structural questions. Thus, as only four copies of acidic proteins have been detected per eukaryotic ribosome (9Uchiumi T. Wahba A.J. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5580-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 50Saenz-Robles M.T. Remacha M. Vilella M.D. Zinker S. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in the cell there must be either a homogeneous population of ribosomes carrying one monomer of each protein type or a heterogeneous population of particles carrying two dimers in different combinations, (P1α)2/(P2α)2, (P1α)2/(P2β)2, (P1β)2/(P2α)2,(P1β)2/(P2β)2. The specific release of P1α and P2β by the absence of L12 fits in better with an asymmetrical ribosomal stalk made by one protein of each type, P0, P1α, P2β, P1β, P2α, in which the four 12-kDa proteins do not have the same role.Contrary to what could be expected, there seems to be a closer relationship between two proteins of a different type, P1α/P2β and P1β/P2α, the binding of the first pair being more directly affected by the presence of protein L12. These two pairs might play the same function than the standard P1 and P2 dimers in mammals. The P1α/P2β and P1β/P2α associations are, however, not an absolute requirement for the formation of the stalk, as it is possible to obtain, by gene disruption, yeast mutant strains with ribosomes exclusively containing the P1α/P2α and P1β/P2β pairs (48Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Bermejo B. Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E. Ballesta J.P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4754-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In any case, the P1α/P2β pair seem to be especially relevant for ribosome activity as its absence is more harmful for cell growth than the absence of P1β/P2α (49Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Bermejo B. Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E. Ballesta J.P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4754-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Protein L12 also affects the interaction of protein P0, although not so obviously as in the case of the acidic proteins. P0 is present in similar amounts in disruptant and in wild-type ribosomes, but the protein can be released from the particles more easily in the first case. Thus, although P0, unlike bacterial L10, is hardly washed off the eukaryotic ribosomes by ammonium/ethanol buffers (30Sanchez-Madrid F. Reyes R. Conde P. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Towbin G. Ramjoue H.P. Kaster H. Liverani D. Gordon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12709-12715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the protein can be detected in the mutant ribosome washes at relatively low ammonium chloride concentrations.The effect of protein L12 in the protein P0 interaction is in agreement with the binding of both proteins to partially overlapping sites in the mammalian rRNA (51Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our footprinting results with ribosomes, in addition to confirm the absence of L12 from the double disrupted strain ribosome, clearly show that this"
https://openalex.org/W2095492608,"We report evidence for catalysis-dependent rotation of the single ε subunit relative to the three catalytic β subunits of functionally coupled, membrane-bound FOF1-ATP synthase. Cysteines substituted at β380 and ε108 allowed rapid formation of a specific β-ε disulfide cross-link upon oxidation. Consistent with a need for ε to rotate during catalysis, tethering ε to one of the β subunits resulted in the inhibition of both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. These activities were fully restored upon reduction of the β-ε cross-link. As a more critical test for rotation, a subunit dissociation/reassociation procedure was used to prepare a β-ε cross-linked hybrid F1 having epitope-tagged βD380C subunits (βflag) exclusively in the two noncross-linked positions. This allowed the β subunit originally aligned with ε to form the cross-link to be distinguished from the other two βs. The cross-linked hybrid was reconstituted with FO in F1-depleted membranes. After reduction of the β-ε cross-link and a brief period of catalytic turnover, reoxidation resulted in a significant amount of βflag in the β-ε cross-linked product. In contrast, exposure to ligands that bind to the catalytic site but do not allow catalysis resulted in the subsequent cross-linking of ε to the original untagged β. Furthermore, catalysis-dependent rotation of ε was prevented by prior treatment of membranes with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to block proton translocation through FO. From these results, we conclude that ε is part of the rotor that couples proton transport to ATP synthesis.

FOF1-ATP synthases are found embedded in the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 2Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation, synthases couple the movement of protons down an electrochemical gradient to the synthesis of ATP. The FO sector is composed of membrane-spanning subunits (ab2c12 in Escherichia coli) (3Fillingame R.H. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Valiyaveetil F.I. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that conduct protons across the membrane, whereas the F1 sector (α3β3γδε) is an extrinsic complex that contains catalytic sites for ATP synthesis. F1 can be removed from the membrane in a soluble form that functions as an ATPase, and rebinding F1 to FO in membranes restores the capacity to catalyze net ATP synthesis. A high-resolution structure for bovine F1 shows a hexamer of alternating α and β subunits surrounding a single γ subunit. The three catalytic sites of F1 are located on the three β subunits at α/β subunit interfaces (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). A model for energy coupling by FOF1-ATP synthases that has gained widespread support is called the binding change mechanism (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). According to this proposal, the major energy-requiring step is not the synthesis of ATP at catalytic sites but rather the simultaneous and highly cooperative binding of substrates to and release of products from these sites (5Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 6Kayalar C. Rosing J. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2486-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was proposed that these affinity changes are coupled to proton transport by the rotation of a complex of subunits that extends through FOF1. Rotation of the γ subunit in the center of F1 is thought to deform the surrounding catalytic subunits to give the required binding changes (7Boyer P.D. Kohlbrenner W.E. Selman B. Selman-Reiner S. Energy Coupling in Photosynthesis. Elsevier/North-Holland, New York1981: 231-240Google Scholar), whereas rotation of the c subunits relative to the single a subunit in FO is believed to be required for completion of the proton pathway (8Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29407-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The rotary aspect of the binding change mechanism remained a popular but speculative idea for a number of years until a critical test became possible following the publication of a high resolution structure for F1 (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Focusing on a β/γ intersubunit point of contact identified in the structure, we introduced a Cys into the β subunit at a position (β380) that would place it in close proximity to a naturally occurring Cys on the γ subunit (γC87). When the resultant βD380C-F1 was exposed to an oxidant, a rapid and specific βD380C-γC87 disulfide cross-link was formed (9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 11Duncan T.M. Zhou Y. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using a subunit dissociation/reassociation approach with the β-γ cross-linked enzyme, we incorporated radioisotope- or epitope-labeled β subunits into the two noncross-linked β subunit positions. Following reduction of the cross-link and a short burst of ATP hydrolysis (9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 12Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), labeled and unlabeled β subunits in the hybrid F1 showed a similar capacity to form a disulfide bond with the γ subunit indicating that γ had rotated relative to the three β subunits during catalysis. Subsequently, additional evidence for subunit rotation during ATP hydrolysis was obtained using immobilized chloroplast F1 with a spectroscopic probe attached near the C terminus of the γ subunit. Recovery of polarized absorption after photobleaching was used to monitor the rotational motion of γ during ATP hydrolysis by the tethered F1 on a time-resolved basis (14Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Finally, in a dramatic visual demonstration, a fluorescent actin filament attached to one end of the γ subunit of immobilized bacterial F1 was seen by fluorescence microscopy to undergo multiple unidirectional rotations during ATP hydrolysis (15Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). Now that catalysis-dependent rotation of γ relative to the catalytic β subunits is well established (16Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 17Dimroth P. Kaim G. Matthey U. Biochim. Biophys.

Noji H. Ishiwata S. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it is important to identify other components of the rotor. A likely candidate is the ε subunit. It forms a tight 1:1 complex with purified γ (20Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cross-linking ε to γ causes less than a proportional amount of inhibition (21Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, cross-linking ε to either β (24Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or α (25Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in soluble F1 strongly inhibits ATPase activity. The fact that ε is randomly oriented in FOF1 relative to the α subunit that interacts with the single δ subunit is also consistent with ε being part of the rotor (26Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Finally, it was recently reported that ATP hydrolysis promotes the rotation of ε in immobilized F1 from chloroplasts (27Häsler K. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and thermophilic bacteria (28Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19375-19377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In work presented here, we have extended our cross-linked hybrid approach to demonstrate rotation of ε relative to the three β subunits during catalysis by functionally coupled membrane-bound FOF1. NADH, ATP, ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP),1 N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD),N-ethylmaleimide, and hexokinase were supplied by Sigma; pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were supplied by Boehringer Mannheim; 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) was supplied by Aldrich; and dithiothreitol (DTT) was supplied by American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. PfuDNA polymerase I was from Stratagene, and all restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. Anti-Flag M2 antibody was obtained from Eastman Kodak, 125I-labeled anti-mouse antibody was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [32P]Pi was from ICN. Other reagents and chemicals were the highest grade available. Mutant constructs p3UβD380C/γC87S and p3UβflagD380C/γC87S were described previously, and these combined mutations have minimal effects on the FOF1 function in vivo (normal phenotypic growth on succinate) or on ATPase activity of purified F1 (11Duncan T.M. Zhou Y. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The εS108C mutation, originally created by Aggeler et al. (21Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), also has only minimal effects on the function of FOF1 in vivo or of purified F1. Here a polymerase chain reaction-based, site-directed method (29Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) (Pfu DNA polymerase I) was used to introduce εS108C into p3U, which expresses all 8 FOF1 subunits. The antisense mutagenic primer, 5′-ATTAGCAGCTGTCACGGCGAC-3′, has a single base change that generates the εS108C mutation and creates a PvuII restriction site. The product was digested with KpnI and NdeI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the p3UβD380C/γC87S vector to produce p3UβD380C/γC87S/εS108C. The mutated region of uncC was sequenced to confirm the presence of εS108C and absence of any additional mutations. To express mutant FOF1, each construct was transformed into strain AN887, which has a Mu insertion that blocks expression of the chromosomal unc operon (30Gibson F. Downie J.A. Cox G.B. Radik J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 728-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of p3UβD380C/γC87S/εS108C yields membranes with normal levels of DCCD-sensitive ATPase and purified F1 with ATPase activity (35 μmol·min−1·mg−1) comparable with that of wild-type F1. Membranes were isolated and washed (31Senior A.E. Fayle D.R.H. Downie J.A. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Wise J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10403-10409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and soluble F1 was purified as described (9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Membranes prepared from strain AN1460 (33Downie J.A. Langman L. Cox G.B. Yanofsky C. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 8-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were depleted of F1 with two additional washes with 10 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Washed membranes were resuspended in TM buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mmMgSO4, pH 7.5), quickly frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Aliquots of F1stock solutions were passed through centrifuge columns containing Sephadex G-50–80 (34Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated with MTKE buffer (20 mmMops-Tris, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The enzymes were diluted to 1 mg/ml with the same buffer and treated with 50 μm DTNB for 40 min at 22 °C. Excess DTNB was removed by column centrifugation. β-ε cross-linked βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1 and epitope-labeled βflagD380C/γC87S-F1 were dissociated into subunits by repeated freezing and thawing in 50 mm MES, 1m LiCl, 5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 6.1. The dissociated enzymes were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and allowed to reassemble as hybrid complexes as described previously (9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 35Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). F1 hybrid containing the βD380C-εS108C disulfide cross-link can contain βflagD380C only in the two noncross-linked β positions. F1 containing the wild-type ε subunit is incapable of forming a β-ε cross-link and is therefore silent in subsequent experiments. Hybrid F1 (0.5 mg/ml) was rebound to FO in F1-depleted membranes (2 mg of protein/ml) by incubation in TM buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Excess F1 was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Airfuge for 1 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended and washed twice with TMG buffer (TM buffer containing 50 mm glucose) and finally resuspended in TMG buffer at about 4 mg of protein/ml. For the DCCD-inhibited control, membranes were incubated with 0.5 mm DCCD and 5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 22 °C, conditions that give specific modification of c subunits in FO (36Tommasino M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3972-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3896-3903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme for the “noncross-linked” control was prepared as described for hybrid F1 except that a β-ε cross-link was not formed prior to subunit dissociation by omitting DTNB treatment. Hence this form of F1 can have βflag at all three β subunit positions. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on 4–15% gradient gels (Ready Gels, Bio-Rad). For nonreducing conditions, samples were denatured in the presence of 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide instead of 2-mercaptoethanol to block sulfhydryls without cleaving disulfides. Proteins were transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex) in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot cell for 1 h at 250 mA using a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 10% methanol, and 0.005% SDS (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). The blotted membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat, dried milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), incubated for 2 h with anti-Flag M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak) at 0.4 mg/ml in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin, and rinsed three times with TBST containing an additional 0.1 m NaCl. The immunoblot was then incubated for 1.5 h with 2 μCi of125I-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (19 μCi/μg, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 ml of TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin, rinsed five times with TBST containing an additional 0.1m NaCl, air dried, and exposed to a Phosphor Screen for 12 h. 125I-Labeled bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (model 425E, Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software. The ATPase activity of soluble F1was measured at 30 °C by a coupled enzyme assay (40Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Datta A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 5 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg of F1/ml in MTK buffer (20 mm Mops-Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 8.0). For measurement of ATP hydrolysis by membrane vesicles at 2–3 μg of protein/ml, 5 μm FCCP and 5 mm KCN were also added to prevent formation of a transmembrane proton gradient and to block NADH oxidation by the respiratory chain. The synthesis of ATP by E. coli membranes was determined by a coupled enzyme assay as described (13Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry assay (41Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Our approach in testing for rotation of the ε subunit requires the reversible formation of a specific covalent linkage between a β subunit and the single copy of ε. Guided by previous cross-linking studies (24Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 42Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we combined the εS108C and βD380C mutations in a single construct. To prevent cross-linking between β and γ subunits, the γC87S mutation was also included (11Duncan T.M. Zhou Y. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochem. Soc.

As shown by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), a rapid and near complete disappearance of ε is accompanied by the appearance of a new band at 67 kDa when F1 (lane 2 versus lane 1) or membrane-bound FOF1 (lane 7 versus lane 6) containing these mutations is oxidized by DTNB. The high yield of cross-linked product correlates to a 90–95% loss of ATPase activity, and the same results were obtained when samples were oxidized in the presence of Mg2+, MgATP, or MgADP/azide (data not shown). The apparent size of the cross-linked product (67 kDa) is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 65 kDa for a 1:1 complex between β and ε. Furthermore, immunoblotting confirmed the presence of both ε and β in the 67-kDa band (data not shown). As expected for a disulfide linkage, cross-linking and inactivation are fully reversed by brief exposure to dithiothreitol (lane 3). Finally, oxidation of F1 lacking the εS108C mutation shows no 67-kDa band nor does the ε band disappear (lane 4). We conclude that the 67-kDa product results from formation of a specific disulfide cross-link between βD380C and εS108C. A second requirement for our F1-hybrid approach in testing for rotation of ε is that ε must not dissociate from F1 during the course of the experiment. If this occurred, ε could rebind in a manner that would allow it to cross-link to a different β than the one with which it was originally aligned, thus giving a false indication of subunit rotation. This requirement presented a potential problem in using soluble F1 because ε is known to undergo reversible dissociation from the E. coli enzyme (43Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hence, the experiment presented in Fig. 2 was conducted to determine the rate of ε subunit exchange between members of an F1 population. The strategy behind this assay was to mix two different forms of the enzyme: one containing εS108C and β lacking the Flag epitope (βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1), and the other containing epitope-tagged β and wild-type ε (βflagD380C/γC87S-F1). Because wild-type ε cannot cross-link to βflag, the only way that a βflag-ε cross-link can form is if an εS108C subunit dissociates from the triple mutant enzyme and rebinds to a Flag-tagged double mutant F1 that has released its own wild-type ε. DTNB was added at the times indicated, and the Flag epitope in the cross-linked product was measured in the immunoblot shown in Fig. 2 A. As expected, the amount of Flag in the β-ε band increased with time. The t½ for the exchange of ε was found to be about 1 min (Fig. 2 B). Because this is on the same time scale as our assay for subunit rotation, we conclude that the soluble E. coli enzyme is unsuitable for this test. In contrast, ε does not dissociate from FOF1(as confirmed below in Fig. 3, lane 8) and in fact is required for binding F1 to FO (44Dunn S.D. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, tests for ε subunit rotation were conducted with reconstituted hybrid FOF1.Figure 3Reorientation of ε relative to the β subunits in FOF1 during catalytic turnover. The presence of Flag epitope in the β-ε band following various treatments was detected by immunoblotting. Forlanes 1, 2, and 4–7, β-ε cross-linked hybrid F1 having Flag-tagged β exclusively in the two noncross-linked β positions was prepared and reconstituted with F1-depleted membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Membranes were suspended at 4 mg of protein/ml in buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate, 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm glucose, 5 μm FCCP, pH 7.5 (TMGF buffer) and subjected to the following treatments. Lane 5, membranes were incubated with 10 mm DTT for 30 s, passed through a centrifuge column equilibrated with TMGF buffer, and collected in a tube containing DTNB (50 μm final), and incubated for 10 min at 22 °C.Lanes 4 and 7, same as for lane 5except that the incubation mixture and centrifuge column buffer also contained 1 mm ATP (lane 4) or 0.5 mm ADP and 0.5 mm NaN3 (lane 7). Lane 1, same as for lane 5 except that DTT was omitted. Lane 2, same as for lane 5except that the column effluent was collected in the absence of DTNB.Lane 6, same as for lane 4 except that membranes were pretreated with DCCD to modify FO as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 3, same as forlane 4 except that FOF1 was reconstituted using F1 that could have βflagat all three β positions (see “Experimental Procedures”).Lane 8, as for lane 4 except that F1-depleted membranes were reconstituted separately with βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1 or βflagD380C/γC87S-F1 and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Hexokinase was included at 3 units/ml in samples 1, 2, 5, and 7 to prevent any potential ATP hydrolysis. The uncoupler FCCP was present in all samples to prevent formation of a transmembrane proton gradient. An aliquot of each sample containing 6 μg of membrane protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and immunoblotting was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are typical of three replicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preliminary studies (not shown) confirmed that DTNB-treated βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1can be dissociated into subunits, reassembled, and reconstituted with FO in F1-depleted membranes without breaking the βD380C-εS108C disulfide bond. Membrane-bound, β-ε cross-linked F1 is catalytically inactive. However, treatment with DTT to reduce the disulfide cross-link restores ATP hydrolysis (9.5 μmol·min−1·mg−1) and synthesis (30 nmol·min−1·mg−1) activities. Furthermore, when reconstituted membranes were preincubated with DCCD, the hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP were inhibited by 80 and >98%, respectively. These results demonstrate that cross-linked βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1 can rebind to FOto form an FOF1 complex that is functionally coupled following reduction of the disulfide. Using a subunit dissociation/reassociation procedure developed previously (9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), we formed a β-ε cross-linked hybrid F1containing βflagD380C subunits exclusively in the two noncross-linked β positions. The resulting hybrid provides a means of distinguishing the β subunit that is initially oriented to allow cross-linking to ε from the other two β subunits. Hybrid F1 was rebound to F1-depleted membranes, and excess soluble F1 was removed. To test for possible rotary movement of ε, the reconstituted membranes were briefly reduced with DTT, exposed to various ligands, and reoxidized with DTNB. In the absence of rotation, εS108C would be expected to cross-link to the original unlabeled β subunit. However, if ε has rotated, εS108C would be positioned to cross-link to Flag epitope-labeled β in a significant fraction of the FOF1 complexes resulting in the appearance of epitope in the β-ε band. The results are shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 3. When reconstituted membranes were reduced and exposed to conditions for ATP hydrolysis, a significant amount of Flag epitope was detected in the β-ε cross-linked band following reoxidation (Fig. 3, lane 4). In contrast, when reconstituted membranes were reduced and exposed to ligands that bind to catalytic sites but do not allow catalytic turnover, little Flag epitope was found in the β-ε bands (Fig. 3,lanes 5 and 7). The amount of epitope in the β-ε band was also low when membranes were reduced and reoxidized in the presence of MgADP but absence of azide (not shown). An important control (the “nonhybrid” control) is shown in Fig. 3,lane 8. For this experiment, cross-linked βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1 and βflagD380C/γC87S-F1 remained separated during subunit dissociation/reassociation and were mixed in a 1:1 ratio only after reconstituting FOF1. The resulting sample was then reduced, exposed to MgATP, and reoxidized. The absence of βflag in the β-ε band (lane 8) excludes the possibility that the ε subunit can exchange between FOF1 complexes. An additional control of this type showed that even when the initial β-ε disulfide was reduced for 5 min prior to the addition of ATP, the exchange of ε between FOF1 complexes was not detectable (data not shown). Taken together, the results provide compelling evidence for rotation of ε relative to the β subunits during catalytic turnover. To determine the maximal level of Flag epitope expected in the β-ε band if εS108C has an equal chance of reacting with any of the three β subunits after catalytic turnover, a noncross-linked control was run (Fig. 3, lane 3). In this case, βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1 was dissociated in the presence of a source of βflag without forming an initial cross-link between ε and one of the β subunits. Consequently, during reassociation βflag could assemble in each of the three β subunit positions. When this enzyme was used to reconstitute FOF1, DTNB oxidation resulted in the highest level of βflag observed in the β-ε band (Fig. 3,lane 3). This value was used to calculate the maximal expected βflag in the β-ε band of hybrid F1 if the orientation of ε relative to the β subunits is randomized by catalysis-driven subunit rotation (Fig. 4, 100%). Conditions for ATP hydrolysis yielded 65% of this maximal value (Fig. 4, MgATP). A value less than the calculated maximum is not surprising in view of the expectation that not all FOF1 complexes in reconstituted membranes will be catalytically active during a brief exposure to MgATP. Of notable significance is the fact that very little βflag appeared in the β-ε band in the absence of catalytic turnover (Fig. 4, 5–7%). It is well known that covalent modification of one or more c subunits by DCCD blocks proton translocation through FO and inhibits both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis by FOF1 (37Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3896-3903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we recently reported that DCCD modification of FO prevents the catalysis-dependent rotation of the γ subunit in membrane-bound FOF1 (12Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,13Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A similar experiment was carried out here to test for functional coupling between ε rotation in F1 and proton conduction through FO. For this purpose, membranes were treated with DCCD under conditions that selectively modify the c subunits of FO. As shown in Fig. 3 (lane 6) and Fig. 4(+DCCD), exposure of DCCD-inhibited membranes to MgATP yielded only 3% of the calculated maximal amount of Flag epitope in the β-ε band. This emphasizes the tight functional coupling of subunit rotation in F1 to proton translocation through FO. The results presented demonstrate catalysis-dependent rotation of the ε subunit in functionally coupled membrane-bound FOF1. In view of earlier evidence for the rotation of γ in F1 (9Duncan T.M.

Acta. 1996; 1275: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we conclude that γ and ε constitute part of the rotor that couples proton transport through FO to the required binding changes in F1. The fact that DCCD modification of subunit c in FO prevents catalysis-dependent rotation of γ (12Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and ε (Fig. 3, lane 6) supports the possibility that subunit rotation in F1 is coupled to subunit rotation in FO. However, it remains to be determined whether the c subunit complex of FO constitutes the remaining portion of the rotor (8Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The intact E. coli FOF1 complex was used in these studies to avoid two potential problems that might have been encountered with soluble F1. The first relates to the well established ability of ε to inhibit catalysis when F1 is separated from FO (43Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This could hinder attempts to detect catalysis-dependent subunit rotation, particularly if ε inhibits by preventing the rotation of γ. A second difficulty could arise from the fact that ε readily dissociates from F1. As noted earlier, when monitoring the orientation of ε relative to the three β subunits as a means of detecting subunit rotation, it is essential to rule out dissociation and rebinding of ε as an alternative cause for its reorientation. The use of FOF1 avoided both of these problems because in the native complex, ε does not inhibit activity (45Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) nor does it dissociate from the complex (Fig. 3, lane 8). The t½ for exchange of ε between βD380C/γC87S/εS108C-F1 and βflagD380C/γC87S-F1 molecules was found to be about 1 min (Fig. 2), whereas at the same temperature, thet½ for dissociation of ε from our wild-type F1 is about 5 min. 2Y. M. Milgrom and R. L. Cross, unpublished data. This suggests that these mutations weaken the interaction of ε with F1resulting in an increased dissociation rate. This is not surprising in view of the fact that βD380 is in close contact with γC87 and εS108 as evidenced by the facility with which substituted cysteines can cross-link. The results imply that one or more of the native residues contributes to the stability of the interaction of ε with the rest of F1.

https://openalex.org/W2000388365,"Overlapping tRNA genes in mitochondria of many metazoans introduce a problem for the processing of such polycistronic primary transcripts. Using runoff transcripts and an S100 extract from HeLa cell mitochondria, the processing of the human mitochondrial tRNATyr/tRNACys precursor (carrying an overlap of one base) was investigated: tRNACys is released in its complete form carrying the overlapping residue at the first position, whereas tRNATyr lacks that nucleotide at the discriminator position. Partial deletion of tRNACys or complete replacement by a non-tRNA-like sequence does not alter the processing reaction and indicates that the upstream tRNATyr alone is recognized by a 3′-endonuclease activity. The truncated 3′-end of this tRNATyr is then completed in an editing reaction that incorporates the missing residue. The processing of this tRNA overlap seems to be species-specific, because an overlapping tRNA precursor (tRNASer(AGY)/tRNALeu(CUN)) from opossum mitochondria is not recognized by the human extract. Because processing activities for overlapping and nonoverlapping tRNA precursors could not be separated, it seems that one general activity is responsible for the 3′-end processing of mitochondrial tRNAs and that this activity coevolved with the particular overlap between tRNATyr and tRNACys in human mitochondria, being unable to recognize overlaps between other tRNAs."

Escherichia coli succinate-ubiquinone (Q)1 reductase, which catalyzes electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone during aerobic respiration, has been purified and characterized (1Spencer M.E.

The purified complex contains four protein subunits with apparent molecular masses of 64,000, 28,000, 19,500, and 17,500 Da (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol.

The two larger subunits (SdhA and SdhB) are succinate dehydrogenase. The 64-kDa subunit (Fp) houses FAD, and the 28-kDa subunit (Ip) houses the three iron-sulfur clusters. The two smaller subunits (SdhC and SdhD) are membrane-anchoring proteins that house cytochrome b 556. The ligands for cytochrome b 556 are bis-histidines (3Peterson J. Vibat C. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gene deletion studies have shown that both SdhC and SdhD are involved in heme ligation (4Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M.

J. 1984; 223: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of Fp and Ip are highly conserved among species (8Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For example, the Ip subunits from E. coli and from bovine heart mitochondria are approximately 50% identical, and the amino acid sequences of Fp and Ip from E. coli show 50% similarity to their counterparts in human liver succinate-Q reductase. The Fp and Ip subunits of E. colisuccinate-Q reductase are also closely related to those of bacterial and mitochondrial fumarate reductases that catalyze the reverse reaction of succinate-Q reductase. On the other hand, the amino acid sequences of the membrane-anchoring subunits of succinate-Q reductase differ significantly among species (9Hägerhäll C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, the E. coli succinate-Q reductase has been resolved into two reconstitutively active fractions: succinate dehydrogenase and the membrane-anchoring fraction (SdhC-SdhD) (10Yang X., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Isolated succinate dehydrogenase is soluble and can catalyze electron transfer from succinate to artificial acceptors, such as phenazinemethosulfate, but not to its physiological acceptor, Q. The addition of the membrane-anchoring fraction to isolated succinate dehydrogenase forms membrane-bound succinate-Q reductase, which catalyzes electron transfer from succinate to Q (10Yang X., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), indicating that SdhC-SdhD provides membrane docking for succinate dehydrogenase and Q binding in succinate-Q reductase. In fact, the membrane-anchoring protein fraction is named QPs (Q-bindingprotein in succinate-ubiquinone reductase) in the mitochondrial system (11Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The involvement of the membrane-anchoring fraction in the Q binding of E. colisuccinate-Q reductase is shown by detection of ubisemiquinone radicals in intact and reconstituted succinate-Q reductases in the presence of exogenous Q. No ubisemiquinone radical is detected with succinate dehydrogenase in the presence of Q. 2D. He, personal communication. To understand the protein-Q interaction and the mechanism of Q reduction in succinate-Q reductase requires knowledge of the Q-binding site. Photoaffinity labeling of beef heart mitochondrial succinate-Q reductase with [3H]azido-Q derivative identified all three QPs subunits as putative Q-binding proteins in this reductase. The Q-binding domain in QPs1 is located at the loop connecting transmembrane helices II and III, which extrudes from the surface of the M-side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (12Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Q-binding domain in QPs3 is located at the end of transmembrane helix I toward the C-side of the membrane (13Shenoy S.K., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The finding that the Q-binding domains in QPs3 and QPs1 are on opposite sides of the membrane is in line with a two-Q-binding site hypothesis formulated from the inhibitor studies of this enzyme complex (14Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Q-binding domain(s) in other succinate-Q reductases has not been identified. The amino acid residues in the putative Q-binding domain of QPs1 and QPs3, responsible for Q binding, have not been identified. The photoaffinity labeling technique does not permit us to identify specifically the amino acid residue(s) directly involved in Q binding because of the rather long life and somewhat nonspecific nature of the activated nitrene radical. The molecular genetic approach to identify amino acid residues involved in Q binding of bovine heart mitochondrial succinate-Q reductase requires site-directed mutagenesis of the QPs1 or QPs3 gene, expression and isolation of recombinant mutant protein, and reconstitution of recombinant mutant QPs1 or QPs3 with a QPs1- or QPs3-deficient succinate-Q reductase. Although bovine heart mitochondrial QPs1 and QPs3 have been cloned and overexpressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (15Lee G.Y. Zhu J., Yu, L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 2837Google Scholar), the functional activity of the recombinant protein cannot be assessed because of the unavailability of reconstitutively active, QPs1- or QPs3-depleted succinate-Q reductase. Since E. coli succinate-Q reductase is structurally and functionally similar to the mitochondrial enzyme and is readily manipulated genetically, it provides an ideal system for the study of Q-binding site using photoaffinity labeling techniques in concert with site-directed mutagenesis. Herein, we report the identification of the Q-binding domain in E. coli succinate-Q reductase by photoaffinity labeling, the deletion of most of the sdhoperon from the E. coli chromosome by site-specific recombination, and the identification of amino acid residues involved in Q binding by site-directed mutagenesis. Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (E9C12), and FMN were obtained from Sigma. DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. pRKD418, which was used for the expression of wild type and mutatedsdh genes, and pSL1180KnERV, which was used to provide the kanamycin-resistant (KnR) gene, were constructed in our laboratory (17Mather M.W.

Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega, Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

E. coli strain NM256 (recA) was generously provided by Dr. J. R. Guest (Sheffield University, United Kingdom). Ubiquinone derivatives 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Q2), 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-[3H]6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone ([3H]azido-Q), 5-azido-2,3-dimethoxy-[3H]6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone ([3H]5-azido-Q), were synthesized in our laboratory as previously reported (18Yu C.A. Yu L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 23: 259-273Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium or M9 minimal medium containing 20 mmsuccinate and required amino acids with vigorous gyratory shaking. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the increase of optical density at 660 nm. Where appropriate, ampicillin (100–125 μg/ml), tetracycline (10–15 μg/ml), kanamycin sulfate (30–50 μg/ml), or trimethoprim (85–100 μg/ml) was used for the growth of the mutants of E. coli. Extra rich medium, TYP, was used in the procedures for rescue of single-stranded DNA (19Khosravi M. Ryan W. Websger D.A. Stark B.C. Plasmid. 1990; 23: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites system from Promega (20Promega Altered Sites228 in Vitro Mutagenesis Systems Technical Manual. Promega, Madison, WI1996Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Oklahoma State University Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used were as follows: CTGGACCTACAGGCCATCCGGTTCCC (T17A), CTACAGACCATCGCGTTCCCCATCACGGCG (R19A), CAGACCATCCGGCTCCCCATCACGGCG (F20L), CGGTTCCCCATCGCGGCGATAGCGT (T23A), ACGGCGATAGCGGCCATTCTCCATC (S27A), ACGGCGATAGCGTGCATTCTCCATCG (S27C), ACGGCGATAGCGACCATTCTCCATCG (S27T), GCGTCCATTCTCGCTCGCGTTTCCGG (H30A), TCCATTCTCCATGCCGTTTCCGGTGTG (R31A), TCCATTCTCCATAAAGTTTCCGGTGTG (R31K), TCCATTCTCCATCACGTTTCCGGTGTGATC (R31H), CTCCATCGCGTTGCCGGTGTGATC (S33A), CTCCATCGCGTTTGCGGTGTGATCACCTTT (S33C), CTCCATCGCATTACCGGTGTGATC (S33T). Plasmid sdhCDAB/pSELECT-1, in which a 4.5-kbBamHI fragment containing sdh operon was inserted into the BamHI site of pSELECT-1, was used as template DNA for mutagenesis. Following mutagenesis, a 4.5-kb EcoRI and XbaI fragment including the whole sdh operon was ligated into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pRKD418Kn, which was constructed by insertion of a KnR gene between theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pRKD418. Loss of kanamycin resistance was then used to screen for recombinant plasmids.sdhCDAB/pRKD418 derivatives were transformed into a succinate-Q reductase deletion strain, E. coli NM256 (recA) (EΔSQR). A 4.5-kbBamHI fragment containing the sdh operon from pGS133 plasmid was ligated into the BamHI site of pSELECT-1 to generate sdh/pSELECT-1 plasmid. The cloning of thesdh operon into the pSELECT-1 plasmid enables us to introduce the KnR gene into the resulting plasmid, because it contains no KnR gene. The sdh/pSELECT-1 plasmid was digested with BclI and XhoI to removesdhC, -D, and -A and the beginning of sdhB. The remaining linear fragment was then treated with Klenow fragment to generate blunt ends and ligated with a 1.2-kb KnR gene cassette contained in HincII fragment from pSL1180KnERV plasmid. The resulting plasmid, ΔSQR::Kn/pSELECT-1 was transformed into E. coliJC7623, and cells were selected for KnR and tetracycline-sensitive (Tcs) phenotypes. It has been shown that replication of ColEI-derived plasmids in recBC sbcBC strains is deleterious to cell growth due to the formation of linear multimers (21Kusano K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under conditions where maintenance of a plasmid is selected, cells in which the plasmid has integrated would be at an advantage. It has also been reported that in this strain covalently closed-circular plasmid DNA is at least as effective for gene replacement by transformation as is linearized plasmid DNA (22Oden K.L. DeVeaux L.C. Vibat C.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Gennis R.B. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, cells with the KnR and TcS phenotypes must result from replacement of the sdh operon by the KnR gene in chromosomes arising from a double crossover event between circular plasmid DNA and chromosomal DNA. The KnR-TcS cells (JC7623 (ΔSQR::KnR)) are unable to grow on an M9/succinate plate. However, since JC7623 (ΔSQR::KnR) cells arerecA +, they cannot stably harbor plasmid and thus cannot be used for expression of cloned sdh operon in a plasmid. The KnR gene in the chromosome of JC7623 (ΔSQR::KnR) cells was introduced into E. coli NM256 (recA −) by P1 transduction using P1clr100. The resulting NM256 with the KnRphenotype is named EΔSQR. General molecular genetic manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrooket al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing was performed at the Oklahoma State University Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility with an Applied Biosystems model 373 automatic DNA sequencer. Membranes were prepared from EΔSQR complement and mutant strains as described previously (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Succinate-Q reductase was purified from membranes by the method of Yanget al. (10Yang X., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Succinate-Q reductase activity was assayed for its ability to catalyze Q-stimulated DCPIP reduction by succinate. The assay was performed at room temperature in a Shimadzu UV2101PC spectrophotometer. An appropriate amount of enzyme was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 μm DCPIP, 20 mmsuccinate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 25 μm of Q2. For determination of apparentK m for Q2, various concentrations of Q2 were used. The reduction of DCPIP was followed by measuring the absorbance decrease at 600 nm, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1cm−1. 8 ml of succinate-Q reductase, 2 mg/ml (10.6 μm cytochromeb 556) in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% E9C12 was incubated with 424 nmol of [3H]azido-Q (5-fold molar excess to cytochromeb 556) at 0 °C for 10 min in the dark. The [3H]azido-Q was added in 100 μl of ethanol. The specific radioactivity of azido-Q used was 1.6 × 104cpm/nmol in 95% ethanol and 6.6 × 103 cpm/nmol in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% E9C12 in the presence of succinate-Q reductase. This mixture was transferred to an illuminating apparatus made from two quartz glasses sandwiched by a Teflon ring, which was immersed in ice in a Petri dish to maintain the temperature at 0 °C. The sample was illuminated with long wavelength UV light for 7 min at a distance of 5 cm from the light source. To determine the amount of [3H]azido-Q incorporated into succinate-Q reductase, the illuminated [3H]azido-Q-treated samples were spotted onto a 3m paper and developed with a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, v/v) to remove non-protein-bound [3H]azido-Q. After the paper was air-dried, the origin spot was cut into small pieces and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The illuminated [3H]azido-Q-treated succinate-Q reductase was precipitated by 50% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 30 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against double-distilled water, overnight, with one change of water. The dialyzed sample was subjected to organic solvent extraction as described previously (12Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), to remove the free azido-Q and detergent-azido-Q adducts, from the protein. The organic solvent remaining in the aqueous layer was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas before the solution containing the photolyzed protein was subjected to lyophilization. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, containing 1% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h before being subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE gel was prepared according to Schägger et al. (24Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) except that 7 m urea was used in the separating gel instead of 13% glycerol. For the reference wells, the digested sample was treated with fluorescamine prior to sample loading. The electrophoresis was run at 15 V for 2 h and then at 45 V for another 15 h. The protein bands were visualized by fluorescence under UV. The SDS-PAGE pattern of the fluorescamine-treated sample was identical to that of the untreated sample stained by Coomassie Blue. The SdhC protein band was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel, and the protein was eluted with an electroeluter from Bio-Rad. Purified [3H]azido-Q-labeled SdhC obtained by electroelution was subjected to a repeated dilution and concentration process using Centricon-10 with dilution buffer of 30 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5. The final protein concentration was about 2 mg/ml, with the SDS concentration around 0.5%. The protein was then digested with protease K at 37 °C for 6 h using a protease K:SdhC ratio of 1:50 (w/w). 100-μl aliquots of the protease K-digested SdhC were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Synchropak RP-8 column (0.46 × 25 cm) using a gradient formed from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. 0.8-ml fractions were collected. The absorbance at 214 nm and the radioactivity of each fraction were measured. Peaks with high specific radioactivity were collected, dried, and subjected to peptide sequence analysis. The FAD contents in wild-type and mutant E. coli succinate-Q reductases were determined fluorometrically as previously reported (25Wilson D.F. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2683-2690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The content of cytochromeb 556 was determined from the reduced minus oxidized spectrum using the millimolar extinction coefficient of 22.8 cm−1 mm-1 for the wavelength pair 558–575 nm as described previously (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer, model UV2101PC. Study of the Q-protein interactions in succinate-Q reductase, using synthetic Q derivatives, requires the prior removal of endogenous Q from the complex because the binding affinity of synthetic Q derivatives is weaker than that of endogenous Q. Since purifiedE. coli succinate-Q reductase contains less than 5% of endogenous Q10 with respect to FAD (10Yang X., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and is fully active upon the addition of exogenous Q, it is an ideal system for studying Q-protein interactions and for identifying the Q-binding site with azido-Q derivatives. When purified succinate-Q reductase was incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of [3H]azido-Q or [3H]5-azido-Q for 10 min at 0 °C in the dark and then illuminated with long wavelength UV light for 7 min, only the [3H]azido-Q-treated sample showed inactivation, indicating that [3H]azido-Q is suitable for studying the Q-protein interactions in this reductase. Fig. 1 shows that when succinate-Q reductase was incubated with various concentrations of [3H]azido-Q and illuminated, the activity decreased as the concentration of azido-Q was increased. Maximum inactivation of 35% was obtained when 5 mol of [3H]azido-Q/mol of cytochrome b 556 was used. Inactivation was not due to the inhibition of succinate-Q reductase by photolyzed products of azido-Q, because when azido-Q was photolyzed in the absence of reductase and then mixed with succinate-Q reductase, no inhibition was observed. Inactivation was also not due to damage of reductase protein by UV, because when the enzyme alone was illuminated, no activity loss was observed. These findings together with the finding that the amount of azido-Q uptake by succinate-Q reductase correlated with the extent of the enzymatic inactivation (about 0.35 mol of azido-Q uptake/mol of cytochrome b 556 at 35% inactivation) indicate that inactivation results from the binding of azido-Q to the Q-binding site. Since purified E. coli succinate-Q reductase contains less than 5% of endogenous Q, we were surprised to see a maximum uptake of 0.35 mol of azido-Q/mol of cytochromeb 556. This low azido-Q uptake may result from some Q-binding sites in the enzyme complex being partially masked by detergent E9C12 or from the azido-Q binding at one of the two putative Q-binding sites in the reductase (14Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that in illuminated [3H]azido-Q-treated succinate-Q reductase, radioactivity was found only in the SdhC subunit, suggesting that this subunit provides the Q-binding site. The lack of azido-Q labeling in the SdhD subunit is in contrast to results with the mitochondrial enzyme, in which radioactivity was found in all of the membrane-anchoring subunits, QPs1 (50%), QPs2 (22%), and QPs3 (25%) (12Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It should be noted that when the azido-Q concentration used is higher than a 5-fold molar excess to cytochrome b 556, nonspecific labeling of the Fp and Ip subunits is observed. In order to identify the Q-binding domain in SdhC through isolation and sequencing of an azido-Q-linked peptide, it is absolutely necessary that the isolated azido-Q-labeled SdhC be free from contamination with unbound azido-Q and completely susceptible to proteolytic enzyme digestion. [3H]Azido-Q-labeled SdhC was isolated from illuminated, [3H]azido-Q-treated succinate-Q reductase by a procedure involving ammonium sulfate fractionation, dialysis, organic solvent extraction, lyophilization, preparative SDS-PAGE, electrophoretic elution, and membrane concentration. Two steps in the isolation procedure, organic solvent extraction and SDS-PAGE, are used to remove non-protein-bound azido-Q adducts. The SDS concentration in the final purification step is about 0.5%, while the concentration of [3H]azido-Q-labeled SdhC is about 2 mg/ml. Isolated [3H]azido-Q-labeled SdhC shows only one band, in SDS-PAGE, which corresponds to the third subunit of succinate-Q reductase (data not shown). About 40% of the SdhC protein present in succinate-Q reductase was recovered in the final purification step, assuming that the molecular mass of succinate-Q reductase is 117 kDa and that it contains 1 mol of SdhC/mol of reductase. This relatively low yield of SdhC is probably due to very thin slicing of the SdhC band, from SDS-PAGE gel, to avoid contamination with SdhD protein. When the SDS present in the purified [3H]azido-Q-labeled SdhC was removed by cold acetone precipitation, the resulting protein was highly aggregated and resistant to proteolytic enzyme digestion. Inclusion of 0.1% SDS and 2 m urea in the digestion mixture does not increase proteolysis. Modification of SDS-free, [3H]azido-Q-labeled SdhC by reductive carboxymethylation followed by succinylation also does not render the protein susceptible to chymotrypsin or trypsin digestion. This is different from the mitochondrial system in which reductive carboxymethylation and succinylation effectively rendered purified, SDS-free, [3H]azido-Q-labeled QPs1 and QPs3 susceptible to chymotrypsin or trypsin digestion. Since the SDS-free [3H]azido-Q-labeled SdhC, with or without prior chemical modification, cannot be completely digested by proteolytic enzymes, an alternative way is to digest isolated [3H]azido-Q-labeled SdhC with a protease that is activ"

A previously characterized HeLa CTD phosphatase has been shown to processively dephosphorylate RNAP II and to be stimulated by the 74-kDa subunit of TFIIF.

Full-length Tat-1 protein (Tat 86R) strongly inhibits the activity of CTD phosphatase. Point mutations in the activation domain of Tat 86R, which reduce the ability of Tat to transactivate in vivo, diminish its ability to inhibit CTD phosphatase. Furthermore, a deletion mutant missing most of the activation domain is unable to inhibit CTD phosphatase activity. The ability of Tat to transactivatein vitro also correlates with the strength of inhibition of CTD phosphatase.

The largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 II from all eukaryotes contains at its carboxyl terminus varying numbers of repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. Each cycle of transcription involves the reversible phosphorylation of this carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) (1Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). RNAP II with an unphosphorylated CTD is designated RNAP IIA, and polymerase with a highly phosphorylated CTD is designated RNAP IIO. The activity of many key regulatory factors appears to be mediated by the CTD although its role in transcription is not clearly defined. An understanding of transcriptional regulation is dependent on elucidating the function of the CTD and the mechanisms and regulation of the enzymes that modify it. Because RNAPs IIA and IIO have distinct roles in the transcription cycle, the activities of enzymes that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the CTD must be tightly regulated. RNAP IIA is efficiently recruited to promoters during the assembly of a preinitiation complex (2Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2329-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, at some point subsequent to the binding of RNAP II to the promoter and likely before RNAP II has cleared the promoter, the CTD is phosphorylated by CTD kinase(s) (2Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After completion of a nascent transcript, RNAP IIA must be regenerated by CTD phosphatase. An enzyme capable of selectively dephosphorylating the CTD has been described (9Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

CTD phosphatases and kinases can be inhibitory or stimulatory to transcription depending on the phase of the transcription cycle during which they act. According to present models, the phosphorylation of RNAP II in a preinitiation complex stimulates transcription whereas the phosphorylation of free RNAP IIA inhibits transcription by diminishing the pool of RNAP II capable of being recruited to the promoter. Conversely, CTD phosphatase acting on free RNAP IIO increases the pool of RNAP IIA available for initiation thereby acting as an activator of transcription, whereas CTD phosphatase acting on RNAP IIO in an elongation complex would likely result in a paused or stalled polymerase (13O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). CTD phosphatase is specific for RNAP IIO and processively removes phosphates from the CTD to generate RNAP IIA. Furthermore, CTD phosphatase appears to interact directly with a site on RNAP II that is distinct from the CTD and is regulated by several of the general transcription factors (10Chambers R.S.

Specifically, the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF stimulates CTD phosphatase as much as 20-fold while TFIIB inhibits the IIF-dependent stimulation but not the basal activity of the enzyme. The analysis of deletion constructs of RAP74 indicates that the carboxyl terminus and part of the conserved amino-terminal domain are required for maximal stimulation of CTD phosphatase (10Chambers R.S.

Because an increased level of CTD phosphorylation can result from either an activation of CTD kinase(s) or an inhibition of CTD phosphatase(s), CTD phosphatase is a potential Tat target. Recently, a two-hybrid screen using RAP74 as bait resulted in the isolation of the mammalian FCP1 cDNA (25Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N.F. Zhang S. Dahmus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27593-27601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). FCP1 was shown to be a subunit of the previously described CTD phosphatase and was found to interact with Tat (9Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N.F. Zhang S. Dahmus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol.

Therefore, Tat has the ability to interact with proteins that can either phosphorylate or dephosphorylate the CTD. This report establishes that the 150-kDa polypeptide (FCP1) corresponds to the catalytic subunit of CTD phosphatase. Tat directly inhibits the activity of CTD phosphatase, and mutants of Tat that are defective in transactivation in vivo are defective in their ability to inhibit CTD phosphatase in vitro. The ability of Tat to regulate both basal and RAP74-stimulated CTD phosphatase activities suggests that the control of transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat is in part mediated by CTD phosphatase. Mono Q, HiTrap columns (heparin, NHS-activated, SP, Q), and radiolabeled [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The DEAE-15HR column is from Waters. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Human recombinant casein kinase II is from UBI. Glutathione-agarose and human thrombin were purchased from Sigma. SYPRO Red stain was purchased from FMC BioProducts. RNase T1 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Transcription templates TAR-G400 and ΔTAR-G100 were provided by P. A. Sharp (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Expression vectors for GST-Tat fusion proteins were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Human CTD phosphatase was purified from HeLa cells as described by Chambers and Dahmus (9Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with several modifications. The purification was begun with 2 × 1011 cells. HiTrap heparin columns (5 ml, three in series) were used in place of heparin-Sepharose resin, and a DEAE-15HR (20 × 100 mm) column was used in place of DE52 resin. The Resource Q column was replaced by three 5-ml HiTrap Q columns run in series. The phenyl-Superose and Superose 12 steps were replaced by a 5-ml HiTrap NHS-activated column that had been coupled with ∼20 mg of recombinant RAP74. The peak of CTD phosphatase activity eluting from the HiTrap-RAP74 was then chromatographed over a 1-ml Mono Q column. Proteins purified by SDS-PAGE were renatured as described by Conaway et al. (26Conaway J.W. Bond M.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8293-8297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Tat and mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (27Rhim H. Rice A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4405-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Tat proteins were recovered from glutathione-agarose by thrombin cleavage of the bound GST-fusion protein. Tat was further purified and concentrated by adjusting to 400 mm KCl, loading onto 1-ml HiTrap heparin columns in TGED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT) containing 400 mm KCl followed by step elution with TGED containing 1m KCl. For Tat and Tat mutants, samples of the peak HiTrap fractions were dialyzed against TGED containing 10 mm KCl until the KCl concentration was less than 25 mm as determined by conductivity. Tat proteins were quantitated by staining of bands in SDS-PAGE with SYPRO Red followed by analysis on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager scanner Storm 860. As assayed by SYPRO and silver staining, all Tat preparations are between 60 and 95% pure. For the preparation of substrate, calf thymus RNAP IIA (>95% pure) was purified by the method of Hodo and Blatti (29Hodo H.D. Blatti S.P. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Kang and Dahmus (6Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).32P-Labeled RNAP IIO was prepared by phosphorylation of purified RNAP IIA with recombinant casein kinase II and [γ-32P]ATP followed by phosphorylation with purified CTDK1 (28Payne J.M. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 80-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 2 mm ATP (4Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because only the most carboxyl-terminal serine (CKII site) is labeled with32P and lies outside the consensus repeat, dephosphorylation by CTD phosphatase results in an electrophoretic mobility shift of subunit IIo to the position of subunit IIa without loss of label. Recombinant RAP74 (>95% pure) was expressed and purified according to Wang et al. (30Wang B.Q. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CTD phosphatase assays were performed as described previously (9Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Reactions were performed in 20 μl of CTD phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.025% Tween 80, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 32P-labeled RNAP IIO (25–35 fmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. For assays that include Tat or Tat mutant proteins, CTD phosphatase, RAP74, and Tat were incubated briefly on ice prior to the addition of RNAP IIO. Assays were terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer, and RNAP subunits were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Transcription reactions were carried out using a dual template protocol (31Zhou Q. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in HeLa nuclear extract (32Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) except that no ATP was present during the 30-min preincubation. Nascent transcripts were digested with 39 units of RNase T1. Initial purification of human CTD phosphatase yielded an active fraction with several polypeptides as putative subunits (9Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 150-kDa polypeptide has recently been shown to be equivalent to the RAP74 interacting protein FCP1 (25Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N.F. Zhang S. Dahmus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27593-27601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The finding that a polyclonal antibody directed against FCP1 precipitates CTD phosphatase activity suggests that the 150-kDa protein is an essential subunit. However, the 150-kDa subunit contains no recognizable phosphatase motif (12Archambault J. Chambers R.S. Kobor M.S. Ho Y. Cartier M. Bolotin D. Andrews B. Kane C.M. Greenblatt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14300-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N.F. Zhang S. Dahmus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27593-27601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To determine which polypeptides present in the CTD phosphatase-containing fraction are required for activity, highly purified CTD phosphatase was denatured and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Each of 34 gel slices was extracted for protein and renatured as described by Conaway et al. (26Conaway J.W. Bond M.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8293-8297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were assayed for CTD phosphatase activity in the presence of RAP74. CTD phosphatase activity was recovered only in fractions 10 and 11 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 8). The processive dephosphorylation of RNAP IIO is characteristic of CTD phosphatase and is preserved in the renatured enzyme. Based on PhosphorImager quantitation of the input and renatured activity, approximately 0.1% of the input CTD phosphatase activity was recovered. The polypeptides recovered from gel slices were re-run on SDS-PAGE, silver-stained, and are shown in Fig. 1 B. Fractions containing CTD phosphatase activity correspond to those fractions containing the 150-kDa subunit. A sample of the input CTD phosphatase is shown in Fig. 1 B, lane 1. Accordingly, the 150-kDa subunit appears necessary and sufficient for CTD phosphatase activity. The basal transcription factors TFIIF and TFIIB have previously been shown to regulate the activity of CTD phosphatase in vitro (10Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The finding that the 150-kDa subunit (FCP1) interacts with the HIV-1 transcriptional regulator, Tat, suggests that Tat might also regulate CTD phosphatase activity (25Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N.F. Zhang S. Dahmus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27593-27601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, purified recombinant Tat 86R (wt) was examined for its ability to influence CTD phosphatase activity in the standard RAP74-dependent CTD phosphatase assay. For increased sensitivity, CTD phosphatase was titrated to the point where approximately 50% of the input RNAP IIO was dephosphorylated during the course of the reaction (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The addition of increasing amounts of Tat 86R resulted in inhibition of CTD phosphatase activity. To determine the specificity of this inhibition and to define domains of Tat required for the regulation of CTD phosphatase activity, three mutant Tat proteins were assayed (Fig. 2, B–D). C22G, P18IS, and D2/36 are, respectively, a substitution of one critical cysteine, an insertion of a single amino acid in the activation domain, and a nearly complete deletion of the activation domain. All mutations are in the wild type (86R) background. Both C22G and P18IS are partially effective in inhibiting the activity of CTD phosphatase. Relative to wild type Tat, an approximately three times higher concentration of C22G and P18IS is required for 50% inhibition (Fig. 2 E). The presence of D2/36, even at very high concentrations, does not result in significant inhibition of CTD phosphatase. These results suggest that the activation domain of Tat is required for CTD phosphatase inhibition, but a completely wild type domain is not strictly required. The three mutants tested in Fig. 2 have been defined as transactivation-deficient in vivo, but at least two of them retain some ability to inhibit CTD phosphatase in vitro. Wild type Tat and the mutants described above were assayed in parallel for their ability to transactivate in vitro and inhibit CTD phosphatase activity (Fig. 3,A and B). Results were quantified and are presented in Fig. 3 C. Tat 86R supports a 5-fold transactivation and, as reported above, is also the most effective in inhibiting CTD phosphatase activity. P18IS shows a reduced but parallel effect on both transactivation and inhibition of CTD phosphatase. C22G is modestly inhibitory but does not transactivate, whereas D2/36 is ineffective in either assay. These results show a parallel between the ability to support transactivation and the inhibition of CTD phosphatase for Tat86R and mutant Tat proteins. All CTD phosphatase reactions described to this point were carried out in the presence of RAP74. To determine whether the effect of Tat is in part mediated by RAP74, the effect of Tat on CTD phosphatase activity was determined in the absence of RAP74. Tat 86R and the mutants were titrated as in Fig. 2, A–D. The pattern of inhibition in the absence of RAP74 is similar to that in its presence (data not shown). A reproducible stimulation of CTD phosphatase activity was observed at low concentrations of 86R and P18IS (data not shown). Approximately 5-fold more Tat is required to inhibit CTD phosphatase to a comparable extent in the absence of RAP74. This is expected in that RAP74-independent reactions contained about 40-fold more CTD phosphatase than those in Fig. 2. These studies establish that human CTD phosphatase is comprised of a single subunit of molecular size 150 kDa. The recovery of CTD phosphatase activity from renatured SDS-PAGE-purified 150-kDa (FCP1) polypeptide, in the presence of recombinant RAP74 and highly purified RNAP IIO, supports the idea that CTD phosphatase is comprised of a single subunit. The fact that FCP1 contains no recognizable phosphatase motifs suggests that CTD phosphatase is a novel protein phosphatase. Alternatively, the 150-kDa protein might be a regulatory subunit that is essential for activation of a catalytic subunit that resides elsewhere. Because RAP74 is recombinant and not essential for CTD phosphatase activity, the only fraction that might contribute required protein(s) is the substrate, RNAP IIO. The observation that normal CTD phosphatase activity can be demonstrated with labeled RNAP IIO phosphorylated by recombinant CKII and P-TEFb 2N. F. Marshall and M. E. Dahmus, unpublished observations. indicates that the protein kinase used in the production of substrate does not contribute to CTD phosphatase activity. This is also consistent with the observation that purified RNAP IIO, phosphorylated in vivo, is also a substrate for CTD phosphatase (9Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that a subunit of RNAP II contributes catalytic activity, perhaps in a manner analogous to that proposed for the S-II-mediated transcript shortening reaction (33Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12864-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cannot be excluded. There is no evidence for an additional factor requirement in HeLa cells as reported for yeast CTD phosphatase (11Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that Tat interacts with CTD phosphatase and inhibits its activity, the molecular mechanism for this inhibition has not been established. The fact that Tat inhibits CTD phosphatase in the absence of RAP74 indicates that it does not simply interfere with the interaction of RAP74 with CTD phosphatase, as proposed for TFIIB (10Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). One possibility is that Tat forms a stable complex with CTD phosphatase, and the resulting complex is incapable of binding to RNAP II. The ability of Tat to inhibit CTD phosphatase correlates well with the ability of Tat to transactivate. The amino-terminal 48 amino acids of Tat constitute the minimal sequence required for Tat to function as a transactivator (27Rhim H. Rice A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4405-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Kamine J. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8510-8514Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 37Selby M.J. Peterlin B.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 769-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The removal of this domain results in a form of Tat (D2/36) that is unable to inhibit CTD phosphatase activity. Furthermore, seven cysteine residues within this domain are required for transactivation, and mutation of one of these (C22G) severely compromises the ability of Tat to inhibit CTD phosphatase. The P18IS mutation was less compromised for CTD phosphatase inhibition, which correlates with the observation that P18IS is able to weakly transactivate (Fig. 3 C). RNAP IIO catalyzes transcript elongation. Indeed, increasing evidence supports the idea that the phosphorylated CTD plays an essential role in processive elongation (18Parada C.A. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 20Yang X. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4576-4584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J.

Accordingly, dephosphorylation of RNAP IIO in an elongation complex will likely result in pausing and subsequent termination. Tat is known to increase gene expression by increasing the processivity of RNAP II (14Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 15Laspia M.F. Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 16Kato H.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4189-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tat leads to an increase in the ratio of RNAP IIO to IIA, an effect due in part to the activation of TFIIH kinase (18Parada C.A. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Both TFIIH and P-TEFb have recently been directly implicated in mediating Tat transactivation (18Parada C.A. Roeder R.G.

The results presented in this manuscript indicate that transactivation by Tat might also be mediated by the direct inhibition of CTD phosphatase activity. According to this hypothesis, initiation of transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat leads to early elongation complexes that are sensitive to CTD phosphatase. In the absence of Tat, CTD phosphatase dephosphorylates RNAP IIO, which leads to pausing and subsequent termination. In the presence of Tat, CTD phosphatase is inhibited, and the level of RNAP II phosphorylation is maintained resulting in processive elongation. Because Tat recruits P-TEFb, through interaction with cyclin T, the activation of CTD phosphorylation and suppression of CTD dephosphorylation may be coordinately regulated by Tat. Accordingly, during the phase of transcript elongation when RNAP IIO is sensitive to dephosphorylation, Tat shifts the equilibrium in favor of CTD phosphorylation by both inhibiting dephosphorylation and promoting phosphorylation. An understanding of the biochemical mechanisms that underlie this complex regulation is dependent on understanding the molecular interactions between the various components and whether or not the interaction of Tat with cyclin T and CTD phosphatase are mutually exclusive. A corollary of this proposal is that RNAP II initiating transcription from different promoters may result in elongation complexes that are differentially sensitive to CTD phosphatase. Accordingly, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which CTD phosphatase is recruited to elongation complexes and how this interaction is regulated.

Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar, 11Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although type I receptor phosphorylation is required for TGF-βR signaling, the number of GS domain phosphorylations, and not their particular location, appears to be the primary determinant of type I receptor activity (10Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 11Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Similarly, autophosphorylation of the type II TGF-βR at serines 213 and 409 are necessary to signal growth inhibitory responses while serine 416 phosphorylation acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β action (13Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1970-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to being regulated by phosphorylation, a number of other sites have been shown to modulate TGF-βR activity (10Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). For instance, while there are no published reports of threonines 200 or 204 in the type I receptor being phosphorylated, their mutation to valine or aspartic acid generates a signaling incompetent or activated receptor complex, respectively (11Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The endocytic mechanisms controlling TGF-βR membrane expression have not been extensively characterized. Early reports were contradictory and found either no significant receptor down-regulation (14Massagué J. Cancer Cells. 1985; 3: 73-78Google Scholar, 15Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Masui T. Harris C.C. Sporn M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) or an approximate 50% decrease in surface binding following addition of ligand (16Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently addressed this question in mesenchymal AKR-2B cells growth stimulated by TGF-β (17Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By using chimeric receptors consisting of the ligand-binding domain of the GM-CSF α or β receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the type I or type II TGF-βR, the signaling and endocytic activity of heteromeric (i.e. type I/type II) or homomeric (type I/type I or type II/type II) TGF-βR cytoplasmic interactions could be evaluated (17Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These studies showed that while signaling competent heteromeric TGF-β receptors were internalized and down-regulated, signaling incompetent homomeric receptor complexes appeared to be recycled back to the cell surface following initial internalization. This was not a secondary response due to an inability of homomeric receptors to signal (19Anders R.A. Doré J.E.J. Arline S.A. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but reflected an inherent difference in the endocytic activity of TGF-βR heteromers and homomers. The present article investigates both the TGF-βR complex required for epithelial cell signaling and the initial endocytic response of ligand-activated receptors. Consistent with previous reports in fibroblasts (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Ba/F3 cells (20Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Muramatsu M. Yan J. Eto K. Tomoda T. Yamada R. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), chimeric TGF-βR signaling in Mv1Lu epithelial cells required the formation of an heteromeric type I-type II receptor complex. Homomeric type I-type I or type II-type II TGF-βR interactions were unable to induce the expression of a TGF-β responsive reporter gene or generate a growth inhibitory signal. However, when effects on receptor trafficking were examined, both similarities and differences were observed from that seen in mesenchymal cells. For instance, although heteromeric receptors were internalized and down-regulated in both cell types, homomeric receptor ligation resulted in a differential endocytic response. Recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was a generous gift from DNAX Research Institute (Palo Alto, CA) while recombinant human TGF-β2 was purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA) or R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cell culture media, horse serum, and Geneticin (G418 sulfate) were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Summit (Fort Collins, CO) and hygromycin B was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). All culture dishes were from Corning (Corning, NY). Parental mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu, were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. Chimeric receptor expressing clones were constructed in a two-step process utilizing the cDNAs described previously (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Initially, either the βI or βII chimeric receptor was transfected into Mv1Lu cells. The designation β1, for example, refers to the extracellular domain of the human GM-CSF receptor β subunit coupled to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the TGF-β type I receptor. Mv1Lu cells were plated at 105 cells per well in 6-well dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated in 2 ml of DMEM for 10 min prior to transfection with a mixture of 2 μg of plasmid and 4 μl of TransIT-LT2 (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) in a final volume of 100 μl of Opti-MEM for 8 h at 37 °C. Medium was replaced with 10% FBS/DMEM for 16 h to allow the cells to recover and then changed to selection medium (10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with 300 μg/ml hygromycin B) for 24 h prior to trypsinization and replating at 1:40 dilution by surface area. Ten days post-transfection isolated colonies were expanded and screened by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for membrane expression of the chimeric receptor as described previously (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two representative epithelial cell clones were chosen for the second transfection based upon high expression of the chimeric βI (clone MB102) or βII (clone MB202) receptor (determined by FACS analysis) and normal (>80%) inhibitory response to endogenous TGF-βR activation (data not shown). To generate a high affinity ligand binding chimeric receptor complex a second transfection was performed with the αI and αII chimeric constructs. The designation αII, for example, refers to the α GM-CSF receptor ligand-binding domain coupled to the TGF-β type II transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Clones MB102 and MB202 were plated at 105 cells in 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of αI or αII plasmid in TransIt-LT2 and Opti-MEM as described. Following 16 h recovery in 10% FBS/DMEM, cells were placed in selection medium (10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B) for 24 h prior to 1:40 dilution. Medium was changed after 5 days and stable clones isolated and expanded 10 days post-transfection. Stable chimeric expressing clones were maintained in 10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with 200 μg/ml Geneticin and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Two to three representative clones from each transfection group were then chosen for further analysis. The heteromeric receptor expressing cell lines consisted of clones MB102-18 and MB202-9, type I homomeric receptor expressing clones were designated MB102-16 and MB102-35, and lines expressing only a chimeric type II TGF-βR were designated MB202-2 and MB202-11. When the comparison of epithelial to mesenchymal cell internalization was performed in Fig. 4, the heteromeric AKR-2B clones were A105 and A110, the type I homomeric clones were A120 and A137, and the type II homomeric clones were A122 and A139 (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Treatment of epithelial cells with TGF-β results in a characteristic inhibition of DNA synthesis and subsequent mitosis. Chimeric receptor expressing clones were plated in 10% FBS/DMEM at 4 × 104 cells per well (1 ml) into 24-well culture dishes. Following overnight 37 °C incubation GM-CSF or TGF-β2 was directly added to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml for 20 h. The cultures were then pulsed for 2 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine and trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts determined (22Shipley G.D. Tucker R.F. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4147-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine the chimeric TGF-βR complex modulating long-term proliferative responses, clones were plated at 104 cells into 33-mm Petri dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS alone or supplemented with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF or TGF-β2. On each of days 3, 5, and 7 (with medium being replaced on day 5) three dishes were trypsinized and cell number determined by a hemocytometer. Receptor binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, clones were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes in 10% FBS/DMEM 24 h prior to the experiment. Binding of radioactive ligand (100 pm125I-GM-CSF; NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) was performed at 4 °C in binding buffer (DMEM containing 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 2 h with or without the presence of 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled GM-CSF, to determine specific binding. Following the 2-h incubation, wells were washed twice with a solution of 75% horse serum, 25% binding buffer and cells solubilized with 0.2 m NaOH, 40 μg/ml sheared single stranded salmon sperm DNA. Clones which had 1,500 cpm or greater were analyzed by FACS to document the presence of both α and β receptors on the cell surface. Functional analysis involved the inhibition of thymidine uptake and the induction of transiently transfected plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-luciferase (3TP-Lux) reporter gene (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), by both GM-CSF (through the chimeric receptors) and TGF-β2 (through the endogenous receptor pathway). The chimeric α-I receptor cDNA was mutated at serine 172 to alanine (S172A) and threonine 176 to a valine (T176V) using the QuickChangeTM Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic primers for S172A were: CGCCCTTTTATTgCAGAGGGTACTACG and CGTAGTACCCTCTGcAATAAAAGGGCG and for T176V, TCAGAGGGTACTgtGTTGAAAGACTTAATT and AATTAAGTCTTTCAACacAGTACCCTCTGAA. The lower- case letters indicate the base changes necessary to introduce the appropriate amino acid change. Mutant constructs in pGEM-3Z were verified by automated DNA sequencing and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pNA at the SalI and HindIII sites. The S172A and T176V αI constructs were transfected into the MB202 parental cell line to generate an heteromeric TGF-βR complex expressing the appropriate type I receptor mutation. We previously documented that the endocytic response of heteromeric and homomeric TGFβ receptors is distinctly regulated in fibroblasts (17Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar methods were utilized to determine whether epithelial cells internalize ligand and undergo receptor-mediated down-regulation. Internalization assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications, 2 × 105 cells/well were plated and internalization occurred in 10% FBS/DMEM (in contrast to binding buffer). Down-regulation of chimeric receptors was determined as described previously in fibroblasts. Scatchard analysis was performed to determine whether observed differences in biological responses were due to changes in receptor number or high affinity binding. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells/well were plated into 6-well plates 24 h prior to the experiment. Cells were washed with binding buffer and 500 pm125I-GM-CSF was added to triplicate wells with increasing amounts of unlabeled GM-CSF (5 pm to 50 nm) and the binding allowed to proceed at 4 °C to equilibrium (3 h). Wells were washed 3 times with 75% horse serum, 25% binding buffer and the cells lysed as described for binding assays. Aliquots of the total labeled GM-CSF added to each well were counted and included in the computer analysis for a two-site receptor model (23Rovati G.E. Rodbard D. Munson P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 636-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Only the properties of high affinity α/β receptor complexes were compared since low affinity α subunit alone binding does not stimulate any biological response (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Shanafelt A.B. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Kastelein R.A.

A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Chimeric GM-CSF/TGF-β receptor constructs were stably transfected into mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu, as described previously for mouse fibroblasts (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Mv1Lu cells were initially transformed with a β1 or β2 receptor construct (designations described under “Experimental Procedures”) and two clones designated MB-102 (β1) and MB-202 (β2) selected based upon chimeric receptor membrane expression and growth inhibitory response to endogenous TGF-βR activation (data not shown). MB-102 and MB-202 were then used as recipient cell lines into which the complementary α receptor chimeric receptors were transfected. Stable clones were obtained by dual selection in hygromycin and Geneticin (G418 sulfate) and clones obtained expressing homomeric (α1β1 and α2β2) and heteromeric (α1β2 and α2β1) TGF-βR interactions. Plasma membrane expression of both the α and β chimeric receptors was confirmed by FACS analysis and ligand binding assays (Fig. 1 and data not shown). We have previously reported that (in fibroblasts) only heteromeric TGF-βR interactions are signaling competent following ligand binding (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since the biological response to TGF-β of epithelial and mesenchymal cells is so distinct (i.e. growth inhibitionversus growth stimulation, respectively), the chimeric receptor expressing epithelial clones were assayed for their ability to reproduce typical TGF-β regulated responses following GM-CSF stimulation (Figs. 2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 2 A, addition of TGF-β2 to cycling epithelial cells resulted in an approximate 90% inhibition in thymidine incorporation. However, while GM-CSF treatment had no significant effect on either the parental Mv1Lu cells or clones expressing chimeric type I or type II homomeric receptors, a similar growth inhibitory response to that seen following addition of TGF-β2 was observed when heteromeric type I/type II TGFβ receptors were activated by treatment with GM-CSF. Furthermore, to address the possibility that a single time point of mitotic inhibition does not adequately represent a growth inhibitory response, clones were grown in the presence of 5 ng/ml TGF-β or GM-CSF and cell counts performed over a 1-week period (Fig. 2, B-D). Consistent with the thymidine incorporation data, GM-CSF significantly inhibited mitosis only in the heteromeric receptor expressing clones (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, the absence of any inhibitory response in the homomeric receptor expressing clones was not simply a reflection of a signaling anergy since treatment with TGF-β to activate endogenous TGF-β receptors similarly resulted in an 80–90% inhibition of growth (Fig. 2).Figure 3Regulation of matrix protein expression by chimeric receptors. Chimeric receptor expressing clones were transiently transfected with the 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid and cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase as described (18Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Normalized luciferase expression was determined following 24 h stimulation with 10% FBS/DMEM containing 10 ng/ml TGF-β2 (filled bars) or 10 ng/ml GM-CSF (stripped bars). Values are the mean (±S.E.) fold increase in luciferase activity (relative to 10% FBS/DMEM treated cells) of two independent clones assayed in duplicate from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous reports have suggested that different signaling pathways and receptor complexes are activated by TGF-β in Mv1Lu cells to stimulate extracellular matrix protein expression and regulate mitosis (26Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Amagasa T. Miyazono K. Takagi M. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2769-2775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine whether stable expression and activation of either type I/type I or type II/type II homomeric TGF-β receptors would effect plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene activity, the studies shown in Fig. 3 were performed. While TGF-β could stimulate luciferase activity through endogenous TGF-β receptors in all clones examined, chimeric receptor activation by GM-CSF could only occur following the formation of an heteromeric type I-type II TGF-βR complex. For instance, GM-CSF stimulated luciferase expression over 100-fold in the heteromeric receptor expressing clones, but <2-fold in clones expressing type I/type I or type II/type II homomeric TGF-β receptors. Thus, Figs. 2 and 3 document that homomeric type I or type II chimeric TGF-βR complexes are unable to signal in Mv1Lu epithelial cells. Our previous studies documented that in fibroblasts homomeric and heteromeric TGF-βR complexes similarly internalized bound ligand (17Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whether a similar endocytic response would be observed in epithelial cells where TGF-β acts as a growth inhibitor was unknown. To address that question, the internalization of labeled GM-CSF was determined over a 60-min, 37 °C, treatment in Mv1Lu epithelial cells expressing chimeric TGF-βR heteromers and homomers. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the mean endocytic rate constant, k e (defined as the probability of an occupied receptor being internalized in 1 min at 37 °C) (28Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of type I/type I and type II/type II receptor homomers were 0.025/min ± 0.002 and 0.030/min ± 0.001, respectively. However, unlike that observed in fibroblasts, heteromeric TGF-βR expressing epithelial cell clones showed both an increased level of ligand internalization and a mean k e (0.084/min ± 0.014) approximately 3-fold greater than that of the receptor homomers. The heteromeric receptor k e is similar to that previously described for the epidermal growth factor and growth hormone receptors (29Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Harding P.A. Wang X. Okada S. Chen W.Y. Wan W. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol.

Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results contrast to that seen in AKR-2B fibroblasts which show a heteromeric receptor k e of 0.050/min ± 0.004 and homomeric rates of 0.038 ± 0.001 (type I/type I) and 0.036 ± 0.005 (type II/type II) (Fig. 4 B). The finding of distinct responses following ligand binding to heteromeric and homomeric receptors suggests a TGF-β receptor subtype-specific trafficking mechanism in epithelial cells (relative to mesenchymal cells) for internalization. In general, the internalization of bound ligand is followed by a decrease in cell surface receptor binding referred to as receptor down-regulation. In that regard, our finding of distinct internalization rates for chimeric TGF-βR homomers and heteromers (Fig. 4) suggested the action of an initial sorting event(s) whereby heteromeric TGF-β receptors were more rapidly recognized and removed from the cell surface than receptor homomers. To determine the fate of these internalized receptors we performed the down-regulation assays shown in Fig. 5. As expected, the heteromeric type I/type II chimeric receptors were rapidly removed from the cell surface. Following a 2-h ligand treatment surface binding was reduced to 23% of initial levels. In contrast to this, cell surface receptor binding was only reduced to 46 and 70% of initial levels for type II and type I receptor homomers, respectively. Although there was no difference between any of the chimeric receptors within the first 10 min of treatment, by 60 min surface binding was significantly different between all chimeric receptor types. This difference in receptor down-regulation is consistent with the hypothesis that an endosomal sorting mechanism differentiates not only TGF-βR homomers from heteromers, but also between homomeric interactions of type I and type II TGF-βR complexes (Figs. 4 and 5). Studies in which single or multiple amino acids have been altered in the type I TGF-βR have attempted to determine regulatory sites within and in proximity to the GS domain (10Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 11Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Of particular interest was the finding that Ser-172 and Thr-176 were reported to separate matrix protein induction from cell cycle regulation in response to TGF-β (27Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Amagasa T. Miyazono K. Takagi M. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2769-2775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results indicated a potential role(s) for these sites in modulating initial membrane events. As such, we wished to determine whether Ser-172 or Thr-176 might have a regulatory role in TGF-βR trafficking. Heteromeric receptor expressing clones were generated containing a wild type type II TGF-βR and a type I TGF-βR mutated at Ser-172 (S172A series) or Thr-176 (T176V series). However, when screening clones of the S172A series prior to analyzing their endocytic activity, while FACS analysis showed no significant difference (data not shown), we noted a gradation in ligand-induced thymidine inhibition which correlated to specific 125I-ligand binding. To address this issue more thoroughly, we separated these clones into high (S172A-H; 5,000–10,000 cpm) and low (S172A-L; 1, 500–3,000 cpm) binding groups. Two representative clones were taken from each group for further study. Since the T176V series clones demonstrated no apparent differences in responses, three representative clones spa"

The fibrillar collagens are major structural proteins that largely define the size, shape, and strength of tissues in most complex organisms (1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H.

In addition, collagen fibrils are encountered in unusual biological situations such as the byssal threads whereby mussels adhere to solid surfaces (5Coyne K.J. Qin X.X. Waite J.H. Science. 1997; 277: 1830-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and in tube worms that live near deep sea hydrothermal vents (6Mann K. Gaill F. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Collagen fibrils are formed by the spontaneous self-assembly of collagen monomers (1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier, New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar, 2Prockop D.J. Hulmes D.J.S. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure.

Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The monomers of the major fibrillar collagens, types I, II and III, are very similar in structure in that they consist of 338 or 343 consecutive repeating tripeptide sequences of -Gly-Xxx-Yyy- tripeptide units. The -Xxx- position of the sequence is frequently proline and the -Yyy- position is frequently hydroxyproline. The tripeptide sequences with proline in the Xxx position and hydroxyproline in the Yyy position drive folding of the polypeptide chains into a unique triple-helical conformation of collagen. Other amino acids between the obligate glycine residues form hydrophobic or hydrophilic clusters on the surface of the molecules that direct the self-assembly of the proteins into stable fibrils. Because of the constraints conferred by the triple-helical conformation, the monomers of collagens are generally regarded as rigid rods. However, there are many indications that different regions of the collagen triple-helix vary in stability and undergo microunfolding in the physiological range of temperatures (7Privalov P.L. Adv.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most direct indications of regions of varying stability in the triple helix came from mutations that convert different obligate glycine codons to codons for amino acids with bulkier side chains and cause the brittleness of bones and other tissues characteristic of the heritable disease known as osteogenesis imperfecta (3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 18Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J.

For example, one mutation that converted the glycine codon at position 631 of the α1(I) chain to a codon for serine had no measurable effect on the thermal stability of type I collagen, whereas a similar mutation that converted the glycine codon at position 598 to a codon for serine markedly lowered the melting temperature of the protein (20Westerhausen A. Kishi J. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13995-14000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were recently obtained with synthetic peptides containing collagen sequences in that a serine substitution for glycine at α1–913 destabilized the triple helix more than a serine for glycine substitution in the same peptide at α1–901 (16Yang W. Battineni M.L. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6930-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We recently developed a cDNA cassette system to synthesize recombinant versions of procollagen II with deletions in one of the blocks of 234 amino acids that define the four repeating D periods of the collagen triple helix (21Arnold W.V Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Mechling D. Bächinger H.-P. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression of the deleted D period cassettes in a mammalian system provided modified procollagen II that was secreted and was triple helical. Here we have compared the thermal stabilities of the recombinant procollagens missing specific D periods. The results provide direct evidence that some regions of the monomer are rich in sequences that stabilize the triple helix and thereby provide clamps for folding and unfolding of the molecule. The results also demonstrate that deletion of the sequences of the D1 period allows the protein to assume an unusual temperature-sensitive conformation at 35 °C so that procollagen N-proteinase cleaves an otherwise resistant Gly-Ala bond in the D2 period of the α1(II) chain. Discrete regions of cDNAs for the pro-α1(II) chain of procollagen II were subcloned to generate seven cassettes that encoded (a) the N-propeptide and the N-telopeptide, (b) the D1 period, (c) the D2 period, (d) the D3 period, (e) the D4 period, (f) the D0.4 period at the C terminus of the triple helix, and (g) the C-telopeptide1 and the C-propeptide (21Arnold W.V Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Mechling D. Bächinger H.-P. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cassettes were amplified by the PCR using primers designed to introduce new restriction sites so that the cassettes could be assembled into a variety of different constructs (see Ref. 21Arnold W.V Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Mechling D. Bächinger H.-P. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The DNA cassettes were cloned into the bacterial strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cassettes were excised withHindIII and BsrBI and then used to assemble a series of DNA constructs that were inserted into the HindIII and EcoRV sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and a gene encoding neomycin resistance. The structures of all the junctions in the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HT-1080 cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL 121) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (22Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with one of the functional DNA constructs by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using a commercial kit (Profection Mammalian Transfection System Kit; Promega). Briefly, cells were split 18 h prior to transfection, grown to a density of approximately 106 cells in a 10-cm cell culture dish, and provided with fresh culture medium 3 h prior to transfection. Each DNA construct used for transfection was linearized by cleavage withPvuI. Approximately 12 μg of DNA was precipitated with calcium phosphate and incubated with the cells for approximately 17 h. Fresh culture medium was then applied. After the cells reached confluency, they were split 1 to 10. After 24 h, medium was added that contained G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at an active concentration of 400 μg/ml. The medium was exchanged with fresh selection medium every 48 h over a 12-day period. Isolated G418-resistant cell colonies were expanded in 6-, 12-, or 24-well plates (22Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon reaching confluency, cells were cultured for 24 h with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 41 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium saltn-hydrate (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and 0.5 μCi/ml uniformly 14C-labeled amino acid mixture (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). The medium was collected and proteins precipitated using 8000 M r polyethylene glycol (Sigma) at a concentration of 5% (w/v). Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, recovered in storage buffer (0.4m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 0.04% NaN3in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4), and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by electroblottings. The samples were assayed both with a phosphor storage plate (Storm System; Molecular Dynamics) for14C-labeled protein and by Western blotting. For Western blotting the primary antibody was a guinea pig anti-human antibody specific for the C-telopeptide region of procollagen II (kindly provided by Dr. Carmen Merryman, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The secondary antibody was goat anti-guinea pig antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Clones that secreted recombinant procollagen II were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Confluent cells from 10 175-cm2 cell culture flasks (22Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were expanded to four interconnected flasks (6000 cm2 each; Nunc Cell Factories; Nunc). When the cells reached approximately 80% confluency, the culture medium was removed and the cell layers were washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline. Labeling medium without fetal calf serum but containing 0.17 μCi/ml of a uniformly14C-labeled amino acid mixture (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) was added for 24 h, and then collected and exchanged with fresh labeling medium. After another 24 h, the second labeling medium was collected and replaced for another 24 h by medium that did not contain 14C-labeled amino acids. Following collection of the third medium, the cell layers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. The cells were then treated with the same cycle of three consecutive 24-h incubations of media to generate a total of six 24-h collections. The method of Fertala et al. (22Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Media harvested from each 24-h period was filtered through a 1.6-μm glass fiber filter (Millipore) and supplemented with stock solutions to provide the following final concentrations: 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, 0.4 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzamidine, and 0.04% NaN3. The medium was adjusted to pH 7.4. High molecular mass proteins were concentrated approximately 10-fold with filter cartridges with a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Prep/Scale TFF; Millipore). The proteins were precipitated overnight by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 to a final concentration of 175 mg/ml, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets from each 24-h collection were pooled and resuspended overnight in storage buffer (22Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and then dialyzed twice against 200 volumes of DEAE-cellulose column I buffer (2 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, and 0.04% NaN3 in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose anion-exchange column (2.6 × 15 cm) equilibrated and eluted with the DEAE-cellulose column I buffer. The elution profile was assayed by14C content in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). The flow-through fraction was collected and dialyzed against 200 volumes of DEAE-cellulose column II buffer (2 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.04% NaN3 in 0.075 mTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8). The sample was chromatographed on a second DEAE-cellulose column (2.6 × 15 cm) equilibrated and eluted with the DEAE-cellulose column II buffer. The flow-through fraction was collected and applied in the same buffer to a third anion-exchange column (1.6 × 5 cm; Q-Sepharose, Pharmacia). The column was washed with DEAE-cellulose column II buffer and the recombinant procollagen II was eluted with 0.4 m NaCl in the same buffer. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 200 volumes of storage buffer and stored at −80 °C. For further analysis by CD, the proteins were concentrated on a membrane filter (YM-100; Amicon) and the storage buffer was exchanged with storage buffer that did not contain EDTA. The amino acid compositions and protein concentrations of the purified procollagens was assayed on protein hydrolysates by the Wistar Protein Microchemistry Core Facility, Philadelphia, PA. All N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation was also performed by the same facility. Because expression of the −D0.4 period construct was not detectable by more rapid migration of the recombinant protein on electrophoretic gels, mRNA from cells expressing the construct was assayed by RT-PCR. Total mRNA was extracted from the cells with a selective resin (RNeasy; Qiagen), and the RNA was reverse transcribed with random primers (First Strand cDNA synthesis kit; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The cDNA for pro-α1(II) chains amplified by PCR with a primer pair spanning the codon for Ser at amino acid position 898 (numbered from the first Gly of the triple helix) to the codon for Trp at amino acid position 1,136 within the C-propeptide. The PCR products were separated on an agarose gel. To assay secretion of the protein, confluent clones expressing the FL and −D0.4 constructs were incubated in 12-well microtiter plates (5 cm2) for 24 h (22Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Proteins in the medium were precipitated with 5% polyethylene glycol. Samples were centrifuged at about 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and pellets were resuspended in 32 μl of storage buffer. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of buffer containing 1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 unit of aprotinin/ml (Sigma), and 3% β-mercaptoethanol in phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 7.4. The cell lysate and proteins precipitated from the media were analyzed by Western blot analysis with guinea pig anti-human collagen II antibodies and secondary antibodies of anti-guinea pig IgG/horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Bands were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham), and x-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham) at two different times of exposure. The film was assayed by densitometry (Personal Densitometer SI; Molecular Dynamics). To assay the protease resistance of procollagen lacking the D0.4 period, medium proteins were precipitated with 176 mg/ml ammonium sulfate from 10 175-cm2 flasks of confluent cells and resuspended in storage buffer (22Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The samples were preincubated at 25–43 °C, and then digested at the same temperature for 2 min with 250 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin and 100 μg/ml trypsin (27Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21232-21237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protease-resistant α1(II) chains were assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry of gel stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Sigma). Purified 14C-labeled novel procollagens II were used as substrates for procollagen N-proteinase and procollagen C-proteinase purified from chick embryo tendons (23Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hojima Y. McKenzie J.A. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay conditions were 27 μl containing approximately 1 μg of procollagen and either 2.2 units of N-proteinase or 1.0 unit of C-proteinase in 7 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.015% Brij, and 0.02% NaN3 in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5. One unit of each of these enzymes is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to cleave 1 μg of substrate in 1 h at 35 °C using the buffer conditions just stated. Unless otherwise noted, digestions were generally performed at 35 °C for 3 or 4 h. Products of the proteinase cleavage were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using a phosphor storage plate. CD was assayed in a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-500A) using thermostatted quartz cells with a path length of 0.05 cm as described by Davis and Bächinger (13Davis J.M. Bächinger H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25965-25972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The temperature of the sample was monitored by a thermistor and a digital thermometer (Omega Engineering, Inc.), and the temperature of the circulating water bath (Lauda RCS20D) was controlled by a temperature programmer (Lauda PM350). The CD spectrum of the sample was scanned from 180 to 260 nm. For melting experiments, the temperature of the sample was increased at a rate of 10 °C/h and the CD signal at 221 nm was monitored. The CD and temperature signals were recorded in the X-Y mode with an HP7090A measurement plotting system. The degree of conversion was calculated as described by Bruckneret al. (25Bruckner P. Bächinger H.-P. Timpl R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because the protein yields were too low for assays by CD, the thermal stability of the procollagen lacking the D0.4 period was assayed by brief digestion with chymotrypsin and trypsin (26Bächinger H.-P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21232-21237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A clone secreting the protein was incubated with14C-labeled amino acids, the medium proteins were protease digested, and the protease-resistant α1(II) chains were assayed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS followed by analysis with a phosphor storage plate analyzer (26Bächinger H.-P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21232-21237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cassettes of cDNA for the pro-α1(II) chain of type II procollagen were assembled (21Arnold W.V Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Mechling D. Bächinger H.-P. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) into six DNA constructs that coded for either full-length pro-α1(II) chains or pro-α1(II) chains lacking one of the four D periods (Fig. 1). The constructs were then used to prepare stably transfected clones of a mammalian cell line (HT-1080) that secreted the recombinant proteins. Screening the medium from the G418-resistant cells with antibodies to type II procollagen identified a few clones that secreted small amounts of FL molecules even though the constructs used for transfection coded for a truncated pro-α1(II) chain, apparently because a small subpopulation of HT-1080 cells expresses the endogenous COL2A1 gene. However, such clones were readily eliminated by the more rapid gel migration of pro-α1(II) chains with deletions of a complete D period (Fig. 1). Chromatographic separation of the medium proteins from the clones expressing the −D1, −D2, −D3, and −D4 constructs gave preparations that were homogeneous by SDS-gel electrophoresis and that had the expected amino acid composition except for lower values for glutamate and higher values for histidine and tyrosine (21Arnold W.V Sieron A.L.

The yields of secreted protein from the −D0.4 construct were too small to purify the recombinant protein. After digestion of the crude medium with trypsin and chymotrypsin, both α chains and two bands of degraded α chains were obtained (upper panel, Fig. 1). Similar bands of degradation products of α1(II) chains were previously obtained after protease digestion of recombinant collagen II (27Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

With procollagen lacking the D1 period, the temperature for 25, 50, and 75% of unfolding were 2 to 4 °C less than for the FL molecule (Table I).

Recombinant coupling factor 6 manifested the same effect as the purified substance, and prostacyclin synthesis inhibitory substance was verified as identical to coupling factor 6.Coupling factor 6 (25Knowles A.F. Guillory R.J. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2672-2679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is known to act inside the cell as an energy transducer in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase that consists of three domains, namely the extrinsic and intrinsic membrane domains, F1 and F0, respectively, joined by a stalk. F0 is the proton channel of the complex that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane, and the protons are conducted from F0 through the stalk to the catalytic sites in F1 composed of five kinds of polypeptides (26Boyer P.D.

Four subunits of the stalk have been identified and designated as follows: the oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein, coupling factor 6, and subunit b and d (28Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1971; 246: 2672-2679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coupling factor 6 is first synthesized as an immature form in the cytosol, then led to the mitochondria by an import signal peptide (32 amino acids) present in the upstream (31Higuti T. Tsurumi C. Kawamura Y. Tsujita H. Osaka F. Yoshihara Y. Tani I. Tanaka K. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and then becomes an active form by the enzymatic deletion of the signal peptide. In the present study, we discovered a novel function of this peptide, an inhibitory effect on prostacyclin synthesis. This effect was demonstrated when the peptide was administered from the outside of the cell. Therefore, after organ damage such as myocardial infarction and myocarditis, this peptide may exert its inhibitory effect on prostacyclin synthesis. The questions whether coupling factor 6, a mitochondrial integral peptide, reaches an appropriate site of action in normal conditions and how coupling factor 6 contributes to the regulation of prostacyclin production in SHR remain to be elucidated.It is of interest to speculate the site of action of coupling factor 6. Because this peptide attenuated the use of endogenous AA in prostacyclin synthesis without affecting the uses of exogenous AA and PGH2, its effect appeared to be focused on PLA2independently of cyclooxygenase and prostacyclin synthase. To confirm this issue, we directly measured the release of [3H]AA from the pre-labeled cells. The result demonstrated that coupling factor 6 suppresses base-line [3H]AA release in HUVEC and blocks the bradykinin-induced increase in [3H]AA release, strongly suggesting that AA release from the plasma membrane is a target of this peptide. The complete blockade of the bradykinin-induced increase in AA release by coupling factor 6 may be overestimated by its suppressant effect on base-line AA release.Based on biochemical properties and structural features, the PLA2 superfamily, in which nine different PLA2groups have been identified to date (32Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), can be subdivided into three main types, i.e. Ca2+-dependent secretory enzymes (sPLA2), Ca2+-dependent cytosolic enzymes (cPLA2), and Ca2+-independent cytosolic enzymes (iPLA2). Although PLA2 inhibitors currently available are not necessarily isoform-specific, the combined use of each inhibitor may allow us to examine the specific function of each PLA2 isoform in vitro. AACOCF3(cPLA2 inhibitor) exhibits 500-fold greater potency to cPLA2 than to sPLA2 (33Riendeau D. Guay J. Weech P.K. Laliberte J. Yergey L. Li C. Desmarais S. Perrier H. Liu S. Nicoll-Griffith D.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). BEL (iPLA2 inhibitor) manifests greater than 1000-fold selectivity for iPLA2 than for sPLA2 and cPLA2 (36Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, BEL has been found to block Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, a key enzyme in cellular phospholipid metabolism (38Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Base-line and bradykinin-induced AA releases were both suppressed by AACOCF3 but not by OPC (sPLA2 inhibitor) and BEL, suggesting that cPLA2 contributes to AA release under these conditions. Coupling factor 6 suppressed base-line and bradykinin-induced AA releases, and the simultaneous administration of AACOCF3 and coupling factor 6 had no additive effect to that by AACOCF3, suggesting that coupling factor 6 inhibits AA release from the plasma membrane via suppression of cPLA2 activity.A distinct difference in the responsiveness to coupling factor 6 was clearly observed between endothelial cells and platelets. We demonstrated that the acting site of coupling factor 6 was AA release from the plasma membrane and not prostacyclin synthase. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that this peptide may inhibit thromboxane A2 synthesis in platelets and suppress aggregation of platelets. However, pretreatment of platelets with coupling factor 6 had no influence on the maximum value of platelet aggregation. This lack of effect suggests that coupling factor 6 may exert an AA release-inhibitory effect with cell specificity. Thus, the major PG suppressed by coupling factor 6 is prostacyclin. The mechanism for the cell specificity of the suppressant effect of coupling factor 6 is unknown. However, if coupling factor 6 indirectly inhibits cPLA2 via mediators such as receptors, one possible reason may be the presence or absence of its mediator(s) in the cell.Because prostacyclin receptor is expressed in many tissues such as aorta, lung, atrium, ventricle, and kidney (20Osanai T. Kanazawa T. Kamada T. Okuguchi T. Kosugi T. Mio Y. Imaoka Y. Metoki H. Oike Y. Onodera K. Hypertens. Res. 1994; 17: 227-232Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and because PG transporter (12Kanai N. Lu R. Satria J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) does not mediate the vascular clearance of prostacyclin, the endogenous prostacyclin synthesis inhibitory peptide may have inhibitory effects against widespread biological actions of prostacyclin. This peptide also may counteract a biological action of AA such as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ current, because a major acting site of coupling factor 6 is the inhibition of AA release from the plasma membrane. Further investigations, especially on the in vivo effects of exogenous coupling factor 6, will be required to establish the effect and role of this peptide.

Four subunits of the stalk have been identified and designated as follows: the oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein, coupling factor 6, and subunit b and d (28Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1971; 246: 2672-2679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coupling factor 6 is first synthesized as an immature form in the cytosol, then led to the mitochondria by an import signal peptide (32 amino acids) present in the upstream (31Higuti T. Tsurumi C.

Commun. 1991; 178: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and then becomes an active form by the enzymatic deletion of the signal peptide. In the present study, we discovered a novel function of this peptide, an inhibitory effect on prostacyclin synthesis. This effect was demonstrated when the peptide was administered from the outside of the cell. Therefore, after organ damage such as myocardial infarction and myocarditis, this peptide may exert its inhibitory effect on prostacyclin synthesis. The questions whether coupling factor 6, a mitochondrial integral peptide, reaches an appropriate site of action in normal conditions and how coupling factor 6 contributes to the regulation of prostacyclin production in SHR remain to be elucidated.It is of interest to speculate the site of action of coupling factor 6. Because this peptide attenuated the use of endogenous AA in prostacyclin synthesis without affecting the uses of exogenous AA and PGH2, its effect appeared to be focused on PLA2independently of cyclooxygenase and prostacyclin synthase. To confirm this issue, we directly measured the release of [3H]AA from the pre-labeled cells. The result demonstrated that coupling factor 6 suppresses base-line [3H]AA release in HUVEC and blocks the bradykinin-induced increase in [3H]AA release, strongly suggesting that AA release from the plasma membrane is a target of this peptide. The complete blockade of the bradykinin-induced increase in AA release by coupling factor 6 may be overestimated by its suppressant effect on base-line AA release.Based on biochemical properties and structural features, the PLA2 superfamily, in which nine different PLA2groups have been identified to date (32Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), can be subdivided into three main types, i.e. Ca2+-dependent secretory enzymes (sPLA2), Ca2+-dependent cytosolic enzymes (cPLA2), and Ca2+-independent cytosolic enzymes (iPLA2). Although PLA2 inhibitors currently available are not necessarily isoform-specific, the combined use of each inhibitor may allow us to examine the specific function of each PLA2 isoform in vitro. AACOCF3(cPLA2 inhibitor) exhibits 500-fold greater potency to cPLA2 than to sPLA2 (33Riendeau D. Guay J. Weech P.K. Laliberte J. Yergey L. Li C. Desmarais S. Perrier H. Liu S. Nicoll-Griffith D.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). BEL (iPLA2 inhibitor) manifests greater than 1000-fold selectivity for iPLA2 than for sPLA2 and cPLA2 (36Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

However, BEL has been found to block Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, a key enzyme in cellular phospholipid metabolism (38Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Base-line and bradykinin-induced AA releases were both suppressed by AACOCF3 but not by OPC (sPLA2 inhibitor) and BEL, suggesting that cPLA2 contributes to AA release under these conditions. Coupling factor 6 suppressed base-line and bradykinin-induced AA releases, and the simultaneous administration of AACOCF3 and coupling factor 6 had no additive effect to that by AACOCF3, suggesting that coupling factor 6 inhibits AA release from the plasma membrane via suppression of cPLA2 activity.A distinct difference in the responsiveness to coupling factor 6 was clearly observed between endothelial cells and platelets. We demonstrated that the acting site of coupling factor 6 was AA release from the plasma membrane and not prostacyclin synthase. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that this peptide may inhibit thromboxane A2 synthesis in platelets and suppress aggregation of platelets. However, pretreatment of platelets with coupling factor 6 had no influence on the maximum value of platelet aggregation. This lack of effect suggests that coupling factor 6 may exert an AA release-inhibitory effect with cell specificity. Thus, the major PG suppressed by coupling factor 6 is prostacyclin. The mechanism for the cell specificity of the suppressant effect of coupling factor 6 is unknown. However, if coupling factor 6 indirectly inhibits cPLA2 via mediators such as receptors, one possible reason may be the presence or absence of its mediator(s) in the cell.Because prostacyclin receptor is expressed in many tissues such as aorta, lung, atrium, ventricle, and kidney (20Osanai T.

Lu R. Satria J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) does not mediate the vascular clearance of prostacyclin, the endogenous prostacyclin synthesis inhibitory peptide may have inhibitory effects against widespread biological actions of prostacyclin. This peptide also may counteract a biological action of AA such as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ current, because a major acting site of coupling factor 6 is the inhibition of AA release from the plasma membrane. Further investigations, especially on the in vivo effects of exogenous coupling factor 6, will be required to establish the effect and role of this peptide. In the present study, a prostacyclin synthesis inhibitory substance was purified from the heart of SHR, and its structure was determined. It was a 76-amino acid peptide, and the sequence from the N terminus to the 40th amino acid was completely identical to the known peptide designated coupling factor 6. Further analysis of fragment peptides cleaved by AspN revealed that the amino acid sequences of the initial four fragments were identical to the 1–39th sequences and the other four to the 40–55th, the 56–64th, the 65–71st, and the 72–76th sequences of rat coupling factor 6. Thus, the purified peptide was completely identical to rat coupling factor 6. Then, we reconstructed rat coupling factor 6 using a cleavable fusion protein strategy and confirmed the effect of this recombinant peptide on prostacyclin synthesis. Recombinant coupling factor 6 manifested the same effect as the purified substance, and prostacyclin synthesis inhibitory substance was verified as identical to coupling factor 6.

Transfections of reporter gene constructs into cultured cells have been widely used to delimit the promoter regions required for tissue-specific expression of myeloid genes. These experiments have shown that the transcriptional control elements of these genes are clustered within the promoter proximal region of the genes. For example, the first 92 bp of the CD11b promoter are sufficient to restrict the expression of reporter gene constructs to myeloid cells, at least in vitro (22Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.E. Chen H.M. Galson D.L. Maki R.A. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5014-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for the genes encoding the membrane glycoprotein CD14 and for several genes encoding myeloid-specific receptors, like the granulocyte-macrophage colony forming factor receptor or for the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (see Ref. 23Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). Moreover, several myeloid-specific genes do contain multiple start sites of transcription due to the lack of a TATA box or defined initiator sequences within their promoter region. In most of these genes, binding sites for either myeloid-specific (like PU.1) or ubiquitous (Sp1) transcription factors or a combination of both are found in close proximity to the major transcriptional start site. Through interaction with additional factors of the basal transcriptional machinery (i.e. TATA-binding protein), these proteins contribute alone or in combination with other factors to the cell specific expression of myeloid genes (see Ref. 23Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). In this paper we report the functional analysis of the HCKpromoter region. We show that the activity of the HCKpromoter depends on sequence elements located in direct vicinity of the transcriptional start site. Moreover, site-specific mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the transcription factor Sp1 is essential for the myeloid-specific expression of theHCK gene. A human genomic DNA library constructed in bacteriophage λFIX II™ (Stratagene) was screened with an oligonucleotide (CGCTCAAGCTGCGAGGATCCGGGCTGCCCGCGAGACG) derived from the first exon of the HCK gene (nucleotides 95 to 132 of the sequence published by N.

Three clones containing HCK sequences were identified.

All further reporter gene constructs were generated after cleavage of p(−4954)CAT with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloning into pCAT-Basic using standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction based strategies. For mutations within the distal GC-rich element (−58 to −51), a 126-bp DNA fragment was amplified from plasmid p(−101)CAT with the primers HCKM1 (CAGCTCGGGAGCACATCAGAGGCTTAGACTAGAGTGGGAAGG) and HCKCATu (CAGATCCTCTAGAACTAGAGGCG). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. An AvaI/XbaI DNA fragment derived from this construct was isolated and used to replace a similar DNA fragment in p(−101)CAT, thereby generating the HCK reporter gene mutant p(−101) M1 CAT. Mutations in the proximal GC-rich box were carried out by using a similar strategy. A 127-bp DNA fragment containing the GC-proximal box was amplified with primers HCKM2 (CTTTCTAGAACTAGAGGCGGGGCGACGCTTAGAGGGGCTTTGGTTAATGCATTATTACTCGTGGTGCTGTCTGAG) and HCK 243d (GTCCCAGTCCGGGAGCACATCAG), cloned into pGEM-T vector and sequenced. The HCK mutant reporter gene construct p(−101) M2 CAT was generated as described before for p(−101) M1 CAT. RAW264, a murine leukemic cell line with monocyte-macrophage characteristics (25Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Cell. 1978; 15: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), was obtained from European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, Salisbury, United Kingdom) and cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The murine embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 (26Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum.Drosophila Schneider cells (27Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by G. Suske (University of Marburg), were cultivated in Schneider medium with 10% heat inactivated insect cell qualified fetal bovine serum. U-937 (28Sundström C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar) and HUT-78 (29Popovic M. Read Connole E. Gallo R.C. Lancet. 1984; 2: 1472-1473Abstract PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 or 15% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Drosophila Schneider cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation exactly as described (30Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) with 20 μg of reporter plasmid/25 cm2 flask. DNA mixtures for transfection of mammalian cells contained 5 μg of control plasmid (RSV-LacZ) and equal molar amounts of reporter gene constructs (10 to 20 μg). The mixture was completed to 25 μg of DNA with pUC18. NIH3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a total of 25 μg of plasmid DNA mixture/25 cm2 flask. U-937 and HUT-78 were transfected by electroporation. 4 × 106 cells were resuspended in 375 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), mixed with a total of 25 μg of plasmid DNA and subjected to the electrical pulse (960 microfarads, 250 V). Transiently transfected cultures were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. β-Galactosidase activity in each mammalian cell extract was used to standardize CAT values to compensate for variability in transfection efficiency between samples and measured by an adaption of established methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for the use in a microplate reader. In brief, 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μl of extract, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 45 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 13,3 mm o-nitrophenole-β-d-galactopyranoside was incubated 30 min at 37 °C in a 96-well plate. The reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 1 mNa2CO3 and absorption was measured at 420 nm in a microplate reader (SpectraMAX 340, Molecular Devices). CAT assays were performed as described by Seed and Sheen (31Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in the assay were adjusted according to transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Gorski et al. (32Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 109 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g. Cells were suspended in 30 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml antipain, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), grinded in a Dounce homogenizer and layerd on top of 10 ml homogenization buffer in a SW27 Beckmann tube. After sedimentation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 2 °C in a SW27 rotor nuclear pellets were suspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors, homogenized, and if necessary diluted to 10 A 260 units/ml. Nuclear proteins were extracted by adding 0.1 volume of 4 m(NH4)2SO4 slowly over a 30-min period. The suspension was cleared by centrifugation (123,000 ×g, 0 °C, 60 min). Proteins were precipitated by addition of 0.3 g of (NH4)2SO4/ml and subsequent centrifugation at 123,000 × g for 30 min at 0 °C in a swing-out rotor. The protein pellet was suspended in dialysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 40 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and dialyzed two times for 2 h each against the same buffer. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation and the clear supernatants kept frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in shifting buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mmEDTA, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 17.5% glycerol) in a total volume of 20 μl. Whenever indicated, reaction mixture was supplemented with competing oligonucleotides. After 15 min, 1.25 fmol of a 32P-labeled DNA fragment (10,000 to 20,000 cpm) was added to the incubation mixture. After 30 min on ice, the reaction mixture was loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA and separated at 200 V at room temperature. For supershift studies, 2 μg of monoclonal Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added 15 min after addition of the probe to a standard binding reaction and incubation was carried out for additional 30 min at room temperature. To identify regions responsible for the cell-type specific expression of the HCK gene, we cloned human genomic sequences preceding the first exon of the human HCK gene. For this, a λFix II™ genomic library (Stratagene) was screened with an oligonucleotide derived from the first exon of the HCK gene (18Lichtenberg U. Quintrell N. Bishop J.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 849-858PubMed Google Scholar). Three clones spanning a total of 22.5 kilobase pairs of DNA were identified. Restriction mapping of the DNA inserts showed that two of the three phages (λHCK3, λHCK5) contained identical inserts (results not shown). A 5-kilobase DNA fragment, spanning the first 36 nucleotides of exon 1 and upstream sequences, was isolated from λHCK3 by partial XbaI restriction enzyme digestion and cloned into the XbaI restriction site in plasmid pCAT-Basic to generate p(−4954)CAT. A series of reporter gene constructs containing successive 5′-3′ deletions within theHCK promoter region were derived from p(−4954)CAT by restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 1 A). The reporter gene constructs were transfected into the HCK positive murine monocytoid cell line RAW264 (25Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Cell. 1978; 15: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) as well as into the HCK negative cell lines HUT-78 (29Popovic M. Read Connole E. Gallo R.C. Lancet. 1984; 2: 1472-1473Abstract PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and NIH3T3 (26Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection of an RSV-LacZ plasmid. A basal level of activity was observed in RAW 264 cells transfected with constructs containing HCK promoter sequences up to position −36 (1.6-fold above background), while extension of the flanking sequence up to position −101 enhanced the relative promoter activity by 8.6-fold (Fig. 1 B). Constructs containing promoter sequences up to position −422 showed similar CAT activities. However, the inclusion of further upstream sequences (up to position −813) caused a dramatic decrease in promoter activity (1.3-fold above background). The addition of sequences up to 3.6-kilobase did not lead to an increase in CAT expression. Promoter activity was partially restored by inclusion of sequences up to position −4954. None of these constructs showed any significant activity in the non-myeloid cell lines HUT-78 and NIH3T3 (Fig. 1 B). The lack of HCK-driven CAT activity in these cells was not due to low transfection efficiencies, since the relative CAT activity of a CMVtk-CAT reporter gene construct in NIH3T3 cells was 70 to 320% (mean 160%,n = 4) and in HUT-78 cells 70 to 80% of that observed in RAW 264 cells (results not shown). Within the first 101-bp 5′-flanking region two GC-rich sequences resembling binding sites for the Sp1 family of transcription factors were identified by sequence homology analysis (Fig. 2 A). The distal sequence GAGGCGAG between base pairs −58 and −51 and the proximal sequence CGCCCGCGGC between base pairs −16 and −7 both fits to known Sp1 consensus binding sites (33Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 34Thiesen H.J. Bach C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3203-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the role of these elements in the differential expression of the HCK gene, a site-directed mutagenesis of the GC boxes was performed. Within the distal site, the three central nucleotides were mutated (GAGGCGAG to GACTAGAG), since mutation of similar nucleotides in GC-rich regions has been shown to abolish transcription factor binding and transcriptional activation by members of the Sp1 family (35Chen H.M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a reporter plasmid was constructed where the proximal GC-rich sequences was mutated to TAATGCATTA (Fig. 2 A). Reporter gene constructs containing wild type or mutations in either of the GC boxes were analyzed by transient transfection into the monocytoid cell line RAW264. As shown in Fig. 2 B, mutations in either of the GC boxes severely reduced promoter activity. The wild type activity was reduced 5.3-fold by mutations within the distal GC box, while a larger decrease in promoter activity (8.4-fold) was observed in constructs containing alterations within the proximal GC box. None of mutant promoter constructs showed CAT activity above background levels in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 B). Since the GC boxes in the promoter region of the humanHCK gene are essential for promoter function, we looked for binding of nuclear proteins to HCK-derived fragments by EMSA. A DNA fragment spanning the distal GC-box (from −77 to −10;HCK F1 in Fig. 3 A) was used to probe nuclear extracts derived either from: (i) RAW 264 cells, (ii) the human promonocytic cell line U-937 (28Sundström C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar), or (iii) U937 cells after 12-O-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were used as a negative control. Two distinct bands, designated D1 and D3, were visible upon incubation of the HCK fragment F1 with nuclear extracts derived from U-937 cells (Fig. 3 B). The interaction between U-937 nuclear proteins and the HCK F1 fragment could be competed with either a 100-fold molar excess of a tetramerized Sp1-binding site (36Grez M. Zörnig M. Nowock J. Ziegler M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled F1 fragment (Fig. 3 B), suggesting the involvement of Sp1 or closely related proteins in these interactions. In contrast, no competition was observed upon preincubation of nuclear extracts with two oligonucleotides containing either a wild type or a mutated PU.1-binding site derived from the SV40 promoter (37Petterson M. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar complexes were observed when the F1 fragment was incubated with nuclear extracts obtained either from phorbol ester-induced U-937 cells or from the murine macrophage cell line RAW264 (Fig. 3 C). To delimit the promoter region involved in protein-DNA interaction more precisely, a 22-bp oligonucleotide (F3) centered at the distal GC box (positions −66 to −44) was synthesized and used as a probe in EMSA experiments. Similarly, an oligonucleotide containing a disrupted distal box (GACTAGAG; F3-M1) was used as a control. Complexes D1 and D3 were clearly visible when F3 was incubated with nuclear extracts derived from U937 cells (Fig. 3 D). The complex was competed with a 100-fold molar excess of the Sp1 tetramer or with a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled probe fragment, but not by a 100-fold molar excess of F3-M1, clearly showing that the mutated nucleotides are essential for binding. Similarly to the observations made with the F1 fragment, no competition was observed with an excess of oligonucleotides containing either a wild type or a mutated PU.1-binding site. Three protein-DNA complexes were observed with nuclear extracts derived from HeLa cells (Fig. 3 B). Two of them, D1 and D3, showed identical migration characteristics as the bands previously described. A novel HeLa specific band, designated D2, appeared between complexes D1 and D3. Addition of a 100-fold molar excess of a Sp1 tetramer competes all three bands, albeit with different efficiencies. While complexes D1 and D3 were competed with equal efficiencies, complex D2 was still visible in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of Sp1 tetramer (Fig. 3 B). All complexes were equally competed with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled F1-fragment, while no competition was observed with SV40 PU.1-wt or SV40 PU.1-M1 derived oligonucleotides. Protein binding to the proximal GC-rich element within theHCK promoter was analyzed in similar experiments. A fragment from −44 to +3 (HCK F2), centered at the GC box proximal to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 4 A), was used as probe for EMSA. When extracts from U-937 cells were used, two protein-DNA complexes were detected (P1 and P3 in Fig. 4 B). Binding to the F2 fragment was competed with an 100-fold molar excess of the tetramerized Sp1-binding site as well as with an 100-fold excess of the unlabeled probe. No competition was observed with the SV40-PU.1 wt and SV40-PU.1 M1 oligonucleotides. Similarly binding analysis of HeLa nuclear extracts with fragment HCK F2 as a probe revealed again two bands (P1 and P3) displaying identical migration characteristics as the complexes obtained with the U-937 extracts. However, an additional HeLa specific DNA-protein complex (P2) appeared between P1 and P3. Again protein binding to the labeled DNA was competed by Sp1-binding sites and by the unlabeled probe at 100-fold molar excess, but not by an 100-fold excess of unrelated oligonucleotides. Similar results were obtained with nuclear extracts prepared from U-937 cells induced with 160 nm12-O-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 24 h and from RAW264 cells (Fig. 4 C). Binding of nuclear factors to the F2-oligonucleotide was not competed by a mutated F2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4D), indicating that the GC box within the F2 oligonucleotide is essential for binding activity. During the course of the competition experiments we realized that the factor(s) involved in complexes P1 and P2 on the F2 oligonucleotide were competed differentially with the wt-F2 oligonucleotide or the Sp1 tetramer. To verify this, a32P-labeled HCK F2 oligonucleotide was incubated with either U-937 or HeLa nuclear extracts in the presence of increasing molar amounts of the HCK F2-wt oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 A) or the Sp1 tetramer (Fig. 5 B). While complex P2 was efficiently competed with a 75-fold molar excess of unlabeled F2-wt oligonucleotide, complex P1 was not fully competed even at a 125-fold molar excess of F2-wt (Fig. 5 A). A densitometic analysis of the EMSA bands showed that the ratio between the intensities of bands P1 and P3 remained constant, while the ratio P1/P2 increased constantly (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the factor(s) involved in complex P2 have higher binding affinity for the F2 oligonucleotide than the factor(s) involved in complex P1. In contrast, complex P1 was effectively competed by a 15-fold molar excess of the Sp1 tetramer, while complex P2 was not fully competed even at a 125-fold molar excess of Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 5 B), indicating a much lower affinity of the protein(s) forming complex P2 to a consensus Sp1 site than to theHCK sequence. Sequence comparison and EMSA competition experiments suggested that both GC-rich elements within the HCK promoter are targets for the Sp1 family of transcription factors. To prove this, nuclear extracts prepared from U-937 or HeLa cells were incubated with the F1 DNA fragment in the presence of 2 μg of a specific Sp1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In the presence of the antibody an additional complex with slower migrating properties was evident in the EMSA gel (denoted SS in Fig. 6 A), with a simultaneous decrease in the intensity of the D1 complex. At higher resolution it was evident that the complex D1 consisted of two bands migrating closely together and that only the faster migrating band within complex D1 (D1b) was shifted by the anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 6 B). The nature of the remaining complexes D1a, D3, and the HeLa specific complex D2 remains unknown. Similar observations were made when the oligonucleotide F2 was used as probe in the EMSA reaction (Fig. 6 C). To investigate dir"
https://openalex.org/W2039645405,"Nuclear factor 1 (NF1) has been reported to be a transcriptional activator for some genes and a transcriptional silencer for others. Here we report that in Hep3B cells, cotransfection of NF1/L, NF1/Red1, or NF1/X with the α1B adrenergic receptor (α1BAR) gene middle (P2) promoter increases P2 activity to more or less the same degree, whereas in DDT1MF-2 cells cotransfection of NF1/L or NF1/Red1 causes a small but statistically significant decrease in the P2 promoter activity, and NF1/X causes a greater, 70% inhibition. Further experiments using truncated NF1/X mutants indicate that NF1/X contains both positive and negative regulatory domains. The positive domain, located between amino acids 416 and 505, is active in Hep3B cells, whereas the negative domain, located between amino acids 243 and 416, is active in DDT1 MF-2 cells. These functional domains are also capable of regulating transcription when isolated from their natural context and fused into the GAL4 binding domain. Furthermore, NF1 affinity purified from rat liver nuclear extracts copurified with a non-DNA binding protein, which can bind to the P2 promoter of the α1BAR gene via interacting with NF1. Taken together, these findings indicate that NF1/X contains both activation and suppression domains that may be recognized and modulated by cell type-specific cofactors. This may be one of the mechanisms whereby NF1 can activate or suppress the expression of different genes, and it may also underlie the tissue-specific regulation of the α1BAR gene.

The α1B adrenergic receptor (α1BAR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an important role in the acute control of cardiovascular homeostasis and metabolic processes in the liver and is also involved in promoting cell proliferation in various tissues (1Graham R.M. Perez D.M. Hwa J. Piascik M. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Expression of the α1BAR gene is regulated by hormonal and developmental factors in a tissue-specific manner, as exemplified in hypothyroidism, which increases the level of α1BAR mRNA in the rat heart but decreases it in the rat liver (2Lazar-Wesley E. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Kunos G. Ishac E.J.N. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1116-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, high cell density prevents the decline in α1BAR expression observed at low cell densities (3Kajiyama Y. Ui M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas in primary cultures of myocardiocytes, increasing cell density decreases α1BAR expression (4Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for such complex regulation, we cloned the rat α1BAR gene and identified the multiple promoters and cis-acting elements in its regulatory domain (5Gao B.

Here we report that NF1 activates the transcription of the α1BAR gene in Hep3B cells and in primary rat hepatocytes but inhibits it in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells.

The results further indicate that NF1/X contains both positive and negative regulatory domains, which remain functional when isolated from their natural context and which display cell type-specific activity. We also provided evidence for the presence in rat liver of a non-DNA binding protein interacting with NF1.DISCUSSIONIn the present paper we provide the first published example of a transcription factor, NF1, acting as either a positive or a negative regulator of the same gene in a cell-specific manner. NF1 activated the transcription of the α1BAR gene through its dominant P2 promoter in Hep3B cells and in primary rat hepatocytes but inhibited it in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. Further studies indicated that NF1/X contained both positive and negative regulatory domains. The positive domain, which is located between aa 416 and 505, is active in Hep3B cells, whereas the negative domain, located between aa 243 and 416, is active in DDT1 MF-2 cells. These domains are also functional when isolated from their natural context. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the presence in rat liver of a non-DNA binding protein interacting with NF1. This suggests that the cell type-specific positive and negative transcriptional control by NF1 may be due to modulation of its activity by cell type-specific cofactors. These findings may also help us to understand the molecular basis for NF1 acting either as a transcriptional silencer or as an activator for different genes.Transcriptional activation by NF1 is mediated by a proline-rich activator region in its C-terminal domain, which enhances transcription through direct interactions with TFIIB and requires a CTD-like sequence (SPTSPSY) (30Wendler W. Altmann H. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2601-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been also reported that transcriptional activation by NF1/CTF1 is mediated by a bipartite low-proline domain (34Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NF1/X protein does not contain a proline-rich region, and the present data demonstrated that its transcriptional activation domain is located between aa 416 and 505. Furthermore, this domain was functionally active in Hep3B but not in DDT1 MF-2 cells. How this region activates gene transcription remains unknown.The mechanisms by which NF1 can repress gene transcription also remain unknown. Several possibilities have been proposed: 1) In reverse-oriented transcription from the inverted terminal repeat of human type 5 adenovirus, NF1 is believed to exert its negative role by stoichometrically interfering with the binding of a TATA box binding protein, therefore preventing transcription from that site (35Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Yamanaka K. Hanaoka F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 2) A switch from activation to repression by NF1 might simply result from the differences in the linear organization of the surrounding target sequences (36Roy R.J. Guerin S.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). 3) Subtle variations in the nucleotide sequence of the NF1 binding site might represent another mechanism by which the cell can switch a particular NF1 isoform from a positive to a negative transcriptional regulator (37Sakai D.D. Helms S. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Rottman F.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), as has been shown for other transcription factors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor, where the presence of an adenine at position 12 in the consensus glucocorticoid response element is the likely cause for a switch from positive to negative transcriptional regulation (37Sakai D.D. Helms S. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Rottman F.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). 4) It has been also proposed that the C terminus of NF1 may be involved in protein-protein interactions (13Gil G. Smith J.R. Goldstein J. Slaughter C.A. Orth K. Brown M.S. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8963-8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), by analogy to a similar mechanism in the case of the negative regulator element of the peripherin gene (18Adams A.D. Choate D.M. Thompson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6975-6983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, there is no published information on any specific domain of NF1 that might be involved in transcriptional repression. The present data demonstrate that NF1/X contains a transcriptional repression domain located between aa 243 and 416, which is active in DDT1 MF-2 cells but not in Hep3B cells.Why does NF1 act as a positive regulator of α1BAR gene transcription in Hep3B cells, but as a negative regulator in DDT1 MF-2 cells? It is widely accepted that NF1 regulates transcription via its C-terminal region, which recognizes other components of the transcription machinery. There is increasing evidence to show that NF1 can interact with many proteins, such as histone H3 (24Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli E. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the Ski oncoprotein (25Tarapore P. Richmond C. Zheng G. Cohen S. Kelder B. Kopchick J. Kruse U. Sipple A. Colmenares C.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5228-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell type-specific positive and negative transcriptional regulation by NF1/X may be due to the presence of a positive cofactor(s) that binds NF1/X region aa 416 and 505 to activate gene transcription in Hep3B cells and due to the presence of a negative cofactor(s) that binds NF1/X region aa 243 and 416 to repress gene transcription. Indeed, the data from the affinity purification of NF1 suggested that liver nuclear extracts contain a non-DNA binding protein that may bind to NF1 and thus interacts indirectly with the P2 promoter of rat α1BAR gene. Whether HepG2 cells and DDT1 MF-2 cells also contain such cofactors interacting with NF1 requires further studies. In future studies, these cofactors could be identified by using the yeast two-hybrid system or by affinity chromatography using purified NF1 derivatives as immobilized ligands. The α1B adrenergic receptor (α1BAR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an important role in the acute control of cardiovascular homeostasis and metabolic processes in the liver and is also involved in promoting cell proliferation in various tissues (1Graham R.M. Perez D.M. Hwa J. Piascik M. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Expression of the α1BAR gene is regulated by hormonal and developmental factors in a tissue-specific manner, as exemplified in hypothyroidism, which increases the level of α1BAR mRNA in the rat heart but decreases it in the rat liver (2Lazar-Wesley E. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Kunos G. Ishac E.J.N. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1116-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, high cell density prevents the decline in α1BAR expression observed at low cell densities (3Kajiyama Y. Ui M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas in primary cultures of myocardiocytes, increasing cell density decreases α1BAR expression (4Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for such complex regulation, we cloned the rat α1BAR gene and identified the multiple promoters and cis-acting elements in its regulatory domain (5Gao B. Kunos G. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Gao B. Kunos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15762-15767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gao B. Spector M. Kunos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5614-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments we have found that the dominant P2 promoter interacts with multiple transcription factors including NF1,1 CP1, AP2, and CREB (8Gao B. Jiang L. Kunos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5997-6008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen J. Spector M.S. Kunos G. Gao B. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Further data showed that NF1 and Sp1 are the major transcription factors involved in controlling the P2 promoter in liver and in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells, respectively (9Chen J. Spector M.S. Kunos G. Gao B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23144-23150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NF1 represents a family of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins that bind to the TGGN7CCA consensus sequence (11Nagata K. Guggenheimer R.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6177-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). NF1 has been reported to act as a transcriptional silencer for some genes, such as the genes encoding retinol-binding protein (12Colantuoni V. Pirrozi A. Blance C. Cortese R.

Whether HepG2 cells and DDT1 MF-2 cells also contain such cofactors interacting with NF1 requires further studies. In future studies, these cofactors could be identified by using the yeast two-hybrid system or by affinity chromatography using purified NF1 derivatives as immobilized ligands. We thank Dr. Y.

https://openalex.org/W2033178625,"One of the critical cleavage events that generates Alzheimer's amyloid Aβ peptide occurs within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is carried out by a poorly understood enzyme activity known as γ-secretase. To investigate this processing, a probe molecule, H26–57C, was constructed containing the TMD of APP flanked immediately on each side by unique epitope tags. H26–57C-transfected cells secrete a ∼2.9-kDa fragment, indicating that the lumenal and cytosolic domains of APP are not required for γ-secretase processing. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the probe turns over with a half-life of 8 min. No degradation intermediates are detected during the chase period, indicating that TMD turnover is a highly processive mechanism. The protease inhibitors, ALLN and MG132, cause a dramatic (50-fold) increase in the steady-state amount of the probe. All of the inhibitors that prevent degradation of the probe in the rough endoplasmic reticulum increase the amount of the ∼2.9-kDa fragment that is secreted into the media and also causes a similar increase the secretion of 4 kDa Aβ from APP-transfected cells. These results indicate that the system responsible for the degradation of the probe in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the intramembrane cleavage by γ-secretase that produces soluble, secreted Aβ are distinct and opposing processes.

Intracellular protein degradation is an integral part of cellular homeostasis that regulates the level of normal proteins and removes abnormal proteins from the cell. Newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 folded, assembled, and transported to a cellular destination, secreted from the cell (1Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Incorrectly folded proteins, unassembled subunits of multisubunit complexes, and mutated proteins are rapidly eliminated from the cell, often in the ER by a process referred to as quality control. Examples of transmembrane proteins degraded in the ER due to this process include the asialoglycoprotein receptor subunit H2a, the T cell receptor α subunit, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, respectively (2Ward C.L.

Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Normal proteins may also be degraded in the ER and in the case of the multiple membrane spanning protein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, its rate of degradation in the ER is accelerated in response to regulatory signals (9Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processing and degradation of the membrane-spanning segments of proteins presents some interesting mechanistic and experimental challenges because of the hydrophobic environment in which they reside. The details of these mechanisms are only beginning to emerge. One mechanism of ER degradation involves reverse translocation of the protein through the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. The MHC class I heavy chain is co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane and glycosylated. In cytomegalovirus-infected cells, it is then transported back into the cytoplasm, deglycosylated, and degraded by the proteasome (10Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A soluble, ubiquitinated species appears to be an intermediate in this pathway. Two other secretory proteins, secreted α1-antitrypsin Z and the yeast protein carboxypeptidase yscY, are degraded in the cytosol by the proteasome (13Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 14Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase degradation in the ER occurs while associated with the membrane (15McGee T.P. Cheng H.H. Kumagai H. Omura S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The lumenal contents are not required for degradation and no proteolytic intermediates are detected during this membrane associated degradation. This appears to be a distinct pathway with a mechanism that has yet to be elucidated. Processing of the TMD of type I transmembrane proteins is particularly important with respect to Alzheimer's disease. In this devastating disease, insoluble extracellular deposits of a 42-amino acid peptide called Aβ accumulate in the brains of affected individuals. It is believed that this peptide is responsible for the neuronal pathogenesis observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (16Younkin S.G. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cleavage within the transmembrane domain of the APP creates the carboxyl terminus of the Aβ peptide. This proteolysis is accomplished by one or more enzymes, termed γ-secretase, that remain to be identified. The precise amino acid cleavage site by γ-secretase is critical for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis because it determines whether the product is the longer Aβ1–42 form of the peptide that aggregates rapidly (17Burdick D.

In autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease caused by mutations within the transmembrane domain of APP or in the presenilin 1 or 2 genes, the mutation is associated with enhanced production of Aβ1–42 (16Younkin S.G. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The presenilin genes encode ER-resident transmembrane proteins that span the bilayer seven times (26Citron M. Westaway D.

At least some of this Aβ may be produced in the ER, because the production of intracellular Aβ is not inhibited by BFA (30Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16085-16088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 31Cook D.F. Forman M, S. Sung J.C. Leight S. Kolson D.L. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. Nat.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16085-16088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The potential association of this cleavage event with the protein degradation systems in the ER has not yet been explored. This may be due at least in part, to technical difficulties in detecting intracellular Aβ by immunoprecipitation (32Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and unambiguously examining the cleavage and degradation of the APP TMD per se. This is not surprising because very little is known about the proteolysis and degradation of the membrane spanning domains of transmembrane proteins. Some of the ambiguity arises from relying on a single epitope for studying transmembrane proteins and the location of the epitope at distances relatively far away from the segment to be examined. These studies describe a novel probe molecule containing two epitope tags immediately flanking the APP TMD that is designed to focus on cleavage events within the TMD. Any single cleavage event should give rise to fragments that are immunoprecipitable by at least one of the antibodies. The probe is efficiently incorporated into the ER membrane and it is rapidly degraded in a highly processive fashion, such that no intermediates are detected by either antibody in the absence of protease inhibitors. Additionally, no soluble cytosolic or ubiquitinated intermediates are detected, suggesting that the major pathway is distinct from the proteasome-dependent pathway recently identified for the MHC class I molecules. The results also indicate that the ER degradative pathway is distinct from the pathway that produces soluble, secreted Aβ. TheHindIII-KpnI signal sequence fragment of APP751 was ligated to 11 pre-annealed oligonucleotides spanning the sequence: (gtaccctatccatatgatgttccagattatgcttcgaacaaaggtgcaatcattggactcatggtgggcggtgttgtcatagcgaca gtgatcgtcatcaccttggtgatgcttaagaagaaacagtacgagcagaa gctcatctccgaggaagacctctaga). The resultingHindIII-XbaI fragment was ligated into the polylinker of the pGem-3z plasmid (Promega) for in vitrotranscription/translation. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Pharmacia A.L.F. DNA sequencer. For transfection, the HindIII-XbaI fragment was subcloned into the polylinker of a pCB6 expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and the neomycin selectable marker. Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) were stably transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA by the CaPO4 method (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. I. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). Individual colonies were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and G418. Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide, CKKKQYEQKLISEEDL, that contains the c-Myc epitope tag, QYEQKLISEEDL, an additional 3 lysine residues from the APP TMD sequence and an extra cysteine residue at the amino terminus. The c-Myc epitope is a sequence derived from the cellular oncogene c-myc (37Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the thiol-reactive linkerm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Pierce) and emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant for the first immunization. Subsequent injections utilized unconjugated synthetic peptide emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. After two immunizations, serum samples were collected and affinity-purified. To immobilize the immunizing peptide, 10 mg of cysteine containing peptide was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, buffer and coupled to Sulfolink Coupling Gel according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce). Serum samples (20–30 ml) were diluted 1:1 in PBS, recirculated over a protein G-Sepharose column, and the IgG fraction was eluted from a protein G-Sepharose column using 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.7. The IgG fraction was neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 8, dialyzed in PBS, recirculated over the c-Myc peptide affinity resin, and eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.7. The affinity purified antibody was neutralized, dialized against PBS, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Once thawed, antibody samples were kept at 4 °C for use. The hemagglutanin (HA) antibody is to the peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA, a 9-amino acid sequence derived from the human influenza hemmaglutanin protein (36Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim. The 4G8 monoclonal antibody specific to residues 17–24 of Aβ was purchased from SENETEK. Coupled in vitro transcription/translation was performed using a pGEM plasmid in Promega's TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate using the manufacturer's protocol. Dog pancreas microsomal membranes were also from Promega. Proteinase K was used at 0.5 mg/ml and incubated with the reactions for 30 min after which phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to inhibit the enzyme. When included, Triton X-100 was used at 0.1% to solubilize the membranes. 10 μl of in vitro translation mixture was added to 1 ml of RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS buffer containing the following inhibitors added fresh: 0.3 μm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 17 μg/ml ALLN, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, 5 mm EDTA) and immunoprecipitated with each antibody and immunoprecipitates run on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine PAGE. Transfected cell cultures were preincubated with methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 40 min prior to labeling. Cells were then incubated with 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of inhibitors for the steady-state experiments. After removal of the media, cells were immediately lysed in RIPA buffer. Pulse-chase experiments were pulsed with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine for 5 min, rinsed with PBS, and chased in methionine containing media (0.3 mg/ml) for the indicated times. For degradation rate determinations, the inhibitor was present during the 40-min incubation in methionine minus media, during the 5-min pulse, and during the chase period. Quantitiation of pulse-chase experiments was performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. It should be noted that experiments that used a chase period lacking [35S]methionine were rinsed with PBS after the labeling period and then incubated in the chase media, whereas steady-state experiments were immediately lysed after removal of [35S]methionine containing media. For the ALLN washout experiment, cells were incubated overnight with [35S]methionine and ALLN. The cells were then rinsed in PBS and either lysed in RIPA buffer for time 0, incubated in complete media containing an excess of cold methionine for 1, 2, 4, or 6 h, or incubated in complete media with ALLN for 6 h (6 + ALLN). The inhibitors were E64 (250 μm), leupeptin (200 μm), pepstatin A (75 μm), BFA (35 μm), ALLN (135 μm), lactacystin (20 μm), and MG 132 (50 μm), chloroquine (50 μm), phosphoramidon (20–60 μm), and NH4Cl (30 mm). Cells were viable under the conditions employed as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The peptides were synthesized byN-(9-fluorenyl)-methoxycarbonyl chemistry using a continuous flow semiautomatic instrument, purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the expected structure was verified by sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry as described previously (19Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Estimates of the fraction of expected product range from 85 to 90%, and no single failure product represents more than 1% of the total, which is typical of synthetic peptides of this size (19Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Media was collected, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant added to an equal volume of 2 × RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors for immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and the soluble cell lysate and media were precleared with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Pharmacia) for the HA and c-Myc antibodies, respectively, and then primary antibody was added. After 2 h with the primary antibody, protein A- or protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit and the same amount of protein was immunoprecipitated in each experiment. The c-Myc antibody was used at 1:300 and the HA antibody used at 4 μg/ml for immunoprecipitations. The monoclonal antibody 4G8, that is specific to residues 17–24 of Aβ, was used at 1:300. The immunoprecipitates were collected at 2500 rpm for 5 min, rinsed 3 times with RIPA buffer and resuspended in 2 × sample buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol). After a 5-min incubation at 100 °C, the samples were subjected to either 7% Tris glycine PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar), 16.5% Tris-Tricine PAGE (35Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar), or 10–20% Tris-Tricine gradient PAGE (Bio-Rad). The gel was treated with ENHANCE (NEN Life Science Products Inc.), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Cells were scraped in homogenizing buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3), stroked 40 times with an A pestle, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant (cytosol fraction) was added to an equal volume of 2 × RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with the c-Myc or HA antibody. The 100,000 × g pellet was extracted with 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, for 40 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant (sodium carbonate membrane extract) was neutralized with 1 m HCl and added to an equal volume of 2× RIPA buffer for immunoprecipitation with the c-Myc or HA antibody. The pellet (sodium carbonate-extracted membrane pellet) was resuspended in 1 × RIPA buffer, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with the c-Myc or HA antibody. Two ml of culture media from a 16-h incubation of a 10-cm dish of H29–56C transfected cells was mixed with an equal volume of 2 × RIPA buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody as described above. The washed protein G-Sepharose beads were eluted with 60 μl of 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, and the eluate dialyzed for 16 h against distilled water at 4 °C using a 1,000 Da molecular mass cut-off membrane. The dialyzed sample was infused into a Finnigan LCQ electrospray mass spectrometer and data collected in the mass range of 1000–4000 Da at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope (Duarte, California). Peak assignment was made using the PAWS software (Rockefeller University) using the default mass accuracy of 1000 parts per million. Only peaks greater than 10% of the intensity of the most abundant peak were selected for assignment. All peaks shown are interpreted as M + 2H. To study the turnover of the TMD of APP, the probe H26–57C was constructed containing the TMD of APP flanked immediately on both sides by unique epitope tags as diagrammed in Fig. 1. The name of the probe is an acronym with the numbers referring to the TMD of APP starting from residue 1 of Aβ with the first letter of the epitope tag at the ends. The signal sequence from human APP is situated at the amino terminus of the probe. The rationale for the design is to detect proteolytic events localized to the lumenal side of the membrane, within the membrane, or on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. If one epitope is degraded from one side of the membrane, the resulting protein fragment should be detected with an antibody to the epitope on the other side of the membrane and any single cleavage event should give rise to at least one identifiable fragment. Cleavage within the TMD, such as the γ-secretase type cleavage known to cleave full-length APP, may release two fragments that are potentially detectable with antibodies to each of the epitopes. Naturally occurring methionine residues at positions 35 and 52 of the Aβ sequence flank the expected sites of γ-secretase cleavage. If γ-secretase cleavage occurs between residues 35 and 52, then both potential fragments will be labeled. The small size of the probe should facilitate a high resolution analysis of cleavage events with respect to the lumen and cytoplasmic ends, the highest resolution being achieved by placing the epitopes adjacent to the transmembrane domain. Initial characterization of the probe was performed using an in vitro coupled, transcription/translation system with dog pancreas microsomes to verify the fidelity of ER translocation and signal sequence removal. In the absence of microsomes, a translation product of the appropriate size of ∼7.9 kDa is detected with both antibodies, indicating that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation is the same from both epitopes (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 4). In the presence of microsomal membranes, virtually all of the translation product migrates with an increased mobility (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 5), indicating that the probe is efficiently inserted into the membrane and the signal peptide removed. This small decrease in size correlates with the loss of the signal peptide. Also shown are the results of experiments aimed at identifying the orientation of insertion of H26–57C into the membrane. In vitrotranscription/translation of H26–57C in the presence of microsomal membranes were subsequently incubated with proteinase K (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 6). The orientation of the probe within the membrane was examined by subjecting the translations performed in the presence of microsomes to proteinase K digestion. After digestion with proteinase K, the probe is no longer immunoprecipitable with the c-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), but with the HA antibody a smaller fragment is observed (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). These results imply that the c-Myc epitope is exposed to the cytoplasmic (outside) surface of the microsomal membranes and is cleaved by proteinase K, while the HA epitope is within the lumen of the microsomal membranes, the correct orientation. When Triton X-100 is included during the proteinase K digestion, a small protease-resistant fraction is detected only with the HA antibody that requires an extended incubation time to digest (data not shown). This may reflect an inherent resistance to degradation of the APP TMD and is not surprising considering the ability of the amyloid Aβ peptide and the membrane-spanning domain of Aβ to form insoluble fibrillar aggregates (17Burdick D.

An initial characterization of probe expression in mammalian cells was performed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (293 cells). 293 cells were stably transfected with H26–57C and clonal lines screened for H26–57C expression. A comparison of H26–57C synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate and expressed by the transfected 293 cells is shown in Fig. 2 B. The H26–57C immunoprecipitated with the c-Myc antibody from the transfected cells (lane 3) comigrates with the in vitro translation product obtained in the presence of microsomal membranes (lane 2) and both migrate faster than the in vitro translation product obtained in the absence of membranes (lane 1). These results indicate that the signal sequence is efficiently processed in the stably transfected cell lines. Identical results were obtained with the HA antibody (data not shown). We also examined whether these cell lines secrete an extracellular fragment of the probe into the media, because the intramembrane cleavage by γ-secretase is characteristic of amyloid Aβ production from a fraction of the APP molecules (39Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkow D.J.

If the transfected cells secrete this 2.9-kDa fragment into the media, this suggests that H26–57C is transported through the same processing pathway as APP that produces Aβ. Immunoprecipitation of the media with the c-Myc and HA antibodies reveals that the cells secrete a 2.9-kDa fragment that is detected with the HA antibody and not the c-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the expected product of γ-secretase cleavage (Fig. 1). In addition, the expected carboxyl-terminal fragment resulting from γ-secretase cleavage with the TMD that contains the c-Myc epitope is not detected in the media, nor is full-length H26–57C. The secreted 2.9-kDa fragment comigrates at the approximate size of synthetic peptides spanning the region from the HA epitope to residue 40 (HA-40) or residue 42 (HA-42) within the transmembrane domain (Fig. 2 D). The fact that the secreted fragment is smaller than the one obtained from proteinase K digestion of intact microsomes and is labeled with [35S]Met indicates that probe is cleaved within the transmembrane domain between residues 35 and the cytosolic end of the TMD at approximately residue 52. The structures of the secreted fragments were further characterized by mass spec"

We have investigated the distribution of RPA in nuclei of proliferating HeLa cells and found that only one-third of the detectable RPA appeared to be bound to DNA in chromatin, whereas the remainder was free in the nucleosol. This distribution did not significantly change when cells were released from a double thymidine block into the S phase of the cell cycle. Single strand-specific endonucleases failed to mobilize RPA bound to chromatin in G1 phase and S phase HeLa cells. In contrast, brief treatments with pancreatic DNase I or with micrococcal nuclease sufficed to release RPA from its chromatin-binding sites. Sucrose gradient analysis of soluble micrococcal nuclease digests showed that the released RPA sedimented free of mono- or oligonucleosomal chromatin fragments, possibly indicating that most of the detectable RPA may be associated with chromatin sites, which are more open to nuclease attack than bulk chromatin. The surprising conclusion is that the majority of the detectable RPA is, either directly or indirectly, associated with double-stranded DNA regions in chromatin from HeLa cells in G1 phase and in S phase.

The major eukaryotic single strand-specific DNA-binding protein is known as replication protein A (RPA)1 because it was originally discovered as a factor essential for simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro. However, more recent evidence indicates that RPA is involved not only in DNA replication, but also in DNA repair and recombination as well as transcriptional regulation. These activities are dependent on the DNA binding properties of RPA, but also on its ability to interact with a variety of proteins such as DNA polymerases, DNA damage recognition proteins, and transcriptional activators (reviewed in Ref. 1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). RPA is composed of three subunits described as RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14 with reference to their approximate molecular masses. The major DNA-binding activity of RPA is associated with the RPA70 subunit, which contains a central region with two adjacent DNA-binding domains (2Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and, possibly, a third and weak binding domain in the carboxyl-terminal region (3Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An additional weak DNA-binding domain appears to reside on the RPA32 subunit, which may therefore contribute to the overall DNA-binding activity of RPA (3Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Bochkarev A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3932-3936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, RPA32, together with RPA70, determines contacts between RPA and other proteins at sites of DNA replication or DNA repair (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The interactions with other proteins may be influenced by cell cycle- or DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of the RPA32 subunit (5Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The function of the smallest subunit, RPA14, is less well known, but RPA14 appears to be involved in RPA complex assembly and stability (5Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPA binds with high affinity and low cooperativity to single-stranded DNA with a preference for polypyrimidine tracts in in vitrobinding studies (7Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3050-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Two binding modes have been identified: an intermediate and relatively weak binding mode, characterized by an occluded binding site of 8–10 nucleotides (8Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and a more stable binding mode in which RPA covers ∼30 nucleotides (7Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3050-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Masrangelo I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4798-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA covered by RPA remains in an extended conformation under low ionic strength conditions, but more physiological salt concentrations induce a severe compaction of RPA·DNA complexes (11Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which may reflect yet another DNA-binding mode possibly including 90 nucleotides of bound DNA, as first suggested by work with yeast RPA (12Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In general, the high affinity of RPA for single-stranded DNA is thought to contribute to the stabilization of single-stranded DNA intermediates and the removal of secondary structures from single-stranded regions. However, RPA also binds to double-stranded DNA, although with an affinity that is several orders of magnitude lower than its affinity for single-stranded DNA (13Wold M.S. Weinberg D.H. Virshup D.M. Li J.J. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2801-2809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). RPA prefers certain sequences or secondary structural elements in double-stranded DNA, with the interesting consequence that bound RPA is able to unwind double-stranded DNA regions up to several thousand base pairs at low ionic strengths in vitro (11Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RPA is an abundant cellular protein with 3 × 104 to 2 × 105 molecules/cell nucleus (13Wold M.S. Weinberg D.H. Virshup D.M. Li J.J. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2801-2809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kenny M.K. Lee S.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9757-9761Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Seroussi E. Lavi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7147-7154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies indicate that RPA may change its localization in the nucleus in a cell-cycle dependent manner. This has been investigated in pseudonuclei that form in Xenopus egg extracts around added sperm chromatin or DNA. Immunofluorescence revealed that RPA accumulates as brightly stained dots in pre-replication centers before the initiation of DNA replication, but disperses throughout the nuclei when replication proceeds (17Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The intranuclear distribution pattern in this system appears to be accompanied by a change of RPA-binding sites. Before replication, RPA seems to be linked to double-stranded DNA in chromatin, probably via protein interactions, but is transferred to single-stranded DNA after the establishment of replication forks (19Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4153-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The intranuclear distribution of RPA changes in a cell-cycle dependent manner also in cultured mammalian cells. Experiments with cellular systems as diverse as mouse myotubes, lymphoma cells, and human HeLa cancer cells have consistently shown that RPA is distributed throughout nuclei of cells in G1 phase, but appears in a punctate or dot-like pattern in most S phase nuclei (20Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 74: 979-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21Brenot-Bosc F. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fotedar R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1995; 103: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Myotube cells, induced to proliferate by expression of the SV40 transformation protein (T antigen), may be a special case though, as only RPA70, but not RPA32, could be detected at replication foci (20Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 74: 979-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Since relatively little is known about the chromatin-binding mode of RPA in mammalian cells, we prepared chromatin from HeLa cells and determined that most of the nuclear RPA is free in the nucleosol, whereas only a minor fraction of nuclear RPA is associated with chromatin in proliferating cells. Interestingly, most of the chromatin-associated fraction appears to be bound to double-stranded DNA. The nuclear distribution of RPA does not detectably change when cells traverse from the pre-replicative G1 phase to the replicative S phase of the cell cycle. Bound RPA is released from chromatin by micrococcal nuclease digestion. Released RPA sediments in sucrose gradients just like isolated free RPA. RPA was expressed in bacteria and purified as described (11Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated RPA was used as an antigen to raise antibodies in rabbits. RPA-specific antibodies were affinity-purified against isolated RPA according to standard procedures (24Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antibodies were used in immunoblotting experiments (Western blotting) essentially as originally described by Towbin et al. (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (26Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu D. Musahl C. Gohring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells (line S3; American Type Culture Collection CCL 2.2) were grown on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. For cell cycle synchronization, cells were arrested at the G1-S phase transition by two subsequent thymidine blocks (2.5 mmthymidine) for 14 h, separated by a period of 10 h without thymidine (27Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyn R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1993: 1-24Google Scholar). Progression through S phase was monitored by pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi) for 60 min. Incorporated radioactivity was determined in acid-precipitated material by scintillation counting. The number of cells in mitosis was determined according to Ohyashiki et al. (28Ohyashiki J.H. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1988; 34: 159-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described (29Gohring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with monospecific RPA antibodies and secondary fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma). Parallel immunofluorescence experiments were performed using a primary monoclonal anti-RPA70 antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and an anti-mouse Texas Red conjugate as secondary antibody (Sigma). For cell fractionation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in buffer A (110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) with 50 μg/ml digitonin (30Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation after 15 min on ice with gentle agitation. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer B (1 mm Hepes and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) with or without 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as indicated below. Chromatin was prepared, according to Hancock (31Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), from washed cells in buffer B with Nonidet P-40. As first shown by Hancock (31Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), incubation in buffer B for 15 min on ice disrupts the nuclear envelope, whereas chromatin remains in a compacted form. Chromatin was further purified by centrifugation through a 100 mm sucrose cushion and finally resuspended in 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8. DNA concentrations were determined with Hoechst 33258 (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) by fluorometry. HeLa cell nuclei were incubated with 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease/40 μg of DNA (Boehringer Mannheim) in 0.25 mm sucrose, 10 mmHepes, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 8 mm EDTA. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were analyzed by zone centrifugation through a 40 to 10% sucrose gradient in a Beckman SW 40 rotor at 4 °C and 40,000 rpm. The gradient was fractionated from the bottom into 0.6-ml aliquots. Samples from each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting for RPA and, after deproteinization, by agarose gel electrophoresis for the determination of DNA lengths (32Krude T. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6257-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The procedure used has been described by Göhring and Fackelmayer (33Goehring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells on plastic dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove all traces of serum. Formaldehyde (1%) in warm Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum was then added for the times indicated below. Cells were lysed in 2% Sarkosyl. The lysate was first centrifuged through a CsCl step gradient to remove uncomplexed proteins. The nucleoprotein complex was recovered, sheared to pieces containing DNA fragments of 500–1000 base pairs, and recentrifuged in a CsCl equilibrium gradient. Cross-links can be broken by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, allowing the analysis of proteins by standard denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies, raised in rabbits against recombinant human RPA, served as a major analytical tool to specifically determine RPA by immunoblotting in the presence of other nuclear proteins. To demonstrate the efficiency and specificity of the antibody preparation, we show in Fig. 1 that the antibodies specifically reacted with two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 70 and 32 kDa in an unfractionated extract of HeLa cells as well as in a protein extract of induced Escherichia coli cells harboring an expression plasmid with the three RPA sequences (5Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison with purified recombinant RPA showed that these polypeptides correspond to the large and middle subunits, RPA70 and RPA32, respectively, and that the antibodies do not recognize the smallest subunit, RPA14 (Fig. 1). Preimmune control antibodies gave negative results on Western blots (Fig. 1). Using RPA-specific antibodies, we show by immunofluorescence that all of the detectable RPA resides in HeLa cell nuclei and that RPA was evenly distributed in pre-replicative nuclei, but partially appeared in a punctate form over a uniformly stained background in nuclei from S phase cells (Fig. 2 A), as described in detail before by Murti et al. (22Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescence experiment was repeated with a monoclonal RPA70-specific antibody with very similar results (data not shown). To determine the fraction of free and structure-bound nuclear RPA proteins, proliferating HeLa cells were lysed in buffers containing digitonin at concentrations that are believed to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane, but not the nuclear envelope (30Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data show, however, that a considerable fraction of total cellular RPA appeared in the supernatants of digitonin-treated cells, suggesting that digitonin renders the nuclear envelope leaky for RPA (Fig. 2 B, soluble fraction 1). Washing of the digitonin-treated nuclei in a hypotonic buffer and in a buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 resulted in an additional release of free RPA (Fig. 2 B, soluble fraction 2 and NP40 wash, respectively). The fraction of RPA remaining bound to structure in the final chromatin pellet was one-third of total nuclear RPA (Fig. 2 B). The cell fractionation procedure of Fig. 2 was performed using HeLa cells arrested by a double thymidine block at the G1/S phase transition as well as at different times after beginning of S phase. The results consistently showed that a fraction of ∼20–30% RPA remained in a structure-bound form in pre-replicative nuclei as well as in nuclei from S phase HeLa cells (data not shown). To further investigate the structure-bound fraction of RPA, we performed in vivo cross-linking experiments by treating proliferating HeLa cells on plastic dishes with formaldehyde for increasing lengths of times (33Goehring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cross-linked nucleoprotein complexes were prepared from cell lysates by two consecutive centrifugations in CsCl gradients. Analyses by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that histones were already cross-linked to DNA after a treatment with formaldehyde for 2 min and that the amount of cross-linked histones increased over time, until maximal values were reached at 30 min (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting of polyacrylamide gels revealed that a significant fraction of RPA became cross-linked to DNA after 4 min of treatment with formaldehyde and that this fraction increased with longer cross-linking times (Fig. 3 B). The results indicate that the RPA remaining in the nuclear pellet after cell fractionation is most likely associated with chromatin. As mentioned in the Introduction, RPA seems to be redistributed in mammalian cell nuclei at the beginning of S phase, when a substantial fraction of immunologically detectable RPA concentrates in distinct dots (22Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine whether this process was accompanied by changes in the amounts of chromatin-associated RPA. To investigate this possibility, proliferating HeLa cells were arrested at the G1/S phase boundary using the double thymidine procedure. Excess thymidine was then removed to release the cells into S phase. As shown in Fig. 4 A, maximal DNA synthesis was observed after 6 h, and most cells had started mitosis after 10 h. Chromatin was prepared before and at 1-h intervals after release from the thymidine block. The protocol for chromatin preparation has originally been described by Hancock (31Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and involves treatment of cells in buffers with low ionic strengths in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Nonidet P-40. This procedure is fast and simple and yields spherical chromatin bodies that are larger in volume and more transparent than chromatin in intact nuclei (31Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Chromatin from mitotic cells does not, of course, have the spherical structure of chromatin bodies from interphase cells, but can nevertheless be pelleted by low speed centrifugation. As shown by Western blotting with monospecific (Fig. 4 B) and monoclonal (Fig. 4 C) RPA antibodies, the amounts of chromatin-bound RPA did not significantly change in the first 5 h after cells had entered S phase. Even though cell synchrony was partially lost at the end of S phase, the data warrant the conclusion that RPA remains on chromatin during most of S phase, but dissociates at least partially from chromatin after DNA replication (Fig. 4). It is not possible to say whether the loss of RPA occurred already during the G2 phase or, more likely, at mitosis as suggested by Murtiet al. (22Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Guided by the report on the DNA binding of RPA in replicating pseudonuclei of Xenopus egg extracts (19Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4153-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that RPA may also be bound to single-stranded DNA in S phase HeLa cell nuclei. To investigate this possibility, we prepared chromatin from cells before and 2, 4, and 6 h after release from the thymidine block (Fig. 4). Chromatin preparations were incubated with single strand-specific mung bean nuclease under conditions known to be optimal for enzymatic activity. Insoluble chromatin was removed after incubation by centrifugation, and the amounts of RPA were determined in pellets and supernatants. Neither a decrease in chromatin-bound RPA nor an increase in free supernatant RPA could be detected (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using the single strand-specific S1 nuclease. Thus, single strand-specific nucleases failed to mobilize chromatin-bound RPA. To exclude the possibility that components in chromatin preparations were inhibitory to exogenous nucleases, we added radioactively labeled single-stranded M13 DNA to a chromatin preparation and treated the mixture with either mung bean nuclease or S1 nuclease. Both nucleases efficiently degraded the single-stranded DNA substrate (data not shown), demonstrating that their activities did not suffer in the presence of HeLa cell chromatin. Our conclusion is that the majority of the chromatin-bound RPA is probably not associated with single-stranded DNA in S phase cells. To independently support this conclusion, the following experiment was performed. Recombinant RPA was bound to single-stranded phage M13 DNA and, in a parallel experiment, to double-stranded M13 DNA at increasing NaCl concentrations. RPA·DNA complexes were removed by ultracentrifugation, and free RPA was determined in the supernatants. The results showed that 0.4 m NaCl and higher was necessary to dissociate RPA from single-stranded DNA, whereas 0.1 mNaCl was sufficient to dissociate most of the RPA from double-stranded DNA (Fig. 5 A). Next we determined the salt sensitivity of RPA binding in isolated chromatin. For this purpose, chromatin from pre-replicative and S phase cells was treated with increasing salt concentrations. The results showed that RPA already dissociated from chromatin at a salt concentration of 0.1 m NaCl (Fig. 5 B), just like RPA bound to double-stranded M13 DNA. The results shown in Fig. 5 B were obtained using chromatin from HeLa cells at 6 h after release from the double thymidine block, but the data with chromatin from other cell cycle stages were similar (data not shown). We conclude that most of the RPA in proliferating HeLa cells is not bound to single-stranded DNA, but could be bound to double-stranded DNA. We note, however, that RPA70 subunits appeared to be more sensitive to salt treatment than RPA32 subunits (Fig. 5 B). The reason for this is presently not clear. Since RPA could not be released from chromatin with single strand-specific nucleases, we used pancreatic DNase I and micrococcal nuclease to determine whether RPA is directly or indirectly associated with double-stranded DNA in chromatin. We could indeed show that pancreatic DNase I (data not shown) and micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 6 A) efficiently mobilized RPA from isolated chromatin. In fact, micrococcal nuclease already released a substantial fraction of RPA from S phase chromatin at short incubation times when the degradation of chromatin to soluble fragments became just detectable. Continued nuclease treatment mobilized approximately two-thirds of all of the chromatin-bound RPA under conditions when <20% chromatin was fragmented and appeared in the supernatants (Fig. 6 B). The fast release of RPA could indicate that chromatin sites with bound RPA are more accessible to micrococcal nuclease than is bulk chromatin, but it has yet to be investigated whether this may be due to a more open chromatin conformation in the vicinity of bound RPA. We note that one-third of the chromatin-bound RPA was not released under standard conditions of incubation with micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 6). This fraction of RPA remained in a compact chromatin structure and could be pelleted by centrifugation. Higher nuclease concentrations or prolonged incubation times failed to decrease the fraction of nuclease-resistant RPA. The results may suggest that two types of RPA-binding sites exist in HeLa cell chromatin, only one of which may be accessible to nuclease attack under standard incubation conditions. To determine whether solubilized RPA was associated with chromatin fragments, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugations of the soluble micrococcal nuclease digests. The results showed that almost all of the RPA sedimented free of mono- or oligonucleosomes (Fig. 7 A). In fact, the sedimentation rate of mobilized RPA was ∼5 S and was similar to that of isolated or recombinant human RPA (data not shown), indicating that very little DNA remained bound to RPA released from chromatin by nuclease treatment. To support this conclusion, we determined the sedimentation properties of RPA in chromatin digests after longer nuclease treatment. If RPA in the experiment of Fig. 7 Acarried DNA pieces of substantial lengths, we expected to find a reduction of its sedimentation rate upon further nuclease treatment. This was not observed even though continued nuclease digestion converted most oligonucleosomal chromatin fragments into nucleosomal core particles (Fig. 7 B). We note some overlap between the peak of RPA and that of mononucleosomes. But a direct association of RPA with other proteins appears to be unlikely because immunoprecipitations with anti-RPA antibodies precipitated all of the RPA, but no additional proteins (histones) or mononucleosomal DNA (data not shown). Furthermore, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36Schlaeger E.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) effectively separated mononucleosomes and RPA (data not shown). The experiment of Fig. 7 was performed with chromatin prepared from cells at the G1/S phase transition as well as from cells in S phase. The results were similar and indicate that the chromatin binding properties of the detectable fraction of RPA do not significantly change in S phase. The experiments described here were performed to learn more about the distribution of RPA in HeLa cells. A first result was that the majority of RPA is present in the soluble fraction even after gentle lysis of cells and that maximally one-third remains in the chromatin pellet. Since immunofluorescence gave no indication of a cytoplasmic localization of RPA, it can be concluded that the soluble RPA fraction originates from the nucleosol. RPA in the pellet is at least partially bound to chromatin because RPA appeared in CsCl gradients of cross-linked nucleoprotein at the same buoyant density positions as histones. This result does not necessarily indicate that RPA is directly bound to DNA. It could be linked to DNA via another protein (37Yan H. Newport J. Science. 1995; 269: 1883-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This would explain why RPA appears during cross-linking some minutes later in nucleoprotein compared with histones. In any case, the fraction of chromatin-bound RPA did not significantly change when HeLa cells became actively engaged in DNA replication after their release from a double thymidine block. This may indicate that the fraction of chromatin-bound RPA is large enough to satisfy the needs for RPA in replication. It is possible though that the pool of free RPA serves as a reservoir for fresh and active RPA during replication. This would be required when chromatin-bound RPA changes its properties during replication, e.g. by phosphorylation (6Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 39Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and when modified RPA is released from chromatin and regenerated in the nucleosol. In this case, molecules from the pools of free and chromatin-bound RPA proteins should be in equilibrium, and the rates of exchange should increase when cells move from the G1 phase into the S phase of the cell cycle. This point has not yet been investigated. Another and possibly simpler explanation for the excess of free RPA would be that free RPA serves as a background system needed in cases of high demand during DNA repair or that RPA is required in high amounts during other stages of the cell cycle such as mitosis when RPA70 has been reported to accumulate at spindle poles and RPA32 at chromosomes (22Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). With regard to the chromatin-bound form of RPA, we had expected to detect at least some RPA on single-stranded DNA during S phase. However, we were unable to mobilize detectable amounts of RPA with single strand-specific endonucleases. This does not, of course, exclude the presence of RPA on single-stranded regions at replication forks. In fact, numerous experiments have clearly demonstrated that the DNA-binding activity of RPA is indispensable for eukaryotic DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), and biochemical experiments have located RPA directly in the vicinity of replication forks (40Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Furthermore, single strand-specific nucleases have been shown to mobilize RPA from replicating sperm chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts (19Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4153-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is known though that the use of origins in Xenopus egg systems is more relaxed than in adult cells (41Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 42Newport J. Cell. 1987; 48: 205-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 43Hyrien O. Mechali M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 44Mahbubani H.M. Paull T. Elder J.K. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), with the consequence that many more replication forks are established, and consequently, much more RPA is engaged at replication forks than in adult cells, in which S phase is 8–10 times longer than in Xenopus egg extracts. Thus, our data could mean that only rather small and undetectable amounts of RPA are in direct contact with single strands at any given time in S phase HeLa cells. Another reason for the inability of single strand-specific nucleases to release RPA from replicating mammalian chromatin could be that RPA is a component of a large multiprotein complex that protects single-stranded regions against nucleolytic attack. But again, this can be true only for a minor fraction of chromatin-bound RPA because RPA sites in chromatin are readily accessible to micrococcal nuclease, which can already mobilize most of the bound RPA after short incubation times. Our conclusion is that most of the RPA appears to be associated with double-stranded DNA. It is not known whether this association is direct or mediated by a protein tether (37Yan H. Newport J. Science. 1995; 269: 1883-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We note though that RPA molecules released by nuclease treatment sediment through sucrose gradients at the rate of free uncomplexed RPA proteins. Thus, if RPA binds indirectly to chromatin, either its protein partner must be too small to affect the sedimentation properties, or the protein partner dissociates from RPA during incubation with micrococcal nuclease. We have excluded the possibility that the partial overlap between RPA and nucleosomal core particles in some of the sucrose gradient fractions was due to an interaction with a nucleosome. Finally, only two-thirds of the bound RPA could be released by either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease. We do not know whether the remaining RPA is associated with an inaccessible part of isolated chromatin or bound to the nuclear matrix, which cannot be solubilized by nuclease treatment. In either case, the fraction of nuclease-resistant RPA is similar in pre-replicative and replicating HeLa cells and therefore is not related to a cell cycle-dependent physiological event. In summary, we draw the surprising conclusion that RPA, the prototypic eukaryotic single strand-specific DNA-binding protein, either occurs free in the nucleosol or is associated to a considerable extent with double-stranded DNA in mammalian cell chromatin and, furthermore, that this distribution does not detectably change when HeLa cells proceed from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle.

Isoleucine (Ile) binds to the E·ATP complex (K 4 = 1.7 ± 0.9 μm) ∼35-fold more tightly than to E(K 1 = 50–100 μm), primarily due to a reduction in the Ile dissociation rate constant (k -1 ≈ 100–150 s−1,cf. k -4 = 3 ± 1.5 s−1). Similarly, ATP binds more tightly toE·Ile (K 3 = ∼70 μm) than to E (K 2 = ∼2.5 mm).

Activation of the carboxyl group of amino acids with ATP to form the corresponding aminoacyl adenylate prior to transfer to tRNA is the first step in protein biosynthesis. The activation of each amino acid is catalyzed by a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)1 which first catalyzes the activation (and stabilization) of the amino acid as a mixed anhydride adenylate, and the subsequent acyl transfer to the corresponding cognate tRNA (for a review, see Ref. 1Meinnel T.

The best known example of such a compound is pseudomonic acid A (PS-A) which specifically inhibits bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) around 10,000-fold more potently that the corresponding mammalian enzyme (7,8) and is a highly effective antibiotic. Staphylococcus aureus infections, particularly of the respiratory tract, are a major clinical problem and, because of the emergence of resistance to “classical” antibiotics (e.g. β-lactams), this organism is an important target for the development of new antibiotics. However, resistance to PS-A itself is emerging although not yet a clinically relevant problem (e.g. Refs. 9Dyke K.G.H. Curnock S.P. Golding M. Noble W.C. FEMS Microbiol.

Therefore, we have considerable interest in understanding the reaction cycle and inhibition of S. aureus IleRS by PS-A in order to aid the design of novel inhibitors and to understand the mechanisms of PS-A resistance.

Although IleRS (E) from S. aureus possesses 18 tryptophan residues distributed fairly uniformly throughout the sequence (11Chalker A. Ward J. Fosberry A. Hodgson J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), examination of the equilibrium enzyme fluorescence of various complexes showed that, with the exception of E·ATP, these differed markedly in their fluorescence yields (Fig. 1). This provided the opportunity to determine the rates and equilibria for their inter-conversion directly by stopped-flow techniques. The intrinsic protein fluorescence intensity is increased by around 7% in the E·Ile binary complex and by around 17% upon the catalytic formation of E·Ile-AMP (Fig. 1). However, enzyme fluorescence was not altered by the presence of >5 mmMg·ATP, Mg·PPi, or Mg·Ap4A (adenosine 5′-tetraphospho-5′-adenosine; data not shown). Interestingly, binding of Ile-ol-AMP (Fig. 10 a) yielded an identical enzyme fluorescence to E·Ile-AMP formed during the reaction cycle, suggesting that the conformation of the enzyme-ligand complex is similar in both cases. The fluorescence change induced by Ile-ol-AMP was used to monitor those interactions that are spectroscopically silent (e.g. Mg·ATP binding, see Fig. 4) using a kinetic competition approach (see below).Figure 4Kinetic competition of Ile-ol-AMP and Mg·ATP binding to IleRS.

The binding of excess Ile-ol-AMP to IleRS was monitored directly by rapid mixing of the enzyme and inhibitor in a stopped-flow apparatus (Fig. 2 A). The observed rate constant, k obs, of the exponential increase in protein fluorescence (amplitude ≈17%) varied linearly with Ile-ol-AMP concentration (Fig. 2 B), consistent with a simple bimolecular reaction (Scheme FS1; k obs =k +i·[Ile-ol-AMP] + k −i). Although k +i = 2.4 ± 0.2 × 106 m −1 s−1(n = 3), the intercept defining k −iwas too small to be determined accurately (k −i < 0.5 s−1) from Fig. 2 B. However, direct measurement of k −i for Ile-ol-AMP via dis-placement experiments yielded a value of ∼0.07 s−1 (12Pope A.J. Moore K.J. McVey M. Mensah L. Benson N. Osbourne N. Broom N. Brown M.J.B.

Similar experiments to those described above but with the substrate l-isoleucine (Ile), also resulted in a single exponential increase in protein fluorescence (Fig. 3 A). The experiment shown in Fig. 3 provided an estimate of k +1 = 3.1 ± 0.3 × 106 m −1·s−1,k -1 = 142 ± 14 s−1 (Fig. 3 B; K 1 = 46 ± 6 μm). Six independent repeat experiments yielded mean (±S.D.) values for each parameter of k +1 = 2.2 ± 0.5 × 106 m −1·s−1,k -1 = 131 ± 50 s−1, and henceK 1 = 60 ± 27 μm. This large error in K 1 limits the reliability of other equilibrium constants in the mechanism, particularlyK 4, which have been estimated, in part, from a thermodynamic linkage argument involving the estimate of K 1 (see below). Nevertheless, these rate and equilibrium constants are consistent with the [Ile] dependence of the fluorescence amplitudes (Fig. 3 C, K 1= 56 ± 10 μm) and provide unambiguous evidence that IleRS can bind Ile (K 1 ≈ 50–100 μm) in the absence of Mg·ATP. The value fork +1 is lower than expected for a diffusion limited binding process (typically >108 m −1 s−1 (37Gutfreund H. Enzymes: Physical Principles. Wiley Interscience, New York1975: 157-161Google Scholar)), although several mechanisms can give rise to such behavior (14Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H.

This mixture is then rapidly mixed withE such that the two ligands bind to Esimultaneously and in parallel according to Scheme 2 and the transient kinetics of E·Ile-ol-AMP formation are monitored spectroscopically.The kinetics and/or thermodynamics of ATP binding are inferred from the effect of ATP on the kinetics of Ile-ol-AMP binding (21Moore K.J.

A series of kinetic competition experiments were performed by mixing 0.1 μm E with a sample of 0.5 μmIle-ol-AMP plus varying concentrations of Mg·ATP. Mixing Einto Ile-ol-AMP alone yielded, as expected (Fig. 2), a single exponential increase in protein fluorescence (k obs ≈ 2.5 s−1, amplitude ≈16%, Fig. 4 A). When Mg·ATP and Ile-ol-AMP were mixed with E, k obs for the formation of E·Ile-ol-AMP decreased with increasing [ATP] (Fig. 4), as expected for the competition between the two ligands where the binding of the spectroscopically silent ligand (ATP) is rapidly reversible relative to the rate of Ile-ol-AMP binding (21Moore K.J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14565-14578Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data according to Equation 1 yields an estimate forK 2 of ∼2.5 ± 0.2 mm(mean ± S.D., n = 3) and an estimate of k −i (∼0.1 s−1) consistent with that determined directly (Fig. 2), as shown, kobs=k+i[Ile­ol­AMP]1+[ATP]K2+k−i(Eq. 1) As predicted, the estimate of K 2 was independent of the concentration of Ile-ol-AMP used (definingk -2 > 10 s−1; see also Fig. 9), and was similar to that obtained from the activation of the aminoacylation reaction by ATP (see below, 2.7 mm; Table III). These data therefore provide clear evidence that ATP can bind toE in the absence of the co-substrate, Ile (and vice versa, see Fig. 3), such that a minimal mechanism must include random order of addition of both substrates. Simulations of the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A by numerical integration techniques (using Scheme FS1, Table I) provide an adequate description of the experimental data (compare Fig. 4, A and C).Table IIISteady-state parameters for tRNA aminoacylation and PPi/ATP exchange by S. aureus IleRS measured at 22 °C, pH 7.9 (see “Materials and Methods”)Kinetic parametertRNA aminoacylationPPi/ATP exchangeKm ,Ile(μm)5 ± 310 ± 2Km ,ATP (μm)240 ± 18ND3-aND, not done.Km ,tRNA(μm)<0.1NA3-bNA, not applicable.kcat (s−1)0.35 ± 0.0518.0 ± 2kcat/Km ,Ile(m −1 s−1)1.8 × 1051.8 × 105Data represent the mean (± S.E. or range) of 2–3 independent experiments3-a ND, not done.3-b NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Data represent the mean (± S.E. or range) of 2–3 independent experiments Rapid mixing of IleRS with mixtures of Ile and Mg·ATP to initiate the amino acid activation reaction resulted in a 16–17% increase in enzyme fluorescence (cf. Fig. 1). Although the time course of the change in species concentration predicted by Scheme FS1 is complex (see below), due to the particular combination of fluorescence yields associated with each of the intermediates, the observed fluorescence transients could, under most conditions, be described by the sum of two exponentials (e.g Fig. 5 A). The fast phase of the transient (observed rate constant k obs,1) had an [Ile] dependence consistent with that observed previously (Fig. 3) and an equivalent transient was observed in the absence of ATP. Furthermore, this rate constant was invariant when IleRS was mixed into varying ATP concentrations in the presence of a fixed concentration of Ile (Fig. 5 B, displayed on a logarithmic scale for clarity). The first phase therefore corresponds to the binding of Ile to the fraction of E that is nucleotide-free (at the concentration of ATP used relative to K 2) to formE·Ile. As described below, the binding of ATP to formE·ATP leads to a reduction in the dissociation rate constant for Ile binding but no significant change in the association rate constant. If k obs,1 arose from the binding of Ile to E·ATP, k obs,1 would be predicted to be lower than the equivalent rate constant observed in the absence of added ATP, in contrast to that observed experimentally. The slower transient observed in these mixing experiments,k obs,2 (ΔF ≈ 7%), showed a hyperbolic dependence in either [ATP] (Fig. 5 C) or [Ile] (data not shown, Table II), most likely due to the first-order catalytic formation of theE·Ile-AMP intermediate since the fluorescence yield of E·Ile-AMP is about 7% greater than that of E·Ile (or E·ATP, E·Ile·ATP) alone (Fig. 1). The [ATP] dependence of k obs,2was analyzed according to Equation 2 ([L] = [Mg·ATP]) to obtain estimates of the maximal observed rate constant,k max = k +5,app +k -5,app, the apparent K d of the binding step,K 3,app and the apparent reverse rate constant for the first order step, k -5,app. We emphasize the apparent nature of these terms as opposed to the elementary nature of the rate and equilibrium constants reported in Table I 2 and derived as described, kobs=k+5,app·[L]K3,app+[L]+k−5,app(Eq. 2) The value of k -5,app was too low to be determined reliably in these experiments, but had a value of <2 s−1 such that k max (=k +5,app + k -5,app) approximates to k +5,app. According to Scheme FS1, the apparent irreversibility of the chemical cleavage step (k -5,app < 2 s−1) is a consequence of the weak binding of PPi, the rapid and thermodynamically favorable release of which from theE·Ile-AMP·PPi complex makes theobserved reverse rate negligible.Table IIDependence of the rate constant for IleRS · Ile-AMP · PPi formation (kobs, 2) on substrate concentration when IleRS was rapidly mixed with Ile and ATP in experiments analogous to those shown in Fig. 5CFixed substrateVariable substrateK4,app(μm)K3,app(μm)Observed k+5,app + k−5,app≈ k+5,app (s−1)Simulated k+5,app + k−5,app ≈ k+5,app(s−1)ATP · Mg 1 mmIsoleucine16 ± 753 ± 657 2 mm15 ± 554 ± 558Isoleucine 15 μmMg · ATP86 ± 728 ± 0.524 30 μm72 ± 1442 ± 1.841 60 μm71 ± 1557 ± 2.658Derivative plots (kobs, 2 versus[substrate]) were fitted to Equation 2 to obtain estimates of the limiting rate constant at high concentration, kmax = k+5,app + k−5,app and K3,appor K4,app (see text for details). Open table in a new tab Derivative plots (kobs, 2 versus[substrate]) were fitted to Equation 2 to obtain estimates of the limiting rate constant at high concentration, kmax = k+5,app + k−5,app and K3,appor K4,app (see text for details). To determine if the maximal apparent rate constant observed at high [ATP] in Fig. 5 C (57 s−1) was the elementary rate constant for E·Ile-AMP·PPi formation, we conducted a series of experiments in which the concentration dependence of k obs,2 in either Ile or ATP was measured in the presence of fixed concentrations of the other substrate (Table II). The maximal observed rate constant,k max, was dependent upon [Ile], reaching a limiting value near 55 s−1 at high concentrations of both ATP and Ile (Table II). This rate constant likely reflects the true elementary rate constant for E·Ile-AMP·PPiformation which was confirmed in a number of other experiments conducted at saturating concentrations of Ile and ATP (not shown). Kinetic simulations of these experiments (Scheme FS1, Table I) yielded fluorescence transients similar to those observed experimentally (compare Fig. 5, A and D) and furthermore, predicted accurately the apparent maximal rate constants fork obs,2 at different [Ile] (Table II). The apparent equilibrium constants for ATP and Ile (K 3,app = 75 μm and K 4,app = 15 μm, respectively; Table II) only approximate to the true equilibrium constants,K 3 and K 4, when the pseudo first-order association and first-order dissociation rate constants are much larger than the rate constant for the subsequent (signal generating) chemical step. For ATP binding toE·Ile, kinetic simulations were able to predict the observed fluorescence transients using a value of K 3 (70 μm) approximately equal to the K 3,app value from Table II (75 μm). However, similar kinetic simulations indicate that the K 4,app value for Ile binding toE·ATP (15 μm) is an overestimate of the trueK 4 (1.7 ± 0.9 μm, Table I). Indeed, experiments described below suggest that the dissociation of Ile from E·Ile·ATP (k -4 ∼ 3 ± 1.5 s−1) occurs more slowly than the rate of the chemical cleavage step (∼60 s−1). As such, the non-equivalence of the best estimate of K 4 and the K 4,app for Ile activation of the chemistry step (Table II) is to be expected. Finally, based on reasonably reliable estimates for three of the four equilibrium constants in Scheme FS1 defining the formation of the E·ATP·Ile complex, thermodynamic linkage with associated error propagation (primarily in K 1, see above), suggestsK 4 = 1.7 ± 0.9 μm. Despite this slight uncertainty, the major conclusion is that the binding of either substrate to E reduces the K d for the formation of the ternary E·ATP·Ile complex by >10-fold compared with the K d obtained for either substrate binding to free E (Figs. 3 and 4). Although Table II predicts that Ile binds more tightly to E·ATP than to the free enzyme, there is no information concerning the rate constantsk +4 and k -4. Initial experiments to monitor the association kinetics of Ile withE·ATP (prior to the chemical step) proved difficult to interpret since, at low [Ile], k obs,1(defining the formation of the ternary E·ATP·Ile complex) had a similar rate constant and amplitude tok obs,2 (defining the catalytic formation of E·Ile-AMP·PPi). In an attempt to kinetically resolve the bimolecular Ile binding step from the first order catalytic step, we conducted experiments at high [Ile] (up to 300 μm) although this necessarily led to rapid transients and associated uncertainty (Fig. 6 A). The apparent observed rate constant increased approximately linearly with [Ile] (Fig. 6 B), yielding an intercept of 22 ± 13 s−1 and a slope of 1.6 × 106 m −1 s−1. These values only represent k -4 and k +4when the bimolecular formation of E·ATP·Ile occurs much more rapidly than the decay of the ternary complex (at ∼60 s−1). However, the predicted species distribution (based on Scheme FS1, Table I) suggests that both processes are likely to be kinetically linked below 150 μm Ile (Fig. 6 D). Only the data between 150 and 250 μm Ile (which yieldedk obs ∼ 450 s−1; close to the upper limit for reliable measurements on our apparatus) could be used to estimate the elementary rate constants (k +4 ∼ 1.6 × 106 m −1 s−1) and, therefore, we can estimate only k -4 <10 s−1. This value is, as we noted above, significantly less than the estimate of the rate of the chemistry step (about 60 s−1) such that rapid equilibrium assumptions associated with Ile binding toE·ATP are invalid. Despite the difficulty in obtaining a reliable estimate for k -4, and henceK 4, from either Table I or Fig. 6 or by thermodynamic linkage with other more well defined equilibrium constants we obtain an estimate of K 4 = 1.7 ± 0.9 μm and hence k -4 ∼ 3 ± 1.5 s−1 from an estimate of k +4. Kinetic simulation of the experiments (Fig. 6 A, Scheme FS1, Table I, k -4 ∼ 3 ± 1.5 s−1) provided an adequate description of the experimental transients (Fig. 6 C) and of the apparent rate constant for the chemistry step at different [Ile] (Table II). We believe the combined data justifies the estimate of k -4 and henceK 4 with appropriate caveats regarding the uncertainty associated with these value. Binding of ATP to free E was sufficiently weak (K 2 = 2.5 mm) to be expected to be a rapid equilibrium on the stopped-flow time scale, an assumption we have incorporated into simulations of Scheme FS1 (k +2 = 107 m −1 s−1,k -2 = 2.5 × 104s−1, e.g. Fig. 6 D). As such, we would expect no difference in the kinetics of E·Ile-AMP formation when the E·ATP complex was mixed with Ile and when both substrates were mixed with E simultaneously. To test this hypothesis (Fig. 7), a fixed concentration of the pre-bound substrate was maintained in both stopped-flow syringes, so that any pre-established equilibria were not perturbed upon subsequent mixing with the second substrate. As expected, the stopped-flow time course obtained was identical whether or not ATP was pre-mixed with E (Fig. 7 A, note that the traces have been offset for clarity). In contrast, the fluorescence amplitude observed following pre-binding of Ile toE reflects the difference in fluorescence intensity betweenE·Ile and E·Ile-AMP (Fig. 1). Kinetic simulation of the experiments in Fig. 7 A (Scheme FS1, Table I) provided a reasonable description of the experimental data (Fig. 7 B) with exponential rate constants (46 s−1) comparable to those observed experimentally (40–44 s−1). Since theE·Ile-AMP complex is relatively stable (rate constant for decay of E·Ile-AMP < 3 × 10−4s−1; data not shown), it could be isola"
https://openalex.org/W2067682525,"Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerases (PPIases) are enzymes capable of isomerizing a Xaa-Pro peptide bond. Three families of PPIases are known: cyclophilins, FKBPs, and parvulins. The physiological functions of the PPIases are only poorly understood. Eucaryotic members of the parvulin family have recently been shown to be essential for regulation of mitosis. Here we describe the purification and characterization of Ssp1, an abundant parvulin homolog from Neurospora crassa, which is unique among the known eucaryotic parvulins in containing a polyglutamine stretch between the N-terminal WW domain and the C-terminal PPIase domain. Ssp1 is asite-specific PPIase with respect to the amino acid N-terminal to the proline residue. Peptides with glutamate, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine in the −1-position proved to be the best substrates. Ssp1 is not only able to isomerize small peptides but is also active in protein folding, as shown with mouse dihydrofolate reductase. Using the substrate specificity of Ssp1, we could identify Glu81-Pro82 as a PPIase-sensitive site in folding of dihydrofolate reductase. These results demonstrate that Ssp1 is a potent mediator of protein folding and that parvulins can serve as tools to elucidate rate-limiting steps in protein folding reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2036521339,"In most non-excitable cells, calcium influx is signaled by depletion of intracellular calcium stores, a process known as capacitative calcium entry. Adenophostin A, a potent activator of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, has been reported to activate Ca2+ entry in Xenopus oocytes to a greater extent than expected on the basis of its ability to release calcium stores. In this study, we compared the abilities of adenophostin A and inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate ((2,4,5)IP3) to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores, to activate Ca2+ entry, and to activate calcium release-activated calcium current (I crac) in rat basophilic leukemia cells. Under conditions of low intracellular Ca2+ buffering (0.1 mm BAPTA), adenophostin A-induced Ca2+ release and activation of I crac could be monitored simultaneously. However, other reagents that would be expected to deplete Ca2+ stores ((2,4,5)IP3, 3-fluoro-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, thapsigargin, and ionomycin) were unable to activate I crac under this low Ca2+buffering condition. Adenophostin A activatedI crac after a significant delay, longer than the delay for Ca2+ release. Thus, adenophostin A activatesI crac as a consequence of release of intracellular Ca2+, rather than directly acting on store-operated channels. The unique ability of adenophostin A to activate I crac under conditions of low intracellular Ca2+ buffering suggests an additional site of action, perhaps in preventing or reducing rapid Ca2+-dependent inactivation of store-operated Ca2+ channels.

Stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors activates phospholipase C, which generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ((1,4,5)IP3)1 and diacylglycerol. (1,4,5)IP3 binds to its receptor on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and releases Ca2+stored therein. The depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores then signals the opening of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, a process known as capacitative calcium entry (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The signaling mechanism for the activation of capacitative calcium entry is not understood. A direct coupling model suggests that store depletion involves a functional coupling between (1,4,5)IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and Ca2+ entry channels on the plasma membrane (3Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 4Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Other models suggest that store depletion generates one or more second messengers which in turn activate Ca2+ entry channels (5Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). Adenophostin A, a compound isolated from the culture broth of thePenicillium brevicompactum, is the most potent known agonist for the (1,4,5)IP3 receptor. Its affinity for the (1,4,5)IP3 receptor is about 100-fold greater than that of (1,4,5)IP3 (6Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two reports (7DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that injection of adenophostin A into Xenopus oocytes produced a greater activation of Ca2+ entry (based on the activity of Ca2+-dependent Cl−channels) than would be expected solely as a result of release of intracellular Ca2+ stores, that is when compared with (1,4,5)IP3. With low concentrations of adenophostin A, DeLisle et al. (7DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported a stimulation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− current without a detectable release of intracellular Ca2+. This suggests that in addition to its action as an agonist for the (1,4,5)IP3 receptor, adenophostin A either acts downstream of (1,4,5)IP3 in the pathway signaling capacitative calcium entry (perhaps on the channels themselves) or preferentially releases Ca2+ from stores coupled to the activation of Ca2+ entry. In this study, we have examined the effects of adenophostin A on Ca2+ entry in a mammalian cell line, rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1). Adenophostin A and (2,4,5)IP3, both non-metabolizable analogs of (1,4,5)IP3, were compared with regard to their abilities to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores, to activate Ca2+ entry, and to activate the well characterized calcium release-activated calcium current (I crac) (9Parekh A.B. Penner R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). While we find no evidence for a direct activation of calcium entry or of I crac by adenophostin A, we have discovered an unusual and unique ability of adenophostin A to supportI crac under conditions of limited intracellular calcium buffering. Adenophostin A will be a useful tool for further investigations into the signaling mechanisms for capacitative calcium entry. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1, ATCC 1378-CRL, batch number F-13352) were cultured as recommended by ATCC. Adenophostin A was isolated as described previously (10Takahashi M. Kagasaki T. Hosoya T. Takahashi S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1993; 46: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Ionomycin and 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-1,4,5-trisphosphate (3-F-IP3) were obtained from Calbiochem, and (2,4,5)IP3 was obtained from Calbiochem or Sigma. Thapsigargin was purchased from LC Laboratories. The attached cells were mounted in a Teflon chamber and incubated with 1 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 25 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and bathed in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (in mm: 150 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2; HPSS) at room temperature for at least 10 min before Ca2+ measurements were made. The fluorescence of the fura-2-loaded cells was monitored with a photomultiplier-based system, mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a Nikon 40× (1.3 N.A.) Neofluor objective. The fluorescence light source was provided by a Deltascan D101 (Photon Technology International Ltd.), equipped with a light path chopper and dual excitation monochromators. The light path chopper enabled rapid interchange between two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), and a photomultiplier tube monitored the emission fluorescence at 510 nm, selected by a barrier filter (Omega). All experiments were carried out at 24 °C with cells incubated in HPSS. Calibration and calculation of [Ca2+]i were carried out as described previously (11Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The normal external saline was HPSS described above. Nominally Ca2+-free saline was the same except no CaCl2 was added. The bath volume (0.5 ml) was rapidly exchanged with a gravity perfusion system. The labels in the figures indicate the exact times when new bath solution was introduced, without any correction for the dead time required for a new solution to reach the cell. For fluorescence experiments, the patch pipette (2–4 MS, Corning glass, 7052) contained (in mm) 150 KCl, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 0.05 fura-2 free acid, 1 MgATP, pH 7.2. For measurement of I crac, the pipette solution was (in mm) 140 Cs-Asp, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA-Cs4, 1 MgATP (free Ca2+ 100 nm, pH 7.2). In someI crac experiments 0.1 mm BAPTA or EGTA was used instead of 10 mm BAPTA. The bath solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 CsCl, 10 CaCl2 (or 10 MgCl2 for Ca2+-free solution), 1.13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. Whole cell voltage clamp was carried out as described previously (12Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar,13Armstrong D. Rossier M.F. Shcherbatko A.D. White R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 635: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The holding potential was 30 mV, and Ca2+ entry was measured by stepping to −60 mV. I crac was measured at a potential of −100 mV from voltage ramps between −100 and +60 mV over a period of 160 ms. All voltages were corrected for a 10 mV liquid-junction potential. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Axopatch-1C amplifier and PCLAMP 6.1 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 300-fs intervals. Fig. 1 illustrates the protocol used to assess Ca2+ entry with a series of concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 and adenophostin A. Cells patch-clamped in the whole cell configuration were held at 30 mV to prevent Ca2+entry. The pipettes contained differing concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 or adenophostin A which induced release of intracellular Ca2+. For (2,4,5)IP3, this release was generally accompanied by the appearance of [Ca2+]i oscillations. This was true for adenophostin A as well, but only with the lower concentrations. 2The number of cells showing oscillations for (2,4,5)IP3 was 100 μm, 10/14; 25 μm, 12/12; and for adenophostin A was 10 μm, 0/6; 2 μm, 1/12; 0.25 μm, 6/8. Where indicated, the holding potential was changed to −60 mV to provide a controlled driving force for Ca2+ entry, and a subsequent rise in [Ca2+]i occurred. The [Ca2+]i rise at −60 mV with the protocol in Fig. 1 may give a reasonable estimate of Ca2+ entry at different concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 or adenophostin, but the initial [Ca2+]i spike is not likely a reliable indicator of the magnitude of release. As in previous studies (14Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

In this experiment, a cell incubated in nominally Ca2+-free medium (+ 1 mmEGTA to prevent Ca2+ entry due to ionomycin) was activated by 250 nm adenophostin A in the pipette. Subsequent addition of a high concentration (10 μm) of ionomycin induced a small release of Ca2+ compared with a control cell, indicative of significant depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by adenophostin A. Fig. 3 (top) summarizes the data for Ca2+ release by adenophostin A and (2,4,5)IP3. It was not possible to obtain graded release of Ca2+ with adenophostin A. 0.25 μmadenophostin A depleted Ca2+ to the same extent as the highest concentration tested, 10 μm, and lower concentrations (0.1 and 0.05 μm) failed to consistently activate release and entry. However, as reported previously (15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), one concentration of (2,4,5)IP3, 10 μm, induced a consistent and partial depletion of Ca2+ stores.Figure 3Aggregate data on Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry.

At 10 μm (2,4,5)IP3, release of Ca2+ was incomplete, and likewise, entry was lower than at other concentrations. Interestingly, at the intermediate concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3, even though (2,4,5)IP3 appeared to release Ca2+ maximally, the Ca2+ entry response was significantly less that that seen with adenophostin A. The level of Ca2+ entry in Figs. 1 and 3 is determined not only by Ca2+ entry but also the extrusion across the plasma membrane and uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, we decided to examine the effect of adenophostin A and (2,4,5)IP3 on Ca2+ entry by using techniques that avoid these complicating factors. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4, prior to changing the holding potential to −60 mV, the external medium was changed from one containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ to one containing 10 mm Ba2+. Ba2+ is able to permeate the channels opened by depleting intracellular stores but is not a substrate for plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+pumps (16Vanderkooi J.M. Martonosi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 144: 99-106Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi D.T. Green J. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 197-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kwan C.Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 678-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The summarized data in Fig. 4 shows that Ba2+ entry is not significantly different when activated by 25 μm (2,4,5)IP3 or 0.25 μmadenophostin A. Another technique for assessing Ca2+ entry that avoids effects of Ca2+ pumps is to measure the current associated with entry directly, the calcium release-activated calcium current, orI crac (19Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Fig. 5shows that adenophostin A activates an inward current in RBL-1 cells and that this current has the following properties indicating that it is I crac: (i) the current is strongly inwardly rectifying with a magnitude and current-voltage relationship similar to that previously described for I crac by Hoth and Penner (19Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar); (ii) the current is observed with strong intracellular calcium buffering (10 mm BAPTA) but is lost when external calcium is removed (Fig. 5). Consistent with the result from the Ba2+ experiments, the amount of I crac activated with adenophostin A was the same as that with (2,4,5)IP3 at all concentrations except for 10 μm (2,4,5)IP3, which only partially depleted the intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 6). Therefore, the results suggest that adenophostin A and (2,4,5)IP3 activate Ca2+entry similarly. Because of the different results from those obtained in the Ca2+ entry experiments, in some experiments we followed the exact same protocol as used in Fig. 1, that is holding the cell at 30 mV and measuring I crac with 1.8 mm external Ca2+ at 300 s after the establishment of whole cell configuration. Again, there was no difference in the amount of I crac activated (1.84 ± 0.28 pA/pF, n = 7, for 0.25 μm adenophostin A versus 1.82 ± 0.11 pA/pF, n = 6, for 25 μm (2,4,5)IP3). The potential meaning of the disparate findings with measurement of net [Ca2+]i changes compared with Ba2+entry or I crac will be addressed under “Discussion.”Figure 6I crac is activated to a similar extent with adenophostin A or (2,4,5)IP3.Cells were held at 30 mV. I crac was determined every 5 s after the establishment of the whole cell configuration with a voltage ramp from −100 to 60 mV. I cracwas measured as the average current (from 10 to 12 ms after the initiation of ramp). Non-I crac current or leak current was taken as the current in nominally Ca2+-free solution or as the current before I crac was activated, and this current was subtracted. Current density was then determined by normalizing I crac amplitude to cell capacitance which is proportional to cell surface area. The external [Ca2+] was 10 mm. The data forI crac with (2,4,5)IP3 are the same as those reported previously (15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and were obtained as a part of the same series of experiments as for adenophostin A. Means ± S.E. from 4 to 17 independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results to this point reveal no clear distinctions between the actions of (2,4,5)IP3 and adenophostin A. Thus, the ability of adenophostin A to activate Ca2+ entry and I crac may result from its ability to release intracellular Ca2+ stores, rather than from a direct effect on calcium entry channels. To investigate further this issue, we examined the temporal relationship between the activation of I crac and Ca2+ release, as we did in an earlier study for (2,4,5)IP3 (15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We measured the latency for I crac activation with adenophostin A and compared that with the latency for Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. We found that adenophostin A activatedI crac with a latency correlating to, but longer than, the latency for Ca2+ release (Fig. 7). A similar pattern for Ca2+ release and I crac activation was found for (2,4,5)IP3 (15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, adenophostin A appears to activate I crac only after Ca2+release from intracellular Ca2+ stores is well under way, suggesting that adenophostin A activates I cracas a result of the release of intracellular Ca2+, rather than through a direct action on store-operated Ca2+channels or some other site downstream of Ca2+ release. One complication in the interpretation of the kinetic data in Fig. 7 is that the measurement of Ca2+ release and I crac are carried out under different experimental conditions. In the fura-2 experiments to measure Ca2+ release, the pipette solution contains a modest amount of Ca2+ buffer (0.1 mm EGTA) so that net changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ can be observed. On the other hand, measurements of I crac in this study (as well as in all other published studies) were carried out with a much higher concentration of Ca2+ buffer in the pipette (10 mm BAPTA or EGTA) to minimize Ca2+-dependent inactivation of I crac. Thus, we attempted to design a protocol that would permit measurement of I crac and Ca2+ release (with fura-2) simultaneously on a single RBL-1 cell. The cells were loaded with fura-2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and cells were patch-clamped with pipettes containing the Cs+-containing I crac intracellular solution with 50 μm fura-2 but with BAPTA reduced to 0.1 mm. To minimize Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-induced inactivation, we held the cell at +30 mV.I crac was assayed by a short ramp (from −100 to 60 mV for 160 ms) every 1–5 s. With this protocol, we expect Ca2+ entry to be greatly reduced during the inter-ramp interval and to be mainly limited to the short duration of the ramp. As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, this procedure resulted in the development of a significant inward current when 0.5 μmadenophostin A was included in the pipette. This current had an I-V relationship expected of I crac (Fig. 8); with these ionic conditions, no other known current could produce such an I-V relationship. The current was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ but did not depend on the level of [Ca2+]i, consistent with Ca2+ acting as a charge carrier rather than as an activator of the current. Thus, the current has all of the properties expected of the depletion-activated current, I crac, seen with stronger intracellular Ca2+ buffers. Surprisingly, (2,4,5)IP3 (two batches from two different sources) completely failed to activate any detectableI crac (Table I) with this protocol even though Ca2+ is almost depleted to the same extent as with adenophostin A (Fig. 3). Furthermore, three other store-depletion reagents (3-F-IP3, thapsigargin, and ionomycin) similarly failed to activate I cracwith the low Ca2+ buffer protocol (Table I). 3-F-IP3 is another nonhydrolyzable (1,4,5)IP3analog. The K d for 3-F-IP3 for the (1,4,5)IP3 receptor is comparable to that of (1,4,5)IP3 (13 nm compared with 6 nm for (1,4,5)IP3 by the same assay) but still higher than that for adenophostin A. The average peak Ca2+release induced by 3-F-IP3 was 256.8 ± 23.5 nm(n = 9 at 50 μm) and 330.0 ± 1.0 nm (n = 2 at 100 μm), respectively, similar to that observed for (2,4,5)IP3 and adenophostin A (Fig. 1 and not shown). Finally, with the high Ca2+ buffer protocol, all of the above store-depleting reagents activated I crac to a similar extent with almost 100% success rate (not shown), suggesting that the difference between adenophostin A and other store-depletion reagents is only seen with the more physiological low Ca2+ buffering protocol.Figure 9Time course of development of I crac and changes in [Ca2+]i in an adenophostin A-activated RBL-1 cell with low intracellular Ca2+ buffering. An RBL-1 cell was patched with a pipette containing 0.5 μm adenophostin A and with a pipette solution buffered with 0.1 mm BAPTA rather than the 10 mm BAPTA used for the experiments in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6. Membrane potential was held at 30 mV and I crac assessed every second with ramps from −100 to 60 mV lasting 160 ms.

Open table in a new tab From the experiment depicted in Fig. 9, some interesting observations about the nature of the Ca2+-mediated inactivation of I crac can be made. In this particular experiment, the initial sampling of I cracoccurred every second. This resulted in an elevated [Ca2+]i which did not return to base line, suggesting that with this schedule, sufficient Ca2+ enters during the ramp (presumably at a very high rate due to diminished inactivation) to maintain the average [Ca2+]i at a level similar to that seen with sustained activation at a physiological membrane potential (as in Fig. 1). Yet, this sustained level of around 250 nm [Ca2+]i is obviously insufficient to induce inactivation because a significant inward current develops. This is consistent with the prior suggestion (20Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 21Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) that Ca2+-dependent inactivation of I crac results from the action of Ca2+ at a site very close to the mouth of the channel and is insensitive to the [Ca2+]i in the bulk of the cytoplasm (22Louzao M.C. Ribeiro C.M.P. Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14807-14813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Note that when the inter-ramp interval was increased to 5 s, the average [Ca2+]i declined substantially, whereas I crac changed little. Removal and restoration of external Ca2+ reversed and reinstated I crac with minimal effects on [Ca2+]i. Finally, changing the holding potential to −60 mV caused I crac to disappear completely, because sustained entry of Ca2+ through the channel causes inactivation to a level below that which can be detected. However, the steady-state [Ca2+]i level at −60 mV was not substantially different from that in the initial phase of the experiment, when the inter-ramp interval was 1 s butI crac was well developed. Again, this is consistent with the conclusion that it is the Ca2+concentration in the microenvironment of the Ca2+ channel rather than the global, cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i which is responsible for inactivation of the Ca2+ entry channels. It is presumed that when Ca2+ entry occurs physiologically,i.e. at −60 mV, the observed sustained entry of Ca2+ is due to I crac, but the level of the current is below that which can be detected with current technology. However, this has not been unequivocally established by either the current studies or any previous work on the electrophysiology of store-operated Ca2+ channels. The low Ca2+-buffering protocol with adenophostin A permits simultaneous measurement of I crac activation and Ca2+ release, and thus the latencies for these two events can be directly compared. Fig. 10illustrates a typical finding with adenophostin A; there was a clear delay for the activation of I crac after Ca2+ release was initiated. Fig. 11 summarizes a number of experiments using this technique to simultaneously examine Ca2+ release and I crac activation. Two concentrations of adenophostin A, 0.5 and 2.0 μm, were employed, and as was seen in the earlier experiments, at both concentrations there was a significant delay between the initiation of release and the initiation of I crac.Figure 11Relationship between Ca2+release and I crac activation utilizing the method for simultaneous assessment of Ca2+ release and I crac. The protocol was as depicted in Fig. 9 and the kinetic parameters as defined in Fig. 7. At both 0.5 and 2.0 μm adenophostin A, the latency for the development of I crac was significantly greater than the latency for initiation of Ca2+ release as well as the time to peak Ca2+ release. The data summarize data from 14 experiments at 0.5 μm and 5 experiments at 2.0 μm adenophostin A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous reports suggest that adenophostin A can activate Ca2+ influx either in the absence of Ca2+release (7DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or with minimal Ca2+ release (8Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These investigations based their conclusions on the activities of Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels, an indirect reporter of [Ca2+]i changes. In this study, we examined the effects of adenophostin A and (2,4,5)IP3 on Ca2+ entry assessed indirectly by measurement of net [Ca2+]i changes and directly by measuring the store-operated Ca2+ current (I crac). For the most part, our results suggest that adenophostin A acts in a manner similar to that of (2,4,5)IP3 in activating Ca2+ entry, through release of intracellular Ca2+, rather than as a direct activator of store-operated Ca2+ channels or through some other mechanism independent of intracellular Ca2+ store depletion. We conclude this because with adenophostin A (i) we never observed activation of entry in the absence of Ca2+release, and (ii) there was a substantial delay between the activation of release and entry, similar to that observed previously for (2,4,5)IP3. Had we only utilized [Ca2+]i changes as an indicator of entry, we might have been misled into concluding that adenophostin was more efficient at inducing entry than (2,4,5)IP3. With intermediate concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3, net Ca2+ entry was not maximal, despite apparent complete depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores (Fig. 3). There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon: either (i) (2,4,5)IP3 (and not adenophostin A) activates a pathway for Ca2+ removal, or (ii) despite the ability of (2,4,5)IP3 to deplete stores completely in the absence of Ca2+ entry (i.e. with the protocol shown in Fig. 2), in the presence of Ca2+ entry some refilling of the stores occurs. We consider the latter alternative the more likely because previous studies have shown that (2,4,5)IP3 acts as a partial agonist compared with (1,4,5)IP3 when rate of release rather than extent of release is measured (23Marchant J.S. Chang Y.-T. Chung S.-K. Irvine R.F. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of Ca2+entry, (2,4,5)IP3 would be able to deplete completely the stores through submaximal activation of the (1,4,5)IP3receptor, but when entry elevates [Ca2+]i, some refilling would occur. Presumably adenophostin A is a full agonist for the receptor producing a maximal permeability increase, and little or no refilling would occur. Despite similarities in the actions of adenophostin A and (2,4,5)IP3, one particularly interesting and potentially significant difference was noted. Only adenophostin A was capable of consistently activating I crac in cells patch-clamped with low Ca2+ buffer solutions,i.e. when [Ca2+]i was permitted to fluctuate. (2,4,5)IP3 failed to supportI crac under this condition, even when employed at a concentration of 100 μm; at this concentration its Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry activation appear maximal and similar to adenophostin A (Table I and Fig. 3). It has not previously been possible to observe I crac in RBL cells without the presence of high concentrations of intracellular buffers. In the present study, even with adenophostin AI crac could only be observed when entry was largely prevented by the use of a positive holding potential. We assume that during calcium entry under physiological conditions,i.e. when an increase in the fura-2 signal is observed, this entry is mediated at least in part by I crac at a level below that which can be detected with present patch clamp technology. Adenophostin A provides for the first time a means to monitor the activity of the channels underlyingI crac while observing changes in [Ca2+]i due to intracellular Ca2+release. Despite the appearance that adenophostin A and (2,4,5)IP3release Ca2+ and activate I crac by similar mechanisms, we conclude that adenophostin A has some additional, unique action which (2,4,5)IP3 does not share. Adenophostin A does not appear to prevent Ca2+-dependent inactivation totally, as shown by the results in Fig. 9, that is when Ca2+ entry proceeds continuously through the channels, neither agent produces detectableI crac because Ca2+-dependent inactivation makes the current too small to detect. Note that Ca2+-dependent inactivation is assumed to underlie the failure of (2,4,5)IP3, thapsigargin, and ionomycin to activate detectable I crac with low Ca2+buffers, but this is not proven. The Ca2+-dependent inactivation that occurs close to the mouth of the channel (21Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) should be considerably reduced by holding at +30 mV. However, there are other slower mechanisms of inactivation (24Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that may be more sensitive to the global [Ca2+] in the cytoplasm. One possibility is that adenophostin A prevents or attenuates only the rapid inactivation that occurs in or near the cytoplasmic opening of the store-operated calcium channel. Regardless of the explanation, the ability to measure physiologically relevant changes in [Ca2+]iresulting from Ca2+ release simultaneously with measurement of I crac will be a useful tool for future research into the quantitative and temporal relationships between Ca2+ discharge and I crac activation. One example in the present study is the clear demonstration of a delay between the release of Ca2+ and the initiation of I crac. This delay supports the idea of a diffusible signal responsible for the activation of the capacitative calcium entry channels, rather than a direct physical interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane (4Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Such an observation has been made previously with (2,4,5)IP3, but it was necessary to compare cells activated under very different conditions (release with low buffering; I cracwith high buffering) (15Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) weakening the interpretation of these experiments considerably. Unlike the previous work with Xenopus oocytes (7DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we found no evidence for a dissociation between the ability of adenophostin A to release Ca2+ and its ability to activate entry. The substantial delay between release of Ca2+ and activation of I crac argues against a direct activation of the channels by adenophostin A. The findings in oocytes may be related to the same property of adenophostin A which in the current study results in the consistent activation of I crac under low Ca2+-buffering conditions. Alternatively, the studies in oocytes utilized Ca2+-dependent chloride currents for assessment of [Ca2+]i changes, and it is possible that they may sometimes underestimate the extent of Ca2+ release, particularly if it occurs at sites which are not in the proximity of the Ca2+-sensitive chloride channels. Regardless of the explanation, it is clear from the earlier work in oocytes and from the present work in RBL-1 cells that adenophostin A may have interesting actions in addition to its ability to activate (1,4,5)IP3receptors with high affinity. It may thus prove a useful tool for unraveling the molecular pathways that regulate capacitative calcium entry. We gratefully acknowledge discussions with and comments by Drs. Gary Bird, Jerry Yakel, and Lisa Broad which greatly assisted in the preparation of this manuscript."

One striking feature of the identified critical α chain residues found within this repeat is that aromatic side chains are important for ligand recognition (Fig. 1), reminiscent of previous observations regarding human growth hormone interaction with its receptor (17Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Also found in the α chain N-terminal region are three predicted divalent cation-binding motifs within repeats V–VII. Each putative cation-binding N-terminal repeat lacks a potential coordinating residue at the most C-terminal position of the cation-binding loop (26Takada Y. Elices M.J. Crouse C. Hemler M.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One possible model is that a residue from a ligand may complete metal coordination within one of these domains to stabilize ligand binding (28Dransfield I. Buckle A.-M. Hogg N. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although data regarding substitution mutations in this region are inconsistent with this proposition (29Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent molecular modeling of the 7-repeat N-terminal domain of the integrin α chain has led to the proposal that it is arranged in a 7-bladed “propeller” structure (18Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This model uses intradomain contacts to bury hydrophobic residues and provides an explanation for why ligand-derived peptides can cross-link to multiple α chain repeats. This is based on the hypothesis that the ligand contact surface of the integrin chain may involve several neighboring repeats binding to a single substrate (19D’Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A.

To investigate the model that identical integrin residues are involved in invasin and natural substrate adhesion, the following work examines three derivatives harboring mutations in a region of α3homologous to the regions shown to be important for substrate recognition (13Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two mutations (α3-Y218A and α3-W220A) lie in the third N-terminal repeat in a region predicted to adopt a β-turn structure on the surface of the α chain integrin subunit (13Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the third mutation (α3-D154A) lies in the second N-terminal repeat. The results indicate that loss of side chains previously implicated in natural substrate recognition of the α subunit is not sufficient to cause loss of recognition of invasin by integrin receptors. Invasin and natural substrates may recognize an overlapping, but nonidentical, set of residues on the integrin receptor during adhesion. Bacterial strains DH5α (supE44ΔlacU169 (φ80lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1), JM109 (recA1 supE44 endA1 hsdR17 gyrA96 relA1 thi Δ(lac-proAB)), and BMH71–18 (thi supE Δ(lac-proAB) mutS::Tn10) were grown in L broth or 2× YT supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 10 μg/ml tetracycline as required.

E. coli BMH 71-18, harboring oligonucleotide-mutagenized pSelect plasmids (Promega, Madison, WI), was grown overnight at 37 °C in L broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. DNA was isolated (Qiagen) after mutagenesis and transformed into E. coli JM109. K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Irvine Scientific) containing 10% FCS2 (Sigma), penicillin, and streptomycin. K562 transfectants expressing wild type α4integrin (KA4), three derivatives harboring α4 mutations (N283E, D346E, and D408E), or vector with no insert (KpF) were as described (29Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stably transfected K562 cells were grown in media supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Geneticin (G418) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Mouse anti-α4 mAb B-5G10, anti-α3 A3-X8, and anti-α3 A3-IVA5 were as described (30Arroyo A.G. Sanchez Mateos P. Campanero M.R.

Mouse anti-α5 antibody VD1 was described previously (4Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate was purchased from Sigma. Plasmid pSelect and related reagents were purchased from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI). An invasin derivative containing the C-terminal 497 amino acids of invasin fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-INV497) was purified from SR2 (pRI285) as described (33Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A plasmid harboring the wild type complete cDNA of integrin α3, pFneoα3, was described (34Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8651-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pFneoα3, containing the entire α3 cDNA, was digested with XbaI and the liberated ∼3500-base pair full-length α3-encoding fragment was inserted into XbaI-cut pSelect vector (Promega). Five α3 substitutions were constructed using the pSelect system as described (see Ref. 31Saltman L.H. Lu Y. Zaharias E.M. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23438-23444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; Promega Biotech). Mutations were incorporated into the gene using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: 5′GGGTCAGAAGCCCAGCGGCGCATG (D154A), 5′GCCCCCGGTGCCGCCAACTGGAAAGG (Y218A), 5′CCCGGTGCCTACGCCTGGAAAGGAAA C (N219A), 5′GGTGCCTACAACGCGAAAGGAAACAGC (W220A), 5′TACAACTGGAAAGCAAACAGCTACATG (G222A). Substitutions were confirmed by sequencing, and the altered α3 genes were returned to plasmid pFneoα3 as XbaI fragments. Sequencing confirmed proper gene replacement within the pFneoα3 vector. pFneoα3 containing each of the α3 inserts was transfected into K562 cells by electroporation using 20 μg of plasmid DNA and 5 × 106 cells at 230 V, 960 microfarads (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser). Cells were grown 48 h in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin. After 48 h, cells were supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418, and stable transfectants were selected. Following 2 weeks of selection, α3-expressing cells were enriched by sorting with magnetic anti-mouse IgG-coated beads (Dynal Co. Oslo, Norway) coated with a 1:10 dilution of mouse anti-α3 antibody A3-X8 hybridoma supernatant. K562 cells transfected with wild type or mutant human α4 clones were sorted with magnetic anti-mouse IgG-coated beads (Dynal Co.) coated with a 1:1000 dilution of the purified anti-α4 antibody B-5G10 (∼1 μg/ml), and expression was analyzed by FACS analysis after 2 weeks grow out as described previously (29Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 96-Well microtiter plates (ICN Biochemicals) were coated with a series of dilutions of MBP-INV497 at a starting concentration of 100 μg/ml (33Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Pierschbacher M. Hayman E. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1224-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted, incubated with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C, recharged with 2 mm MgCl2, and repelleted. Cells were resuspended in RPMI containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 0.4% bovine serum albumin (Binding Buffer), counted, pelleted and resuspended in Binding Buffer at 5 × 106cells/ml. 25 μl of cells were transferred to wells in a 96-well plate and mixed with 25 μl of an undiluted supernatant of anti-α5β1 antibody VD1 or 25 μl of Binding Buffer for 1 h at room temperature to block α5β1 binding to invasin. The 50-μl mixtures were transferred to wells of an invasin-coated 96-well microtiter plate and allowed to bind for 50 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Unbound cells were removed by washing three times with PBS, and bound cells were fixed with 100 μl of acetone/methanol (1:1). Cells were stained with 0.01% crystal violet in H2O for 30 min at room temperature, washed 5–10 times with H2O, and lysed with 100 μl of 2% deoxycholate. Cell binding was determined at A 595 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Rad). Cells transfected with human α3 derivatives were enriched for those with the highest α3 expression using magnetic bead selection as described above. Adhesion of α3transfectants to epiligrin was determined by incubating cells in 96-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates (Falcon) in which a series of 1:2 dilutions of A431 cells starting at a highest density of 1.5 × 104 cells had been allowed to deposit extracellular matrix for 48 h as described (36Carter W.G. Kaur P. Gil S.G. Gahr P.J. Wayner E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3141-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 39Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Epiligrin concentration in wells was determined using anti-laminin 5 mAb 6F12 (see Ref. 37Marinkovitch M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; generous gift of Dr. R. E. Burgeson) and a colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To measure adhesion, 25 μl of cells, resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Binding Buffer, were mixed with 25 μl of either undiluted supernatant of the blocking anti-α3 antibody A3-IVA5 or a 1:100 dilution of the blocking anti-α3 antibody P1B5 ascites in Binding Buffer. Cells were incubated with antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and the 50-μl mixture was added to matrix-coated wells for 45 min at 37 °C. Unbound cells were removed by washing three times with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, and bound cells were fixed and stained as described above for α4transfectants. Binding to invasin was determined similarly, except that 96-well microtiter dishes (ICN Biochemicals) were coated with 100 μl of 1 or 5 μg/ml MBP-INV497, and cells were preincubated with 25 μl of a 1:2 dilution of culture supernatants of hybridomas producing VD1 or 25 μl of an equal mixture of the hybridoma supernatant and mAB A3-IVA5. The concentration of VD1 was sufficient to eliminate detectable binding to α5β1 (see Fig. 5). K562 transfectants expressing wild type or mutant α4 chains were pelleted, washed twice with PBS to remove G418 and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics, grown overnight in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, washed once with PBS, and grown overnight again in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS. To assay uptake, mammalian cells were pelleted and resuspended in Binding Buffer at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and 500-μl cells were added for 60 min at room temperature to a 24-well tissue culture-treated plate in the presence or absence of 50 μl anti-α5β1 VD1 antibody. A 10-μl aliquot of 1 × 108 bacteria/ml of MC4100 harboring plasmid pJL277 (inv + (31Saltman L.H. Lu Y. Zaharias E.M. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23438-23444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) or pT7-12 (vector without insert) was added to cells preincubated with or without mAb VD1 and allowed to internalize bacteria for 90 min at 37 °C. 50 μg/ml gentamicin was then added for 90 min at 37 °C; cells were washed three times by pelleting at 2000 rpm in microcentrifuge tubes, and the eukaryotic cells were lysed with 200 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100. Liberated bacteria were diluted and plated on L agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacterial uptake was calculated as number of bacteria internalized/bacteria added. K562 transfectants expressing α3 were tested for bacterial uptake in a similar fashion except that theinv + strain used was MC4100/pRI203 (2Isberg R.R. Voorhis D.L. Falkow S. Cell. 1987; 50: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and theinv − strain was MC4100. In addition, the effects of anti-α3 antibodies P1B5 and A3-IVA5 were determined by including them in the VD1 preincubation at a dilution of 1:200 or 1:10, respectively. Analyses of blocking antibodies as well as site-specific mutagenesis indicate that in the α4, α5, and αIIb chains, there exists a region within the third “FG-GAP” repeat (Fig. 1) that is critical for adhesion (11Schiffer S.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To begin to analyze the role of the α3 chain in invasin-mediated uptake, and to determine if residues recognized by invasin are identical to those recognized by natural substrates, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate five substitutions of the human α3 chain. The substitutions changed residues of the third N-terminal repeat shown to be important in substrate recognition in other α chains, as well as a residue located in the second N-terminal repeat. The derivatives α3-Y218A, α3-W220A (third repeat), and α3-D154A (second repeat) were stably expressed in K562 cells as determined by FACS analysis using the anti-α3 monoclonal antibody P1B5 (Fig. 2), whereas α3-N219A and α3-G222A were not expressed (data not shown). Stable cell lines expressing α3 substitutions were tested for adhesion to invasin and to an extracellular matrix containing epiligrin, a natural α3β1 integrin ligand comprised of a mixture of laminins 5 and 6 (38Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). A dose-response curve of cell adhesion to increasing amounts of epiligrin was performed by incubating transfectants in microtiter wells that had been coated by ECM deposited by A431 cells (see “Materials and Methods”). The concentration of laminin 5 deposited in the wells was dependent on the density of A431 cells (Fig. 3 A). K562 cells harboring substitutions α3-Y218A and α3-W220A showed no detectable adhesion to the laminin 5-containing matrix in the absence of blocking anti-α3 antibody, even at the highest concentrations of laminin 5 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the derivative α3-D154A containing a substitution in the second repeat adhered considerably better than the wild type α3 (α3-wt) transfectant (Fig. 3 B). This high adhesion efficiency was clearly dependent on the presence of the α3 chain, as both wild type receptor and the D154A derivative were unable to promote adhesion to matrix if anti-α3 mAb P1B5 was included in the adhesion mix (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that residues present in repeat III of α3 that are predicted to contribute to adhesion to natural substrate are required for adhesion by α3β1. Furthermore, there appears to be a region within repeat II that modulates the binding efficiency of the integrin to natural substrate (Fig. 3 B). A second result that implicated a role for repeat II in adhesion to substrate was the fact that transfectants expressing α3-D154A were not blocked for adhesion to matrix by the anti-α3 mAb A3-IVA5 (Fig. 3 B) because they were not recognized by this reagent. Antibody A3-IVA5 failed to elicit homotypic aggregation of transfectants harboring this derivative (data not shown; see Ref. 34Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8651-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FACS analysis showed that this derivative failed to be recognized by A3-IVA5, although the other blocking mAb, P1B5, recognized α3-D154A as well as the other α3 derivatives (Fig. 2, C and H). As derivatives that failed to bind epiligrin could be recognized by A3-IVA5 and P1B5, this indicates that recognition of substrate and of blocking mAbs does not necessarily involve interaction with identical residues. Furthermore, a region not previously demonstrated to be involved in recognition of natural substrates is recognized by a blocking mAb (Fig. 2, C and H) and appears to modulate binding to epiligrin. Adhesion to invasin by K562 cells expressing the α3 derivatives was determined in the presence of the blocking anti-α5β1 antibody VD1, which inhibits binding to the sole endogenous invasin receptor, the α5β1 integrin (40Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The α3-Y218A derivative showed a small defect for cell adhesion to invasin, relative to wild type, when invasin was coated at either 1 or 5 μg/ml (Fig. 4, A and B). This compares to the total loss of adhesion to epiligrin by this derivative (Fig. 3). The α3-W220A and α3-D154A derivatives, on the other hand, adhered to invasin as well as or better than transfectants harboring the wild type α3 chain (Fig. 4, A and B). That adhesion was dependent on α3β1 was shown by the addition of the blocking anti-α3 antibody A3-IVA5, which reduced adhesion of K562 cells expressing α3-Y218A to background levels if wells were coated with 1 μg/ml invasin or to 50% when coated at 5 μg/ml invasin (relative to “inv + VD1”) (Fig. 4, A and B). Antibody A3-IVA5 decreased adhesion of cells expressing α3-W220A or α3-wt to 1 μg/ml invasin to ∼50% levels. A3-IVA5 had no effect on α3-D154A-mediated adhesion to invasin consistent with results of the previous experiment indicating that this substitution derivative lacks the A3-IVA5 recognition epitope (Figs. 2 and 4,A and B). As bacterial uptake into cultured cells is a more stringent assay than adhesion (33Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the ability of α3derivatives to internalize E. coli expressing invasin was determined. K562 transfectants were challenged with bacteria in the presence or absence of anti-α5 and anti-α3antibodies, and uptake was assayed (see “Materials and Methods”). Transfectants harboring the α3-wt, α3-Y218A, α3-W220A, and α3-D154A derivatives were all capable of internalizing bacteria expressing invasin, although uptake promoted by α3-Y218A was consistently 50–75% of that seen with α3-wt (Fig. 5). Interestingly, in the absence of anti-α5 antibody, both α3-Y218A and α3-W220A displayed reduced uptake levels relative to wild type α3 transfectants (Fig. 5), indicating that binding to α5β1may be less active in promoting bacterial internalization than α3β1, and binding of bacteria to α5β1 may interfere with access to α3β1. The antibody A3-IVA5 was able to inhibit uptake by all α3 derivatives, except α3-D154A, indicating uptake was dependent on α3β1(Fig. 5). As the effects of α3 chain mutations that eliminate integrin adhesion to natural substrate had little or no effect on cellular adhesion to invasin or on invasin-promoted uptake, we decided to compare these results to the analysis of other previously characterized mutants within human α chains. Potentially, the higher affinity of invasin for integrin receptors relative to natural ligands means that single amino acid substitutions that affect natural substrate adhesion are not sufficiently drastic to eliminate adhesion to invasin. Masumoto and Hemler (29Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) isolated three integrin α4substitutions containing the conservative substitutions N283E, D346E, or D408E at position 3, respectively, of the three proposed divalent cation-binding loops residing within N-terminal repeats 5–7 (Fig. 1). All three derivatives showed strong defects in their adhesion to VCAM-1 (10–50% binding) and CS-1 (alternatively spliced fibronectin, no binding) relative to wild type α4. Binding to invasin shows a moderate defect for each mutant (65–70% binding). The invasin-binding phenotype of these K562 mutants was investigated further. Transfected cells were sorted using magnetic beads coated with the anti-α4 antibody B-5G10 (see “Materials and Methods”), and surface expression was confirmed by FACS analysis (Fig. 6). When tested for binding to invasin-coated surfaces in the presence of anti-α5antibody, the coating concentration of invasin necessary to support half-maximal binding of K562 transfectants was only slightly greater for the mutants than for wild type α4 (Fig. 7, A and B).Figure 7Binding of α4β1transfectants to microtiter well immobilized invasin. Microtiter plates were coated with 100 μl of serial dilutions of MBP-INV497 (33Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”), and adhesion of K562 cell transfectants was measured in the presence (A) or absence (B) of the blocking anti-α5 antibody VD1. Displayed are derivatives described in text, along with mock transfectant control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of these transfectants harboring α4 integrin substitutions to internalize an E. coli inv +strain was analyzed to determine if the small effects on adhesion had strong effects on uptake (see “Materials and Methods”). In contrast to the subtle defect of these mutants in adhesion to invasin-coated microtiter wells, the three α4 mutants displayed strong defects in α4β1-dependent, invasin-mediated bacterial uptake (Fig. 8). The strong defects observed support the model that moderate differences in adhesion can result in more pronounced defects in bacterial uptake (40Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These results also indicate that mutations that cause defects in cellular adhesion to natural substrates can cause drastic defects in invasin-mediated bacterial uptake, in contrast to the results with the mutations in repeat III of the α3 chain. The work presented here analyzed the relative effects of substitutions in the integrin α chain on substrate adhesion. Whereas mutations in the third N-terminal repeat of α3 abolished adhesion to the natural integrin ligand epiligrin (laminin 5; Fig. 3), integrins harboring these changes showed only small defects in adhesion to invasin (Fig. 4) even when tested in the more stringent assay of bacterial uptake (Fig. 5). A control mutation in the analogous region of the second N-terminal repeat, α3-D154A, gave the surprising result of enhanced adhesion to epiligrin. In contrast, integrins harboring substitutions in any of the three putative divalent cation binding domains of integrin α4 previously shown to be defective for natural ligand binding (29Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were severely defective for invasin-mediated bacterial uptake (Fig. 8). These results suggest that although ligand recognition may be mediated by the integrin α chain third N-terminal repeat (11Schiffer S.G. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Tizard R. Osborn L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), mutational change of any single residue in this region results in a receptor with considerable residual invasin binding activity. This is very different from results with natural ligands, in which substitutions of single critical residues eliminate adhesion. Furthermore, sequences in repeat II (Fig. 1) may play an important role in modulating the adhesion activity of the integrin, as a mutation in this repeat simultaneously stimulates adhesion to epiligrin and results in failure to bind a function blocking mAb. Although the α3 substitution mutants were much more defective for adhesion to epiligrin than invasin, one derivative, α3-Y218A, was more susceptible to antibody A3-IVA5 inhibition of invasin adhesion than was wild type receptor, consistent with this derivative being reduced in its affinity for invasin. Incomplete antibody inhibition of α3-W220A and α3-wt adhesion to invasin is most likely a reflection of the high affinity interaction of invasin with integrins (Fig. 4; see Ref. 4Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were found with the anti-α3antibody P1B5 (data not shown). The unusually strong affinity of integrin binding to invasin probably plays a role in the observed differences in recognition of altered integrin derivatives by invasin and epiligrin. Presumably, an overlapping set of residues on the α3 chain is required for adhesion to both invasin and natural substrates. Consistent with this hypothesis, cell lines expressing α3-Y218A showed defective adhesion to both a natural ligand and invasin, and mAb A3-IVA5 blocked interaction with both ligands. The high affinity of invasin for integrin receptors has the presumed consequence that single amino acid substitutions eliminating natural substrate adhesion are not sufficiently drastic to greatly affect adhesion to invasin. There are two likely explanations for why adhesion to invasin is more tolerant of such changes. First, during adhesion, invasin may engage more residues on the integrin receptor than do natural ligands. The overall binding energy contributed by these novel contacts may be sufficient to support adhesion to invasin in the absence of residues necessary for adhesion to natural substrates. Second, the residues engaged by invasin and natural substrates may be identical, but the binding energy contributed by the individual unaltered residues may be greater for adhesion to invasin than to other substrates. As a result, the relative contributions of the mutated residues to invasin adhesion would be less than that observed for adhesion to a natural substrate. The results presented here suggest that the α3β1 integrin is more active than α5β1 at promoting bacterial uptake. Substitution derivative α3-W220A showed no defect in the invasin adhesion assay, yet it appeared to be attenuated, compared with wild type α3, in its competition with endogenous α5β1 for promoting bacterial uptake (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the result that an anti-α5antibody stimulated bacterial uptake in cell lines expressing α3-W220A or α3-Y218A, whereas the wild type derivative showed no stimulation of bacterial uptake by this treatment (Fig. 5). The reduced bacterial uptake by α3-Y218A and α3-W220A in absence of anti-α5β1 antibody is apparently a by-product of two phenomena. When α3β1competes with α5β1 for adhesion to invasin, derivatives α3-Y218A and α3-W220A are presumably less efficient competitors of α5β1 than is α3-wt. In addition, bacterial adhesion to α3β1 would be predicted to result in more efficient phagocytosis than adhesion to α5β1. α3β1 has recently been shown to be specifically associated with tetraspan membrane proteins that are involved in a variety of signaling activities (41Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), whereas other integrins are apparently not associated with these proteins. Perhaps these integrin-associated proteins may provide important signals for invasin-mediated uptake. All three α4 derivatives tested were dramatically defective for invasin-mediated bacterial uptake relative to wild type receptor, indicating that substitution in three different N-terminal repeats affected invasin binding. As the bacterial uptake defect of each of the α4 mutants is approximately equal (Fig. 8), this suggests that substitution within any one cation-binding loop is no more detrimental to ligand interaction than another. These three cation binding domains may regulate the structure of the integrin α subunit, affecting the ligand-binding site at a distance. It has recently been suggested that the integrin α chain N-terminal repeats adopt a 7-bladed propeller structure resembling G-protein β subunits (18Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 42Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). According to this model, α3integrin chain residues Tyr-218 and Trp-220 reside on a solvent-exposed surface of the third blade (repeat) of the propeller. The finding that the α3 integrin substitution D154A in the second repeat is not recognized by the function-blocking antibody A3-IVA5 (Fig. 2) and stimulates ligand binding is surprising (Fig. 3) but consistent with this model. There are several explanations for the results regarding repeat II. The second and third repeats may be in sufficiently close proximity to allow a single antibody to bind to the repeats or allow steric interference of ligand binding to repeat III by an antibody bound to the neighboring repeat II. Antibody binding to one domain may also disrupt the structure of its neighbor by causing a conformational change. Additionally, sequences that are proximal in the linear sequence to Asp-154 may be required for ligand interaction. Finally, sequences in repeat II could modulate binding of substrate to repeat III. The D154A mutation may lock the integrin into a high affinity state that allows high efficiency substrate adhesion. In the propeller model, α3 residues Tyr-218, Trp-220, and Asp-154 are in close proximity on a solvent-exposed surface of the molecule, consistent with each of these scenarios (18Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Physical studies on the interaction of this region with substrates will directly test the validity of these models and provide an explanation for the apparent interaction between neighboring repeats.

Several studies suggest that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 may precede channel opening, and ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 may precede channel closing (10Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C.

Thus, despite shared amino acid sequences (∼29% identity), NBD1 and NBD2 appear to have different roles in controlling CFTR channel activity. However, our understanding of how nucleotides regulate CFTR is incomplete. Although several models have been proposed (13Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the mechanism and consequences of the ATP hydrolytic cycle at the NBDs is still not known. Studies of CFTR and other ABC transporters indicate that there is a functional interdependence between the NBDs in mediating ATPase activity (15Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); both NBDs must be functional for ATPase activity to occur. The physical basis of this interdependence has not been determined. Similarly, the timing and the role of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at each NBD relative to channel opening and closing are not fully established. At least three consensus sequences have been identified in the NBDs of CFTR and other ABC transporters: the Walker A and Walker B motifs and the LSGGQ motif (21Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 22Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and mutagenesis studies on other proteins have clearly shown the importance of the Walker A and B motifs in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (for a review, see Ref.23Glynn I.M. Hoffman J.F. J. Physiol. 1971; 218: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the function of the LSGGQ motif, a motif unique to and well conserved across all ABC transport proteins, is not well understood (22Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 24Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F.

Modeling studies have suggested that this motif may mediate an interaction between the NBDs and the membrane-spanning domains (24Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); sequence similarities with G proteins and mutagenesis studies, however, have suggested a role for this motif in mediating ATP hydrolysis (26Manavalan P. Dearborn D.G. McPherson J.M. Smith A.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2443-2448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To learn more about ATP regulation of CFTR and its structural basis, we introduced cysteine residues at analogous sites in the two NBDs of CFTR and studied the consequences of their covalent modification with the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Earlier work showed that the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein is inhibited in a nucleotide-dependent manner by NEM modification of an endogenous cysteine residue in the Walker A motif of either NBD1 or NBD2 (17al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We therefore used P-glycoprotein sequence to guide us in introducing a cysteine residue into the Walker A motif of NBD1 or NBD2 of CFTR. We also introduced a cysteine at the serine position of the LSGGQ motif in NBD1 or the LSGGQ-like motif (LSHGH) in NBD2. Following transient expression in HeLa cells, these mutants were studied using the excised, inside-out patch clamp technique. We examined their functional response to modification by NEM and the effect of nucleotides on the rate and the consequences of NEM modification. CFTR mutants were prepared in the pTM1-CFTR4 plasmid using the method of Kunkel (29Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by restriction digestion and by sequencing around the site of the mutation. In vitrotranscription and translation of each mutant was performed to assess expression of full-length protein. Wild-type and mutant CFTRs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 bacteriophage hybrid expression system as described previously (9Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were studied routinely 4–24 h after transfection, depending on the level of expression desired. Methods used for excised, inside-out patch clamp recordings were as described previously (13Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 30Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar). Voltages were referenced to the extracellular side of the membrane. Macropatch and single channel data were collected at −40 mV and −80 mV, respectively, and at 34–36 °C. In excised, inside-out patches of membrane, CFTR was activated by excising into a bath solution containing 1 mm ATP (magnesium salt; Sigma) and 75 nm of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA, Promega, Madison, WI). For excised, inside-out patches, the pipette (extracellular) solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 100 mmaspartic acid, 35.5 mm HCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, pH 7.3, with HCl. The bath (intracellular) solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 135.5 mm HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, 1 mm Cs4EGTA, pH 7.3, with HCl ([Ca2+]free < 10−8m). The magnesium salt of ATP was used throughout these studies. At MgATP concentrations greater than 2 mm, the bath solution was readjusted to pH 7.3 with 1.4 mm NaOH per 1 mm MgATP. When sodium pyrophosphate or sodium ADP were used, an equimolar amount of MgCl2 was also added to ensure high free Mg2+ concentrations. NEM was added to the cytosolic surface of patches; since NEM is stable in solution for hours at neutral to acidic pH (31Gregory J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 3922-3923Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar), NEM decomposition is not of concern during our time course studies. To evaluate the reaction rate of NEM under the conditions we used, we did experiments similar to those described previously (32Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Bath (intracellular) solution, pH 7.3 (TES), with or without ATP or PPi was used to prepare a 1 mm stock solution of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). β-Mercaptoethanol was added to this stock to a final concentration of 100 μm, causing it to turn yellow with the formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid. NEM was then added to a final concentration of 100 μm, causing the solution to become slowly clear again. Absorbance at 412 nm immediately following the addition of NEM was analyzed spectrometrically at room temperature (22–24 °C; Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer, Fullerton, CA). The rate of NEM modification of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, as determined by estimation of the pseudo-first order rate constant, was the same in the absence or presence of 5 mm ATP or 5 mm PPi(122 ± 4 s−1, 127 ± 9 s−1, and 116 ± 10 s−1, respectively, n = 3 each). Single channel current amplitudes were determined from an all points histogram. Single channel conductances were derived from the slope of a line fit by linear, least-squares regression to single channel I-V relationships at negative potentials (−40 to −100 mV). Excised macropatch data were filtered at 1 kHz using a variable eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 2 kHz. For single channel analysis, replayed data were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. Events lists for single channel analysis were created using a half-height transition protocol; transitions less than 1 ms in duration were excluded from analysis. Data analysis was done using the pClamp 6.0 software package (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA); curve fitting of macropatch data was done using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Open and closed time constants were derived from the fit of a one- or two-component exponential using the maximum likelihood method. Burst analysis was performed as described previously using a τc(the time that delineates interburst from intraburst closures) of 20 ms derived from single-channel closed time histograms (13Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Where indicated, τcs was calculated using the formulaP o = (T B ×P o, Burst)/(T B + τcs), where T B is the mean burst duration and P o, Burst is the open state probability within a burst. Results are presented as means ± S.E. for nobservations. Statistical significance was determined as indicated in the figure legends. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. NEM was dissolved in ethanol and kept on ice prior to its use. All reagents were obtained from Sigma. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence for the Walker A motif of NBD1 and NBD2 of both CFTR and P-glycoprotein. We introduced a cysteine residue by site-directed mutagenesis at residue 462 in NBD1 (termed the NBD1-Cys mutant) or residue 1248 in NBD2 (termed the NBD2-Cys mutant). These sites correspond to the location of cysteines in P-glycoprotein (Fig. 1). Both NBD1-Cys and NBD2-Cys mutants also contain the C832A mutation. This mutation largely removes the stimulatory effect of 100 μm NEM on wild-type CFTR but does not otherwise alter channel function (33Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25617-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine the functional consequences of NEM modification of the NBDs, we applied 100 μm NEM to the cytoplasmic side of excised membrane macropatches containing CFTR-C832A (control), NBD1-Cys, or NBD2-Cys mutant channels. As we have shown previously (33Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25617-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 100 μm NEM had a slight stimulatory effect on CFTR-C832A channel activity (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, NEM irreversibly inhibited the activity of both NBD1-Cys and NBD2-Cys (Fig. 2, B and C). NBD2-Cys was modified more rapidly than NBD1-Cys. The addition of vehicle alone (ethanol) had no effect on channel activity (33Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25617-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because the NBDs of CFTR are thought to interact with ATP, we hypothesized that ATP may alter the rate of NEM modification. In addition, because NEM modification occurs at a potential ATP binding site, we further speculated that after channels were completely modified by NEM, the ATP dependence would be altered, perhaps due to altered ATP affinity. To test this, we examined the effect of NEM in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. Fig. 2, Band C, shows that as ATP concentration increased, inhibition by NEM occurred more slowly. In Fig. 3, we quantify this effect. For the NBD2-Cys mutant, the decline in current following NEM application was well fit by a single decay exponential plus a constant (see legend to Fig. 3 A). This allowed us to quantify differences in the rate of modification and the effect of ATP concentration on fully modified channels. The reciprocal of the time constant, τ, derived from this analysis and shown in Fig. 3 A represents the pseudo-first order rate constant for NEM modification. The constant, I ∞, represents current through completely modified channels relative to that measured before NEM modification under the same conditions. When we studied the NBD1-Cys mutant at ATP concentrations > 0.1 mm, the time course of inhibition was not well fit by a single exponential; therefore, in Fig. 3 B we report only the percentage of current remaining at 5 min (however, the data at 0.1 mm ATP were well fit and are reported below). The NEM response of the CFTR-C832A mutant is also quantified in Fig. 3 B. For the NBD2-Cys mutant, the estimated τ increased with increasing ATP (Fig. 3 A); for the NBD1-Cys mutant, the percentage of current remaining at 5 min also increased with increasing ATP (Fig. 3 B). Because ATP decreased the rate of NEM modification, ATP binding must alter the accessibility or reactivity of the introduced Walker A cysteine. After complete modification by NEM of all the channels in a patch, some channel activity remained in NBD2-Cys (Fig. 3 A, I ∞). This indicates that NEM-modified channels retain function, albeit diminished. Fig. 3 A also shows the effect of ATP concentration on activity relative to that in unmodified channels. Increasing ATP concentrations at least partially overcame the inhibitory effects of NEM modification. This observation suggests that at least part of the effect of NEM modification is due to decreased ATP binding. The effects observed in the presence of increasing ATP were not due simply to increasing Mg2+ or a decrease in NEM reactivity. The rate of modification and ATP dependence of the fully modified NBD2-Cys mutant were similar at high and low MgCl2concentrations (τ = 16 ± 3 versus 10 ± 1 s, and I ∞ = 2 ± 1 versus8 ± 4% with 0.3 mm ATP and in the presence of either 13 mm MgCl2 or 3 mmMgCl2, respectively; n = 3 each). Similarly, the rate of NEM modification of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid was not affected by 5 mm ATP or 5 mmPPi (see “Experimental Procedures”). To learn how NEM inhibited current, we studied single channels. Fig. 4 shows current records from excised, inside-out patches containing either a single wild-type CFTR channel (A) or a single NBD1-Cys (B) or NBD2-Cys (C) mutant channel before and after NEM modification. Fig. 4and Table I show that neither mutant behaved markedly different from the wild-type molecule. NBD2-Cys had a slightly increased open state probability (P o) relative to wild-type CFTR due primarily to a slightly increased duration of burst activity. Neither single channel conductance nor any of the other time constants calculated for either mutant were significantly different from wild-type CFTR. Our earlier work showed that NEM did not alter the single channel properties of CFTR-C832A (33Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25617-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, NEM inhibited NBD1-Cys and NBD2-Cys channels by decreasing the P o (Fig. 4, Table I). The decreased P o was due to a marked increase in the long closed time between bursts of activity (τcs). Consistent with the macroscopic currents, some activity remained in both mutants following NEM modification. After NEM modification, the mean burst duration decreased in the NBD2-Cys mutant and tended to increase in the NBD1-Cys mutant. However, these changes were small compared with the changes in τcs.Table ISingle channel properties of wild-type CFTR with no mutations and NBD1-Cys and NBD2-Cys mutants.Wild typeNBD1-CysNBD1-CysNBD2-CysNBD2-CysNEM−−+−+g (pS)1-aSingle channel conductance (in picosiemens).9.6 ± 0.4 (8)9.8 ± 0.2 (9)10.3 (1)9.3 ± 0.4 (9)8.3 ± 0.3 (5)P o0.38 ± 0.02 (11)0.40 ± 0.02 (9)0.01 ± 0.011-bp < 0.05 relative to channel in absence of NEM.

Earlier work showed that adding PPi in the presence of ATP stimulates wild-type CFTR channel activity (12Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Carson M.R. Winter M.C. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20466-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PPi produced a marked prolongation of CFTR's burst duration and a shortening of the closed time interval between bursts. These and other studies suggested that PPi binds to the NBDs, perhaps at the site of ATP binding. To better understand the mechanism of PPi stimulation and its interaction with the NBDs, we examined the effects of PPi on the rate and consequences of NEM modification. As a control, we first asked whether the stimulatory effect of PPi was intact in the mutants. Table II shows that PPistimulated NBD1-Cys activity to levels similar to those observed with wild-type CFTR. With the NBD2-Cys mutant studied in the presence of 0.3 mm ATP, 5 mm PPi stimulated less current than in wild-type CFTR; this result is similar to the reduced effect of PPi in other NBD2 mutants (35Cotten J.F. Ostedgaard L.S. Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21279-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When we increased the PPi concentration to 10 mm, stimulation was similar in wild type and NBD2-Cys (Table II).Table IIThe effect of PPi and ADP on channel activity of wild-type CFTR with no mutations and NDB1-Cys and NBD2-Cys mutants.ConditionATP (mm)0.30.10.31PPi(mm)55100ADP (mm)0001Wild type (%)237 ± 23 (4)218 ± 3 (3)193 ± 7 (3)41 ± 4 (3)NBD1-Cys (%)242 ± 25 (3)279 ± 34 (3)ND2-aND, not done.36 ± 2 (3)NBD2-Cys (%)141 ± 6* (5)ND200 ± 8 (4)55 ± 2* (3)Data are percentage of macroscopic current compared with that in the presence of ATP alone (100%).

To determine if PPi would alter modification by NEM, we selected ATP and PPi concentrations that would allow us to detect an effect of PPi in either of the mutants. Fig. 5 shows that in the presence of PPi, NEM inhibited current in both NBD1-Cys and NBD2-Cys. However, comparison of the records with those shown in Fig. 2 suggests that PPi slowed the effect of NEM. Fig. 6 A shows that PPislowed the rate of NEM modification of NBD2-Cys. For NBD1-Cys, PPi also increased the percentage of current remaining at 5 min (Fig. 6 B). Visual inspection of Figs. 2 and 5 (and other tracings not shown) suggests that PPi also slowed the rate of modification of the NBD1-Cys channel. Similar to what we observed with increasing concentrations of ATP (Fig. 3 A, I ∞), PPi increasedI ∞ relative to that obtained in the absence of PPi (Fig. 6 A). This result indicates that, like ATP, PPi can partially overcome the inhibitory effects of NEM modification.Figure 6Effect of PPi (A and B) and ADP (C and D) on rate and extent of inhibition by NEM.

Table II shows that the inhibitory effect of ADP was intact for the NBD1-Cys mutant, although, as observed in channels containing other NBD2 mutations, inhibition was slightly diminished for the NBD2-Cys channel. Despite its diminished effect, ADP slowed the rate of modification of the NBD2-Cys channel (Fig. 6 C). In"

We demonstrate here that the ETS-2 repressor factor (ERF) is expressed in pituitary tumor cells and that overexpression of recombinant ERF inhibits prolactin promoter activity, but not the closely related growth hormone promoter. In non-pituitary cell lines, coexpression of ERF disrupts the cooperative interactions between Pit-1 and ETS-1 and blocks the induction of Pit-1-dependent prolactin promoter activity by cAMP. The potential role of ERF in the inhibitory response of the prolactin promoter to dopamine was examined using pituitary tumor cells stably expressing dopamine D2 receptors.

A single Pit-1 DNA-binding element from the prolactin promoter is sufficient to reconstitute the inhibitory response to ERF. DNA binding analysis using either a composite Pit-1/ETS protein-binding site or a Pit-1 element with no known affinity for ETS proteins revealed that ERF interferes with Pit-1 binding.

The transcription of the prolactin (PRL)1 gene in the lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary is under predominantly inhibitory control mediated by dopamine released by hypothalamic neurons. Extensive analysis of tissue-specific and hormone-responsive DNA elements in the rat PRL gene promoter, however, has not lead to the identification of specific inhibitory sites. Instead, this analysis has revealed a series of apparently redundant DNA-binding sites for the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 (GHF-1) that are both necessary and sufficient for multihormonal regulation of transcriptional activity, including the inhibitory response to dopamine (1Iverson R.A.

Although Pit-1 has been implicated as the mediator of hormonal responses conferred by the PRL gene promoter, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involving Pit-1 remain obscure. Previous studies demonstrated that Pit-1 is phos- phorylated in response to several different signaling pathways (7Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28662-28669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, mutagenesis of the three phosphoacceptor sites within the Pit-1 POU domain showed that this modification is not a key step in hormonal regulation of the PRL gene (10Okimura Y. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1559-1565PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fischberg D.J. Chen X.-h. Bancroft C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1566-1573PubMed Google Scholar). These data predict that Pit-1 is not the sole mediator of hormonal responses conferred by the PRL gene promoter and that other factors recruited to the Pit-1 DNA elements may function in the capacity of positive or negative regulators of PRL gene transcription. In this regard, some of the Pit-1 elements in the PRL promoter also serve as binding sites for other transcription factors. For example, members of the ETS transcription factor family interact with two Pit-1-binding sites within the PRL promoter (12Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol.

The ETS family of proteins mediate transcriptional responses to growth factors and activators of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and these composite PRL gene Pit-1/ETS protein DNA elements confer responses to several different hormones acting through diverse signal transduction pathways (12Bradford A.P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). One possible molecular mechanism for multihormonal control of PRL promoter activity is the convergence of different signal transduction pathways on the MAPK pathway, which in turn modulates the cooperative interactions between ETS factors and Pit-1 (13Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Tran P.H. Ostrowski M.C. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cooperative interactions between Pit-1 and ETS family members appear particularly important in establishing pituitary lactotroph-specific PRL gene expression (15Bradford A.P. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and could account for the differential basal and hormonally induced transcriptional responses of the Pit-1-dependent PRL and growth hormone (GH) genes. The above model predicts that factors interfering with the interactions between Pit-1 and ETS proteins could selectively inhibit PRL gene transcription. Recently, a novel member of the ETS family was identified that acts as a transcriptional repressor. The ETS-2 repressor factor (ERF) is a 548-amino acid phosphoprotein with an N-terminal DNA-binding domain homologous to that of other ETS family members and a unique C-terminal repressor domain (16Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Liu D. Pavlopoulos E. Modi W. Moschonas N. Mavrothalassitis G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of ERF recognizes ETS-binding sites, and the repressor activity of ERF can abrogate transactivation by ETS proteins. Given the importance of the interaction of Pit-1 and ETS proteins to PRL gene transcription, we hypothesized that ERF could act to inhibit PRL promoter activity by antagonizing this interaction. Here we show that the ERF gene transcript is expressed in GH pituitary tumor cells. Using an expression vector encoding the ERF protein, we demonstrate profound and specific suppression of PRL reporter gene expression in both lactotroph cell lines and non-pituitary cells coexpressing the Pit-1 and ETS-1 proteins. Moreover, expression of ERF effectively blocked the induction of PRL gene transcription by the protein kinase A pathway and acted in an additive manner with dopamine to suppress PRL promoter activity. We demonstrate that tandem copies of a single PRL promoter Pit-1 DNA element are sufficient to confer the inhibitory response to ERF and that protein extracts from cells expressing ERF inhibit Pit-1 binding to Pit-1 DNA elements. Together, these results support the view that ERF can act as a potent inhibitor of PRL gene activity. All cell lines used in these studies were maintained as monolayers in Ham’s F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% new born calf serum. The cell culture medium was changed prior to transfection as indicated for the individual experiments. For transfection, cells were harvested by treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA and washed by centrifugation. The LZR1 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (4Elsholtz H.P. Lew A.M. Albert P.R. Sundmark V.C. J. Biol.

All other cell lines were transfected by electroporation with the BTX ECM 600 electroporation system using conditions optimized for each cell type. The cells were resuspended Ca2+/Mg2+-free Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.4-ml aliquots of the cell suspension (containing ∼1 × 106 cells) were transferred into 0.2-cm gap electroporation cuvettes containing the indicated luciferase reporter gene and varying concentrations of the indicated expression vector DNAs. The total amount of DNA was kept constant using empty vector DNA. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing rat PRL promoter sequences spanning coordinates −422 to +34 or −306 to +34 relative to the transcription start site (rPRL-Luc) and the rat GH promoter (−235 to +8) have been described previously (14Bradford A.P.

Total cellular RNA was isolated from GH4ZR7 cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated. The yield and purity of RNA samples were assessed by the ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. mRNA was fractionated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membrane. The membranes were sequentially hybridized with 1 × 106 cpm/ml32P-labeled complementary DNA probes to human ERF and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase at 45 °C for 16 h. The blots were rinsed in 2× SSC and washed in succession with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C. Transiently transfected HeLa cells were lysed at 4 °C in detergent buffer as described previously (22Day R.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1410-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for 1 h by electroblotting at 100 V and then detected by Ponceau S staining. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the Anti-Xpress antibody directed against the enterokinase recognition sequence (1:10,000 final dilution; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Following washes in TBS-T buffer, the membranes were incubated with a 1:50,000 final dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Pierce). The membranes were washed in TBS-T buffer and incubated in ECL reagents (NEN Life Science Products) for 1 min. The membranes were then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 5–15 min. EMSAs were performed on whole cell extracts prepared from transiently transfected HeLa cells as described previously (23Day R.N. Day K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). Duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to the PRL 3P and PAL 1P Pit-1-binding sites and the GATA gene EBS were as follows: PRL 3P, 5′-GGCTTCCTGAATATGAATAAGA; PAL 1P, 5′- CCTGATTACATGAATATTCATGAAGGTG; and GATA EBS, 5′-CTTCGAGGAAGGGCACAGTGCCTTCCTTTAAC. The indicated duplex oligonucleotides were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Whole cell extracts from transfected HeLa cells were added alone or in the indicated combinations to 15-μl reaction mixtures assembled on ice. For immunoclearing experiments, 1 μl of anti-Pit-1 polyclonal antibody was added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures were transferred to tubes containing ∼50,000 cpm of the end-labeled probe. For competition studies, unlabeled duplex oligonucleotides were added in excess as indicated. The mixtures were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature and loaded on prerun 6% polyacrylamide gels prepared in running buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mmglycine, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were run at 150 V, dried, and autoradiographed using Kodak XAR-5 film. RNA blot analysis was performed to determine if ERF is expressed in pituitary lactotroph cells. Using RNA from the dopamine-responsive GH4ZR7 cell line probed with the human ERF cDNA, we detected a single transcript ∼2.6 kilobases in length (Fig. 1). This result is in agreement with that reported by Sgouras et al. (16Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) for other tissues and cell lines. The recent cloning of the ERF gene and 5′-regulatory sequences revealed a number of potential promoter elements that could function in hormonal regulation of ERF expression (24de Castro C.M.

The GH4ZR7 cells were treated with several different hormones and agents known to alter gene expression in GH pituitary cell lines to determine if ERF is transcriptionally regulated. Treatment of GH4ZR7 cells with dopamine for 5 or 24 h or exposure to forskolin, dexamethasone, or retinoic acid had no affect on steady-state levels of ERF mRNA (Fig. 1). These results indicate that expression of the ERF gene in pituitary cells does not appear to be controlled at the level of transcription. Because cooperative interactions between Pit-1 and ETS-1 are key to the regulation of PRL gene transcription (12Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of ERF expression on PRL promoter activity. The Pit-1-dependent GH promoter was used for comparison. Cotransfection of GH pituitary cells with an expression vector encoding ERF and the luciferase reporter gene linked to the rat PRL promoter (rPRL-Luc) demonstrated that ERF inhibits the basal activity of the PRL promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, expression of ERF had no significant impact on the rat GH promoter-luciferase reporter gene (rGH-Luc) (Fig. 2 B), suggesting selectivity in the inhibitory actions of ERF at these Pit-1-dependent promoters. In this regard, it should be noted that in cells expressing ERF, we also achieved expression of other proteins from several different genetic vectors using the cytomegalovirus, early SV40, or Rous sarcoma virus promoters. This indicates that ERF is not a potent inhibitor of transcription from these promoters. Cotransfection studies to reconstitute the activation of the PRL promoter in non-pituitary cells were used to determine the effect of ERF expression on the functional interactions between Pit-1 and ETS-1. COS-1 kidney cells were cotransfected with the rPRL-Luc reporter gene and expression vectors encoding Pit-1, ETS-1, and ERF. Expression of Pit-1 induced PRL promoter activity 5-fold, and coexpression of Pit-1 with ETS-1 resulted in ∼30-fold induction (Fig. 3). Cotransfection of the Pit-1 and ETS-1 plasmids with increasing amounts of the ERF expression vector resulted in the dose-dependent inhibition of the Pit-1- and ETS-1-mediated induction of PRL promoter activity. Together, these results show that expression of the ERF protein inhibits rPRL (but not rGH) basal promoter activity in pituitary cells and suggest that the inhibitory activity results from interference with the ability of Pit-1 and ETS-1 to cooperatively induce the PRL promoter. Previous studies demonstrated that functional interactions between Pit-1 and ETS-1 are required for some hormonal responses conferred by the PRL promoter (12Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C.

The protein kinase A signaling pathway activates the MAPK signaling cascade through B-Raf, resulting in activation of ETS family transcription factors (25Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In pituitary cells, this signaling cascade could induce the cooperative interaction of an ETS protein with Pit-1, resulting in protein kinase A-dependent activation of PRL transcription (13Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of ERF expression on protein kinase A induction of PRL promoter activity and evaluated the role of p42 MAPK in this response using the specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase-1 (MEK), the drug PD098059 (26Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). Rat-1 fibroblast cells maintained in the absence of serum were cotransfected with the rPRL-Luc reporter gene and the indicated protein expression vectors. The transfected cells received no further addition or were treated with the permeable analog of cAMP, CPT-cAMP. Addition of CPT-cAMP had no effect on basal rPRL promoter activity in these non-pituitary cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, coexpression of Pit-1 induced reporter gene activity 5-fold, and treatment with CPT-cAMP increased this activity an additional 2-fold. This response to CPT-cAMP was completely blocked by addition of the MEK inhibitor PD098059. Under these serum-free conditions, coexpression of the ETS-1 and Pit-1 proteins did not result in cooperative induction of rPRL promoter activity (compare with Fig. 3). However, CPT-cAMP treatment of the cells coexpressing Pit-1 and ETS-1 resulted in 8-fold induction of PRL promoter activity, and this response was also inhibited by treatment with PD098059. Similarly, coexpression of ERF resulted in inhibition of the CPT-cAMP response mediated by the coexpressed Pit-1 and ETS-1 proteins, and the response to ERF was additive with the inhibitory response to addition of the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 4). Together, these results support the convergence of the protein kinase A and MAPK signaling pathways in activation of PRL promoter activity and demonstrate that ERF can inhibit this response. Dopamine binding to lactotroph D2 receptors results in tonic inhibition of PRL promoter function (4Elsholtz H.P. Lew A.M. Albert P.R. Sundmark V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22919-22925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27McChesney R. Sealfon S.C. Tsutsumi M. Dong K.W. Roberts J.L. Bancroft C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 79: R1-R7Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of ERF to modulate dopaminergic inhibition of rPRL promoter activity in the dopamine D2 receptor-expressing GH4ZR7 cell line. Typical dose-response curves for both dopamine and the ERF expression plasmid are shown in Fig. 5 A. Dopamine treatment of GH4ZR7 cells transfected with the rPRL-Luc reporter gene caused a 1.7-fold decrease in reporter activity. Similarly, in GH4ZR7 cell cultures transfected with the ERF plasmid, basal promoter activity was reduced 2.6-fold, and the inhibitory response to ERF was enhanced significantly by addition of dopamine (Fig. 5 A). The inhibitory response of the PRL promoter to D2 receptor activation is restricted to pituitary cells and several other neuroendocrine cell types. In a number of non-pituitary cell lines stably expressing dopamine D2 receptors, dopamine stimulates PRL promoter activity (6Lew A.M. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7156-7160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Lew A.M. Yao H. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This response may result from increased Ca2+ levels or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis (28Lew A.M. Yao H. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vallar L. Muca C. Magni M. Albert P. Bunzow J. Meldolesi J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10320-10326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and similar to other stimulatory hormonal responses of the PRL promoter, Pit-1 markedly enhances the dopamine induction in these cell types. A mouse Ltk− cell line stably expressing dopamine D2 receptors (LZR1) was used to determine the effect of ERF expression on the stimulatory responses to dopamine conferred by the rPRL promoter. The results shown in Fig. 5 B demonstrate that expression of Pit-1 in LZR1 cells induced the rPRL-Luc reporter gene 4-fold over basal levels and that expression of ERF suppressed both basal and Pit-1-activated transcription. Treatment of LZR1 cells with dopamine induced basal rPRL-Luc activity <2-fold, but stimulated the promoter by 3.7-fold in the presence of Pit-1 (Fig. 5 B, right panel). Interestingly, expression of ERF failed to suppress the stimulatory response to dopamine, either in the presence or absence of Pit-1 (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that certain transcriptional responses conferred by PRL promoter elements in the context of non-pituitary cells are not inhibited by the ETS repressor, ERF. The results comparing the rGH and rPRL promoters (Fig. 2) indicated that ERF displayed specificity in inhibition of these Pit-1-dependent promoters. The PRL 3P Pit-1 DNA element, a composite Pit-1/ETS site located between positions −165 and −150 base pairs, is sufficient to confer hormonal responsiveness in non-pituitary cells expressing Pit-1 (13Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of ERF to inhibit transcriptional responses conferred by tandem copies of the PRL 3P DNA element. HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene coupled to four tandem copies of the PRL 3P site and the minimal PRL promoter (4×3P-Luc). Expression of Pit-1 resulted in a 6-fold induction of the reporter gene, and coexpression of the ERF protein inhibited this response by 60% (Fig. 6). Furthermore, coexpression of Pit-1 and ETS-1 together resulted in a cooperative 25-fold induction of the PRL 3P site reporter gene construct, and this response was reduced 90% by expression of ERF. These results demonstrate that this Pit-1 DNA element is sufficient to confer the inhibitory response to ERF. To begin to dissect the mechanisms for ERF-dependent inhibition of PRL promoter activity, extracts were prepared from HeLa cells expressing epitope-tagged Pit-1 and ERF proteins for use in EMSA. Western blot analysis confirmed that similar amounts of the recombinant proteins were made and indicated that the tagged ERF protein migrated as a doublet (Fig. 7). The ERF protein is a substrate for MAPK, and this pattern of migration could indicate that the protein is partially phosphorylated in HeLa cells (16Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). EMSA was then used to assess the binding of proteins from these transfected cell extracts to the PRL 3P site. An endogenous HeLa cell protein bound to the PRL 3P element, forming a single shifted complex (Fig. 8 A, lane 1, solid arrow), and extracts from HeLa cells expressing Pit-1 resulted in the formation of two additional shifted complexes (lane 2, open arrows). This result is consistent with previous reports of Pit-1 binding to DNA elements as both a monomer and dimer (13Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 198-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both of these complexes were cleared from the reaction by addition of an antibody specific to Pit-1 (Fig. 8 A, lane 3), and all three protein complexes were diminished by competition with increasing amounts of the unlabeled PRL 3P site oligonucleotide. In contrast, only the complex formed by endogenous HeLa cell protein was competed for by the EBS from theGATA gene (32Seth A. Robinson L. Thompson D.M. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1783-1790PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this complex contains an ETS family member (Fig. 8 A).Figure 8The ERF protein interferes with protein binding to the composite PRL 3P DNA element. Whole cell extracts were prepared from HeLa cells transfected with empty vector or with the expression vector encoding either Pit-1 or ERF. EMSA was used to assess binding of proteins to the duplex 32P-labeled PRL 3P Pit-1 site probe. The reactions were fractionated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and the probe was detected by autoradiography.A, a single shifted complex was detected for proteins from the control HeLa cell extract (lane 1, solid arrow). Two additional DNA-protein complexes were formed by extracts from cells expressing Pit-1 (lane 2, open arrowheads), and these complexes were cleared by pretreatment with an antibody directed against Pit-1 (lane 3). Competition with excess unlabeled PRL 3P oligonucleotide (lanes 4–6) or excess unlabeled GATA gene EBS oligonucleotide (lanes 7–9) from 3- to 30-fold (indicated by the wedge) demonstrated the specificity of these DNA-protein complexes. B, to examine potential interactions of ERF with the PRL 3P DNA element, extract from control HeLa cells was mixed with increasing amounts of extract from HeLa cells expressing ERF (left panel). Then, to determine if the ERF protein influenced Pit-1 binding to the PRL 3P site, a constant amount of extract from HeLa cells expressing Pit-1 (3 μg) was mixed with increasing amounts of ERF cell extract (3 or 9 μg); the total amount of HeLa cell protein was kept constant with the control extract (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate potential interactions of ERF with the PRL 3P site, EMSA reactions were prepared using increasing amounts of protein extract from HeLa cells expressing ERF. Total protein was kept constant using extract prepared from control HeLa cells transfected with vector alone. The results shown in Fig. 8 B demonstrate that no additional shifted complexes were detected with extracts containing ERF. There was, however, diminished binding of the endogenous HeLa cell protein to the PRL 3P site with increasing amounts of ERF-containing cell extract (Fig. 8 B, left panel). Moreover, when Pit-1 cell extract was held constant and increasing amounts of ERF cell extract were added, both of the shifted complexes resulting from Pit-1 binding (open arrows) and the HeLa cell protein (solid arrow) were diminished (Fig. 8 B, right panel). One interpretation of these results is that ERF protein binding to the EBS of the composite Pit-1/EBS site displaces both Pit-1 and ETS proteins. An alternative view would be that protein/protein interactions between ERF and complexes including Pit-1 and ETS proteins interfere with binding to the Pit-1 element. To differentiate these potential mechanisms, we examined the effect of ERF on protein binding to a synthetic palindromic Pit-1 DNA-binding element (PAL 1P site) (33Elsholtz H.P. Albert V.R. Treacy M.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), an element with no known affinity for ETS proteins. Extract from HeLa cells expressing Pit-1 resulted in three complexes (Fig. 9 A, open arrows) that were cleared by addition of anti-Pit-1 antibody (lane 2). Competition with unlabeled PAL 1P site demonstrated the specificity of the complexes containing Pit-1 and showed a shifted complex forming with HeLa cell protein to be nonspecific (Fig. 9 A, solid arrow). As was observed for the PRL 3P site (Fig. 8 B), no additional complexes were detected with ERF cell extracts (Fig. 9 B, lane 1). When a constant amount of Pit-1 cell extract was titrated with increasing amounts of ERF cell extract, only the Pit-1 complexes were reduced (open arrows); the nonspecific complex was not affected by increasing amounts of ERF cell extract (Fig. 9 B). Taken together, these results suggest that ERF inhibits Pit-1-dependent transcriptional activity through interference with binding to specific promoter elements. The predominant physiological control of PRL gene expression in anterior pituitary lactotrophs is inhibitory, and the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the suppression of transcription are not well understood. It has become increasingly clear that specific endocrine regulation of PRL gene transcription requires the cooperative interactions between Pit-1 and other transcription factors, including members of the ETS family of proteins. More important, the closely related GH gene is expressed in distinct pituitary cell types and has a different pattern of endocrine regulation. Whereas the GH promoter contains both Pit-1 DNA elements and potential ETS protein-binding sites, this promoter does not support the cooperative interactions between Pit-1 and ETS factors (14Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Tran P.H. Ostrowski M.C. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the Pit-1/ETS protein interactions provide a mechanism for differential regulation of the PRL and GH gene promoters in anterior pituitary cells. This interaction could also serve as a potential target for inhibitory factors that selectively suppress PRL gene transcription, and the results shown here indicate that the ETS family repressor protein ERF can function in this capacity. The studies presented here demonstrate that mRNAs homologous to the transcript encoding ERF are present in GH pituitary tumor cells, indicating that these lactotroph cells have the capacity to synthesize the ETS repressor protein. Consistent with the results reported by Sgouras et al. (16Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we found no evidence for hormonal regulation of the ERF transcript levels. However, these authors demonstrated post-transcriptional regulation of ERF repressor activity through phosphorylation by MAPK, and our Western blot analysis of the ERF protein expressed in HeLa cells indicated that the protein is modified (see Fig. 7). The differential regulation of gene expression by MAPK pathway modulation of ETS transcription factor activities appears to be of both physiological and developmental importance. For example, in Drosophila, a critical stage in eye development occurs when activation of the MAPK pathway simultaneously inhibits the ETS repressor protein Yan and stimulates the ETS activator Pointed (34Brunner D. Dücker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klämbt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism involving coordinate activation of ETS proteins and reduction of ERF repressor activity by MAPK phosphorylation could mediate transcriptional responses to hormones (16Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Liu D. Pavlopoulos E. Modi W. Moschonas N. Mavrothalassitis G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Given the central role of Pit-1 and ETS proteins in the hormonal regulation of PRL gene transcription, we undertook studies to determine if the ERF protein could influence PRL promoter activity. Our results demonstrate ERF to be a potent inhibitor of the PRL promoter, but not the closely related GH promoter, in pituitary tumor cells. Moreover, expression of the ERF protein in non-pituitary cells blocked the activation of the PRL promoter by the coexpressed Pit-1 protein as well as by the combined expression of Pit-1 and ETS-1. Furthermore, we found that ERF inhibits the cAMP induction of Pit-1/ETS-1-dependent PRL promoter activity in these non-pituitary cells. A convergence of the protein kinase A signaling pathway and the MAPK pathway resulting in the activation of ETS proteins, such as Elk-1, was demonstrated (25Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), and we show here that the Pit-1-dependent cAMP response is blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD098059. Together, these results support the view that induction of PRL gene transcription by the protein kinase A signaling pathway is mediated by activation of the MAPK pathway and ETS proteins and that the ETS repressor ERF can inhibit this response. These results implicated ERF as a potential mediator of inhibitory responses conferred by the PRL promoter. Because PRL transcription in pituitary lactotrophs is under the inhibitory control of dopamine D2 receptor-coupled signaling, we used the dopamine-responsive GH4ZR7 pituitary cell line to determine if ERF participated in this inhibitory pathway. Our results indicate that dopamine inhibition and ERF inhibition of PRL promoter activity are additive. Our previous study demonstrated that isolated Pit-1 DNA elements, including the PRL 1P site, which has no known affinity for ETS proteins, are sufficient to confer dopamine inhibition (6Lew A.M. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7156-7160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of the EBSs that are part of the composite Pit-1 elements does not prevent dopamine inhibition. 2J. Liu and H. P. Elsholtz, unpublished data. These results suggest that ERF and dopamine may function by complementary mechanisms to reduce transcription at the PRL promoter. In D2receptor-expressing mouse L cells, dopamine treatment stimulated PRL promoter activity. We observed here that ERF failed to block dopaminergic stimulation, indicating that not all PRL promoter responses are sensitive to ERF inhibition. It is important to note that not all cis-active sites in the rPRL promoter are part of composite Pit-1 elements. For example, an ETS site located in the promoter region between −101 and −76 confers responsiveness to insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and fibroblast growth factor (35Ouyang L. Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10425-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Schweppe R.E. Frazer-Abel A.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Bradford A.P. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This site is also required for responsiveness to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway and may specify interactions with ETS family proteins that differ from those directed to the composite Pit-1 DNA elements (36Schweppe R.E. Frazer-Abel A.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Bradford A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30852-30859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Castillo A.I. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that ERF is unlikely to directly mediate transcriptional effects of dopamine on the PRL promoter. Our present data, however, do not exclude a mechanism whereby dopamine D2 receptor signaling could induce post-translational modifications of ERF that enhance repressor activity that may be independent of binding to DNA elements. We found that tandem copies of the PRL 3P Pit-1 site were sufficient to confer the inhibitory response to ERF (Fig. 6), suggesting that ERF could interact with this composite element. Using EMSA and extracts from HeLa cells expressing Pit-1, we demonstrated binding of an endogenous HeLa cell protein to the PRL 3P site as well as specific shifted complexes formed by Pit-1. Competition studies demonstrated that HeLa cell protein binding to the PRL 3P site also had affinity for the GATA EBS oligonucleotide. More important, although competition with the homologous PRL 3P site reduced both the Pit-1-specific and HeLa protein complexes, competition with the EBS oligonucleotide did not influence Pit-1 binding (Fig. 8). This indicated that in this in vitro system, binding of Pit-1 to the PRL 3P site is independent of the HeLa cell protein binding. Using extracts from HeLa cells expressing ERF, we were unable to detect the formation of any additional shifted complexes. There was, however, diminished binding of both the endogenous HeLa cell protein and Pit-1 to the PRL 3P site in the presence of these extracts. This result could be an indication that ERF binding to the EBS of the composite PRL 3P element is capable of displacing both Pit-1 and ETS proteins, suggesting that competition for DNA binding at this composite Pit-1 element is a potential mechanism of ERF inhibitory action. This interpretation, however, is not supported by our EMSA results using the PAL 1P site, an element with no known affinity for ETS proteins. EMSA studies using extracts from HeLa cells expressing Pit-1 identified both Pit-1-specific complexes and a nonspecific complex formed by HeLa cell protein. Using ERF-containing cell extracts, we again found no evidence for the binding of ERF to this DNA element. However, titration of a constant amount of Pit-1 cell extract with increasing amounts of ERF cell extract resulted in diminished Pit-1 binding. In contrast, the binding of the nonspecific protein complex was not influenced by increasing amounts of ERF cell extract (Fig. 9), demonstrating selective effects of ERF on DNA/protein interactions. It is possible that low affinity binding of ERF to these Pit-1 DNA elements could account for the inhibitory actions of ERF and that the EMSA conditions used here did not allow detection of these interactions. However, this would predict inhibition of all Pit-1-dependent promoters, including the rGH promoter, a result not obtained in the present studies (Fig. 2). An alternative view is that inhibitory activity results from the formation of protein complexes with Pit-1 not requiring the ERF protein to form specific contacts with DNA. Promoter element specificity could arise if the pairing of Pit-1 and coactivator protein partners directs these ERF protein interactions. The potential role of ERF in the pituitary lactotroph has not been defined, nor has its ability to regulate the endogenous PRL gene been determined. One approach to address this issue would be to examine endogenous PRL gene transcription in a stable pituitary cell line in which ERF is expressed under the control of an inducible promoter. Taken together, our results suggest that ERF inhibits Pit-1-dependent transcriptional activity through interference with binding to specific promoter elements. In addition, our results with ERF extend the view that ubiquitous ETS family proteins, through unique partnerships with cell-specific transcription factors, can serve to integrate and coordinate both stimulatory and inhibitory transcriptional responses, leading to the control of tissue-specific gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2086806536,"A eukaryotic fumarase is for the first time unequivocally shown to contain two distinct substrate-binding sites. Pig heart fumarase is a tetrameric enzyme consisting of four identical subunits of 50 kDa each. Besides the true substratesl-malate and fumarate, the active sites (sites A) also bind their analogs d-malate and oxaloacetate, as well as the competitive inhibitor glycine. The additional binding sites (sites B) on the other hand also bind the substrates and their analogsd-malate and oxaloacetate, as well asl-aspartate which is not an inhibitor. Depending on the pH, the affinity of sites B for ligands (K d being in the millimolar range) is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the affinity of sites A (of which K d is in the micromolar range). However, saturating sites B results in an increase in the overall activity of the enzyme. The benzenetetracarboxyl compound pyromellitic acid displays very special properties. One molecule of this ligand is indeed able to bind into a site A and a site B at the same time. Four molecules of pyromellitic acid were found to bind per molecule fumarase, and the affinity of the enzyme for this ligand is very high (K d = 0.6 to 2.2 μm, depending on the pH). Experiments with this ligand turned out to be crucial in order to explain the results obtained. An essential tyrosine residue is found to be located in site A, whereas an essential methionine residue resides in or near site B. Upon limited proteolysis, a peptide of about 4 kDa is initially removed, probably at the C-terminal side; this degradation results in inactivation of the enzyme. Small local conformational changes in the enzyme are picked up by circular dichroism measurements in the near-UV region. This spectrum is built up of two tryptophanyl triplets, the first one of which is modified upon saturating the active sites (A), and the second one upon saturating the low affinity binding sites (B).

The additional binding sites (sites B) on the other hand also bind the substrates and their analogsd-malate and oxaloacetate, as well asl-aspartate which is not an inhibitor. Depending on the pH, the affinity of sites B for ligands (K d being in the millimolar range) is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the affinity of sites A (of which K d is in the micromolar range). However, saturating sites B results in an increase in the overall activity of the enzyme. The benzenetetracarboxyl compound pyromellitic acid displays very special properties. One molecule of this ligand is indeed able to bind into a site A and a site B at the same time. Four molecules of pyromellitic acid were found to bind per molecule fumarase, and the affinity of the enzyme for this ligand is very high (K d = 0.6 to 2.2 μm, depending on the pH). Experiments with this ligand turned out to be crucial in order to explain the results obtained. An essential tyrosine residue is found to be located in site A, whereas an essential methionine residue resides in or near site B. Upon limited proteolysis, a peptide of about 4 kDa is initially removed, probably at the C-terminal side; this degradation results in inactivation of the enzyme. Small local conformational changes in the enzyme are picked up by circular dichroism measurements in the near-UV region. This spectrum is built up of two tryptophanyl triplets, the first one of which is modified upon saturating the active sites (A), and the second one upon saturating the low affinity binding sites (B). l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fumarase (fumarate hydratase, EC 4.2.1.2) catalyzes the reversible, stereospecific addition of water to fumarate to forml-malate (1Hill R.L. Teipel J.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 539-571Google Scholar). Being an enzyme of the citric acid cycle, it serves both catabolic and anabolic purposes and, as such, it is found within all living organisms. In eukaryotes, both mitochondrial fumarase (which is involved in the citric acid cycle) and the cytoplasmic enzyme are encoded by the same gene (2Suzuki T. Sato M. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2581-2586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These fumarase molecules are tetramers consisting of identical subunits of 50 kDa each, and their activity does not depend upon the presence of metal cations (1Hill R.L. Teipel J.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 539-571Google Scholar). In prokaryotes on the other hand, there are two distinct classes of fumarase molecules: class I fumarases are heat-labile and Fe2+-dependent, dimeric enzymes with subunits of 60 kDa each, having no obvious sequence homology to the eukaryotic enzymes, whereas class II fumarases are heat-stable, Fe2+-independent tetrameric enzymes with subunits of 50 kDa and showing extensive homology to the eukaryotic fumarases. Recently the three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli class II fumarase has been unraveled (5Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Wilkens Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Weaver T. Lees M. Banaszak L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to crystallographic data, each subunit is composed of three domains, of which the central one (D2) forms a 5-helix bundle. The association of the D2 domains was shown to result in tetramer formation, domains D1 and D3 capping at opposite ends the central core composed by the 20 roughly parallel α-helices.From studies with nitrocarbanion substrate analogs on the one hand (8Porter D.J.T. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4772-4780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and investigations of isotope effects on the other hand (9Blanchard J.S. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4506-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it was unequivocally concluded that the mechanism of the fumarase reaction initially involves the formation of a carbanion. Proton removal froml-malate thus is the first chemical step of the dehydration reaction. The abstracted proton is stabilized onto the enzyme and is only released after fumarate (10Hansen J.N. Dinovo E.C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6270-6279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by pig heart fumarase have been studied in the past by several authors and have been summarized by Alberty (11Alberty R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 2nd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1959: 531-544Google Scholar) and Hill and Teipel (1Hill R.L. Teipel J.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 539-571Google Scholar). These investigations showed that, whereas at low substrate concentrations fumarase exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics giving classic saturation curves in thev versus [S] plots, at substrate concentrations higher than 5 × K m substrate activation occurs, and at substrate concentrations above 0.1 minhibition is observed. The latter is explained by the binding of two substrate molecules at the same time into the enzyme's active site, thereby forming non-efficient enzyme-substrate complexes. Several mechanisms can be put forward to explain substrate activation. (a) The enzyme preparation might either contain two different fumarase species or two non-convertible conformational forms of a single species, each enzyme form obeying classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and having its own set of K m and V max values. No indications for heterogeneity can, however, be detected through electrophoretic or physicochemical analyses (12Beeckmans S. Kanarek L. Int. J. Biochem. 1982; 14: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Beeckmans S. Kanarek L. Peeters H. Protides of the Biological Fluids. 32. Pergamon Press, New York1984: 1013-1016Google Scholar). Moreover, the existence of distinct but stable conformers is highly improbable since denaturation as well as enzyme modification processes progress through simple kinetics (see e.g. Refs. 14Hill R.L. Kanarek L. Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 1964; 17: 80-97PubMed Google Scholar and 15Beeckmans S. Kanarek L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 743: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). (b) Another mechanism is that of negative cooperativity. According to this model, binding of the first molecule of substrate into one of the four, initially similar binding sites decreases the affinity for substrate molecules of the other sites on the enzyme. This hypothesis is ruled out since Teipel and Hill (16Teipel J.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5679-5683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found linear Scatchard plots from equilibrium dialysis experiments. (c) Still another mechanism explaining the activation implies the existence of additional substrate-binding sites, other than and spatially separated from the active sites. The affinity of these supplementary substrate-binding sites may be supposed to be lower, but once they are occupied, the catalytic rate at the level of the active sites is increased due to (slight) conformational changes in the enzyme. Alternatively, the second substrate-binding sites may be potential catalytic sites as well. A number of anions, especially phosphate, have also been shown to affect the activity of pig heart fumarase (1Hill R.L. Teipel J.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 539-571Google Scholar, 11Alberty R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 2nd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1959: 531-544Google Scholar, 17Andersen B. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 653-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Wharton C.W. Szawelski R.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Hasinoff B.B. Davey J.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 891-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). They can be supposed to bind into the substrate-binding sites as well, thereby exerting an effect on the enzyme which is comparable to the effect induced by the substrates themselves. (d) However, more recently Rose and co-workers (20Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9993-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Yuan R.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8504-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12346-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggested that activation of fumarase at high concentrations of l-malate or fumarate can be explained without assuming additional substrate-binding sites. According to their investigations with pig heart (20Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9993-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Yuan R.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8504-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as well as with a yeast fumarase (22Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12346-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the interconversion of substrate- and product-free so-called “isoforms” of the enzyme might be a rate-limiting step during catalysis. It was claimed that activation of fumarase at substrate concentrations above 5 ×K m can be explained solely by such a recycling of free enzyme molecules through various conformational states differing in substrate specificity and catalytic activity. In their model, substrate specificity of the isoforms will depend upon the conformation of the active sites, as well as upon their state of protonation. It was further shown with yeast fumarase (22Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12346-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that this recycling of the enzyme involves at least two proton transfers and a conformational change. Depending upon the anions present in the solution, whether simple anions (e.g. Cl−, Pi, etc.) or substrate analogs, these events, together with the release of l-malate, will be rate-determining.Recent crystallographic studies on the prokaryotic E. colifumarase (class II) revealed the presence of two distinct binding sites per monomer for inhibitors (5Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Wilkens Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Weaver T. Lees M. Banaszak L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was concluded from these studies that the active site (site A) comprises amino acid residues belonging to three different subunits. Residues Thr-100, Ser-139, Ser-140, and Asn-141 from the b-subunit, Thr-187, His-188 from the d-subunit, and Lys-324, Asn-326 from the c-subunit were supposed to form direct hydrogen bonds with substrates and inhibitors (5Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Wilkens Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover a highly coordinated buried water molecule was found at the A site and supposed to be associated to residues Ser-98, Thr-100, Asn-141 from the b-subunit and His-188 from the d-subunit (6Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Weaver T. Lees M. Banaszak L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An additional binding site (site B) is supposed to be nearby and is built up of residues belonging to one single subunit (the b-subunit), i.e.Arg-126, His-129, Asn-131, and Asp-132 (5Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Wilkens Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Conclusive evidence that site A is indeed the enzyme's catalytic site was provided by site-directed mutagenesis experiments (7Weaver T. Lees M. Banaszak L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, the mutation H188N in the A-site resulted in an enzyme showing largely reduced specific activity, whereas the mutation H129N in the B-site was essentially without effect.In view of the above presented arguments, it seemed of interest to investigate substrate binding with the most well known eukaryotic fumarase from pig heart tissue. In this article we present evidence that this fumarase also possesses two kinds of sites into which they specifically bind substrates and substrate analogs. We describe further kinetic studies as well as inactivation/modification experiments extending our knowledge about these substrate-binding sites, and unraveling the inter-relationship between both types of sites. Moreover the dissociation constants for both types of binding sites have been determined for a whole series of substrate analogs.DISCUSSIONAccording to the results presented in this paper, the enzyme fumarase possesses not only four active sites (sites A), which have high affinity for their substrates (K d being in the micromolar range), but also additional binding sites (sites B), which bind the substrates with lower affinity (K d being in the millimolar range). All experiments were performed in Tris acetate buffers, since a number of anions, such as e.g. phosphate, are known to bind into additional binding sites as well, thereby modifying the enzyme's properties (1Hill R.L. Teipel J.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 539-571Google Scholar, 11Alberty R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 2nd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1959: 531-544Google Scholar).The nature of both types of binding sites (A and B) was unraveled by experiments of enzyme denaturation (urea), modification (tyrosyl and methionyl residues), and limited proteolysis on the one hand, and by circular dichroism measurements on the other hand. In all cases, the effect of several ligands was investigated and dissociation constants could easily be calculated and compared with kinetically determined values of K m (K i) and K½. The ligand pyromellitic acid was found to play a pivotal role in this study. All experiments described are consistent with a fumarase model schematically depicted in Fig. 5.The active site (site A) harbors the tyrosyl residue whose modification with tetranitromethane results in loss of activity. Indeed, full protection by the substrate equilibrium mixture malate/fumarate against this type of inactivation already occurs when the high affinity binding sites are occupied, a K d = 78 μm (pH 8.0) was determined. Into this site glycine also binds, which was shown to be a competitive inhibitor (K i = 4 mm). Glycine was moreover shown to protect fumarase against inactivation with tetranitromethane, and a K d = 5.36 mm could be determined.A methionyl residue is apparently located in, or in the vicinity of the additional, low affinity binding site (site B). Indeed, full protection against modification with benzylbromide was only observed with malate/fumarate concentrations saturating both binding sites. AK d = 4.2 mm (pH 6.8) could be determined for the substrate equilibrium mixture, which corroborates the kinetically determined value of K½,app= 6.5 mm.l-Aspartate, which is a structural analog ofl-malate but which is not a competitive inhibitor and, as such, does not bind into the active sites, readily binds into the low affinity sites. This could be concluded from CD spectroscopy in the near-UV region. Indeed, aspartate was found to induce the same spectral changes in fumarase as high concentrations of d-malate, which also saturates the low affinity binding sites. However, binding of aspartate in site B was shown not to be sufficient in order to protect the enzyme against methionyl modification by benzylbromide.Full protection against limited proteolysis only occurs when both the high and the low affinity sites are occupied. With trypsin as well as with subtilisin, a peptide with a molecular mass of about 4 kDa is initially cleaved off. We postulate that this degradation, which results in loss of activity, occurs at the C-terminal site. Indeed, the region 421YDKAAKIAKT430 (i.e. about 40 residues before the C terminus) contains several lysine residues. This stretch of amino acids forms part of helix α18 in E. coli fumarase and, according to x-ray crystallographic analyses (5Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Wilkens Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), is protruding from the fumarase molecule. This region might thus indeed be more accessible for proteolytic enzymes. Moreover Tyr-421, which is conserved in all fumarases except the Arabidopsis thaliana enzyme, was supposed to be the tyrosyl residue modified with tetranitromethane and being located at the entrance of the active site cleft (6Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).According to the results presented, pyromellitic acid, i.e.benzene-(1,2,4,5)-tetracarboxylic acid, binds both into the high and the low affinity binding sites, and, moreover, one molecule of this ligand is able to bind into one site A and one site B at the same time. Consistent with this hypothesis are the following observations. (i) Pyromellitic acid protects the enzyme exceptionally well against denaturation by 2.5 m urea (at pH 7.3, the half-life time of inactivation is raised from 2.7 min without any ligand, to infinite in the presence of 1 mm of pyromellitic acid; maximal protection with the substrate equilibrium mixture raises the half-life time only up to 22 min). Since it is known that dissociation of the enzyme into (inactive) dimers is the first event occurring upon denaturation of pig fumarase by urea (30Beeckmans S. Kanarek L. Int. J. Biochem. 1982; 14: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we conclude that pyromellitic acid acts by strongly cross-bridging the fumarase subunits. (ii) From all possible experiments performed, the affinity of fumarase for pyromellitic acid was determined to be in the same order of magnitude, and very high: from kinetic measurements,K i = 0.6 μm; from protection against denaturation by urea, K d = 0.65 μm at pH 7.3, 1.82 μm at pH 8.0, and 2.20 μm at pH 8.3; from protection against tyrosyl modification at pH 8.0,K d = 1.75 μm; from protection against methionyl modification at pH 6.8, K d = 1.00 μm (note that, in the latter case, also sites B have to be occupied, as was discussed above; nevertheless, the same, low value for K d is also found in this case). (iii) As is shown above, the extreme protection of pyromellitic acid against denaturation by urea can be reduced by adding a substrate equilibrium mixture. (iv) Binding of pyromellitic acid into sites B is abolished by aspartate. This can be concluded from the observation (Table II) that the protection by 200 μm pyromellitic acid against denaturation of fumarase by urea is markedly reduced when aspartate (200 mm) is present as well. Moreover, we could determine the dissociation constant of aspartate to be K d = 33 mm at pH 7.3, which is in the same order of magnitude asK½ = 10 mm for l-malate (at pH 7.3). (v) Pyromellitic acid (5.5 μm) induces the same fumarase CD spectrum as 200 mmd-malate, from which we may conclude that pyromellitic acid indeed not only binds into the high affinity site A, but also in the low affinity site B. On the other hand, a mixture of 5.5 μm pyromellitic acid and 0.5 mmd-malate induces the same spectrum as 0.5 mmd-malate alone. From the latter finding we indeed conclude that d-malate binds into site A, but, in these conditions, pyromellitic acid does not bind anymore into site B. (vi) We were able to determine the number of binding sites for pyromellitic acid to be four molecules per fumarase tetramer.If, as was demonstrated, one single molecule of pyromellitic acid occupies both a high and a low affinity binding site at the same time, both sites have to be located into the fumarase molecule within each other's immediate vicinity. Also from crystallographic studies it was suggested that, at least in E. coli fumarase, sites A and B are only separated by about 12 Å (6Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Our results indicate that the competitive inhibitor glycine binds into the enzyme's active sites. The affinity of fumarase for this ligand was determined in several ways: kinetic measurements lead to a value of K i = 4 mm, pH 7.3; from protection studies against urea-induced denaturation we calculated aK d = 3.7 mm (pH 7.3); finally, from protection against tyrosyl modification a K d = 5.36 mm, pH 8.0, was observed. Nevertheless, this ligand clearly binds in a different way than the substrate analogd-malate. First, glycine protects fumarase appreciably more efficiently against tyrosyl modification by tetranitromethane. Second, it is clear from CD spectroscopy that glycine does not prevent pyromellitic acid from binding in site B, whereas d-malate does. Indeed, a mixture of pyromellitic acid (5.5 μm) (i) with 100 mm glycine results in the same spectrum as pyromellitic acid alone; (ii) with 200 mmd-malate again gives the same spectrum, indicating that site B is still occupied; (iii) with 0.5 mmd-malate (which is only sufficient to saturate site A) results in the same spectrum as 0.5 mmd-malate alone, indicating that pyromellitic acid does not bind anymore in site B.Finally, we could wonder what might be the advantage and/or the reason for fumarase to have additional, low affinity substrate-binding sites. This enzyme already shows high catalytic efficiency, as measured from the values of k cat/K m which, at pH 7.3, amount, respectively, to 1.54 × 108m−1 s−1 in the direction of fumarate consumption (K m1F = 5.2 × 10−6m and k cat = 800 s−1), and to 3.75 × 107m−1 s−1 in the direction of fumarate formation (K m1M = 24 × 10−6m and k cat = 900 s−1). The increase in activity upon filling up the low affinity binding sites was found to be only moderate (maximally 2-fold), so that it is doubtful that reaching higher catalytic rates might have been the ultimate goal for the existence of sites B. What might be the significance of the second binding site still remains purely speculative. Since indications accumulate pointing to the existence of physical interactions between enzymes of the same metabolic pathway (31Beeckmans S. Van Driessche E. Kanarek L. J. Mol. Recognit. 1993; 6: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Ovadi J. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 152 (, and articles therein): 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33Ovadi J. Cell Architecture and Metabolic Channeling. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar), one might speculate, e.g. on local conformational changes within the enzyme, resulting in stronger interactions with the neighboring enzymes. The influence of phosphate on fumarase may in that case be considered from the same point of view. The citric acid cycle complex will indeed be localized in the immediate vicinity of mitochondrial ATPase, where the local concentrations of phosphate might be relatively high. Moreover, 100 mmphosphate induces about the same CD spectrum in the near-UV region as 100 mmd-malate. Another clue toward the reason for the existence of the sites B could perhaps be found in the ability of aspartate to fit into these sites. Fumarase and aspartase are known to show extensive sequence homology (34Woods S.A. Miles J.S. Roberts R.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and also the latter enzyme seems to possess additional substrate-binding sites (35Ida N. Tokushige M. J. Biochem. 1985; 98: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Karsten W.E. Gates R.B. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Murase S.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It does not seem unlikely then that both enzymes would have evolved from an ancestral gene through duplication, leading to the creation of two separate binding sites. A binding site on fumarase for aspartate could then be a reminiscence of the common origin of both enzymes. Although we could demonstrate recently 2S. Beeckmans et al., submitted for publication. that, indeed, regions of internal sequence homology are found both in fumarase and aspartase, the location of these homologous stretches within both enzyme molecules seems to rule out such a simplistic view upon their evolution. Fumarase (fumarate hydratase, EC 4.2.1.2) catalyzes the reversible, stereospecific addition of water to fumarate to forml-malate (1Hill R.L. Teipel J.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 539-571Google Scholar). Being an enzyme of the citric acid cycle, it serves both catabolic and anabolic purposes and, as such, it is found within all living organisms. In eukaryotes, both mitochondrial fumarase (which is involved in the citric acid cycle) and the cytoplasmic enzyme are encoded by the same gene (2Suzuki T. Sato M. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2581-2586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These fumarase molecules are tetramers consisting of identical subunits of 50 kDa each, and their activity does not depend upon the presence of metal cations (1Hill R.L. Teipel J.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 539-571Google Scholar). In prokaryotes on the other hand, there are two distinct classes of fumarase molecules: class I fumarases are heat-labile and Fe2+-dependent, dimeric enzymes with subunits of 60 kDa each, having no obvious sequence homology to the eukaryotic enzymes, whereas class II fumarases are heat-stable, Fe2+-independent tetrameric enzymes with subunits of 50 kDa and showing extensive homology to the eukaryotic fumarases. Recently the three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli class II fumarase has been unraveled (5Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Wilkens Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Weaver T. Lees M. Banaszak L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to crystallographic data, each subunit is composed of three domains, of which the central one (D2) forms a 5-helix bundle. The association of the D2 domains was shown to result in tetramer formation, domains D1 and D3 capping at opposite ends the central core composed by the 20 roughly parallel α-helices. From studies with nitrocarbanion substrate analogs on the one hand (8Porter D."
https://openalex.org/W1963561064,"Kinectin, an integral membrane protein (160 kDa), was identified as a kinesin-binding protein. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of kinectin cDNA indicated an α-helical coiled-coil structure from amino acid 320 to 1310. A 120-kDa kinectin has been observed consistently, and N-terminal sequencing showed that 232 amino acids were missing from the N terminus of full-length kinectin. 120-kDa kinectin was distributed in the supernatant and a low density fraction of vesicles, whereas both forms were in the high density fraction of vesicles. In the electron microscope, the 120-kDa form appeared as a linear molecule of 133 nm in length. In hydrodynamic studies, the cytosolic 120-kDa kinectin was a dimer. Monoclonal antibody molecules (anti-kinectin KR160.9) bound asymmetrically to kinectin often with two antibodies/kinectin, indicative of a parallel coiled-coil. Metabolic labeling with [3H]myristic acid showed that both the 120- and 160-kDa kinectin are myristoylated in chick embryo fibroblasts. The myristoylation of 120-kDa kinectin may provide a mechanism for linking it to a low density fraction of vesicles. Immunoprecipitation with a 160-kDa kinectin-specific antibody brought down the 120-kDa kinectin. Thus, we suggest that kinectin is an extended parallel coiled-coil dimer, often a heterodimer. Kinectin, an integral membrane protein (160 kDa), was identified as a kinesin-binding protein. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of kinectin cDNA indicated an α-helical coiled-coil structure from amino acid 320 to 1310.

Microtubules play an important role in intracellular organelle transport in various membrane trafficking events by supporting the movement of motor proteins bound to the vesicles (for reviews see Refs.1Vallee R.B.

The microtubule-dependent motor proteins such as kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein have been implicated in the movement of melanophores (3Rodionov V.I. Gyoeva F.K. Kashina A.S. Kuznetsov S.A. Gelfand V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysosomes (4Hollenbeck P.J. Swanson J.A.

A. 1991; 88: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For specific targeting of motor molecules to vesicles, there must be a specific attachment site on the vesicle surface. For instance, given a cytosol containing both motor proteins, purified secretory granules select kinesin, whereas purified phagosomes prefer cytoplasmic dynein in vitro (6Burkhardt J.K. McIlvain Jr., J.M. Sheetz M.P. Argon Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 151-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Burkhardt J.K. Blocker A. Jahraus A. Griffiths G. Pedroso de Lima M.C. Duzgunes N. Hoekstra D. Trafficking of Intracellular Membranes (NATO ASI Series). H91. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1994: 212-222Google Scholar). Such results throw light upon the potential importance of organelle-specific proteins, which may act as regulatory receptors or activators for microtubule-dependent motors. A recent development in the study of the targeting of motor-protein interactions with membranes was the identification of a kinesin-binding protein, kinectin, on endoplasmic reticulum and evidence of kinectin's functional involvement with in vitro vesicle motility (8Blocker A. Severin F.F. Burkhardt J.K. Bingham J.B., Yu, H. Olivo J.-C. Schroer T.A. Hyman A.A. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,9Kumar J., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the distribution of kinectin between different intracellular organelles is unclear. Further, the 120-kDa kinectin and other isoforms of kinectin may be differentially distributed between different membrane compartments. Kinectin was originally purified from chick embryo brain (CEB)1 vesicles as an integral membrane protein of 160 kDa that associated with the motor protein, kinesin. A kinectin cDNA clone containing a 4.7-kilobase insert was isolated from a CEB library by immunoscreening with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to kinectin (10Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A human homologue of kinectin has been identified with 61–71% identity in the different domains (12Futterer A. Kruppa G. Kramer B. Lemke H. Kronke M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In chicken and human cells, kinectin appeared as two protein species of 160 and 120 kDa as defined by the relative molecular mass on SDS-PAGE. The 160-kDa kinectin corresponds to the full-length protein, but the actual mass of both forms has not been characterized previously. The 160-kDa kinectin was identified in the high density fraction of vesicles in chick embryo brains. In addition, a series of mAbs against kinectin recognize the 160- as well as the 120-kDa protein on these vesicles. Previously, the structure of kinectin has been predicted on the basis of cDNA sequence data without any ultrastructural or biochemical evidence. In the present study, we show that the 160- and the 120-kDa forms distribute differently in low and high density vesicle fractions in chick embryo fibroblasts. Furthermore, we have analyzed the N-terminal sequence and myristoylation of both forms. The 120-kDa kinectin was further analyzed. The molecular mass was determined by hydrodynamic parameters, and the structure was demonstrated by electron microscopy. Chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) vesicles were prepared as described previously (13McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 29: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by pelleting at 700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with homogenization buffer, PMEE (35 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/mlp-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 10 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in an approximately equal volume of cold homogenization buffer. The homogenate was prepared by using a ball bearing homogenizer (14Martin T.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 168: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The nuclei and unlysed cells were pelleted at 1400 × g, and the resulting supernatant (S1) was analyzed on a linear Nycodenz gradient. A linear Nycodenz (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co., NY) gradient (10–60% in homogenization buffer) was prepared by using a gradient maker. The CEF cells were collected by trypsinization, and a CEF supernatant (S1) was prepared as described above. The CEF supernatant (S1) was layered onto the Nycodenz gradient and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C in an SW 40 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions (8 drops in each) were collected from top to bottom by using an automatic fraction collector, and the kinectin distribution was analyzed by Western immunoblot with mAb KR160.9. Because the chick embryo brain high speed pellet contains both the 160- and 120-kDa forms of kinectin, we prepared both a high speed pellet and a cytosolic fraction as described earlier with slight modification (10Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Chick embryo brains (frozen), typically 40 g, were homogenized in an equal volume of homogenization buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in an SA 600 (Sorvall Instruments, Wilmington, DE). The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 90 min in a Ti-50.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The supernatant (S2) was collected gently for immunoaffinity purification of the 120-kDa protein from cytosol. Furthermore, the pellet (P2) was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer. The pellet suspension was treated with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl, subsequently diluted to 20 ml with homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 90 min in a Ti-50.2 rotor. The resulting Triton X-100 supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation by using an antibody purified from ascites, mAb KR160.9, as described earlier (9Kumar J., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The protein purified by using protein A beads with mAbs contains mAb contamination because of elution at low pH. An alternative preparation, in which mAb KR160.9 was conjugated to Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, instruction manual), gave a purified kinectin without contaminating mAb. For rotary shadowing and analysis of hydrodynamic properties, the 120-kDa protein was purified from CEB cytosol by using mAb KR160.9 Sepharose CL-4B. After elution, the 120-kDa protein was concentrated on a Centricon-30, and buffer was exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The 120-kDa protein (∼20 μg/ml) was exchanged with buffer containing a final concentration of 20% glycerol and 0.2 mammonium bicarbonate for rotary shadowing. For N-terminal sequencing of the 160- and 120-kDa proteins, approximately 20 pmol of protein was purified by immunoprecipitation, as described earlier, from the Triton X-100 soluble fraction of vesicles (CEB P2) by using mAb KR160.9, which cross-reacts with both forms of kinectin. The immunoprecipitated sample from the Triton X-100 supernatant was denatured at 100 °C for 2.0 min with SDS sample buffer and separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The SDS-PAGE gel was kept at 4 °C for 24 h before electrophoresis, and 11.4 mg/liter thioglycolate was added to the upper running buffer prior to electrophoresis to scavenge the reactive compounds (15Nakagawa S. Fukuda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 168: 48-53Google Scholar). The protein was transferred overnight to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma), and the 160- and the 120-kDa bands were excised and kept at −20 °C in a sealed tube. The N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Edman degradation method on an Applied Biosciences 470A sequencer (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Durham, NC). The 120-kDa form of kinectin was purified from chick embryo brain cytosol by immunoprecipitation with mAb KR160.9. The hydrodynamic properties of the 120-kDa protein were analyzed according to the procedure of Seigel and Monte (16Siegel L.M. Monte K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The Stokes radius (R s) and sedimentation coefficient (s) were estimated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1 × 31 cm) and by using a 15–40% glycerol gradient at 38,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman SW 55 rotor, respectively, as described earlier (17Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The molecular mass was estimated by using Equation 1, Mr=sN0 (6π η Rs)/(1−v2ρ)=4,204 s′ Rs′(Eq. 1) where M r represents molecular mass,N 0 is Avogadro's number, η is viscosity of the solvent (0.01 poise), ρ is density of solvent (1.0 g/cm3), and v 2 is partial specific volume of the protein (assumed to be 0.73 cm3/g). For this numerical formulation, s′ is in Svedberg units and R s′ is in nanometers. For rotary shadowing, the samples purified from CEB cytosol by mAb KR160.9 were exchanged into 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate, 20% glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, dried under vacuum, and rotary shadowed with platinum (18Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The micrographs were obtained on a Phillips 300 microscope at × 50,000 and printed at × 150,000 magnification. To analyze the association of 120-kDa kinectin with 160-kDa kinectin, the Triton X-100 supernatant of vesicles (CEB P2) was immunoprecipitated as described above except that the solubilized vesicles were diluted with an equal volume of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with mAbs KR160.10 or KR160.9 or mouse IgG ascites as a control. The immunoprecipitated material was eluted and analyzed on Western blot as described in the legend of Fig. 7. The CEF cells were grown in 6-well plates, and [9,10-3H]myristic acid (53 Ci/mmol) or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (53 Ci/mmol, Amersham International plc, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) labeling was performed as described earlier (19Mumby S.M. Buss J.E. Methods: A Companion to Methods Enzymol. 1990; 1: 216-220Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The metabolic labeling was performed for 2 and 9 h for myristate and palmitate, respectively, at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After incubation, the cells were kept on ice and washed four times with medium and once with homogenization buffer. Subsequently, the cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with KR160.9 mAb using protein A-agarose as described above except that washed protein A beads were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel in duplicate as described in the legend to Fig. 8. To determine the nature of modification, the gels were treated with 1.0 mhydroxylamine (pH 7.0) or 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). Further, fluorography for the detection of tritium in the gel was performed by using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described earlier (19Mumby S.M. Buss J.E. Methods: A Companion to Methods Enzymol. 1990; 1: 216-220Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Kodak XAR-5 film was used for detection at −70 °C for 30 days. Total RNA and mRNA were purified from chick embryo fibroblasts by using RNeasy total RNA kit and Oligotex mRNA kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The mRNA was separated on a 0.75% agarose-formaldehyde gel using a standard protocol (21Sambrook E.J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The mRNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and probed with32P-labeled kinectin cDNA. After hybridization, the nylon membrane was washed two times for 30 min in 2× SSPE (1× SSPE is 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 0.8 mm EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with sodium hydroxide and autoclaved), 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once with 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 45 °C. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. The presence of 160- and 120-kDa kinectin could represent different vesicle subpopulations. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of both forms of vesicle-associated kinectin by separating the low speed supernatant of CEF on a linear Nycodenz gradient (10–60%). The distribution of kinectin (Fig. 1) showed that the 120-kDa protein was separated into two different subpopulations of vesicles. Only the 120-kDa kinectin was found in the low density Nycodenz peak fractions, whereas high density fractions contained both the 120- and 160-kDa kinectin. To rule out the possibility that the low density 120-kDa kinectin was the result of soluble contamination, pelleted vesicles (CEF P2) were also separated on a stepwise Nycodenz gradient. A low density vesicle fraction from P2 was found with only 120-kDa kinectin (data not shown). Thus, the 120-kDa kinectin was associated with a low density vesicle fraction. Most of the monoclonal antibodies against kinectin react with both the 160- and 120-kDa protein of kinectin on immunoblots of chick and human cells (10Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the C-terminal domain of kinectin recognize both 160- and 120-kDa kinectin, but antibodies against the N-terminal domain react only with the 160-kDa protein (12Futterer A. Kruppa G. Kramer B. Lemke H. Kronke M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This suggests that the 120-kDa kinectin may lack a large portion of the N-terminal sequence. Therefore, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of both forms of kinectin in chick embryo brain was determined. The sequence of the 160-kDa kinectin shows that it contains the N-terminal amino acid sequence predicted by the cDNA clone of kinectin, whereas the 120-kDa form starts 233 amino acids from the N terminus of the cDNA clone (Fig. 2). The sequence and the antibody binding data are consistent with the hypothesis that the 120-kDa form is missing the N-terminal 232 amino acids of the 160-kDa kinectin. The peptide mass from amino acids 233–1364 is 129,905 Da, consistent with the 120-kDa band on SDS-PAGE. The hydrophobic portion of kinectin that is believed to be the membrane anchor is within the N-terminal 232 amino acids. Therefore, the 120-kDa kinectin may exist as a soluble form. The concentration of the 120-kDa form of kinectin in CEB cytosol is so low (∼27 ng/mg of cytosol) that we cannot detect it by Western blot. Consequently, the hydrodynamic properties of the 120-kDa form of kinectin were determined with material purified and concentrated by immunoaffinity. Gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 was used to determine the Stokes radius by extrapolating from the elution profiles of known proteins. The R s of 120-kDa kinectin was estimated to be 11.9 nm, as shown in Fig. 3. The sedimentation coefficient was estimated by glycerol gradient velocity sedimentation (Fig. 4). Purified 120-kDa kinectin co-sedimented with the peak of bovine serum albumin (4.6 S), and thes value was estimated to be 4.6. TheR s estimated from gel filtration and thes value from velocity sedimentation were used to estimate the mass of native 120-kDa kinectin using the Svedberg equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). A mass of 230,127 Da was determined by this equation, which is very close to the mass for a dimer of a 129,905-Da peptide. Thus, the native form of cytosolic 120-kDa kinectin appears to be a dimer of kinectin molecules.Figure 4Glycerol gradient sedimentation of the 120-kDa kinectin. Sample was sedimented on a 15–40% glycerol gradient at 38,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman SW 55 rotor.Lane numbers represent gradient fraction numbers on Western blot. A, indicates starting material. Fraction 5 is about 11.3 S (catalase); fraction 9 is about 4.6 S (albumin); fraction 10 is about 3.5 S (ovalbumin). Because 120-kDa kinectin peaks in fraction 9, which coincides with the peak fraction of albumin, we estimated thes value of 120-kDa kinectin to be 4.6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the 160-kDa kinectin has a hydrophobic membrane attachment peptide, it cannot easily be purified from vesicles for structural studies. Therefore, the 120-kDa kinectin (purified from CEB cytosol) was chosen for analysis by electron microscopy. Initial studies used the 120-kDa kinectin purified by immunoprecipitation with mAb KR160.9 on protein A-agarose beads. We found that antibodies released from the protein A by the low pH elution contaminated this material (Fig. 6). We therefore developed a new immunoaffinity procedure using mAb KR160.9 covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B followed by concentration and buffer exchange on a Centricon-30 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). As seen in Fig. 5, the final preparation was quite pure, showing a single 120-kDa band on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE.Figure 5Electron micrographs of rotary shadowed 120-kDa kinectin. A, immunoaffinity purification of 120-kDa kinectin from CEB cytosol by using mAb KR160.9 covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B, followed by concentration and buffer exchange on a Centricon-30. The purified sample on an SDS-PAGE gel shows a single 120-kDa band when stained with Coomassie Blue. This material was used for rotary shadowing. B, the pure, 120-kDa protein preparation was visualized by rotary shadowing and revealed a simple and uniform structure. The string-shaped molecules are thin strands with a length of ∼133 nm, and the diameter is too thin to measure reliably but is similar to that of myosin and other double-stranded coiled-coils. A very tiny globular domain appears at one end of the molecule, and a hinge region appears probably at the C-terminal end of the molecule. Bar represents 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This preparation was visualized by rotary shadowing and revealed a simple and uniform structure. The molecules were thin strands with a length of 133.0 ± 12 nm (mean ± S.D. and no. of molecules (n) = 21). Some molecules showed a hinge region with a length of 24.0 ± 6 nm (Mean ± S.D. and no. of molecules (n) = 17). The diameter is too thin to measure reliably but is similar to that of myosin and other double-stranded coiled-coils we have visualized. Some molecules had a very small globular domain at one end. The preparations contaminated with mAb KR160.9 provided an important additional insight. There were many free IgG molecules, visible as triangular shapes, in the electron microscope specimen. Most of the kinectin strands had mAbs attached at a single site, which was 76.0 ± 8.4 nm from one end and 56.8 ± 6.2 nm (mean ± S.D. and no. of molecules (n) = 21) from the other end of the molecule as shown in Fig. 6. The complex frequently appeared as a “bow tie,” which we interpret as two triangular IgG molecules attached at the same point (one to each strand of the coiled-coil) on opposite sides of the molecule. Because the mAbs attached at the same point on the strand, we suggest that the coiled-coil is parallel rather than anti-parallel. Although it was not possible to obtain similar micrographs of the 160-kDa kinectin, we predict that it is also a dimeric protein because of co-precipitation with the 120-kDa form. The mAb KR160.10 selectively recognizes the 160-kDa kinectin, whereas mAb KR160.9 recognizes both the 160- and 120-kDa kinectin. As shown in Fig. 7, the immunoprecipitation of Triton X-100-solubilized CEB (P2) by mAb KR160.10 brought down both the 120- and 160-kDa forms of kinectin. This suggests that 120-kDa kinectin might be associated with 160-kDa kinectin. The 120-kDa kinectin lacks the N-terminal, hydrophobic, membrane-binding domain but exists in a membrane-bound form in the low density fraction of vesicles. One possible membrane attachment mechanism of the 120-kDa kinectin might be the post-translational modification of kinectin with fatty acids. When CEFs were labeled with [3H]myristic acid for 2 and 9 h, both 160- and 120-kDa kinectin were myristoylated after 9 h (Fig. 8). Parallel incubations with [3H]palmitic acid did not show any labeling of either form. Furthermore, the myristoylation was not sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment, which indicated that it was amide-linked myristoylation of kinectin. Although the exact myristoylation site of kinectin is not known, myristoylation of 120-kDa kinectin suggests that post-translational modification may serve for membrane attachment even without the membrane-binding domain. A Northern blot of CEF mRNA probed with kinectin cDNA identified two messages (Fig. 9). One message, ∼5.3 kb, is consistent with the mRNA observed in chick embryo brain for 160-kDa kinectin (11Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The second message appears to be ∼4.4 kb in size but is a minor band in CEF. The presence of the second message suggests that there are other possible isoforms of kinectin in CEFs. Because kinectin may function in several different vesicular compartments to attach motors to vesicles, we have characterized the two major species that react with most of the anti-kinectin antibodies in chick embryo fibroblast and brain extracts. The 120- and 160-kDa proteins are both clearly kinectin. From the molecular characterization of the 120-kDa soluble protein, kinectin appears to be an extended α-helical coiled-coil dimer. Myristoylation may serve to more tightly link the protein to the vesicle membrane. From the separation of the two major forms on vesicles of different densities, there may be different targets for the proteins in intracellular vesicle transport events. Initial characterization of the anti-kinectin antibodies identified one monoclonal antibody that only reacted with the 160-kDa kinectin (10Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,11Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mAb KR160.10 reacts with the bacteria-expressed N-terminal portion of kinectin (11Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibody data and the N-terminal sequence of the 120-kDa kinectin indicate that it is formed by the deletion of 232 amino acids from the N terminus of full-length kinectin. The fact that 120-kDa but not 160-kDa kinectin is found in the cytosolic fraction further supports the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain functions in membrane binding. Because the 120-kDa form is a soluble kinectin, we could use it to characterize the basic structure of most of the kinectin molecule. The soluble 120-kDa kinectin is very dilute (∼27 ng/mg CEB cytosolic protein), and it is not detected in cytosol by Western blot analysis (10Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). By comparison, there is at least 50 times more found as membrane bound in CEB (P2) vesicles, as measured by densitometric quantitation (data not shown). We were able to concentrate material by immunoaffinity purification (∼7.0 μg from cytosol after processing 50 g of CEB). Under these conditions, we did not find any of the 160-kDa form of kinectin in CEB cytosol (Fig. 5). The hydrodynamic properties of 120-kDa kinectin indicated a molecular mass of ∼230 kDa, which is close to the mass of 260 kDa predicted for a dimer of kinectin amino acid 233–1364 peptide. The molecule is ∼133.0 ± 12 nm in length, which is considerably longer than kinesin (∼80 nm in length) or cytoplasmic dynein. Sequence analysis predicts a coiled-coil extending from amino acid 320 to 1310 in the 160-kDa kinectin. This would mean that the 120-kDa kinectin should have an ∼110-amino acid N-terminal domain, 890 amino acids of coiled-coil, and a small C-terminal domain. The electron microscopy shows a structure quite consistent with this, a long thin strand with a globular domain at one end, presumably the N terminus. The average length of 133 nm is predicted for an 890-amino acid α-helix. Some molecules show a pronounced bend about 24.4 nm from one end, which is consistent with the break in the predicted coiled-coil structure about 200 amino acids from the C terminus. The different vesicular compartments within the cell typically have differentiated components such as specific small G proteins, and it is to be expected that the different kinectin isoforms would be localized on different compartments. Here, we find that the two-kinectin forms of 160 and 120 kDa are distributed in two subpopulations of vesicles of different density (Fig. 1). A recent analysis of the distribution of kinectin in chicken pancreatic tissue suggested that the microsomal fraction contains both 160- and 120-kDa kinectin, whereas the zymogen granules contain exclusively 120-kDa kinectin. 2D. Drenckham, personal communication. The predominance of the 120-kDa kinectin in the light membrane compartments is consistent with localization to that compartment by a post-translational modification of the soluble form of kinectin, whereas the 160-kDa form would be restricted to movement through membrane compartments. The fatty acid derivatization of both forms of kinectin provides a simple means for affixing a soluble species to the vesicle membrane surface. It has been suggested that kinectin is myristoylated or palmitoylated on the basis of sequence analysis (11Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our metabolic labeling of CEF cells with myristic acid (Fig. 8) suggests that the 160- and 120-kDa forms of kinectin are myristoylated, and myristic acid seems to be amide-linked because there is no effect of hydroxylamine (pH 7.0) treatment on the labeled proteins. It is known that proteins modified by amide-linked myristic acid are diversely distributed to plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, and cytoplasm (20Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that 120-kDa kinectin is distributed to the membrane as well as the cytoplasm, and it is possible that myristoylation of 120-kDa kinectin could provide a means to link it to membranes. The origin of the 120-kDa form is not clear at this point. Although the Northern blot of CEF mRNA shows another isoform of kinectin (Fig. 9), the other message was too low in quantity with respect to the full-length 5.3-kb message of kinectin for the 120-kDa form to be detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques.In vitro translation studies have shown that a 120-kDa product is often produced, presumably at an alternate start site for translation. 3C. McGoldrick and M. Sheetz, unpublished observations. Alternatively, proteolysis perhaps induced by apoptotic signals may have caused the cleavage of 160-kDa kinectin into a 120-kDa form. The sequence shows several predicted Asp-protease sites that could produce an approximately 120-kDa protein. However, the N-terminal sequence from amino acid 229 of 160-kDa kinectin is IPLVDNSDAG (the 120-kDa kinectin begins at DNSDAG) and is not consistent with the Asp-protease site. The presence of two closely spaced 120-kDa bands raises the possibility that a C-terminal proteolysis had occurred. However, there is evidence of alternatively spliced forms of kinectin from two human kinectin sequences in the data base, and the 160-kDa kinectin appears as multiple bands as well. Further, the addition of protease inhibitors does not change the pattern, whereas the pattern does change between different tissues. There is reason to believe that the multiple forms of kinectin are present within cells and perhaps serve different functions. The immunoprecipitation of 120-kDa kinectin from chick embryo brain vesicles with mAb KR160.10, which does not recognize the 120-kDa kinectin, shows that the two forms may exist in a heteromeric complex with 160-kDa kinectin as shown in Fig. 7. The simplest hypothesis is that the single N terminus of the 160-kDa subunit would be sufficient to bind both 160- and 120-kDa kinectin to the membrane. However, 120-kDa kinectin homodimers would lack this strong N-terminal membrane attachment but could attach to low density membranes through the myristate or could be soluble in the cytosol. The characterization of kinectin structure and distribution is consistent with the postulated roles for kinectin in microtubule-dependent vesicle trafficking. Recent findings of small G protein interaction sites in kinectin near the sites where we find motor binding suggest that multiprotein complexes be formed on the vesicle surfaces that include kinectin (22Hotta K. Tanaka K. Mino A. Kohno H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). α-Helical coiled-coil domains interact in many motor-protein complexes involved in force production, and it is possible here that an extended interaction occurs between the motors and kinectin. The extended length of the coiled-coil may be designed to provide a flexible tether between the motor molecule and the membrane vesicles.

Phosphorylation of serine residues, which reside mostly within the C-terminal two-thirds of the R domain, is required for nucleotide-dependent activation of CFTR chloride channel activity. The N terminus of the R domain is also likely to be important in CFTR function, since this region is highly conserved among CFTRs of different species and exhibits sequence similarity with the “linker region” of the related protein, P-glycoprotein.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane proteins, a family that includes several clinically important proteins such P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein, and sulfonylurea receptor (1Juranka P.F. Zastawny R.L. Ling V. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2Riordan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 609-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3Cole S.P.

Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Overall, these family members share certain structural features, including duplication of transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains. However, CFTR possesses a unique cytosolic domain, the R domain, which contains multiple sites for phosphorylation by PKA and PKC (5Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). The activity of CFTR as a chloride channel is dependent upon phosphorylation of the R domain and upon the binding and hydrolysis of ATP at either or both nucleotide binding folds (6Tabcharani J.A.

The R domain of CFTR was originally defined as amino acids 590–831, encoded by exon 13, which span the region between the C-terminal boundary of the first nucleotide binding fold and the second transmembrane domain (5Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). However, alignment of this entire sequence with CFTR from various species and with related ABC family members revealed that there may be two independent subdomains within this region (10Dulhanty A. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). According to Dulhanty and Riordan (10Dulhanty A. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the N-terminal third of the R domain (RD1, i.e. residues 590–672) is highly conserved, whereas the large central region (RD2,i.e. residues 672–831) is not well conserved among different species. Further, the RD1 region corresponds to a homologous “linker” region in other ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein (Fig. 1), whereas RD2 is unmatched in any ABC proteins (11Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Recept. Chan. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hoedemaeker F.J. Davidson A.R. Rose D.R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Rich et al. (11Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Recept. Chan. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar) described RD2 as comprising the “functional R domain,” since it contains five or six of the sites phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Deletion of RD2 leads to partial channel activity of the unphosphorylated CFTR (13Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that phosphorylation of RD2 may cause a structural modification that is permissive to CFTR channel gating (14Ma J. Tasch J.E. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RD1, on the other hand, is unlikely to be significantly modified by phosphorylation. Of the two possible phosphorylation sites that reside in this region (Ser641 and Ser660), only Ser660 appears to contribute to channel activation by phosphorylation (16Wilkinson D.J. Strong T.V. Mansoura M.K. Wood D.L. Smith S.S. Collins F.S. Dawson D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L127-L133PubMed Google Scholar). Further, phosphorylation of the homologous “linker” region of P-glycoprotein does not appear to modify the transport function of this protein (17Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Licht T. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1708-1716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, RD1 is likely to possess a critical role in CFTR maturation and/or function, since R domain deletions that extend to include this region lead to a total loss of channel activity (11Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Recept. Chan. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, several disease-causing mutations exist in RD1, highlighting the importance of this region. 2Cystic Fibrosis Consortium Genetic Database, coordinated by L.-C. Tsui, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. The purpose of the present study was to study the role of RD1 in CFTR processing and channel function by examining the consequences of five disease-causing mutations in this region. We found that each of the variant proteins with mutations in RD1 exhibited defective processing in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Hence, it is probable that none, or only a fraction, of the mutant proteins are properly trafficked to the cell surface, where they could contribute to measurements of chloride conductance across the surface of these mammalian cells. However, cell surface expression was detected by immunofluorescence in three of the RD1 mutants following expression in Xenopus oocytes, a more permissive expression system for CFTR processing mutants (19Drumm M.L. Wilkinson D.J. Smit L.S. Worrell R.T. Strong T.V. Frizzell R.A. Dawson D.C. Collins F.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1797-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). One of these RD1 mutants, L619S, failed to exhibit chloride channel function in two electrode voltage clamp studies and hence is likely to reside in a region critical for this activity. The two other mutants, D614G and I618T, exhibited partial function in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments and could be studied at the single channel level, wherein it was revealed that they exhibited altered rates of channel opening. These findings are consistent with a possible role for RD1 in modifying ATP-dependent opening of the CFTR chloride channel. Mutations were introduced into CFTR cDNA in the Bluescript vector (pBQ6.2 version 2, kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Rommens) using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Mississauga, Canada) and specifically designed oligonucleotides. The smallest possible cassette containing the mutation, a BstEII–HpaI fragment, was then subcloned into new vector pBQ6.2. This entire cassette was then sequenced to confirm the introduction of the specific mutation of interest. A midscale plasmid preparation (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was performed, and this DNA served as the template for cRNA production. DNA was linearized downstream of the CFTR cDNA at the XhoI site, and cRNA was produced from the T7 promoter using the T7 mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). cRNA was stored at −80 °C as either an isopropyl alcohol precipitate or in solution in RNase-free water. The isopropyl alcohol cRNA precipitate was centrifuged at 4 °C and resuspended in RNase-free water prior to injection into Xenopus oocytes. The cRNA concentration was quantitated based on OD reading at 260 nm. For expression in HEK-293 cells, the mutations contained in pBQ6.2 (version 2), were subcloned into the mammalian transfection vector pCMV-CFTR (gift of Dr. J. M. Rommens, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto) in aBstEII–BstXI fragment. The product was confirmed by restriction analysis. HEK-293 cells grown to 50% confluency in 60-mm2 tissue culture plates were transfected with 5 μg of DNA using the SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 2 days, the cells were pelleted and then resuspended in 2% SDS for subsequent analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% acrylamide) and Western blotting. A 1:1 mixture of two monoclonal antibodies against CFTR: M3A7 (1 μg/ml) and L12B4 (1 μg/ml) (kindly provided by Dr. N. Kartner, Department of Pharmacology, University of Toronto) were used for CFTR detection (20Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Stage VI Xenopusoocytes were surgically removed and defolliculated by collagenase digestion as described previously (21Bear C.E.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 707-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water (control) or 50 nl water containing cRNA encoding wild type or mutant CFTR (approximately 1–3 ng/nl cRNA). Three days after cRNA injection, Xenopus oocytes were treated with a cAMP activation mixture (see ingredients below) to optimize cell surface expression of CFTR (23Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), embedded in OCT (Miles Diagnostics), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections, approximately 5 nm thick, were cut in a cryostat and mounted on sialinated slides. The oocyte sections were then fixed in acetone for 2–5 min and then air-dried. The sections were then washed several times with Tris-buffered saline, blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum, and then incubated with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of CFTR (using a dilution of 1:100). Following a thorough wash with Tris-buffered saline, samples were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h. Slides were washed thoroughly with PBS and coverslipped using a mounting medium. Specimens were examined with an Olympus Vanox AHBT3 Reichert Polyvar epifluorescence microscope, and the images were captured using ImagePro (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). CFTR channel activity was assessed 2 days after cRNA injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique (21Bear C.E. Duguay F. Naismith A.L. Kartner N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19142-19145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CFTR channel activity was stimulated by the addition of a cAMP activation mixture containing forskolin (10 μm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm), and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (100 μm) to the bath perfusion solution. All of these reagents were purchased from Sigma. The bath solution was standard oocyte solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6. The time course and magnitude of the cAMP-dependent currents was assessed continuously at a holding potential of −60 mV. In addition, current-voltage relationships were determined to confirm chloride selectivity of the activated whole cell current on the basis of the measured reversal potential. The stimulatory effect of cAMP mixture on the whole cell currents was fully reversible. The difference in the whole cell currents before and after activation by the cAMP mixture were normalized to cyclic AMP-dependent currents recorded from oocytes from the same batch expressing wild type CFTR and reported as mean ± S.D. The unpaired Student’s t test was used to evaluate statistical differences between these groups. The vitelline membrane on oocytes was removed in order to perform patch clamp studies of the single channel activity of wild type or variant CFTR. This membrane was manually detached using fine forceps after incubation of oocytes in hypertonic solution (standard oocyte solution plus 200 mm sucrose) for 10 min (24Stuhmer W. Rudy B. Iverson L.E. Methods in Enzymology. 207. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 319-339Google Scholar). After the removal of the vitelline membrane, the stripped oocytes were then placed in isotonic standard oocyte solutions. Single channel activities were recorded in the cell-attached configuration on oocytes stimulated with the cyclic AMP-activating mixture (same as in the two-electrode voltage clamp) for at least 5 min prior to the formation of the patch pipette seal. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 150N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 sucrose at pH 7.3. Single channel currents were acquired via the Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and the ITC-16 Interface (Instrutech Corp.). All electrophysiological experiments in Xenopus oocytes were carried out at room temperature (23 °C). Data were acquired and analyzed using Pulse + PulseFit (HEKA Electronik) and TAC software (Skalar Instruments, Inc.). Open time constants for both wild type and mutant CFTR were determined using methods described by Baukrowitz et al. (8Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.-C. Nairn A. Gadsby D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, the open times for every single channel opening were sorted on a basis of duration and plotted against the probability that a particular opening event will last at least time τ. For example, the probability of an event with the shortest defined τ for an open state is 1. All data were fitted with either a single or double exponential function, yielding either one or two time constants, respectively. The same method was applied to analyze the single channel events for the closed time constant(s). Open and closed time duration histograms for wild type and mutant CFTR were fit using TACFit program (Skalar Instruments, Inc.). To obtain a sufficient number of events for mutant CFTR dwell time analysis, we pooled all of the open and closed times from multiple single channel recordings of CFTRD614G (n = 6 patches) and CFTRI618T (n = 12 patches). Western blot analysis of HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with CFTR-RD1 variants revealed that their processing is abnormal (Fig. 2). The mature, complex-glycosylated form of the CFTR protein that resides on the cell surface of T84 epithelial cells migrates on SDS gel as the high molecular mass species (∼170 kDa), commonly referred to as band C. As expected, the band C form of CFTR was detected by Western blot analysis of lysates from 293 cells transfected with cDNA encoding wild type CFTR. In addition, a broad, lower molecular weight band was detected. This broad band probably contains bands A (135 kDa) and B (150 kDa), thought to correspond to core glycosylated, immature forms of CFTR (2Riordan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 609-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). While the lower molecular weight bands could be detected following Western blot analysis of HEK-293 cells transfected with the RD1 mutants, band C could not be detected. These results suggest that while the mutant proteins are being synthesized they are not properly processed in these mammalian cells and hence are unlikely to be effectively expressed at the cell surface. In an attempt to assay function of these mutant proteins, we expressed each mutant in Xenopus oocytes, since this system appears to be more permissive with respect to biosynthesis of CFTR mutant proteins (19Drumm M.L. Wilkinson D.J. Smit L.S. Worrell R.T. Strong T.V. Frizzell R.A. Dawson D.C. Collins F.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1797-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Wild type CFTR could be detected at the surface of Xenopus oocytes 3 days after injection of CFTR cRNA (Fig. 3 c). This signal is specific for CFTR, since it is not detected in control oocytes injected with water rather than CFTR cRNA (Fig. 3 a), nor was a signal detected if the anti-CFTR antibody was omitted (Fig. 3 b). Some of the RD1 mutants could be expressed at the surface of individualXenopus oocytes. Immunofluorescence can be readily detected at the oocyte plasma membrane, 3 days after the injection of cRNA encoding CFTRD614G, CFTRI618T, and CFTRL619S (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the fluorescence signal was very weak in CFTRΔ607–634 and CFTRL610S-injected oocytes. Hence, not all of the RD1 mutants appear to undergo similar processing and trafficking to the cell surface in Xenopus oocytes. Using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, we compared cyclic AMP-stimulated whole cell currents 2 days after oocyte injection of water (control), wild type, or mutant CFTR cRNA. Cyclic AMP-dependent currents were evoked by superfusion of the cAMP activating mixture described under “Materials and Methods.” As we previously reported (21Bear C.E. Duguay F. Naismith A.L. Kartner N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19142-19145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), control (water-injected) oocytes do not exhibit cyclic AMP-stimulated whole cell currents (n = 13 oocytes; data not shown). At 2 days after oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding wild type CFTR, we found that superfusion of a cyclic AMP-activating mixture led to large chloride currents (1026 ± 94 nA, n = 33 oocytes, at −140 mV). On the other hand, after the same expression period, oocytes injected with cRNA encoding the RD1 mutants CFTRΔ607–634 and CFTRL619S failed to exhibit cAMP-activated chloride currents (Fig. 4). The lack of function of CFTRΔ607–634 is probably related to its failure to be expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 3). On the other hand, CFTRL619S is expressed in the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes. Hence, the lack of functional expression suggests that mutation of the leucine in position 619 to serine severely impairs the channel activity of CFTR. Oocytes injected with CFTRL610S cRNA exhibited small cAMP-activated chloride currents (about 10% of the wild type currents, p < 0.05), consistent with its very weak immunofluorescence signal at the oocyte surface (Fig. 3). The mutants CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T were expressed on the oocyte plasma membrane and exhibited cAMP-activated currents that were about 75% and 50%, respectively, of the current measured in wild type CFTR (Figs. 3 and 4). We know from the previous whole cell studies that the L619S mutation causes severe dysfunction of the CFTR channel activity because, despite expression of this mutant protein at the cell surface (Fig. 3), cyclic AMP-activated chloride currents were not detected (Fig. 4). The complete lack of measurable function for this mutant in the oocyte makes it impossible to determine by single channel analysis the molecular mechanisms underlying this defective activity. On the other hand, for the mutant proteins, Δ607–634 and L610S, insufficient protein reached the surface (Fig. 3) to perform single channel analysis. However, cAMP-dependent chloride currents conferred by expression of CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T (Fig. 3) could be analyzed at the single channel level and compared with those of wild type CFTR. As described previously, 2 days after wild type CFTR, CFTRD614G, or CFTRI618T cRNA injection, the addition of a cAMP activation mixture leads to the stimulation of chloride currents in two-electrode voltage clamp studies (Fig. 4). Typically, those oocytes that express cAMP-activated currents of approximately 500–1000 nA (at the holding potential of −60 mV) exhibited clear single channel recordings in the cell-attached configuration. These single channel currents can be recognized as CFTR on the basis of their activation by cyclic AMP, unitary conductance of 7 pS, lack of voltage dependence, and linearI-V relationship (Figs. 5 and 6). CFTR channel activity can be readily distinguished from endogenous 12–20-pS chloride channels, since the endogenous chloride channels exhibit pronounced voltage dependence of gating and open only at depolarized potentials (data not shown).Figure 6RD1 mutants exhibit altered channel gating. a, the top two traces show representative single channel traces corresponding to wild type and mutant CFTRD614G channel activity. The bottom two traces show wild type and CFTRI618T channel activity. Open probability (P o) for wild type CFTR (n = 3 patches), CFTRD614G (n = 3 patches), and CFTRI618T (n = 3 patches) was determined from patches containing multiple and single channel activities. Several minutes of channel activity were analyzed for wild type (2 min), CFTRD614G (7 min), and CFTRI618T (6 min). b, distributions of channel open and closed times for wild type CFTR and mutants CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T recorded in patches on cyclic-AMP stimulated cells are shown. The open time distributions for wild type and mutant channels were fitted with a single exponential function to derive the open time constants shown (τ). The closed time distributions for wild type and mutant channels were fitted using a double exponential function to derive the two mean closed times (τ1, τ2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Single and multiple CFTR channel openings were detected in cell-attached patches on cAMP-stimulated oocytes expressing the mutants CFTRD614G (n = 6 patches) and CFTRI618T (n = 12 patches) (Figs. 5 and 6). Single channel analysis revealed that the unitary conductances for the channel activity of CFTRD614G (7 ± 0.9 pS, n = 4 patches) and CFTRI618T (7 ± 0.6 pS, n = 4) were similar to wild type CFTR (7 ± 0.9 pS, n = 3). On the other hand, channel open probability of these mutant channels was abnormal. Whereas CFTR channel activity had an open probability (P o) of 0.5, the CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T mutants exhibited a P o of 0.29 and 0.33, respectively. The reduced P o of CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T mutants is probably due to a decreased rate of channel opening to a burst. It has been well documented that wild type CFTR in patches on mammalian cells stimulated with cyclic AMP-activating mixture exhibits a bursting pattern of channel activity (25Winter M.C. Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1398-1403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Previous reports have documented that the CFTR channel opens to a burst, wherein channel openings within this burst are punctuated by sojourns to a short-lived closed state, and each burst is separated by a long closed state. Our analysis of dwell time histograms of single channel data obtained from CFTR expressed in Xenopus oocytes reveals that CFTR channel function in the Xenopus oocyte membrane also exhibits bursting kinetics (Fig. 6 b). The open time histogram is fit with a single exponential with the open time constant (τ) = 0.19 s and the closed time histogram fit with a double exponential function with two closed time constants: τ1 = 0.024 s and τ2 = 0.120 s, respectively. In the CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T mutants, the open time constants are prolonged to τ = 0.430 s and τ = 0.330 s, respectively, suggesting that the channel closing rate is altered by the mutations. In addition, while both CFTR mutants exhibit two closed time constants like the wild type protein, the longer of the two closed time constants is very prolonged in both cases, to τ2 = 7.5 s for CFTRD614G and τ2 = 4.3 s for CFTRI618T. The prolonged long closed times correlate to a remarkable slowing of the channel opening rate to a burst, i.e. from 8 openings/s for wild type CFTR to 0.1 openings for CFTRD614G and 0.2 openings/s for CFTRI618T. The data shown in this report support the hypothesis that the N terminus of the R domain of CFTR participates in normal protein processing. Each of the disease-causing mutations in this region appears to cause a defect in protein processing in the mammalian HEK-293 cell expression system. Western blot analysis of HEK-293 cells expressing each R domain mutant revealed an electrophoretic mobility pattern that is common for all of the R domain mutants but is quite distinct from that observed for the wild type CFTR (Fig. 2). Band C, thought to represent the fully glycosylated form of the protein on the plasma membrane is not seen following expression of any of these RD1 mutants. For the most common CFTR processing mutant, CFTRΔF508, protein misfolding is thought to underlie misprocessing (27Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Sondek J. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5727-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, while we lack direct proof, we speculate that the R domain mutant proteins may be misfolded during biosynthesis. Our immunofluorescence and electrophysiological data support the suggestion that the Xenopus oocyte expression system is relatively permissive to CFTR processing mutants. Two RD1 mutants, CFTRL610S and CFTRΔ607–634, exhibit little or no channel function, respectively, and this is consistent with their low levels of surface immunofluorescence (Figs. 3 and 4). On the other hand, three of the CFTR R domain mutants are expressed at the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocyte, CFTRL619S, CFTRD614G, and CFTRI618T, where chloride channel function can be assessed. Mutation of the leucine residue at position 619 to serine has a profound inhibitory effect on channel activity, such that whole cell currents cannot be detected despite significant cell surface expression. In contrast, whole cell cyclic AMP-activated chloride currents can be detected in oocytes expressing CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T. Analysis of single channel currents conferred with these two latter variants suggests that the partially reduced whole cell currents reflect a defect in the rate of CFTR channel opening (Fig. 6). Hence, a region of RD1 encompassing residues 614, 618, and 619 fulfills an important role in the regulation of CFTR chloride channel activity. Recently, we and others have speculated that the first nucleotide binding fold, possibly in cooperation with the second nucleotide binding fold, mediates CFTR channel opening (7Anderson M.P. Berger H.A. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 775-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11623-11626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since this function is impaired in disease-causing mutants in RD1, we suggest that this region is an important determinant of nucleotide affinity with the first nucleotide binding fold. Further, we have proposed that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain modulates the affinity of one or both nucleotide binding folds for nucleotides (28Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11623-11626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Hence, the mutations studied at the single channel level in this report, CFTRD614G and CFTRI618T, may exhibit slow rates of channel opening because nucleotide affinity and/or phosphorylation has been impaired. This interpretation is compatible with other recent studies that employed recombinant R domain peptide and suggested that the regions within the R domain may mediate channel opening by facilitating the interaction of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) with ATP (15Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These functional data are also consistent with several recent structural predictions regarding the N terminus of the CFTR-R domain. As previously mentioned, the N terminus is highly conserved, emphasizing its probable significance for protein function. The aspartic acid residue at position 614 and hydrophobic residues at positions 610, 618, and 619 are conserved among different species of CFTR (Fig. 1). Three recent models of the first NBD of CFTR have extended the C terminus of the NBD1 to include amino acid residues initially defined as part of the N terminus of the CFTR R domain (12Hoedemaeker F.J. Davidson A.R. Rose D.R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,29Bianchet M.A. Ko Y.H. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). According to a model proposed by Hoedemaeker et al.(12Hoedemaeker F.J. Davidson A.R. Rose D.R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the first NBD forms a classical Rossman fold, and RD1 may actually comprise part of the central β-sheet of this fold. The two β-strands formed by residues in RD1 are predicted to lie in close proximity to the Walker A or “P loop,” a structure that is thought to be critical for ATP binding and/or hydrolysis in proteins with similar function (5Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C.

Therefore, our electrophysiological data showing a defect in channel opening for mutations in RD1 are consistent with this and similar structural models that place this region close to the nucleotide binding cleft of NBD1. The five mutations studied in this paper lead to varying degrees of disease severity. Using the extent of pancreatic disease as a benchmark for disease outcome, it has been reported that three mutations (CFTRΔ607–634, CFTRL619S, and CFTRI618T) are associated with pancreatic insufficiency and one mutation with (CFTRD614G) pancreatic sufficiency or mild disease.2 Unfortunately, the clinical status of the patient(s) with the mutation CFTRL610S is unknown. Our analysis of protein processing in HEK-293 cells suggests that all of these mutants are misprocessed. Hence, it is not possible to easily explain the above variation in patient phenotype on the basis of differences in protein folding or trafficking. On the other hand, the patient phenotypes appear to be more closely correlated with chloride channel activity of a given mutant as determined in theXenopus oocyte system. For example, no channel function could be detected for the pancreatic insufficiency mutant, CFTRL619S, and partial channel function was detected for the pancreatic sufficiency mutant, CFTRD614G (Fig. 4). However, the relative activity of each mutant protein will impact on disease severity only if a proportion of this protein is expressed at the cell surface, and we have no evidence to support this possibility at present. Alternatively, because so few patients have been studied, it is possible that a secondary gene may be acting to modify disease severity in those individuals with the CFTRD614G mutation, a possibility raised in recent studies of cystic fibrosis mice with mild disease (18Rozmahel R. Wilschanski M. Matin A. Plyte S. Oliver M. Auerbach W. Moore A. Forstner J. Durie P. Nadeau J. Bear C. Tsui L.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To summarize, this is the first report to document changes in the rate of CFTR channel opening with mutations in the R domain that do not involve phosphorylation sites. Instead, all of the mutations studied are clustered toward the N terminus of the R domain in a region that is conserved among CFTR of different species and other ABC family members (10Dulhanty A. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Hoedemaeker F.J. Davidson A.R. Rose D.R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since certain mutations in NBD1, i.e. CFTRG551D (26Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and mutations of phosphorylation sites in the R domain (16Wilkinson D.J.

Physiol. 1997; 273: L127-L133PubMed Google Scholar) also impair the rate of channel opening, we propose that RD1 may participate in CFTR channel gating by modulating the dynamic interactions between NBD1 and these phosphorylation sites. Alternatively, mutations in RD1 may mimic the consequences of particular mutations in NBD1 because it forms part of this domain as suggested in recent models of NBD1 (12Hoedemaeker F.J. Davidson A.R.

At 4 °C, EBVCS1 binds to about 10% of the receptors recognized by mAb25 on the B cell surface. At 37 °C, whereas mAb25 reaches its maximal binding within a few seconds, EBVCS1 requires 60 min to bind to the same extent. Stabilization of the oligomeric structure of CD23 with IgE strongly affects in a dose-dependent fashion the number of binding sites seen by EBVCS1 but not thet 1/2 to reach them, suggesting that EBVCS1 binds to the coiled coil region through an allosteric mechanism. EBVCS1 rapidly down-modulates the membrane CD23 expression with a coincident increase of CD23-soluble fragments in the culture medium, an effect that is inhibited by IgE. In contrast, mAb25, as well as IgE, protects CD23 from proteolytic cleavage and stimulates its endocytosis. These results suggest that EBVCS1 unravels the coiled coil structure of CD23, rendering it more susceptible to proteolytic attack. This supports the oligomeric model proposed previously (Gould, H., Sutton, B., Edmeades, R., and Beavil, A. (1991) Monogr. Allergy 29, 28–49).

These observations prompted Gould and colleagues (6Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 34Gould H. Sutton B. Edmeades R. Beavil A. Monogr. Allergy. 1991; 29: 28-49PubMed Google Scholar) to suggest an allosteric mechanism by which binding of IgE or mAb to the lectin domain of the FcεRII would stabilize the coiled coil stalk region and would protect it against proteolysis, whereas other ligands would exert the opposite effect. The present work shows that binding of EBVCS1 mAb to the stalk region of CD23 strongly stimulates the cleavage of FcεRII at the surface of B cells and provides evidence that this operates by unravelling the coiled coil structure. SKW6.4 and RPMI 8866 B cells lines were from ATCC; the Alf B cell line, kindly given by Dr. A. Fisher, was derived from a patient lacking the LFA-1 adhesion protein. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 2 mm pyruvate, 5 × 10−5 m 2-mercaptoethanol in a humidified incubator under 6% CO2 (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany). CD23 mAb, mAb25 was obtained from Aster Biotechnologies (La Gaude, France), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (RAMs), and RAM-FITC (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Human polyclonal IgE and horseradish peroxidase-labeled BU38 mAb (CD23) were from The Binding Site (Grenoble, France). The EBVCS1 (35Sugden B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 239-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) murine hybridoma line producing antibody to human CD23 was a generous gift of Dr. B. Sugden (McArdle Laboratory, Madison, WI); IgG was purified from ascites fluids and conjugated to FITC in our laboratory. Lactoperoxidase, elastase, and protease inhibitors were from Sigma. Na125I and streptavidin-peroxidase were obtained from Amersham (Les Ulis, France). CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and PD10 columns were from Pharmacia (St Quentin en Yvelines, France), and iodobeads were from Pierce. RPMI 1640 culture medium and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc.. Cells (5 × 105) were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3, and were incubated (45 min at 4 °C) with an appropriate dilution of mAb25 or EBVCS1 in the same buffer. Cells were then washed, incubated (45 min at 4 °C) with RAM-FITC, washed again, and fixed with 0.37% paraformaldehyde. The mean fluorescence intensity of 5000 cells was determined by flow cytometry (FACScan; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). sCD23 present in the culture medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay essentially as described (36Graber P. Jansen K. Pochon S. Shields J. Aubonney N. Turcatti G. Bonnefoy J.Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 149: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 96 well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with EBVCS1. After saturation, the plates were incubated overnight with serial dilution of samples. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled BU38 mAb was added, and incubation continued for 1 h. After addition of orthophenylendiamine (1 mg/ml), absorbance at 490 nm was measured. Cells were125I-labeled on ice by the lactoperoxidase method as described previously (37Grenier-Brossette N. Bourget I. Akoundi C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cousin J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Surface-labeled cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described (37Grenier-Brossette N. Bourget I. Akoundi C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cousin J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at room temperature using anti-CD23 imunosorbent. After washing in lysis buffer, proteins were eluted by boiling immunoprecipitates in 3% SDS + 2-mercaptoethanol buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE according to Ref. 38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, and revealed by autoradiography (Biomax or Tri Max films). Coupling of mAb25 or EBVCS1 to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was performed at 5 mg/ml of gel as indicated by the supplier. 125I labeling of EBVCS1 and mAb25 was performed at room temperature using iodobeads as indicated by the supplier in the presence of 125I. Then, iodinated antibody was separated from free 125I by gel filtration through a PD10 column in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Binding of 125I-labeled mAb25 or EBVCS1 to SKW6.4 cells was inhibited at 90% by prior incubation of cells with the corresponding nonradioactive monoclonal antibody. Endocytosis experiments were performed as described previously (37Grenier-Brossette N. Bourget I. Akoundi C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cousin J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 125I-labeled cells were cultured at 37 °C. At the indicated times, cells were washed and incubated with 50 μg/ml elastase for 15 min at 37 °C. Proteolytic digestion was terminated by adding elastatinal (final concentration, 200 μg/ml). Under these conditions, elastase removed CD23 without affecting CD19, CD20, CD40, CD45, surface immunoglobulin, or HLA class I. In addition, duration of the elastase treatment was relatively short as compared with the kinetics of CD23 endocytosis. Elastase-treated cells were then washed and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40-containing buffer, and clarified lysates were incubated with mAb25 and RAM coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoadsorbed material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as above. Three B cell lines (SKW6.4, Alf, and RPMI 8866) were stained for CD23 by indirect immunofluorescence, using two CD23 mAbs, mAb25 and EBVCS1, that bind the lectin-like and leucine zipper domains, respectively. When the two antibodies were used at saturating concentrations, a 10-fold higher fluorescence was measured with mAb25 as compared with EBVCS1 (Fig. 1). This large difference was not due to the reactivity of RAM-FITC to the mAbs because (i) the two mAbs are IgG1, (ii) identical results were obtained when polyclonal goat immunoglobulin anti-mouse immunoglobulins-FITC was substituted for RAM-FITC, and (iii) Sepharose beads to which either mAb25 or EBVCS1 were chemically coupled were shown to bind the same amount of RAM-FITC (data not shown). We next analyzed the kinetics of binding of EBVCS1 and mAb25 to SKW6.4 cells. Cells were first incubated at 37 °C with the mAb for various period of time. Bound mAbs were revealed with RAM-FITC at 4 °C. Fig. 2 shows that binding of mAb25 was nearly maximal after a contact with the antibody as short as possible (a few seconds), whereas EBVCS1, at the same time, stained only 10% of the mAb25 binding sites, as already seen in the previous experiment, and reached the maximum after about 1 h. Thereafter, a decrease for both EBVCS1- and mAb25-associated fluorescence was observed (this point will be investigated in more detail below). Similar results were obtained with the two other EBV-transformed cell lines (data not shown). We next performed kinetics of EBVCS1 binding at various antibody concentrations. Whatever the concentration, binding reached its maximum at about 60 min (data not shown), and the maximal level increased as a function of the antibody concentration (Table I). However, there was no significant variation in the time required to reach half-maximal binding (t 1/2), indicating that the delay observed in the binding of EBVCS1 was independent of its affinity. This experiment was reproduced twice. This suggests that, in contrast to mAb25, which binds all of the CD23 molecules present at the cell surface, EBVCS1 binds CD23 molecules through an allosteric mechanism: at a steady state, only 10% of the CD23 molecules exhibit the EBVCS1 epitope, and binding of the mAb progressively drives the receptors to a new conformational state in which all these epitopes are exposed. This view is supported by evidence that EBVCS1 binds to the stalk region of the molecule (32Katira A. Gordon J. Allergy. 1995; 50: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) involved in the formation of oligomers (8Beavil R.L. Graber P. Aubonney N. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gould H.J.

The values represent the mean of three measurements ± S.D. Open table in a new tab SKW6.4 cells were incubated in normal culture conditions with various concentrations of 125I-labeled EBVCS1. Cells were washed with culture medium, and the radioactivity was measured. For each concentration, the maximal binding of EBVCS1 and the half-time are reported. The values represent the mean of three measurements ± S.D. We next tested whether the mAb could affect CD23 cleavage. For this purpose, SKW6.4 cells were125I-labeled and cultured with or without EBVCS1, and CD23 was immunoprecipitated from both culture medium and cell extract using immunosorbent mAb25 because the two antibodies do not cross-block (30Bonnefoy J.Y. Shields J. Mermod J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Results presented in the Fig. 3 show that under the control conditions, the receptor disappeared from the cell surface, and soluble forms of CD23 were detected in the culture medium, indicating that CD23 is spontaneously cleaved. EBVCS1 strongly affected the kinetics. The total radioactivity immunoprecipitated by mAb25 (mCD23 + sCD23) decreased with time, indicating that sCD23 is finally processed into fragments not recognized by mAb25. EBVCS1 also accelerated this processing. Interestingly, with EBVCS1, a major soluble fragment of 29 kDa was observed, whereas smaller species ranging from 25 to 12 kDa were not detected. This suggests that EBVCS1 affected the exposure and/or the sensitivity of the sites of proteolysis. In addition, EBVCS1 did not affect the amount of the 16-kDa fragment seen in the cell extracts after 16 h that results from intracellular degradation of internalized CD23 receptors (37Grenier-Brossette N. Bourget I. Akoundi C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cousin J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suggests that EBVCS1 did not affect endocytosis of the receptor (we return to this issue below). This also emphasizes that EBVCS1 did not prevent immunoprecipitation of small CD23 fragments by mAb25. These data strongly suggest that the conformation of CD23 induced by EBVCS1 is a better substrate for the extracellular proteolytic enzymes. IgE has been reported to stabilize the oligomeric structure of CD23 (7Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2372-2382PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bartlett W.C. Kelly A.E. Johnson C.M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4240-4246PubMed Google Scholar) and to protect both human (40Guy G.R. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6239-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and murine (29Lee W.T. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1191-1198PubMed Google Scholar) receptors from the proteolytic cleavage. In addition, EBVCS1 does not affect IgE binding to CD23 (30Bonnefoy J.Y. Shields J. Mermod J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have tested the effects of IgE on the kinetic of EBVCS1 binding and the formation of sCD23 induced by this mAb. Preincubation of cells with IgE did not significantly affect mAb25 binding (not shown) but strongly decreased the binding of EBVCS1 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the effect of IgE was dose-dependent, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4, with an estimated IC50 of 100 nm, which is close to the dissociation constant reported for the binding of IgE to CD23 (7Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2372-2382PubMed Google Scholar, 41Spiegelberg H.L. Adv. Immunol. 1984; 35: 61-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that IgE did not affect mAb25 binding although mAb25 blocks IgE binding (30Bonnefoy J.Y. Shields J. Mermod J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) might be explained by an higher affinity of mAb25, which could dissociate IgE from its binding site. This is also supported by the observation that IgE does not prevent immunoprecipitation of mCD23 by immunosorbent mAb25. 2N. Grenier-Brossette and J.-L. Cousin, unpublished data. We next tested the effects of IgE on the cleavage of CD23 induced by EBVCS1. 125I-Labeled cells were cultured in the presence of submaximal concentrations of EBVCS1 (8 μg/ml) and high concentrations of human IgE (100 μg/ml). Control experiments were performed with each effector alone. Membrane-associated and soluble forms of CD23 were immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE. As expected, a down-regulation of mCD23 in the presence of EBVCS1 and an enhanced production of soluble fragments were observed (Fig. 5). IgE inhibited the spontaneous cleavage. In 11 independent determinations, the inhibition ranged from 43 to 17%, with an average of 26%. Clearly, IgE also decreased EBVCS1-induced degradation of the mCD23 and the amount of sCD23 detected in the medium. This was not due to a competition of IgE with mAb25 in the immunoprecipitation step because addition of IgE in the medium from control cells prior to immunosorbent mAb25 did not affect the recovery of sCD23 (Fig. 5, medium, compare the two left lanes). The amount of sCD23 in samples with EBVCS1 + IgE was less than with IgE alone, and this was unexpected; similar data were obtained in three independent experiments. This could result from the fact that in addition to promoting CD23 shedding from the cell surface, EBVCS1 also stimulated the degradation of sCD23 into pieces not immunoprecipitable. In a confirmatory experiment, we found that IgE blocked the EBVCS1-induced down-regulation of cell surface CD23, as assessed by staining mCD23 with mAb25-FITC (data not shown). The binding curves for both EBVCS1 and mAb25 exhibit a decay (Fig. 2). We have previously shown that mAb25 protects CD23 from extracellular cleavage but stimulated the endocytosis of the receptor and its intracellular degradation leading to a quite stable 16-kDa fragment (37Grenier-Brossette N. Bourget I. Akoundi C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cousin J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The data presented above showed, in contrast, that EBVCS1 stimulated the cleavage at the cell surface, and this accounts for the decay observed with the EBVCS1. Moreover, it did not affect the intracellular formation of the 16-kDa fragment (Fig. 3). To further analyze the effects of EBVCS1 and mAb25 on mCD23 endocytosis,125I-labeled cells were incubated at 37 °C for various period of time with or without the mAb. Extracellular CD23 was removed by treatment with elastase, and the presence of CD23 or its fragments protected from proteolytic digestion (i.e. endocytosed receptors) was assessed by immunoprecipitating Triton extracts with mAb25. Fig. 6 shows that elastase, when added immediately after labeling, effectively removed 90% of mCD23. In control cells, the fraction of receptors protected from elastase digestion as well as the amount of 16-kDa fragments increased with time, demonstrating the internalization of mCD23. In the presence of EBVCS1, endocytosis was less pronounced due to the competition between internalization and extracellular cleavage. In the presence of mAb25, the fraction of endocytosed receptor increased drastically, as we had already observed. It is interesting to note that intracellular degradation in SKW6.4 cells proceeded more rapidly than in RPMI 8866 cells, in such way that unless the receptor is massively internalized (with mAb25), intracellular receptors are rapidly converted into its 16-kDa fragment. This could be due to differences in the lysosomal enzymatic equipment. The effects of EBVCS1 and mAb25 on CD23 endocytosis have been confirmed by two other techniques. Cells were incubated with either 125I-mAb25 or 125I-EBVCS1 at 37 °C. Cell-associated and internalized antibodies were determined after washing the cells in either normal or acidic medium. Internalized acid resistant fraction increased with time in the presence of mAb25, whereas it remained nearly undetectable with EBVCS1 (not shown). In addition, fibroblasts transfected with CD23a have been incubated with either EBVCS1 or mAb25 and then with RAM-FITC, cultured for various periods of time, and observed with a confocal microscope. The experience clearly showed bright and dull intracellular staining with mAb25 and EBVCS1, respectively (not shown). Altogether, it is clear that mAb25 stimulates CD23 endocytosis, whereas EBVCS1 does not. In contrast, EBVCS1 but not mAb25, stimulates extracellular cleavage. Thus, two completely different mechanisms account for the decay observed for the binding curves of both EBVCS1 and mAb25, depicted in Fig. 2. Gould and co-workers (5Beavil A.J. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have proposed a structural model in which the α-helical coiled coil spacer region of the CD23 molecule is responsible for the formation of dimers or trimers. In this model, the protective effect of IgE on the initial cleavage of CD23 (29Lee W.T. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1191-1198PubMed Google Scholar, 40Guy G.R. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6239-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) results from a stabilization of the integrity of the coiled coil structure, which contains the sites of cleavage, through shifting the equilibrium toward oligomerized CD23. The model predicts, in contrast, that unraveling of the superhelical structure would render it more susceptible to proteolytic attack. The present work supports this model. Indeed, we show that binding of EBVCS1, a mAb that has been shown to recognize the leucine zipper domain of CD23 (32Katira A. Gordon J. Allergy. 1995; 50: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), 3O. Munoz, C. Brignone, and J.-L. Cousin, unpublished data. induces the conformational change of the receptor and promotes its proteolytic cleavage. The model is the following: under normal conditions at steady state, CD23 molecules at the cell surface predominantly form oligomers and only a few monomers. Both oligomers and monomers are equally recognized by mAb25, but they can be distinguished by their ability to bind EBVCS1. About 10% of the CD23 molecules recognized by mAb25 exhibit the epitope for EBVCS1. Upon binding, EBVCS1 progressively drives the population of molecules to a new steady state in which all of the EBVCS1 epitope is exposed. Several lines of evidence support this model. EBVCS1 recognized 10-fold less membrane CD23 than mAb25 at 4 °C. When binding was performed at 37 °C, in contrast to mAb25, which reached maximal binding within a few seconds, EBVCS1 required about 1 h to have access to the same number of sites. This is not related to the affinity of the mAbs because variation in EBVCS1 concentration affected the number of binding sites but not the half-time required to reach them. In addition, IgE, by stabilizing the oligomeric form of CD23, strongly affects the binding of EBVCS1, which is reminiscent of the effects of inhibitors of allosteric enzymes. The present report also shows that EBVCS1 drastically stimulated the cleavage of membrane CD23, and this also was inhibited by IgE. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the conformational change induced by binding of EBVCS1 to the leucine zipper region exposes the cleavage sites. In addition, unravelling oligomers also renders the lectin domain more susceptible to proteolytic attack leading to fragments unrecognized by mAb25. Another interesting point is the effect of EBVCS1 on the pattern of soluble fragments released in the culture medium. In the presence of the mAb, a major form of 29 kDa was observed, whereas the species of lower molecular mass were not detected. This is indicative that the proteolytic site located at the boundary of the stalk and the lectin domains is hidden by EBVCS1. The presence of large amount of 29-kDa fragment very early, together with the 37-kDa component, suggests that binding of EBVCS1 both uncovers the cleavage site generating the 29-kDa component and inhibits its processing into the 25-kDa species. This is supported by the demonstration that this mAb recognizes 29-kDa and higher molecular mass CD23 fragments but not the 25-kDa sCD23 (32Katira A. Gordon J. Allergy. 1995; 50: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar,37Grenier-Brossette N. Bourget I. Akoundi C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cousin J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We reported previously that ligation of mAb25 to the lectin domain stimulates the endocytosis and inhibits the extracellular cleavage of CD23 (37Grenier-Brossette N. Bourget I. Akoundi C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Cousin J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that type a of CD23 mediates the endocytosis of IgE-coated particles, and type b mediates the phagocytosis of soluble IgE complexes (4Yokota A. Yukawa A. Yamamoto K. Sugiyama M. Suemura Y. Tashiro T. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This provides a molecular basis for the role of CD23 in IgE- or CD23 mAb-dependent antigen focusing (42Kehry M.R. Yamashita L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7556-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 43Pirron U. Schlunck T. Prinz J.C. Rieber E.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 44Squire C.M. Studer E.J. Lees A. Finkelman F.D. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4388-4396PubMed Google Scholar). The present report confirms that binding of mAb25 to the lectin domain stimulates CD23 endocytosis. In contrast, triggering of the stalk region with EBVCS1 has an opposite consequence: no effect on endocytosis and stimulation of the extracellular cleavage. Hence, the two mAbs provoke a decay of mCD23 (Fig. 2) but through completely different mechanisms. Like EBVCS1, a putative natural ligand for the stalk region would regulate the functions of CD23 toward the cytokine side and reduce the properties associated to the membrane receptor. As mentioned above, a large body of evidence indicates that CD23 plays a central role in the regulation of IgE synthesis. Both the membrane-bound FcεRII and its soluble fragments are involved. On one hand, cross-linking FcεRII at the cell surface by IgE delivers a negative feedback for IgE production and inhibits the release of sCD23. On the other hand, sCD23 fragments larger than 25 kDa that retain a part of the stalk region promote continuing IgE production by at least two mechanisms: (i) sCD23 directly stimulates IgE production by triggering of CD21 (24Bonnefoy J.Y. Pochon S. Aubry J.P. Graber P. Gauchat J.F. Jansen K. Flores-Romo L. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Bonnefoy J.Y. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Aubry J.P. Gauchat J.F. Graber P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and (ii) sCD23, by its ability to trap IgE in the medium, prevents negative feedback through membrane-bound FcεRII. Our finding that EBVCS1 decreases the expression of the FcεRII at the surface of B cells and induces the release of fragments, together with the observation that it enhances IgE synthesis by human B cells stimulated in vitro by a combination of IL-4 and CD40 mAb or hydrocortisone (31Wakai M. Pasley P. Sthoeger Z.M. Posnett D.N. Brooks R. Hashimoto S. Chiorazzi N. Hybridoma. 1993; 12: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), further supports this model. It is interesting to point out that among the sCD23 fragments, the 29-kDa species, which is one of the major components produced by EBVCS1-stimulated cells, has a strong stimulatory activity on IgE production (2Delespesse G. Sarfati M. Wu C.Y. Fournier S. Letellier M. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 23Aubry J.P. Pochon S. Graber P. Jansen K.U. Bonnefoy J.Y. Nature. 1992; 358: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This effect of EBVCS1 on CD23 is not limited to B cells. In U937 cells in which CD23 expression was induced by IL-4 and IFN-γ for 48 h, EBVCS1 strongly stimulated the shedding of CD23 (data not shown). Interestingly, sCD23 activates monocytes to produce proinflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α but not IL-10 (27Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Gauchat J.F. Aubry J.P. Graber P. Life P. Paul-Eugène N. Ferrua B. Corbi A.L. Dugas B. Plater-Zyberk C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunity. 1995; 3: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 45Armant M. Rubio M. Delespesse G. Sarfati M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4868-4875PubMed Google Scholar), whereas IL-10 is produced by triggering of membrane-bound CD23b (46Dugas N. Vouldoukis I. Bécherel P. Arock M. Debré P. Tardieu M. Mossalayi D.M. Delfraissy J.F. Kolb J.P. Dugas B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Strikingly, both IL-6 (47Vercelli D. Jabara H.H. Arai K. Yokota T. Geha R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-α (48Gauchat J.F. Aversa G. Gascan H. De Vries J.E. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) enhance IL-4-induced IgE synthesis, whereas IL-10 suppresses it (49Punnonen J. De Waal Malefyt R. Van Vlasselear P. Gauchat J.F. De Vries J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1280-1289PubMed Google Scholar, 50Bober L.A. Grace M.J. Pugliese-Sivo C. Waters T.A. Sullivan L.M. Narula S.K. Int. Arch.

Altogether, these observations support the view that the stimulatory effect of sCD23 and the inhibitory role of membrane CD23 on IL-4-induced IgE synthesis could be mediated to some extent by monocytes. Increasing evidence indicate that the release of sCD23 is associated with physiopathological situations. Leishmaniasis is known to be associated with a high IgE level and increased FcεRII expression. Interestingly, Leishmania chagasi has been shown to selectively down-modulate CD23 expression on B cells and monocytes with a coincident increase of sCD23 cleavage (51Noben N.N. Wilson M.E. Lynch R.G. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A parasite-derived protease does not seem to be responsible for the shedding, but a direct contact between promastigote and B cell was required. An effect of the protozoan on the three dimensional structure of CD23 is a candidate mechanism. The fact that different strains of Leishmania are able to down-modulate both human and mouse FcεRII (51Noben N.N. Wilson M.E. Lynch R.G. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in which proteolytic sites are not conserved supports this view. Recently, it has been shown that Der p I, the major house dust mite allergen, disrupts the IgE network by selectively splitting CD23 and CD25 (for review, see Ref. 52Shakib F. Schulz O. Sewell H. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 313-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Upon cleavage, the lectin domain of CD23 was removed, whereas the stalk region remained associated with the cell membrane and retained the ability to bind EBVCS1 (53Schulz O. Laing P. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3191-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Based on their model of the three-dimensional structure of the FcεRII, Schulz et al. (54Schulz O. Sutton B.J. Beavil R.L. Shi J. Sewell H.F. Gould H.J. Laing P. Shakib F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) proposed that the cleavage site is located within the coiled coil region and will therefore only become accessible upon dissociation of the oligomer. The mechanism that we propose for EBVCS1-induced CD23 cleavage completely fit in with this model. Recently, we found that triggering of CD20 with mAbs decreases the expression of CD23 by stimulating the cleavage of extracellular CD23 on the surface of EBV-transformed B cells and IL-4-stimulated B cells. Whether this occurs through a conformational change in the CD23 molecule is currently being investigated. In conclusion, we provide evidence that binding of EBVCS1 to the stalk region of the FcεRII results in a destabilization of the oligomeric structure of the receptor that renders it more susceptible to a proteolytic attack. We speculate that any agent, of autologous or exogenous origin, that is able to interact with the leucine zipper domain of CD23 would disrupt the IgE regulatory mechanism, thereby increasing IgE synthesis. Additionally, the sCD23 produced would provoke the release of proinflammatory mediators."

The primary site at which the α5β1 integrin interacts with fibronectin is the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) amino acid sequence. In general, the sites on the integrin α subunits involved in ligand binding are not well characterized. Based on previous cross-linking studies, sequence alignment, predicted conformation, and intron-exon boundaries, we identified a 144-residue region (positions 223–367) on the α5 subunit as a putative binding region and divided it into four subdomains named domains I, II, III, and IV. Chimeric receptors were prepared in which sequences on the α5subunit were exchanged with the corresponding sequences on the α6 subunit, which is specific for laminin and does not bind via an RGD sequence. The mutated human α5 integrin gene was transfected into CHO B2 cells, which are deficient in α5 expression. Only chimeras of domain III or IV express on the cell surface. Both of these chimeras decreased the adhesion, spreading, focal adhesion assembly, and migration on fibronectin. The adhesion of the chimeric receptors to fibronectin remained sensitive to the RGD peptide, and antibodies that inhibit interaction with the fibronectin synergy site and RGD loop remain inhibitory for the chimeras, indicating that our chimeras do not inhibit binding to either the RGD or synergy sites. Finally, the affinity of soluble fibronectin to cells via the α5β1 receptor decreased only about 3-fold. This decrease is substantially less than the observed effects on migration and spreading, which were not altered by changes in substrate concentration. Thus, the alteration in binding sites does not easily account for the changes in cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly. The tyrosine phosphorylation and focal adhesion assembly that are seen when cells expressing the wild type α5 receptor adhere to fibronectin were inhibited in cells expressing the chimeric receptors. Therefore, our results suggest that the chimeras of these domains likely interrupt α5-mediated conformational signaling.

Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric adhesive receptors of major importance in diverse biological processes that include embryonic development, tumorigenesis, blood clotting, inflammation, and wound healing (1Hynes R. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Through their dual functions as receptors for molecules associated with the cytoskeleton and for adhesive molecules in the extracellular matrix, on other cells, and in the circulation, they provide anchorage for cell attachment and spreading. Integrins also transduce signals from the outside to the inside of the cells in cooperation with growth factor receptors (2Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar).The interactions of integrins with their extracellular ligands are subjects of intensive study. The binding affinity is regulated by a process called inside-out signaling, in which the intracellular signals affect affinity and, for some integrins, specificity as well (4Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Ligand affinity can also be modulated by exogenous agents, which include the nature of the cations that bind to the integrin; antibodies that induce high affinity ligand binding; and alterations in the membrane proximal region of integrin cytoplasmic domains (5Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have been incorporated into the hinge model of integrin function. In this model, affinity/specificity-determining conformational changes are propagated from the inside to the outside via a critical hinge region, which resides near the membrane on the cytoplasmic domains of the integrin subunits (4Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).Due to their potential for the design of therapeutics, the ligand-binding sites on integrins are under intensive study. Peptide cross-linking analyses of mutant integrins, peptides corresponding to integrin sequences, and epitope mapping of inhibitory mAbs1 have been used to identify the integrin ligand-binding sites. From these studies, three regions are implicated in ligand binding: the N-terminal portions of both the α and β subunit and the A (or I) domain in the integrins that contain it (9Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The ligand-binding sites on the β1 and β3subunits are the best understood. RGD-containing peptides cross-link to the N-terminal portion of the β3 (positions 109–171) subunit (10D’Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. Science. 1988; 242: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The importance of this region in ligand binding of β3 and some other integrins has been confirmed in several studies. A labeled RGD peptide cross-links to a peptide corresponding to the amino acids 61–203 on the sequence of the β3subunit (11Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18726-18731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A naturally occurring mutation on β3(Asp119 → Tyr) and mutations of the homologous residue on β1 and β6 also result in reduced ligand binding (12Loftus J.C. O’Toole T. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger A.L.D. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis within this domain inhibits ligand binding (14Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20913-20919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For integrin α subunits that do not possess an A domain, ligand binding localizes to the N-terminal portion. This region corresponds roughly to the amino-terminal 400 amino acids on several α subunits including α4, α5, and αIIb(9Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It contains metal ion binding sites and is composed of seven homologous, repeated domains, recently termed FG-GAP repeats (15Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Peptide ligands cross-link to this region on both the αIIb and αv subunits (16Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2168-2172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17D’Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations in repeat III on α4, for example, inhibit ligand binding (18Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Repeats V–VII (or IV–VII in some integrins) encompass sequences that resemble the classical Ca2+binding motifs known as EF-hands. Mutations in the EF-hand motifs on the α4 integrin impair ligand binding (19Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A peptide derived from repeat V on αIIb inhibits platelet aggregation and binding of fibrinogen to purified αIIbβ3 (20D’Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Matsueda G.R. Plow E.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and peptides corresponding to repeat V/VI on αL interfere with the interaction between ICAM-1 and αLβ2 (21Paula S. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The importance of divalent metal-binding sites is also seen in the cation dependence of integrin ligand binding. Mn2+ and Mg2+ generally elevate ligand binding, whereas Ca2+ inhibits it (22Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Alterations in some EF-hand motifs of the α subunit inhibit ligand binding. The missing 12th coordination site on the partial EF-hand motif on α subunits has led to the hypothesis that integrin ligands may directly bind to cations by providing an oxygenated residue, e.g. the Asp in the RGD sequence (23Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 585-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another model suggests that divalent cations promote ligand binding by switching the integrin into an active conformation (6Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mould A.P. Garatt A.N. Askari J.A. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23 (suppl.): 395Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In most integrins, the binding of Mn2+ increases the binding affinity. In addition, changing any one of several different cation-binding sites on α4 reduces ligand binding similarly, suggesting a structural rather than a direct ligand binding role (19Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear which model reflects the real function of cations in integrin-ligand interaction, cation binding is very likely a key factor in this process.Despite the characterization of cation binding as critical to ligand binding, ligand-binding motifs on integrin α subunits (outside of the I domain on some α subunits) are not well characterized. This is due, in part, to the sensitivity of α subunit to conformational changes that result in improper folding and/or impaired dimerization. In an attempt to avoid this problem, we constructed chimeric integrins to study the ligand binding domain on the α5 integrin. We selected four consecutive small fragments near the first and second cation-binding site on the α subunit, exchanged each segment with the homologous sequence on the α6 subunit, and expressed the resulting chimera in CHO B2 cells, which are deficient in expression of the α5 subunit (25Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We chose α5 and α6 integrins because both dimerize with the β1 subunit but have distinct ligand specificity; the former binds to fibronectin, while the later binds to laminin. We found that two of the chimeras express stably on the cell surface and exhibit defects in adhesion, spreading, and migration on fibronectin. Interestingly, the binding to fibronectin via the RGD and synergy sites was not grossly perturbed. However, the mutations did impair focal adhesion formation and adhesion-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The data suggest that the regions of these mutations are probably involved in outside-in signal transduction.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified domains on the integrin α5 subunit that mediate cell spreading and signaling on fibronectin. Genetic approaches to identifying functional regions on integrin α subunits have been frustrated by the sensitivity of their extracellular domains to mutation. Such mutant α subunits often do not dimerize or appear on the surface (19Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To avoid this, we divided a putative ligand binding region on the integrin α5 subunit into four smaller segments that are flanked by conserved sequences and form predicted loops. We made chimeric α5 subunits by substituting each segment with its counterpart on the α6subunit. Since the α5 and α6 subunits dimerize with the same β1 subunit, the α5chimeras should minimize conformational perturbations. Two of the α5 chimeras that we constructed express on the cell surface. Both contain swaps near putative cation binding regions. When introduced into the CHO B2 cell line, which is deficient in expression of endogenous α5 integrin, the cells showed inhibited spreading, adhesion, migration, and focal adhesion formation when compared with CHO B2 cells expressing the wild type α5subunit. However, the affinity of the mutants for binding to fibronectin decreased only 3-fold. The recognition sites for RGD and PHSRN were not grossly perturbed on the chimeric α5subunits, since RGD peptides and antibodies directed against both the RGD and PHSRN sites inhibited adhesion. Metal ions still promoted cell adhesion at concentrations similar to those for the wild type α5 subunit. These data suggest that the defects most likely do not arise solely from alterations in receptor affinity. However, as indicated by phosphotyrosine blotting and inhibited spreading, signal propagation mediated by α5 was disrupted by the mutations, suggesting a model in which the chimeras inhibit the putative conformation changes that mediate ligand-induced transmembrane signal propagation.It has been previously reported that the N-terminal one-third of integrin α and β subunits mediate integrin-ligand recognition (9Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is also involved in the interactions between α and β subunits. Despite the conservative nature of our mutations, it is interesting that most of the chimeric α5 subunits that we made failed to express on cell surface. Furthermore, even some conserved point mutations in the EF-hands, such as D284E, D334E, N336E, D338E, and G398S, also resulted in no detectable surface expression (data not shown). Similar inhibitions of dimerization and surface expression in mutant α subunits have been reported by others (19Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations all point to a high conformational sensitivity in this region. Presumably, the encompassed cation-binding motifs are crucial for proper folding and/or dimerization.The altered spreading, migration, and focal adhesion formation observed with CHO B2 cells expressing the α5III and α5IV do not likely arise from major conformational changes. As pointed out above, any major conformational alteration in this tightly folded structure would probably abolish its surface expression. In our experiments, both α5III and α5IV express on the cell surface. Furthermore, cells transfected with either the wild type or mutant α5subunits showed similar concentration optima for antibody binding and inhibition of adhesion, indicating that the mutations do not grossly alter the affinity of α5III and α5IV to several antibodies.Our data also suggest that the interaction of the chimeric α5 receptors with fibronectin is perturbed only about 3-fold. Both the RGD and PHSRN sequences, which are the important motifs on fibronectin for adhesion to fibronectin, are also not grossly altered. Adhesion-perturbing antibodies directed against these sites on fibronectin inhibit the adhesion and spreading of both wild type and mutant cells. Furthermore, RGD-containing peptides inhibit adhesion of chimeric integrins at concentrations that are similar to those that inhibit adhesion of the wild type subunit. In addition, increasing the substrate concentration did not enhance adhesion, spreading, or migration in cells expressing the chimeric α5 subunits. Mass action predicts that decreased affinity would be compensated for by an increase in substrate concentration as observed previously for migration and spreading (28Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 43Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 44Palecek S.P. Schmidt C.E. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that major recognition sites on α5III and α5IV are intact.It is unlikely that the inhibited adhesion and spreading arise solely from the 3-fold affinity alteration caused by the mutations. The evidence for this conclusion includes the following. First, the affinity change is much smaller than that observed for spreading, migration, and focal adhesion formation. A swap mutation on the β3 subunit has been reported that increases the affinity of integrin αIIbβ3 to fibrinogen over 30-fold. However, the adhesion of the mutant and the wild type cells to fibrinogen, while different on low concentrations of substrate, showed no difference at higher concentrations (35Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. Gawaz M.P. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22211-22216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with αIIb, when assayed in the presence of LIBS6, an activating antibody, showed a 10-fold increased affinity for fibrinogen; however, the spreading of the cells was similar to those not treated with LIBS6. 2A. Huttenlocher, unpublished data. Second, it has been shown previously that some mutations affect cell adhesion and spreading without altering the ligand binding affinity. Mutations within the divalent cation-binding regions of integrin α4, for example, alter cell adhesion significantly but have no effect on the binding of soluble VCAM-1 (45Pujades C. Alon R. Yauch R.L. Masumoto A. Burkly L.C. Chen C. Springer T.A. Lobb R.R. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2647-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another mutant in the region outside of the cation-binding region also showed inhibited adhesion while still bound to VCAM-1 (46Ma L. Conrad P.J. Webb D.L. Blue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18401-18407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in cell adhesion and spreading do necessarily arise from large affinity changes. Conversely, small affinity alterations also do not necessarily lead to impaired cell spreading.2 Third, recent publications (28Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 43Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 44Palecek S.P. Schmidt C.E. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar) show that alterations in receptor affinity shift the concentration optimum for cell migration in a manner predictable by force and mass action considerations. In these studies, 3-fold changes in receptor affinity would not show the magnitude and type of inhibitions of migration and spreading seen in cells expressing the chimeric integrins. In this context, it is particularly important to note that the inhibition of migration, for example, cannot be compensated for by increased substrate fibronectin concentration. Thus, although the affinity change of α5III and α5IV chimeras to fibronectin may contribute to the altered spreading, migration, and focal adhesion formation of the chimera, it is unlikely that they are the primary contributors. However, since adhesion is a highly cooperative process, we cannot rigorously exclude a contribution from the relatively small change in affinity.Alterations in a post-ligand-binding event provide a more likely explanation for the defects in the chimeric α5 subunits, since we observed inhibition of well characterized post-ligand-binding processes. Adhesion mediated by the α5 integrin induces spreading, focal adhesion formation, and phosphorylation of several prominent proteins migrating in the molecular mass area of 130 and 70 kDa. All of these were inhibited in CHO B2 cells expressing the chimeric integrins. Therefore, we hypothesize that the chimeras disrupt ligand-initiated signal propagation.The mechanism by which ligand binding to integrins initiates a signal transduction process that propagates from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is not known. Considerable evidence points to a major, long range conformation change involving cation binding regions in the integrin molecule as a key event in this process (47Pelletier A.J. Kunicki T. Ruggeri Z.M. Quaranta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18133-18140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 48Fox J.E. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the αIIbβ3integrin, for example, induces a conformation that is recognized by certain mAbs (49Mazurov A.V. Khaspekova S.G. Byzova T.V. Tikhomirov O. Berndt M.C. Steiner B. Kouns W.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PAC-1 is a mAb directed against the β3integrin subunit that recognizes an active conformation of αIIbβ3. The affinity of the PAC-1 mAb for αIIbβ3 increases 20-fold following the addition of peptide ligands (50Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This change has been hypothesized to propagate to the cytoplasmic domain via a “hinge” where the membrane proximal regions of the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains reside.The regions swapped in our chimeras represent regions in or near putative cation binding motifs. Our domain III encompasses a cation-binding site, while domain IV is adjacent to one. These regions are sensitive to conformational changes and implicated in regulating the affinity of integrin-ligand binding (22Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 51Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J.

Changes in the cations bound to integrins alter the affinity of several integrins and can expose new epitopes. Replacing Ca2+ with Mn2+, for example, increases the affinity of several different integrins, while the binding of Mg2+ exposes an epitope on integrin αLβ2 (22Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 51Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J.

The affinity of integrins can also be affected through alterations of the cytoplasmic domains or by signals from the cytoplasm (53Hughes P.E. O’Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 54O’Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Thus, conformational information appears to travel reciprocally from the cytoplasmic domains to the ligand-binding site and vice versa. The cation binding domain appears to lie on this pathway.How might the domains III and IV participate in the conformation changes that mediate ligand-initiated signal transduction? The β-propeller model provides potential insights (15Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In this model, the N-terminal region of the integrin α subunit folds into a β-propeller domain, which is composed of seven four-stranded β-sheet structures. It has been proposed that integrins bind to ligands and a putative Mg2+ ion at the upper face of the propeller. The Ca2+ binding motifs are predicted to be on the lower face of the propeller. Domain III in our study encompasses strand 1 and part of strand 2 of the fifth β-sheet structure and is predicted to interact with Ca2+ at the lower face of the propeller. Domain IV contains part of strands 2 and 3 of the fifth β-sheet and is located on top of the propeller, possibly at or close to the interface between the ligand and the integrin. One hypothesis is that when α5β1 interacts with fibronectin, domain IV, which is adjacent to the ligand binding pocket, undergoes a conformational change and causes a change in domain III, which in turn propagates the alteration toward to the cytoplasmic domain. The metal ion associated with domain III helps to stabilize the proper conformation or assist in the transformation. Domains III and IV therefore constitute a mediator that directs the signal from ligand-recognition site to the cytoplasm. Mutations in α5III and α5IV would disrupt such a pathway and result in attenuated signaling. It is likely that the signal-propagation domain(s) would be coupled to the ligand-binding domain in the sterically constrained environment that appear to characterize integrin extracellular domains. Considering the proximity of domains III and IV to the ligand-binding site, mutations in this region may also cause a small conformational alteration of the ligand-binding pocket, which could produce the 3-fold effects that we observe.A related hypothesis is that domains III and IV reside at or adjacent to the interface between the α and β subunits. It is known that ligands and divalent cations induce a conformational change in the integrin heterodimer, and the interaction between the α and β subunit may be involved in this conformational change. In the model discussed above, the β-propeller domain on the α subunit interacts with the β subunit (55Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that αIIbβ3 subunits dissociate when the Ca2+ is removed (56Jennings L.K. Philips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10458-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, domains III and IV in our study may be part of the interface between the subunits. In this location, the α5IIIβ1 and αIVβ1 chimeras would inhibit intersubunit conformation changes that mediate ligand-initiated signal transduction.The mechanisms by which ligand binding to the extracellular domain couples to the cytoplasmic responses that mediate adhesion, spreading, and tyrosine phosphorylation are an enigma. The available evidence points to ligand occupancy and receptor aggregation being required for a complete response (38Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 39LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J.

We previously reported that a 115-base pair (bp) promoter fragment was able to ensure the brain-specific expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in transgenic mice, but only at a low level (Thomas, M., Makeh, I., Briand, P., Kahn, A., and Skala, H. (1993)Eur. J. Biochem. 218, 143–151). Here we show thatin vivo activation of this promoter at a high level requires cooperation between an upstream 0.6-kilobase pair (kb) fragment and far upstream sequences. In the 0.6-kb region, a 28-bp DNA element is shown to include overlapping in vitro binding sites for POU domain regulatory proteins and for the Winged Helix hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β factor. An hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β-binding site previously described in the short proximal promoter fragment is also shown to interact in vitro with POU proteins, although with a lower affinity than the 28-bp motif. Additional binding sites for POU factors were detected in the upstream 0.6-kb sequences. Progressive deletion in this region resulted in decreased expression levels of the transgenes in mice, suggesting synergistic interactions between these multiple POU-binding sites.

Molecular events underlying specific gene expression in the brain still remain poorly elucidated compared with those governing gene transcription in other differentiated tissues, in part due to the complexity of this organ, which appears as a mosaic of various cell types.

The aldolase C gene, coding for the brain-specific form of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase, belongs to this last class and, in addition, is also transcribed in glial cells (5Popovici T.

We have previously reported that brain-specific expression of the CAT1 reporter gene in transgenic mice could be directed by a short (<115 bp) promoter fragment of the aldolase C gene (10Thomas M. Makeh I. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, this short fragment was not able to direct the high level transgene expression observed with the full-length 5.5-kb 5′-flanking region (11Makeh I. Thomas M. Hardelin J.P. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thomas M. Skala H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol.

To identify DNA regulatory elements required to ensure high level gene expression in the brain, we have now defined in vivo, in transgenic mice, activating sequences of the aldolase C gene and some of the cognate DNA-binding transcription factors. We found that cooperation between an upstream 0.6-kb region and a far upstream 3.8-kb region is required. Several DNA motifs exhibiting overlapping binding sites for both POU domain proteins (13Ruvkun G. Finney M.

Since this type of dual motif is also present in the brain-specific 115-bp promoter of the aldolase C gene and in regulatory elements of several genes specifically expressed in secretory neurons, we proposed that it could constitute an important determinant for regulated expression of brain-specific genes, both broadly expressed and neuron-type restricted genes. The 5.5/CAT, 0.8/CAT, and 0.115/CAT constructs have been described previously (10Thomas M. Makeh I. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J.

The transgenes 3.8+0.8/CAT, B+C+D+0.8/CAT, A+0.8/CAT, A+B+0.8/CAT, A+C+0.8/CAT, A+D+0.8/CAT, and 3.8+0.5/CAT contain different restriction fragments of the aldolase C gene 5.5-kb 5′-flanking region inserted upstream of the CAT reporter gene. The following restriction sites were used:XbaI, SacI, BamHIa, BamHIb, and SmaI (see Fig. 1). The transgene 3.8+115/CAT was obtained by cloning the 3.8-kb fragment upstream of the 0.115/CAT construct. The transgene 3.8+0.7/CAT was obtained by inserting a polymerase chain reaction fragment (subsequently sequenced) between theBamHIa and SmaI sites. 2Further details of the cloning procedures are available on request. All constructs were cloned in the sense orientation, except the transgene A+C+0.8/CAT, in which fragment C was cloned in the antisense orientation. Inserts were isolated from agarose gels and purified on Elutip-d columns (Schleicher & Schuell). The fragments (5–10 ng in a 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA buffer) were microinjected into fertilized B6D2 mouse eggs (17Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 219-250Google Scholar). Transgenic founders and offspring were identified (18Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) by Southern blotting using a random-primed CAT probe. CAT activities generated by transgene expression were assayed on 0.5–500 μg of liver, heart, lung, and brain extract proteins (19Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from rat brain according to Piette et al. (20Piette J. Kryszke M.H. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and from rat liver according to Gorski et al. (21Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression vectors for the different glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were constructed by inserting an entire coding region or a POU-coding region of mouse class III POU genes into the vector pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For GST-Brn-1, the 2-kb SmaI fragment was subcloned at theSmaI site of pGEX2TΔB (in which the BamHI site is modified by the fill-in reaction to alter the coding frame). The resulting fusion protein possesses part of Brn-1 (from amino acids 257 to 498) including the POU domain. For GST-Brn-2, theBamHI-EcoRI fragment derived from a Brn-2 partial cDNA clone was subcloned in frame in pGEX2T. This vector can produce a fusion protein with part of the Brn-2 protein (from amino acids 131 to 486) including the POU domain. For GST-Brn-4, the 2.3-kbBamHI-EcoRI fragment was subcloned in pGEX2T. The fusion protein contains the entire Brn-4 amino acid sequence plus three extra residues added at the junction. For GST-Oct-6, the 1-kbSmaI fragment was subcloned at the SmaI site of pGEX2T. This expression vector can produce a fusion protein containing the Oct-6 POU domain (from amino acids 229 to 448). The recombinant proteins were produced and purified as recommended by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides used as probes or competitors were as follows: 28 bp (bp −862 to −835 of the rat aldolase C gene (7Vibert M. Henry J. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (12Thomas M. Skala H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol.

Various amounts of specific or unrelated competitors were included or not. For supershift assays, binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C, and then 1 or 2 μl of antibodies were added and further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. DNA complexes were separated on 6% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Anti-HNF-3β polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by J. E. Darnell (Rockefeller University, New York); anti-Oct-1, anti-Brn-1, and anti-Brn-2 polyclonal antibodies were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. For methylation interference assays (27Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar), binding reactions included partially methylated 5′- or 3′-labeled 28-bp probe. Bound and free DNA fractions separated by gel shift electrophoresis were cleaved with piperidine at modified guanine and adenine residues (28Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar) and loaded on a 8 m urea, 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Using the CAT reporter gene, we previously showed that the transcriptional activity of the rat aldolase C gene in transgenic mice was ensured by a short 115-bp promoter that was brain-specific, but that was considerably more active when present in a construct containing 5.5 kb of aldolase C upstream sequences (10Thomas M. Makeh I. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Makeh I. Thomas M. Hardelin J.P. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To localize activating sequences in this 5.5-kb fragment, we analyzed, in transgenic mice, various combinations of aldolase C gene 5′-noncoding sequences fused to the CAT reporter gene. Potential regulatory elements are usually correlated with the presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the chromatin. However, in the case of the aldolase C gene, we reported only one hypersensitive site located in the vicinity of the transcription start sites in the 115-bp promoter (11Makeh I. Thomas M. Hardelin J.P. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So, we used naturally occurring restriction sites to perform arbitrary deletions in the 5.5-kb fragment (Fig. 1). All constructs contained the 115-bp promoter and exhibited brain-specific expression, with CAT activities being at least 100–1000-fold higher in the brain than in the heart, lung, and liver of transgenic animals. As already reported (11Makeh I. Thomas M. Hardelin J.P. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there was no correlation between the number of integrated copies and the CAT activity of the aldolase C/CAT chimeric transgenes. For most constructs, we therefore analyzed a great number of independent transgenic lines or founders to overcome integration site-dependent variations of transgene expression. A large deletion leaving ∼0.8 kb of upstream sequences (transgene 0.8/CAT) was previously shown to drastically reduce transcription in the brain (11Makeh I. Thomas M. Hardelin J.P. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), compared with the construct containing 5.5 kb of 5′-noncoding sequences (transgene 5.5/CAT) (Fig. 1 and Table I). CAT activities directed by the 0.8/CAT transgene were in the same range as those obtained with the 0.115/CAT transgene containing the short promoter alone (10Thomas M. Makeh I. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,11Makeh I. Thomas M. Hardelin J.P. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. J. Biol.

No correlation between copy number and CAT activity level was observed. Open table in a new tab For each transgenic mouse, three other tissues were tested (heart, lung, and liver); CAT activities were at least 100–1000-fold lower than in brain. aCopy numbers ranged from 2 to 40. No correlation between copy number and CAT activity level was observed. The transgene 3.8+0.8/CAT, containing an internal deletion of 0.9 kb (BamHIa-BamHIb; Fig. 1), was then analyzed. CAT activities ranged between 400- and 1000-fold the activities observed with the transgene 0.8/CAT (Table I), being even higher and less dispersed than CAT activities directed by the original 5.5/CAT construct. This latest observation could be explained either by the occurrence of a negative element in the deleted 0.9-kb fragment or by a position effect. These results indicate that the far upstream 3.8-kb fragment contains elements able to induce transcriptional activation. However, when cloned directly upstream of the 115-bp promoter (transgene 3.8+0.115/CAT; Fig. 1), the 3.8-kb element directed low CAT activities in the brains of transgenic mice, not exceeding 32 cpm/min/μg of protein (Table I). The 3.8-kb fragment alone is thus unable to ensure activation. Cooperation between upstream elements, present in the 0.6-kb sequences located immediately upstream of the 115-bp promoter, and far upstream elements, present in the 3.8-kb region, is necessary to activate the aldolase C promoter in vivo. The 3.8-kb fragment was then subdivided into four subfragments, A–D, which were cloned in various combinations upstream of the 0.8/CAT construct (Fig. 1 and Table II). The fully active transgene 3.8+0.8/CAT, which contained subfragments A, B, C, and D, was again reported in this table. Deletion of element A (transgene B+C+D+0.8/CAT) decreased the brain CAT activities below 40 cpm/min/μg of protein in the nine transgenic lines analyzed, with five lines exhibiting CAT activities below 1 cpm/min/μg of protein. These results indicate that element A is necessary for transcriptional activation. However, when element A was cloned alone upstream of the 0.8/CAT construct (transgene A+0.8/CAT), we observed a binary distribution of the CAT values, with only three transgenic lines out of six expressing high activities in the brain. This dispersion of the CAT values, which probably reflects the position effect already reported in transgene expression (29Robertson G. Garrick D. Wu W. Kearns M. Martin D. Whitelaw E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5371-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), contrasts with the high activities obtained in all lines with the 3.8+0.8/CAT transgene. We then hypothesized that element A contains sequences able to activate transcription (see lines 4, 12, and 29), but that depending on the integration site, it could need sequences present in element B or/and C or/and D to overcome a negative influence of the chromatin environment. We therefore cloned each of elements B–D between the element A and 0.8/CAT sequences (Table II). When element B was present in addition to element A (transgene A+B+0.8/CAT), a bimodal distribution of the CAT values was observed again, as was the case with element A alone. In contrast, the A+C+0.8/CAT transgene directed high levels of CAT expression in the brain for nine out of ten transgenic lines, with activities ranging from >200 to 3500 cpm/min/μg of protein. Consequently, fragment C seems to contain elements allowing, in cooperation with element A, for a high transcriptional activity more or less independent of the chromatin environment. The A+D+0.8/CAT transgene directed CAT activities intermediate between those obtained with transgenes containing A or A+B elements and transgenes containing A+B+C+D or A+C elements. Thus, the 1.3-kb fragment A and the 0.7-kb fragment C were the most efficient far upstream elements to ensure a high transcriptional level, in cooperation with the 0.6-kb upstream region.Table IIDissection of the 3.8-kb fragmentSee the legend to Table I for details.aCopy numbers ranged from 2 to 40. No correlation between copy number and CAT activity level was observed. Open table in a new tab See the legend to Table I for details. aCopy numbers ranged from 2 to 40. No correlation between copy number and CAT activity level was observed. Computer analysis of the 0.6-kb sequence and in vitro DNA/protein interaction studies (see below) revealed the presence of several DNA-binding sites for regulatory proteins of the POU domain family. To determine which sequences are able to cooperate with the far upstream activator, we compared the CAT activities directed by the 3.8+0.8/CAT transgene and by transgenes progressively deleted in the upstream 0.6-kb region, including the 3.8+115/CAT construct (Fig. 1). The results are presented in Table III. Four protein-binding sites (described below) are indicated on the schemes of the transgenes. Analysis of the 3.8+0.7/CAT transgene showed very dispersed expression levels, with three out of nine transgenic lines (lines 2, 30, and 56) still exhibiting high CAT activities in the brain (from 350 to 800 cpm/min/μg of protein) and the others expressing the reporter gene at markedly decreased levels (from 90 to <1 cpm/min/μg of protein). CAT activities directed by the 3.8+0.5/CAT transgene were similarly dispersed, but remained at or below 100 cpm/min/μg of protein in all ten lines, i.e. in the same range as activities observed with the 3.8+115/CAT transgene. Thus, the main decrease in the transgene expression level was observed when the 100 bp located at the 5′-end of the 0.6-kb fragment were deleted, although an additional decrease also seemed to occur when an additional 200 bp were removed.Table IIIDissection of the 0.8-Kb fragmentSee the legend to Table I for details. ■, 28-bp element; ▪, site 824 oligonucleotide; ▦, site 524 oligonucleotide; ○, box C oligonucleotide.aCopy numbers ranged from 2 to 40.

Biochem. 1989; 181: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) aldolase C genes revealed a perfect homology over an AT-rich, 28-bp motif located at the 5′-end of the rat gene 0.6-kb fragment (bp −862 to −835). Binding of nuclear factors on the 28-bp labeled probe was investigated by EMSA. Using rat brain nuclear extracts, three specific complexes (x, y, and z) were observed, which were abolished by competition with the 28-bp unlabeled oligonucleotide and not by the unrelated Sp1 competitor (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–3 and 7). Rat liver nuclear extracts displayed two 28-bp binding activities (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3): complex x′, exhibiting the same electrophoretic mobility (data not shown) as the brain complex x, and the retarded band u. Complex x/x′ was also detected with other non-neuronal tissue or cell extracts, whereas complexes y and z were only detected with brain extracts (data not shown). The AT-rich sequence of the 28-bp motif was reminiscent of binding sites for homeodomain proteins. We focused on the POU protein family, whose several members are specifically expressed in nervous tissues and have been involved in regulatory events concerning development and differentiation of the nervous system (31Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ubiquitous complex x/x′ and the brain-specific complexes y and z, but not the liver complex u, were totally displaced by the Oct oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 4), containing the Oct-1-binding site TAATGARAT of a herpes simplex virus immediate-early gene promoter (22O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Haigh A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4231-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Bendall A.J. Sturm R.A. Danoy P.A.C. Molloy P.L. Eur. J.

The CRH II oligonucleotide, matching with the preferential affinity consensus sequence CATnTAAT for the class III POU proteins (23Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was also able to abolish formation of complexes x, y, and z with brain extracts (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). A methylation interference analysis performed on the major brain-specific complex y revealed strong interference at adenine −854 on the noncoding strand and adenine −853 on the coding strand of the 28-bp element (Fig. 2 C). Accordingly, the 28mut oligonucleotide, bearing T → G and A → C transversions at positions −854 and −853, respectively, was unable to prevent formation of complex y with the labeled 28-bp probe (Fig. 2 A, lane 6); it also failed to compete for formation of the brain complexes x and z and of the liver complexes x′ and u (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 6), suggesting that the binding sites for each of these interactions overlap and that they share at least 1 nucleotide required for DNA/protein contacts. Adenines −854 and −853 are located at the center of a palindromic motif (−858 to −849) presenting homologies in both orientations to several consensus binding sites for POU domain proteins (Fig. 3 A). This aldolase C motif matches at only six out of eight bases with the canonical octamer ATGCAAAT, but the most highly conserved positions (A+1 and A+7) are respected, and the T at position −1 is favorable (32Bendall A.J. Sturm R.A. Danoy P.A.C. Molloy P.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 799-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The aldolase C motif also matches at seven out of nine positions with the TAATGARAT consensus sequence, which represents an alternative binding site for Oct-1 (22O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Haigh A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4231-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Bendall A.J. Sturm R.A. Danoy P.A.C. Molloy P.L. Eur. J.

Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In supershift experiments with commercial polyclonal antibodies, complexes x (brain) and x′ (liver) were abolished by antibodies directed against the ubiquitous factor Oct-1 (Fig. 2, A, lane 8; and B, lane 7). Complexes y and z were abolished by antibodies directed against the brain-specific Brn-1 and Brn-2 factors, respectively (Fig. 2 A, lanes 9 and 10). Screening of data banks for homology to known protein-binding sites revealed that the 28-bp sequence also matched at eight out of eleven positions in antisense orientation with the consensus binding site for the WH protein HNF-3β (Fig. 3 A) (15Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10421-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 33Overdier D. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell.

Accordingly, in liver extracts, complex u was specifically abolished by the HNF-3 oligonucleotide, consisting of the HNF-3β-binding site of the transthyretin gene, and by a polyclonal antibody directed against the HNF-3β protein (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 8). Anti-HNF-3α and anti-HNF-3γ antibodies failed to supershift or abolish complex u (data not shown).

Approximately 50-fold higher concentrations of protease (trypsin or chymotrypsin) were required to inactivate IleRS after incubation with substrates and formation of the E·Ile-AMP intermediate compared with free E. Binding of pseudomonic acid A (PS-A) or isoleucynol adenylate (Ile-ol-AMP) also induced resistance to proteolysis and altered the patterns of IleRS cleavage fragments in an inhibitor-class specific manner. The determinants for PS-A binding were investigated via proteolysis of E·[3H]PS-A. Limited proteolysis of E·[3H]PS-A (excising residues 186–407) could be achieved without significant loss of bound inhibitor, eliminating this region as contributing to inhibitor binding. Assays were developed which allowed IleRS proteolysis to be readily followed using fluorescence polarization. Inhibitor-protected IleRS was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate with only a small effect upon catalytic activity (Fl-IleRS). The (pseudo) kinetics of proteolytic cleavage of Fl-IleRS could be measured at low nanomolar Fl-IleRS concentrations in 96/384-well microtiter plates, allowing real-time monitoring of dose-dependent protection from proteolysis.

As part of an effort to understand the precise mechanism of the interaction of PS-A and its analogues with IleRS we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the kinetics and thermodynamics of substrate and inhibitor binding by this enzyme (3Pope A.J.

These experiments showed that PS-A analogues are reversible, slow tight-binding inhibitors that form an highly stabilized inhibitor complex with overall dissociation constants in the picomolar range. Comparison of PS-A analogues with inhibitors that were non-hydrolyzable analogues of the normal activated enzyme intermdiate, Ile-AMP, showed that both classes of inhibitor bound to IleRS in a manner that was mutually exclusive with each other and with the substrates, l-isoleucine (Ile) and Mg·ATP, but that very different enzyme conformations were induced upon binding (as shown by differences in IleRS tryptophan fluorescence) (4Pope A.J.

In this report, we describe experiments in which we attempted to gain additional information on the binding of substrates and inhibitors to IleRS using different approaches to the more classical techniques which we had previously employed (e.g. state-state and transient kinetics (3Pope A.J.

Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 117-144Google Scholar), and this has previously been shown to yield useful information on several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (e.g. Refs. 6Cassio D. Walker J-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Kalogerakos T.P. Dessen G. Fayat G. Blanquet S.

Here, we used this approach in two distinct ways. First, the effect of substrate and inhibitor binding on IleRS proteolysis patterns was investigated in an attempt to identify protein determinants for binding. Second, a homogeneous real-time assay capable of monitoring ligand protection from IleRS proteolysis using fluorescence polarization was developed which could be potentially used to screen for new inhibitors.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEffect of Substrates on Proteolysis of IleRS Monitored by Catalyitc ActivityThe catalytic activity of IleRS can be monitored two ways: either through tRNA aminoacylation or via isotopic exchange from [32P]PPi into ATP, which is independent of tRNAIle binding (e.g. Ref. 14). The effects of protease digestion, using trypsin or chymotrypsin, were first examined on both of these activities where the digestion was performed in the absence of any substrates. This showed, unsurprisingly, that identical conditions were required for inactivation of both activities. Representative data showing the results obtained from trypsin treatment of IleRS are shown in Fig. 1. PPi/ATP exchange was used to investigate whether preincubation with saturating concentrations of the substrates, Ile and Mg·ATP (which leads to stoichiometric accumulation of the E·Ile-AMP intermediate (3Pope A.J. Lapointe J. Mensah L. Benson N. Brown M.J.B. Moore K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31680-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), induced stabilization of IleRS to proteolysis. Under the conditions used in the experiments shown in Fig. 1 (1-h digestion at 37 °C with trypsin), around 50-fold higher concentrations of protease were required to inactivate IleRS in the E·Ile-AMP form (Fig. 1). No such marked protection was observed with either of the individual substrates, Ile and Mg·ATP or tRNAIle (data not shown).This approach was not applicable to the examination of stabilization to proteolysis by inhibitors, since inhibitor binding effectively precludes measuring the consequences of proteolysis via its effect upon residual catalytic activity for obvious reasons. Two complimentary approaches were therefore adopted to characterize substrate and inhibitor binding further. First, the proteolytic fragmentation of IleRS was characterized using classical separation techniques, such as SDS-PAGE and column chromatography. Second, attempts were made to fluorescently label IleRS while retaining functional activity to develop fluorescence-based assays for proteolysis that would allow a more quantitative approach to the measurement of proteolysis rates.Analysis of Ligand-induced Stabilization of IleRS by SDS-PAGEEffects of Substrates on Patterns of Proteolysis—The effect of a range of ligands on IleRS proteolysis was surveyed by characterization of the digestion products by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2 A shows representative results obtained when IleRS was preincubated with saturating concentrations of each of the individual substrates of the tRNA aminoacylation reaction (i.e. Ile, ATP, and tRNAIle) either alone or in combination, and then subjected to proteolysis using chymotrypsin. The control lane in Fig. 2 B shows that, in the absence of substrates, IleRS was extensively digested under these conditions, with the most predominant product being a single band at around 60 kDa. In contrast, each of the substrates protected IleRS from digestion by chymotrypsin to some extent (as shown by the residual undigested IleRS; Fig. 2 B), and produced a distinct pattern of proteolysis. Protection from proteolysis was much more pronounced with Mg·ATP and tRNAIle than with Ile (Fig. 2 A) and, interestingly, the major product of digestion of E·Ile was similar to that from free enzyme. This product was almost completely absent in the presence of other substrates. Adding combinations of substrates produced slightly more protection still. Interestingly, the presence of ATP and tRNAIle appeared to produce the highest level of protection of any of the conditions, even compared with all three of the substrates added together (Fig. 2 A). Digestion patterns of similar complexity, and showing more or less the same pattern of substrate protection were obtained when IleRS complexes were digested with other proteases (e.g. trypsin, thrombin, V8, thermolysin; data not shown).Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteolytic digestion products from IleRS treated in the presence of substrates (A) or inhibitors (B).

Both classes of inhibitor protected IleRS from proteolysis (compare the control lane in Fig. 2 B with the lanes containing inhibitors). Morevover, the pattern of proteolytic fragmentation observed upon digestion of E·inhibitor complexes appeared to be inhibitor class specific. This was shown by the fact that the digestion pattern observed by addition of PS-A and SB 205952 and of Ile-ol-AMP and Ile-NHSO2-AMP, respectively, were identical (Fig. 2 B). In particular, digestion of the IleRS complex with PS-A or SB 205952 yielded a pattern that was most similar to that observed upon digestion of the E·Ile binary complex (compare Fig. 2, A and B), yielding around 8 major fragments sized between 10 and 60 kDa, two of which were most predominant (Figs. 2 and 3). The proteolytic patterns observed with the two analogues of Ile-AMP were clearly different, confirming that the conformation of the inhibitor complex was distinct when formed with PS-A or Ile-AMP analogues, respectively (4Pope A.J.

This made it extremely difficult to make comparisons between independent experiments, as the overall extent of proteolysis could not easily be controlled. For example, this may well be the reason why the fragmentation pattern observed for cleavage of the catalytic E·Ile-AMP complex (i.e. E + Ile + Mg·ATP) appears dissimilar to that when the E·Ile-ol-AMP orE·Ile-NHSO2-AMP complexes are digested (e.g. compare the extent of proteolysis in Figs. 2, A, lane 9 (+ATP, Ile) and B, lanes 5–6 (+Ile-ol-AMP, +Ile-NHSO2-AMP)), despite the fact that IleRS tryptophan fluorescence measurements had suggested a similar enzyme conformation in both cases (3Pope A.J. Lapointe J. Mensah L. Benson N. Brown M.J.B. Moore K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31680-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Pope A.J. Moore K.J. McVey M.

For this reason, we focused on trying to gain some further information on the distinct fragmentation pattern observed when binding PS-A to IleRS, and simultaneously developed alternative methods to allow proteolysis to be characterized in a more quantitative manner.The relatively complex patterns of proteolytic digestion observed here contrast with the results of Yanigasawa et al. (9Yanigasawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 39: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) who found that tryptic digests of the Escherichia coli IleRS complexed with ATP or PS-A resulted in a specific cleavage at a single site at lysine 605. The same authors observed no protection from this proteolytic event by saturating concentrations of Ile or tRNAIle. Yanigasawa et al. (9Yanigasawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 39: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) used similar amounts of protease (∼1:50, w/w, protease:IleRS) but very different exposure conditions (overnight on ice cf, 37 °C for 1 h in the present study). It is therefore difficult to conclude whether the very simple proteolytic patterns observed by these workers reflected differences in the structure of the E·PS-A complex between E. coli and Staphylococcus aureusIleRS, or the kinetics/extent of the proteolysis conditions.Proteolysis of the E·[3H]PS-A ComplexTo test if the cleaved IleRS is competent to bind PS-A, proteolytic digestions were performed on the complex of IleRS with 3H-labeled PS-A. Digestion of E·[3H]PS-A with chymotrypsin under the conditions shown in Fig. 2 B did not lead to any significant loss of bound [3H]PS-A. Using [3H]PS-A as a marker, the fragments that retained inhibitor binding were purified under nondenaturing conditions. However, chromatographic separation of the digested material using a range of different techniques (e.g. ion exhange (Fig. 3 A, lane 5, Resource Q), size exclusion (Fig. 3 A, lane 6, Sephacryl S-200), hydrophobic interaction (Phenyl-Sepharose; data not shown)), including running multiple separation steps in tandem, always resulted in elution of [3H]PS-A in a single peak, which on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A) or reverse phase-HPLC (Fig. 3 B, inset) was shown to consist of two components. Fig. 3 B shows a typical ion-exchange chromatographic purification of the digestedE·[3H]PS-A complex. The fact that these two enzyme fragments always co-purified together suggests strongly that they were tightly associated with each other and with [3H]PS-A.Laser desorption mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing of the product(s) from several purifications showed that they were always the same two peptides comprising amino acids 1–185 (21.762 kDa; N-terminal amino acid sequence, MDYKETLLM) and 407–918 (59.073 kDa; N-terminal amino acid sequence, RATPQWFASISK). These fragments therefore correspond to the two major products observed from digestion of the complex of IleRS with PS-A or SB 205952 (e.g. Figs. 2 B and 4 A). Therefore, chymotryptic digestion of IleRS complexed with this class of inhibitor leads to excision of a central portion of the enzyme between residues 186 and 406, with the remaining portions still tightly associated with each other and inhibitor. These enzyme domains contain all of the conserved sequences implicated in catalysis (e.g. HIGH and KMSKS; see Ref. 14Meinel T. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA, Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 251-292Google Scholar).

Residues 186–406 therefore appear to play no role in PS-A binding. Using similar purification procedures to those shown in Fig. 3, the truncated E·PS-A complex was successfully purified to >99% purity yielding sufficient material (>10 mg) to initiate crystallography for x-ray diffraction experiments.Figure 4Characterization of Fl-IleRS and fluorescence polarization assays of substrate and inhibitor protection from proteolysis.

Checovich W. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 585-589PubMed Google Scholar and 17Jolley M.E. J. Biomol. Screening. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This approach is based upon the differences in the molecular rotational correlation time and hence polarization of a fluorophore when attached to a large protein substrate compared with that of small proteolytic fragments. Hence, proteolysis leads to a reduction in overall fluorophore fluorescence polarization that allows enzymatic cleavage to be followed in real-time. To facilitate this approach, we labeled IleRS with FITC in the presence of saturating concentrations of Ile-ol-AMP to protect the IleRS active site. This inhibitor was chosen because it has a relatively fast off-rate (k−i = ∼0.1 s−1 (4Pope A.J. Moore K.J. McVey M. Mensah L. Benson N. Osbourne N. Broom N. Brown M.J.B. O'Hanlon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31691-31701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) and could readily be removed by gel filtration or dialysis. By optimizing the conditions for labeling we were able to reproducibly produce fluorescein-IleRS (Fl-IleRS) that had a labeling stoichiometry of ∼1:1 mol/mol and retained around 75% of the catalytic activity of unlabeled IleRS, as measured by tRNA aminoaclation or PPi/ATP exchange. Higher labeling stoichiometries led to a greater loss of catalytic activity.To establish whether fluorescein labeling affected inhibitor binding to IleRS we performed stopped-flow mixing experiments between Fl-IleRS and SB 205952, a pseudomonic acid analogue that possesses a chromophore that induces a large change in enzyme tryptophan fluorescence upon binding via radiationless energy transfer (4Pope A.J. Moore K.J. McVey M. Mensah L. Benson N. Osbourne N. Broom N. Brown M.J.B. O'Hanlon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31691-31701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The kinetics of binding of SB 205952 to Fl-IleRS and unlabeled enzyme were almost identical. In the example shown in Fig. 4 A, in which 0.2 μm Fl-IleRS was mixed with 75 μm SB 205952 (final concentrations), the rate constant for binding (k obs) was 125.1 ± 1.75 s−1 and 126.5 ± 2.9 s−1 for native and Fl-IleRS, respectively. However, the amplitude of the fluorescence transient was smaller with Fl-IleRS (27% of total enzyme tryptophan fluorescence, cf. 40% for native IleRS). This was consistent with the measurements of catalytic activity which suggested that fluorescent labeling of IleRS resulted in loss of about a quarter of its catalytic activity, possibly by labeling at lysine residues in the region of the active site. As the overall stoichiometry of labeling was close to unity, one possible interpretation was that only a proportion of the IleRS was labeled with fluorescein (at multiple stoichiometry), and that the catalytic activity and stopped-flow transients were arising from residual unlabeled enzyme. However, this was not the case because Fl-IleRS was capable of binding inhibitor since a transient change in the fluorescein fluorescence emission could also observed upon binding SB 205952 (Fig. 4 A). This could only originate from labeled enzyme.Subsequent proteolysis protection experiments suggested that Fl-IleRS was competent to bind substrate and inhibitors (see below), so the reduction in catalytic activity seems most likely to be a general effect of IleRS labeling, rather than the presence of populations of active and inactive labeled (and unlabeled) IleRS forms. SDS-PAGE analysis of Fl-IleRS digestion patterns in the presence and absence of inhibitors showed similar patterns to those observed with unlabeled enzyme (e.g. Fig. 1). Despite the fact that IleRS was labeled at an average stoichiometry of close to 1, virtually all of the Fl-IleRS digestion fragments were fluorescently-labeled (as visualized using an imaging system). It therefore seemed that FITC treatment resulted in the labeling of Fl-IleRS at many different surface lysine residues.Real-time Measurements of Fl-IleRS Proteolysis Monitored by Fluorescence PolarizationMeasurements of the fluorescence properties of Fl-IleRS suggested that it would be a useful system with which to monitor IleRS proteolysis. The fluorescence intensity of Fl-IleRS was sufficiently bright to monitor ∼1 nmconcentrations with a coefficient of variation of <5% in commercial fluorescence plate readers. However, as is commonly found with fluorescein (18Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemical. Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR1996Google Scholar), the Fl-IleRS conjugate fluorescence was highly quenched (<30% of the brightness of unreacted FITC). As would be expected from the large size of the IleRS monomer (106 kDa), Fl-IleRS fluorescence was highly polarized (∼250 mP). These observations suggested that the generation of proteolytic fragments of Fl-IleRS could be monitored either via relief of fluorescence quenching or changes in overall fluorescence polarization. Indeed, mixing Fl-IleRS with protease resulted in a time-dependent increase in overall fluorescence intensity (data not shown) and a decrease in fluorescence polarization (e.g. Fig. 4 B). The rate of fluorescence change showed a first-order dependence in protease concentration up to around 25 μg/ml (or trypsin or chymotrypsin), yielding a rate of polarization decrease of 3–4 mP/min. This was sufficient to measure proteolysis rates with reasonable precision at Fl-IleRS concentrations of around 1 nm and using 30–60-min time courses. In the absence of protease, the fluorescence signal from IleRS was stable over this period (e.g. Fig. 4 B). Although measurements of the changes in fluorescence intensity and polarization could be used more or less interchangeably, fluorescence polarization, which is a ratiometric technique, was found to be intrinsically more reliable and less prone to interference and so was used routinely.The recent availability of commercial microtiter plate fluorescence polarization instruments meant that such measurements could be made in a highly automated manner and using relatively small sample volumes (30–100 μl). Typical time courses measured on such a system are shown in Fig. 4 B, which shows chymotrypsin digestion of Fl-IleRS in the presence and absence of Ile and Mg·ATP. In this example, the rate of decrease of fluorescence polarization was 3.6 mP min−1 in the absence of substrates and 1.1 mP min−1 in the presence of Mg·ATP and Ile, so the rate of digestion was therefore reduced by around one-third when Fl-IleRS formed the Fl-E·Ile-AMP intermediate. This method therefore provided at least semi-quantitative data on the rates of proteolysis and the susceptibility to proteolysis of different Fl-E·ligand complexes. Table I summarizes the results of experiments to measure the protection from proteolysis by each of the individual substrates using this method. The results are in reasonable accordance with measurements of substrate binding using conventional methods (K d, ATP = 2.5 mm;K d, Ile = 100 μm,K m, tRNA = <0.1 μm(3Pope A.J. Lapointe J. Mensah L. Benson N. Brown M.J.B. Moore K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31680-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, the maximum decrease in proteolytic rate observed in the presence of substrates was around one-third of the control values. This may represent the limit of proteolytic protection for Fl-E·S (or reaction intermediate) complexes, at least under the conditions used here.Table IProtectio"
