https://openalex.org/W2789900707,"Comprehensive genomic characterization of prostate cancer has identified recurrent alterations in genes involved in androgen signaling, DNA repair, and PI3K signaling, among others. However, larger and uniform genomic analysis may identify additional recurrently mutated genes at lower frequencies. Here we aggregate and uniformly analyze exome sequencing data from 1,013 prostate cancers. We identify and validate a new class of E26 transformation-specific (ETS)-fusion-negative tumors defined by mutations in epigenetic regulators, as well as alterations in pathways not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the spliceosome pathway. We find that the incidence of significantly mutated genes (SMGs) follows a long-tail distribution, with many genes mutated in less than 3% of cases. We identify a total of 97 SMGs, including 70 not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the ubiquitin ligase CUL3 and the transcription factor SPEN. Finally, comparing primary and metastatic prostate cancer identifies a set of genomic markers that may inform risk stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2795028304,"Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death caused by the failure of the glutathione-dependent lipid-peroxide-scavenging network. FINO2 is an endoperoxide-containing 1,2-dioxolane that can initiate ferroptosis selectively in engineered cancer cells. We investigated the mechanism and structural features necessary for ferroptosis initiation by FINO2. We found that FINO2 requires both an endoperoxide moiety and a nearby hydroxyl head group to initiate ferroptosis. In contrast to previously described ferroptosis inducers, FINO2 does not inhibit system xc– or directly target the reducing enzyme GPX4, as do erastin and RSL3, respectively, nor does it deplete GPX4 protein, as does FIN56. Instead, FINO2 both indirectly inhibits GPX4 enzymatic function and directly oxidizes iron, ultimately causing widespread lipid peroxidation. These findings suggest that endoperoxides such as FINO2 can initiate a multipronged mechanism of ferroptosis. FINO2 is a small molecule that requires the endoperoxide moiety and hydroxyl group to promote ferroptosis through indirect inhibition of GPX4 enzymatic function and direct oxidation of iron, resulting in increased lipid peroxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2794458614,"Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of genetic variants that are associated with disease1. Most of these variants have small effect sizes, but their downstream expression effects, so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), are often large2 and celltype-specific3–5. To identify these celltype-specific eQTLs using an unbiased approach, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to generate expression profiles of ~25,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 donors. We identified previously reported cis-eQTLs, but also identified new celltype-specific cis-eQTLs. Finally, we generated personalized co-expression networks and identified genetic variants that significantly alter co-expression relationships (which we termed ‘co-expression QTLs’). Single-cell eQTL analysis thus allows for the identification of genetic variants that impact regulatory networks. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of ~25,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 donors identifies new celltype-specific cis-eQTLs and genetic variants that significantly alter co-expression relationships (‘co-expression QTLs’)."
https://openalex.org/W2795164082,"DNA methylation loss occurs frequently in cancer genomes, primarily within lamina-associated, late-replicating regions termed partially methylated domains (PMDs). We profiled 39 diverse primary tumors and 8 matched adjacent tissues using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and analyzed them alongside 343 additional human and 206 mouse WGBS datasets. We identified a local CpG sequence context associated with preferential hypomethylation in PMDs. Analysis of CpGs in this context (‘solo-WCGWs’) identified previously undetected PMD hypomethylation in almost all healthy tissue types. PMD hypomethylation increased with age, beginning during fetal development, and appeared to track the accumulation of cell divisions. In cancer, PMD hypomethylation depth correlated with somatic mutation density and cell cycle gene expression, consistent with its reflection of mitotic history and suggesting its application as a mitotic clock. We propose that late replication leads to lifelong progressive methylation loss, which acts as a biomarker for cellular aging and which may contribute to oncogenesis. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling and analysis of normal tissues from both human and mouse reveal that hypomethylation within partially methylated, late-replicating domains depends on sequence context, starts early in development, accumulates with cell divisions and progresses with organismal aging."

https://openalex.org/W2795008267,"Although cancer genomes are replete with noncoding mutations, the effects of these mutations remain poorly characterized. Here we perform an integrative analysis of 930 tumor whole genomes and matched transcriptomes, identifying a network of 193 noncoding loci in which mutations disrupt target gene expression. These ‘somatic eQTLs’ (expression quantitative trait loci) are frequently mutated in specific cancer tissues, and the majority can be validated in an independent cohort of 3,382 tumors. Among these, we find that the effects of noncoding mutations on DAAM1, MTG2 and HYI transcription are recapitulated in multiple cancer cell lines and that increasing DAAM1 expression leads to invasive cell migration. Collectively, the noncoding loci converge on a set of core pathways, permitting a classification of tumors into pathway-based subtypes. The somatic eQTL network is disrupted in 88% of tumors, suggesting widespread impact of noncoding mutations in cancer. Analysis of whole-genome sequences and transcription data from tumors identifies noncoding loci in which mutations affect target gene expression. These somatic eQTLs can classify tumors into pathway-based subtypes and are disrupted in 88% of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2795406817,"Microglia are immune cells of the central nervous system and are implicated in brain inflammation. However, how brain microglia modulate transport and metabolism of the essential metal iron in response to pro- and anti-inflammatory environmental cues is unclear. Here, we characterized uptake of transferrin (Tf)-bound iron (TBI) and non-Tf-bound iron (NTBI) by immortalized microglial (IMG) cells. We found that these cells preferentially take up NTBI in response to the proinflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or β-amyloid (Aβ). In contrast, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4) promoted TBI uptake. Concordant with these functional data, levels of the Tf receptor (TfR) in IMG cells were up-regulated in response to IL-4, whereas divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) and ferritin levels increased in response to LPS or Aβ. Similar changes in expression were confirmed in isolated primary adult mouse microglia treated with pro- or anti-inflammatory inducers. LPS-induced changes in IMG cell iron metabolism were accompanied by notable metabolic changes, including increased glycolysis and decreased oxidative respiration. Under these conditions, the extracellular acidification rate was increased, compatible with changes in the cellular microenvironment that would support the pH-dependent function of DMT1. Moreover, LPS increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) expression in IMG cells, and iron released because of HO1 activity increased the intracellular labile free-iron pool. Together, this evidence indicates that brain microglia preferentially acquire iron from Tf or from non-Tf sources, depending on their polarization state; that NTBI uptake is enhanced by the proinflammatory response; and that under these conditions microglia sequester both extra- and intracellular iron."

Here we integrate tumor barcoding, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and ultra-deep barcode sequencing to interrogate pairwise combinations of tumor suppressor alterations in autochthonous mouse models of human lung adenocarcinoma. We map the tumor suppressive effects of 31 common lung adenocarcinoma genotypes and identify a landscape of context dependence and differential effect strengths."
https://openalex.org/W2795587190,"Over 26 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure annually. When the cause of heart failure cannot be identified, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) represents the gold-standard for the evaluation of disease. However, manual EMB interpretation has high inter-rater variability. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to detect cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and dermatologic lesions from images. In this study, we develop a CNN classifier to detect clinical heart failure from H&E stained whole-slide images from a total of 209 patients, 104 patients were used for training and the remaining 105 patients for independent testing. The CNN was able to identify patients with heart failure or severe pathology with a 99% sensitivity and 94% specificity on the test set, outperforming conventional feature-engineering approaches. Importantly, the CNN outperformed two expert pathologists by nearly 20%. Our results suggest that deep learning analytics of EMB can be used to predict cardiac outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2795910885,"The fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is a species native to the Americas. This polyphagous lepidopteran pest was first reported in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Principe in 2016, but its presence in eastern Africa has not been confirmed via molecular characterisation. In this study, FAW specimens from western and central Uganda were identified based on the partial mtDNA COI gene sequences, with mtDNA COI haplotypes matching those identified in Nigeria and São Tomé. In this study, we sequence an additional partial mtDNA Cyt b gene and also the partial mtDNA COIII gene in Ugandan FAW samples. We detected identical mitochondrial DNA haplotypes for both the mtDNA Cyt b and COI partial genes, while combining the mtDNA COI/Cyt b haplotypes and mtDNA COIII haplotypes enabled a new maternal lineage in the Ugandan corn-preferred FAW samples to be identified. Our results suggested that the African incursions of S. frugiperda involved at least three maternal lineages. Recent full genome, phylogenetic and microsatellite analyses provided evidence to support S. frugiperda as likely consisted of two sympatric sister species known as the corn-preferred and rice-preferred strains. In our Ugandan FAW populations, we identified the presence of mtDNA haplotypes representative of both sister species. It is not known if both FAW sister species were originally introduced together or separately, and whether they have since spread as a single population. Further analyses of additional specimens originally collected from São Tomé, Nigeria and throughout Africa would be required to clarify this issue. Importantly, our finding showed that the genetic diversity of the African corn-preferred FAW species is higher than previously reported. This potentially contributed to the success of FAW establishment in Africa. Furthermore, with the additional maternal lineages detected, there is likely an increase in paternal lineages, thereby increasing the diversity of the African FAW population. Knowledge of the FAW genetic diversity will be needed to assess the risks of introducing Bt-resistance traits and to understand the FAW incursion pathways into the Old World and its potential onward spread. The agricultural implications of the presence of two evolutionary divergent FAW lineages (the corn and the rice lineage) in the African continent are further considered and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2795180687,"Single-fluorescent-molecule imaging tracking (SMT) is becoming an important tool to study living cells. However, photobleaching and photoblinking (hereafter referred to as photobleaching/photoblinking) of the probe molecules strongly hamper SMT studies of living cells, making it difficult to observe in vivo molecular events and to evaluate their lifetimes (e.g., off rates). The methods used to suppress photobleaching/photoblinking in vitro are difficult to apply to living cells because of their toxicities. Here using 13 organic fluorophores we found that, by combining low concentrations of dissolved oxygen with a reducing-plus-oxidizing system, photobleaching/photoblinking could be strongly suppressed with only minor effects on cells, which enabled SMT for as long as 12,000 frames (~7 min at video rate, as compared to the general 10-s-order durations) with ~22-nm single-molecule localization precisions. SMT of integrins revealed that they underwent temporary (<80-s) immobilizations within the focal adhesion region, which were responsible for the mechanical linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Dissolved oxygen and a reducing-plus-oxidizing system suppress photobleaching and photoblinking in single-molecule tracking experiments, allowing long recordings of CD47 and integrin that showed temporary immobilization within focal adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2795600679,"Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) is an important histone mark involved in both transcription elongation and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). It is known that H3K36me3 recruits the mismatch-recognition protein MutSα to replicating chromatin via its physical interaction with MutSα's PWWP domain, but the exact role of H3K36me3 in transcription is undefined. Using ChIP combined with whole-genome DNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrate here that H3K36me3, together with MutSα, is involved in protecting against mutation, preferentially in actively transcribed genomic regions. We found that H3K36me3 and MutSα are much more co-enriched in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and nontranscribed regions. The H3K36me3–MutSα co-enrichment correlated with a much lower mutation frequency in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and nontranscribed regions. Correspondingly, depleting H3K36me3 or disrupting the H3K36me3–MutSα interaction elevated the spontaneous mutation frequency in actively transcribed genes, but it had little influence on the mutation frequency in nontranscribed or transcriptionally inactive regions. Similarly, H2O2-induced mutations, which mainly cause base oxidations, preferentially occurred in actively transcribed genes in MMR-deficient cells. The data presented here suggest that H3K36me3-mediated MMR preferentially safeguards actively transcribed genes not only during replication by efficiently correcting mispairs in early replicating chromatin but also during transcription by directly or indirectly removing DNA lesions associated with a persistently open chromatin structure."

In total 3.2% (29/908) of the collection were positive for mcr, including 27 Escherichia coli, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 Enterobacter cloacae. Twenty-four isolates possessed genes from the mcr-1 family, including the original mcr-1 (n = 22), as well as mcr-1.2 (n = 1) and mcr-1.5 (n = 1), which each differ from mcr-1 by encoding single amino acid variations. Genes from the mcr-3 family were found in isolates from Thailand, including mcr-3.1 (n = 3) and mcr-3.2 (n = 1). An E. coli isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection in Colombia contained the recently discovered mcr-5. The full colistin-resistant collection was tested against a panel of antimicrobial agents with ceftazidime-avibactam and tigecycline exhibiting the highest activity."
https://openalex.org/W2796149500,"Vitiligo is a depigmentary disorder that develops as a result of the progressive disappearance of epidermal melanocytes. Stress can precipitate or exacerbate a skin disease through psychosomatic mechanisms. Stress exposure induces vitiligo-like symptoms in mice, as cellular damage to melanocytes causes synthetic pigment loss. Stress also increases IL-17, IL-1β, and antimelanocyte IgG in model mouse serum. Up-regulation of the IL-1β transcript in patients suggests its possible role in autoimmune pathogenesis of vitiligo. We demonstrate that IL-17 promoted IL-1β secretion from keratinocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which can induce the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is emerging as a mechanism that underlies various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-17 inhibits melanogenesis of zebrafish, normal human epidermal melanocytes, and B16F10 cells. IL-17 increased mitochondrial dysfunc-tion and ROS accumulation, which was related to autophagy induction. Autophagy is needed for autophagic apoptosis of B16F10 cells induced by IL-17. To inhibit ROS generation, B16F10 cells were pretreated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which inhibited autophagy. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) also had an inhibiting effect on autophagy. NAC or 3-MA pretreatments inhibited IL-17-mediated cell apoptosis. In summary, IL-17 induces the cellular stress microenvironment in melanocytes to promote autophagic cell apoptosis in vitiligo.—Zhou, J., An, X., Dong, J., Wang, Y., Zhong, H., Duan, L., Ling, J., Ping, F., Shang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2795648902,"Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are microbial multienzymes for the biosynthesis of biologically potent secondary metabolites. Polyketide production is initiated by the loading of a starter unit onto an integral acyl carrier protein (ACP) and its subsequent transfer to the ketosynthase (KS). Initial substrate loading is achieved either by multidomain loading modules or by the integration of designated loading domains, such as starter unit acyltransferases (SAT), whose structural integration into PKS remains unresolved. A crystal structure of the loading/condensing region of the nonreducing PKS CTB1 demonstrates the ordered insertion of a pseudodimeric SAT into the condensing region, which is aided by the SAT-KS linker. Cryo-electron microscopy of the post-loading state trapped by mechanism-based crosslinking of ACP to KS reveals asymmetry across the CTB1 loading/-condensing region, in accord with preferential 1:2 binding stoichiometry. These results are critical for re-engineering the loading step in polyketide biosynthesis and support functional relevance of asymmetric conformations of PKSs."
https://openalex.org/W2795757601,"Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2796358061,"In mammalian cells, autophagy plays crucial roles in restricting further spread of invading bacterial pathogens. Previous studies have established that the Salmonella virulence factors SseF and SseG are required for intracellular bacterial survival and replication. However, the underlying mechanism by which these two effectors facilitate bacterial infection remains elusive. Here, we report that SseF and SseG secreted by Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) inhibit autophagy in host cells and thereby establish a replicative niche for the bacteria in the cytosol. Mechanistically, SseF and SseG impaired autophagy initiation by directly interacting with the small GTPase Rab1A in the host cell. This interaction abolished Rab1A activation by disrupting the interaction with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the TRAPPIII (transport protein particle III) complex. This disruption of Rab1A signaling blocked the recruitment and activation of Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate biogenesis, which ultimately impeded autophagosome formation. Furthermore, SseF- or SseG-deficient bacterial strains exhibited reduced survival and growth in both mammalian cell lines and mouse infection models, and Rab1A depletion could rescue these defects. These results reveal that virulence factor–dependent inactivation of the small GTPase Rab1A represents a previously unrecognized strategy of S. Typhimurium to evade autophagy and the host defense system."
https://openalex.org/W2795831917,"To identify patterns summarizing the retinal vascular network in the elderly and to investigate the relationship of these vascular patterns with cardiovascular history.We conducted a population-based study, the Montrachet study (Maculopathy Optic Nerve nuTRition neurovAsCular and HEarT diseases), in participants older than 75 years. The history of cardiovascular disease and a score-based estimation of their 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality (Heart SCORE) were collected. Retinal vascular network analysis was performed by means of Singapore ""I"" Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Principal component analysis was used to condense the information contained in the high number of variables provided and to identify independent retinal vascular patterns.Overall, 1069 photographs (1069 participants) were reviewed with SIVA software. The mean age was 80.0 ± 3.8 years. We extracted three vascular patterns summarizing 41.3% of the vascular information. The most clinically relevant pattern, Sparse vascular network, accounted for 17.4% of the total variance. It corresponded to a lower density in the vascular network and higher variability in vessel width. Diabetic participants with hypoglycemic treatment had a sparser vascular network pattern than subjects without such treatment (odds ratio, [OR], 1.68; 95% CI, 1.04-2.72; P = 0.04). Participants with no history of cardiovascular disease who had a sparser vascular network were associated with a higher Heart SCORE (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08-2.25; P = 0.02).Three vascular patterns were identified. The Sparse vascular network pattern was associated with having a higher risk profile for cardiovascular mortality risk at 10 years."
https://openalex.org/W2794504533,"Zinc-finger protein 471 (ZNF471) was preferentially methylated in gastric cancer using promoter methylation array. The role of ZNF471 in human cancer is unclear. Here we elucidated the functional significance, molecular mechanisms and clinical impact of ZNF471 in gastric cancer. ZNF471 mRNA was silenced in 15 out of 16 gastric cancer cell lines due to promoter hypermethylation. Significantly higher ZNF471 promoter methylation was also observed in primary gastric cancers compared to their adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). ZNF471 promoter CpG-site hypermethylation correlated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients (n = 120, P = 0.001). Ectopic expression of ZNF471 in gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, BGC823, and MKN74) significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while it induced apoptosis in vitro and inhibited xenograft tumorigenesis in nude mice. Transcription factor AP-2 Alpha (TFAP2A) and plastin3 (PLS3) were two crucial downstream targets of ZNF471 demonstrated by bioinformatics modeling and ChIP-PCR assays. ZNF471 directly bound to the promoter of TFAP2A and PLS3 and transcriptionally inhibited their expression. TFAP2A and PLS3 showed oncogenic functions in gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, ZNF471 recruited KAP1 to the promoter of the target genes, thereby inducing H3K9me3 enrichment for transcriptional repression and inhibition of oncogenic TFAP2A and PLS3. In conclusion, ZNF471 acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer by transcriptionally inhibiting downstream targets TFAP2A and PLS3. KAP1 is a co-repressor of ZNF471 at the promoter of the target genes. The promoter CpG-site methylation is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of gastric cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W2795808249,"The growing area of European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F1 population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes. Applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to disentangle 'pseudo-linkage' between markers, removing markers around the translocation breakpoints and obtain a linear order of the markers for the two chromosomes arms, for each linkage group involved in the translocation. Twenty-nine QTL for time of leaf budburst were identified, including a stably expressed region on LG_02 of the Tonda Gentile delle Langhe map. The stability of these QTL and their coding sequence content indicates promise for the identification of specific chromosomal regions carrying key genes involved in leaf budburst."
https://openalex.org/W2796397697,"Lipid composition in the reproductive and somatic tissues were investigated for female albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga, in the western Indian Ocean, between latitude 18-21°S and longitude 56-60°E, from January 2014 to March 2015. Highest total lipids (TL) were found in the gonads of spawning-capable females (SCP) (mainly phospholipids, PL, triacylglycerols, TAG and wax esters, WE) and in the liver of females in the late regressing and regenerating ovary phases (mainly TAG, PL and sterols, ST). Muscle TL was low but exhibited high inter-individual variability. Correlations between gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices with TL and the lipid classes in albacore gonads and liver describes a pattern of reallocation of energy from the liver to the gonads during SCP. Female albacore were also observed to pursue foraging activities even during this period. Therefore, female albacore can be considered as a capital-income breeder relying mostly on stored lipids before the onset of reproduction and to a lesser extent on energy derived from concurrent feeding during the spawning season. Overall, the three examined tissues had similar general fatty acid profiles with the dominance of 22:6ω3 (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA), 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1ω9. The proportions of fatty acids varied with maturity stage and ovary lobe, with the smaller lobe having significantly higher proportions of essential fatty acids, as well as 16:0 and 18:1n9, compared to the larger one. Our results provide new information on the life-history and energy allocation strategy of albacore which will assist fisheries managers."
https://openalex.org/W2796346814,"Background Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment. Results Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p<0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%). Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex and service type, but was associated with age. Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value<0.05). Conclusion A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care. Almost a quarter of clients diagnosed with TB did not link to treatment. Integrated community-based HIV and TB testing services are efficient in diagnosing HIV and TB, but strategies to improve linkage to care are required to control these epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2796360169,"Complex II (SdhABCD) is a membrane-bound component of mitochondrial and bacterial electron transport chains, as well as of the TCA cycle. In this capacity, it catalyzes the reversible oxidation of succinate. SdhABCD contains the SDHA protein harboring a covalently bound FAD redox center and the iron-sulfur protein SDHB, containing three distinct iron-sulfur centers. When assembly of this complex is compromised, the flavoprotein SDHA may accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix or bacterial cytoplasm. Whether the unassembled SDHA has any catalytic activity, for example in succinate oxidation, fumarate reduction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, or other off-pathway reactions, is not known. Therefore, here we investigated whether unassembled Escherichia coli SdhA flavoprotein, its homolog fumarate reductase (FrdA), and the human SDHA protein have succinate oxidase or fumarate reductase activity and can produce ROS. Using recombinant expression in E. coli, we found that the free flavoproteins from these divergent biological sources have inherently low catalytic activity and generate little ROS. These results suggest that the iron-sulfur protein SDHB in complex II is necessary for robust catalytic activity. Our findings are consistent with those reported for single-subunit flavoprotein homologs that are not associated with iron-sulfur or heme partner proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2796268034,"Chemotherapy-induced hemorrhagic cystitis (CHC) can be difficult to manage. Prior work suggests that IL-4 alleviates ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis (IHC), but systemically administered IL-4 causes significant side effects. We hypothesized that the Schistosoma hematobium homolog of IL-4-inducing principle from Schistosoma mansoni eggs (H-IPSE), would reduce IHC and associated bladder pathology. IPSE binds IgE on basophils and mast cells, triggering IL-4 secretion by these cells. IPSE is also an ""infiltrin,"" translocating into the host nucleus to modulate gene transcription. Mice were administered IL-4, H-IPSE protein or its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) mutant, with or without neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibody, or 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (MESNA; a drug used to prevent IHC), followed by ifosfamide. Bladder tissue damage and hemoglobin content were measured. Spontaneous and evoked pain, urinary frequency, and bladdergene expression analysis were assessed. Pain behaviors were interpreted in a blinded fashion. One dose of H-IPSE was superior to MESNA and IL-4 in suppressing bladder hemorrhage in an IL-4-dependent fashion and comparable with MESNA in dampening ifosfamide-triggered pain behaviors in an NLS-dependent manner. H-IPSE also accelerated urothelial repair following IHC. Our work represents the first therapeutic exploitation of a uropathogen-derived host modulatory molecule in a clinically relevant bladder disease model and indicates that IPSE may be an alternative to MESNA for mitigating CHC.-Mbanefo, E.

https://openalex.org/W2795517808,"The RET tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is involved in the development of endocrine resistant ER+ breast cancer. However, we know little about how ER+ cells activate RET signaling and initiate an endocrine resistant phenotype. Here we show that both ER+ endocrine resistant and sensitive breast cancers have a functional RET tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, but that endocrine sensitive breast cancer cells lack RET ligands that are necessary to drive endocrine resistance. Transcription of one RET ligand, GDNF, is necessary and sufficient to confer resistance in the ER+ MCF-7 cell line. Endogenous GDNF produced by endocrine resistant cells is translated, secreted into the media, and activates RET signaling in nearby cells. In patients, RET ligand expression predicts responsiveness to endocrine therapies and correlates with survival. Collectively, our findings show that ER+ tumor cells are ""poised"" for RET mediated endocrine resistance, expressing all components of the RET signaling pathway, but endocrine sensitive cells lack high expression of RET ligands that are necessary to initiate the resistance phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2795755088,"G protein–coupled receptors that signal through Gαq (Gq receptors), such as α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-ARs) or angiotensin receptors, share a common proximal signaling pathway that activates phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. Despite these common proximal signaling mechanisms, Gq receptors produce distinct physiological responses, yet the mechanistic basis for this remains unclear. In the heart, Gq receptors are thought to induce myocyte hypertrophy through a mechanism termed excitation–transcription coupling, which provides a mechanistic basis for compartmentalization of calcium required for contraction versus IP3-dependent intranuclear calcium required for hypertrophy. Here, we identified subcellular compartmentalization of Gq-receptor signaling as a mechanistic basis for unique Gq receptor–induced hypertrophic phenotypes in cardiac myocytes. We show that α1-ARs co-localize with PLCβ1 and PIP2 at the nuclear membrane. Further, nuclear α1-ARs induced intranuclear PLCβ1 activity, leading to histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) export and a robust transcriptional response (i.e. significant up- or down-regulation of 806 genes). Conversely, we found that angiotensin receptors localize to the sarcolemma and induce sarcolemmal PLCβ1 activity, but fail to promote HDAC5 nuclear export, while producing a transcriptional response that is mostly a subset of α1-AR–induced transcription. In summary, these results link Gq-receptor compartmentalization in cardiac myocytes to unique hypertrophic transcription. They suggest a new model of excitation–transcription coupling in adult cardiac myocytes that accounts for differential Gq-receptor localization and better explains distinct physiological functions of Gq receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2796142446,"The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a versatile transcriptional regulator required for embryogenesis, but its function in vascular development or in diseases with a vascular component is poorly understood. Here, we found that endothelial Ctcf is essential for mouse vascular development and limits accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conditional knockout of Ctcf in endothelial progenitors and their descendants affected embryonic growth, and caused lethality at embryonic day 10.5 because of defective yolk sac and placental vascular development. Analysis of global gene expression revealed Frataxin (Fxn), the gene mutated in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), as the most strongly down-regulated gene in Ctcf-deficient placental endothelial cells. Moreover, in vitro reporter assays showed that Ctcf activates the Fxn promoter in endothelial cells. ROS are known to accumulate in the endothelium of FRDA patients. Importantly, Ctcf deficiency induced ROS-mediated DNA damage in endothelial cells in vitro, and in placental endothelium in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicate that Ctcf promotes vascular development and limits oxidative stress in endothelial cells. These results reveal a function for Ctcf in vascular development, and suggest a potential mechanism for endothelial dysfunction in FRDA."
https://openalex.org/W2796402490,"The importance of meniscus preservation is widely recognized. There have been a few studies describing trends in meniscectomy and meniscus repair in the United States; however, they presented differing results. We reported annual trends in meniscus surgery, using a national database in Japan.We interrogated the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, which represents approximately half of all hospital admissions in Japan. We included the patients who underwent meniscectomy and meniscus repair between July 2007 and March 2015. The diagnosis, age and sex of each patient were recorded.We identified 83,105 patients: 69,310 underwent meniscectomy; 13,416 underwent meniscus repair and 379 underwent both in a single admission. The proportion of patients undergoing meniscus repair rose from 7.0% in 2007 to 25.9% in 2014 (p < 0.001), while the proportion undergoing meniscectomy fell from 92.8% in 2007 to 73.3% in 2014 (p < 0.001). Among patients under 30 years old, the proportions undergoing meniscus repair or meniscectomy in 2014 were 50.3% versus 48.3%, respectively. A bimodal age distribution was observed for meniscectomy, with peaks at 10-19 years of age and 60-69 years of age, whereas most patients undergoing meniscus repair were 10-19 years of age.We found characteristic trends where the popularity of meniscus repair increased rapidly at the expense of meniscectomy in Japan during the study period. In the last survey year, the proportion of meniscus repair exceeded that of meniscectomy in those younger than 30 years. Meniscectomy was undertaken most often in adolescents and early old age, while meniscus repair was undertaken most often in adolescents."

The MinCDE proteins help localize the Z ring to the center of the Escherichia coli cell. MinC, which inhibits Z-ring assembly, is a passenger on MinD. Previous studies have shown that MinC–MinD from E. coli and Aquifex aeolicus assemble in vitro into extended filaments with a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, a recent study has raised questions about the function of the MinC–MinD copolymer in vivo, because its assembly appears to require a high concentration of these two proteins and has a long lag time, and its blockade does not affect in vivo activities. Here, we found that MinC and MinD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa coassemble into filaments with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We also found that the minimal concentration of ∼4 μm required for assembly applies only to MinD because above 4 μm MinD, even very low MinC concentrations sustained coassembly. As previously reported, the MinC–MinD coassembly exhibited a long lag of ∼100 s when initiated by ATP. Premixing MinD with ATP eliminated this lag, suggesting that it may be due to slow MinD dimerization following ATP activation. We also discovered that MinC–MinD copolymers quickly bound FtsZ filaments and formed huge bundles. Our results resolve previous questions about the low concentration of MinC and the lag time, insights that may inform future investigations into the exact role of the MinC–MinD copolymer in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2796464785,"India, like many developing countries, only recently began to grant pharmaceutical product patents. Indian patent law includes a provision, Section 3(d), which tries to limit grant of ""secondary"" pharmaceutical patents, i.e. patents on new forms of existing molecules and drugs. Previous research suggests the provision was rarely used against secondary applications in the years immediately following its enactment, and where it was, was redundant to other aspects of the patent law, raising concerns that 3(d) was being under-utilized by the Indian Patent Office. This paper uses a novel data source, the patent office's first examination reports, to examine changes in the use of the provision. We find a sharp increase over time in the use of Section 3(d), including on the main claims of patent applications, though it continues to be used in conjunction with other types of objections to patentability. More surprisingly, see a sharp increase in the use of the provision against primary patent applications, contrary to its intent, raising concerns about potential over-utilization."

The security level of the encrypted image boosts using the algebra of Galois field in Fresnelet domain. At first level, the Fresnelet transform is used to propagate the given information with desired wavelength at specified distance. It decomposes given secret data into four complex subbands. These complex sub-bands are separated into two components of real subband data and imaginary subband data. At second level, the net subband data, produced at the first level, is deteriorated to non-linear diffused pattern using the unique S-box defined on the Galois field [Formula: see text]. In the diffusion process, the permuted image is substituted via dynamic algebraic S-box substitution. We prove through various analysis techniques that the proposed scheme enhances the cipher security level, extensively."
https://openalex.org/W2795700958,"A large number of programs have been implemented in many countries to increase the healthcare workforce recruitment in rural and remote areas. Rural early exposure programs for medical students have been shown to be effective strategies. However, no related studies have been reported before in China. This study was carried out to determine the association between medical students' participation in rural clinical clerkships and their intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation from western medical schools in China.Based on a two-stage random sampling method, the cross-sectional survey was carried out in ten western provinces in China. A brief questionnaire filled in by medical students was used for data collection. A total of 4278 medical students participated in the study. The response rate was approximately 90.34%. Pearson's chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analyses were performed for data analyses.Approximately 52.0% of medical students disclosed intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation. Only one in five participants had experience with a rural clinical clerkship. Rural clinical clerkships were significantly associated with medical students' intentions to work in rural medical institutions (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.05-1.46); further analyses indicated that such clerkships only had a significant impact among the medical students with an urban background (OR: 2.10, 95%CI: 1.48-2.97). In terms of the sociodemographic characteristics, younger age, low level of parental education, majoring in general practice, and studying in low-level medical schools increased the odds of having intentions to engage in rural medical work among medical students; however, rural origins was the only positive univariate predictor. In addition, the predictors of intentions to choose rural medical work were different between medical students with a rural background and those with an urban background.Rural clinical clerkship is likely to increase the odds of having intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation among medical students in western China, especially for those with an urban background. Related policy makers could consider developing compulsory rural clerkship programs and implement them among medical students to increase early rural exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2796311686,"Purpose Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Methods In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection). Results In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)]. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test II was associated with more concurrent relationships and transactional sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.6 (1.1, 2.5) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.4), respectively], and testing in the lowest four quintiles of Test III was associated with more concurrent relationships [aPR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.0, 2.7)]. Conclusions These results demonstrate an association between low executive function and sexual risk in South African young women. Future work should seek to understand the nature of this association and whether there is promise in developing interventions to enhance executive function to reduce sexual risk."
https://openalex.org/W2795855556,"Experiencing a syntactic structure affects how we process subsequent instances of that structure. This phenomenon, called structural priming, is observed both in language production and in language comprehension. However, while abstract syntactic structures can be primed independent of lexical overlap in sentence production, evidence for structural priming in comprehension is more elusive. In addition, when structural priming in comprehension is found, it can often be accounted for in terms of participants' explicit expectations. Participants may use the structural repetition over several sentences and build expectations, which create a priming effect. Here, we use a new experimental paradigm to investigate structural priming in sentence comprehension independent of lexical overlap and of participants' expectations. We use an outcome dependent variable instead of commonly used online measures, which allows us to more directly compare these effects with those found in sentence production studies. We test priming effects in syntactically homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions on a sentence-picture matching task that forces participants to fully parse the sentences. We observe that, while participants learn the structural regularity in the homogeneous condition, structural priming is also found in the heterogeneous condition, in which participants do not expect any particular structure. In fact, we find that a single prime is enough to trigger priming. Our results indicate that-like in sentence production-structural priming can be observed in sentence comprehension without lexical repetition and independent of participants' expectation."

In addition, most of the studies exploring STI rates among the military focus on US service members. This paper assesses the prevalence and correlates of STIs in the French military using biomarkers and compares self-reported versus diagnosed STIs.Data are drawn from the COSEMIL study, a national sexual health survey conducted in the French military in 2014 and 2015. A random sample of 784 men and 141 women aged 18-57 years completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided biological samples for STI testing. We used logistic regression modeling to identify the correlates of STI diagnosis and self-reports.The prevalence of diagnosed STIs was 4.7% [3.8-5.9], mostly due to Chlamydia trachomatis. This rate was four times higher than the 12 months self-reported rate of 1.1% [0.6-2.3]. Reported STI rates were similar among men and women (1.1% versus 1.8%), but diagnosed STI rates were twice as high among females versus males (10.4% versus 4.1%, p = 0.007). There were significant differences in the determinants of reported versus diagnosed STIs. In particular, age and sexual orientation were associated with reported STIs, but not with diagnosed STIs. Conversely, STI counseling and depression were associated with STI diagnosis but not with STI reports.This study underlines the need to use biomarkers in population-based surveys, given the differential and substantial underreporting of STIs. Results also highlight the need for programmatic adaptation to address gender inequalities in STI rates, by developing women's health services in the French military. Addressing such needs not only benefits women but could also serve as a strategy to reduce overall STI rates as most military women have military partners, increasing the risk of internal transmission."

However, the pathways leading to the activation of defense reactions related to abiotic or biotic stress as a function of RES formation, accumulation or treatment are poorly understood in plants. Here, the thiol-modification of proteins, including the RES-activated basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor TGA2, was studied. TGA2 contains a single cysteine residue (Cys186) that was covalently modified by reactive cyclopentenones but not required for induction of detoxification genes in response to OPDA or prostaglandin A1. Activation of the glutathione-S-transferase 6 (GST6) promoter was responsive to cyclopentenones but not to unreactive cyclopentanones, including jasmonic acid suggesting that thiol reactivity of RES is important to activate the TGA2-dependent signaling pathway resulting in GST6 activation We show that RES modify thiols in numerous proteins in vivo, however, thiol reactivity alone appears not to be sufficient for biological activity as demonstrated by the failure of several membrane permeable thiol reactive reagents to activate the GST6 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W4234859739,"Aquaculture is increasing rapidly to meet global seafood demand. Some hydroid populations have been linked to mortality and health issues in finfish and shellfish, but their dynamics in and around aquaculture farms remain understudied. In the present work, two experiments, each with 36 panels, tested colonization (factors: depth, season of immersion) and succession (factors: depth, submersion duration) over one year. Hydroid surface cover was estimated for each species, and data were analyzed with multivariate techniques. The assemblage of hydrozoans was species-poor, although species richness, frequency and abundance increased with time, paralleling the overall increase in structural complexity of fouling assemblages. Submersion duration and season of immersion were particularly important in determining the species composition of the assemblages in the succession and colonization experiments, respectively. Production of water-borne propagules, including medusae, from the hydroids was observed from locally abundant colonies, among them the well-known fouling species Obelia dichotoma, potentially representing a nuisance for cultured fish through contact-driven envenomations and gill disorders. The results illustrate the potential importance of fouling hydroids and their medusae to the health of organisms in the aquaculture industry."

https://openalex.org/W2796383084,"Oxytocin is a neurohypophysial peptide linked to a wide range of biological functions, including milk ejection, temperament and reproduction. Aims of the present study were a) the characterization of the OXT (Oxytocin-neurophysin I) gene and its regulatory regions in Old and New world camelids; b) the investigation of the genetic diversity and the discovery of markers potentially affecting the gene regulation. On average, the gene extends over 814 bp, ranging between 825 bp in dromedary, 811 bp in Bactrian and 810 bp in llama and alpaca. Such difference in size is due to a duplication event of 21 bp in dromedary. The main regulatory elements, including the composite hormone response elements (CHREs), were identified in the promoter, whereas the presence of mature microRNAs binding sequences in the 3’UTR improves the knowledge on the factors putatively involved in the OXT gene regulation, although their specific biological effect needs to be still elucidated. The sequencing of genomic DNA allowed the identification of 17 intraspecific polymorphisms and 69 nucleotide differences among the four species. One of these (MF464535:g.622C>G) is responsible, in alpaca, for the loss of a consensus sequence for the transcription factor SP1. Furthermore, the same SNP falls within a CpG island and it creates a new methylation site, thus opening future possibilities of investigation to verify the influence of the novel allelic variant in the OXT gene regulation. A PCR-RFLP method was setup for the genotyping and the frequency of the allele C was 0.93 in a population of 71 alpacas. The obtained data clarify the structure of OXT gene in domestic camelids and add knowledge to the genetic variability of a genomic region, which has received little investigation so far. These findings open the opportunity for new investigations, including association studies with productive and reproductive traits."

A risk factor/exposure survey was administered to individuals with high levels of exposure to wildlife. Serological testing was performed to evaluate prior infection with several wildlife viral pathogens. Follow up serology was performed on a subset of the cohort as well as close contacts of individuals. 1,312 individuals were enrolled in the study. Contact with a wide range of wildlife species was reported in both occupational and occasional contexts. The overall proportion of individuals seropositive to any of the tested wildlife pathogens was approximately 4.0%. However, persons employed as butchers demonstrated a seropositivity of 9.0% to at least one pathogen of interest. By contrast, individuals working as hunters had lower rates of seropositivity. Among the study population, a number of other behaviors showed correlation with seropositivity, including contact with particular wildlife species such as field rats. These results demonstrate the need to further explore zoonotic risks of particular activities regarding wildlife contact, and to better understand risks of persons working as butchers with wildlife species."

We used ectopic tethering of CHROMATOR (CHRIZ/CHRO) and dCTCF to pre-defined regions of the genome to dissect the influence of these proteins on local chromatin organization, to analyze their interaction with other key chromatin proteins and to evaluate the effects on transcription and replication. Specifically, using UAS-GAL4DBD system, CHRO and dCTCF were artificially recruited into highly compacted polytene chromosome bands that share the features of silent chromatin type known as intercalary heterochromatin (IH). This led to local chromatin decondensation, formation of novel DHSes and recruitment of several “open chromatin” proteins. CHRO tethering resulted in the recruitment of CP190 and Z4 (PZG), whereas dCTCF tethering attracted CHRO, CP190, and Z4. Importantly, formation of a local stretch of open chromatin did not result in the reactivation of silent marker genes yellow and mini-white immediately adjacent to the targeting region (UAS), nor did RNA polII become recruited into this chromatin. The decompacted region retained late replicated, similarly to the wild-type untargeted region."

The contact time between TM-composite and S. mutans down-regulated the gbpB and covR and up-regulated the gtfC gene expression, reduced cell viability and significantly decreased parameters of the structure and characteristics of S. mutans biofilm virulence. The presence of Triclosan Methacrylate monomer causes harmful effects at molecular and cellular levels in S. mutans, implying a reduction in the virulence of those microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2796415911,"Background Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care. Results Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, p<0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, p<0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26). Conclusions In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2795973812,"Host genetic architecture is a major factor in resistance to pathogens and parasites. The collection and analysis of sufficient data on both disease resistance and host genetics has, however, been a major obstacle to dissection the genetics of resistance to single or multiple pathogens. A severe challenge in the estimation of heritabilities and genetic correlations from pedigree-based studies has been the confounding effects of the common environment shared among relatives which are difficult to model in pedigree analyses, especially for health traits with low incidence rates. To circumvent this problem we used genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data and implemented the Genomic-Restricted Maximum Likelihood (G-REML) method to estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations for resistance to 23 different infectious pathogens in calves and cows in populations undergoing natural pathogen challenge. Furthermore, we conducted gene-based analysis and generalized gene-set analysis to understand the biological background of resistance to infectious diseases. The results showed relatively higher heritabilities of resistance in calves than in cows and significant pleiotropy (both positive and negative) among some calf and cow resistance traits. We also found significant pleiotropy between resistance and performance in both calves and cows. Finally, we confirmed the role of the B-lymphocyte pathway as one of the most important biological pathways associated with resistance to all pathogens. These results both illustrate the potential power of these approaches to illuminate the genetics of pathogen resistance in cattle and provide foundational information for future genomic selection aimed at improving the overall production fitness of cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2795808197,"Genetic switches frequently include DNA loops secured by proteins. Recent studies of the lambda bacteriophage repressor (CI), showed that this arrangement in which the protein links two sets of three operators separated by approximately 2.3 kbp, optimizes both the stability and dynamics of DNA loops, compared to an arrangement with just two sets of two operators. Because adjacent dimers interact pairwise, we hypothesized that the odd number of operators in each set of the lambda regulatory system might have evolved to allow for semi-specific, pair-wise interactions that add stability to the loop while maintaining it dynamic. More generally, additional CI dimers may bind non-specifically to flanking DNA sequences making the genetic switch more sensitive to CI concentration. Here, we tested this hypothesis using spectroscopic and imaging approaches to study the binding of the lambda repressor (CI) dimer protein to DNA fragments. For fragments with only one operator and a short flanking sequence, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements clearly indicated the presence of two distinct DNA-CI complexes; one is thought to have a non-specifically bound CI dimer on the flanking sequence. Scanning force micrographs of CI bound to DNA with all six operators revealed wild-type or mutant proteins bound at operator positions. The number of bound, wild-type proteins increased with CI concentration and was larger than expected for strictly specific binding to operators. In contrast, a mutant that fails to oligomerize beyond a dimer, D197G, only bound to operators. These data are evidence that CI cooperativity promotes oligomerization that extends from operator sites to influence the thermodynamics and kinetics of CI-mediated looping."
https://openalex.org/W2796045623,"Discovering regulatory interactions between genes that specify the behavioral properties of cells remains an important challenge. We used the dynamics of transcriptional changes resolved by PRO-seq to identify a regulatory network responsible for endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We show that GDNF leads to endocrine resistance by switching the active state in a bi-stable feedback loop between GDNF, EGR1, and the master transcription factor ERα. GDNF stimulates MAP kinase, activating the transcription factors SRF and AP-1. SRF initiates an immediate transcriptional response, activating EGR1 and suppressing ERα. Newly translated EGR1 protein activates endogenous GDNF, leading to constitutive GDNF and EGR1 up-regulation, and the sustained down-regulation of ERα. Endocrine resistant MCF-7 cells are constitutively in the GDNF-high/ ERα-low state, suggesting that the state in the bi-stable feedback loop may provide a 'memory' of endocrine resistance. Thus, we identified a regulatory network switch that contributes to drug resistance in breast cancer."

A novel approach to increase diagnostic accuracy in medical decision making is collective intelligence, which refers to the ability of groups to outperform individual decision makers in solving problems. We investigated whether combining the independent ratings of chiropractors, chiropractic radiologists and medical radiologists can improve diagnostic accuracy when interpreting diagnostic images of the lumbosacral spine. Evaluations were obtained from two previously published studies: study 1 consisted of 13 raters independently rating 300 lumbosacral radiographs; study 2 consisted of 14 raters independently rating 100 lumbosacral magnetic resonance images. In both studies, raters evaluated the presence of ""abnormalities"", which are indicators of a serious health risk and warrant immediate further examination. We combined independent decisions of raters using a majority rule which takes as final diagnosis the decision of the majority of the group. We compared the performance of the majority rule to the performance of single raters. Our results show that with increasing group size (i.e., increasing the number of independent decisions) both sensitivity and specificity increased in both data-sets, with groups consistently outperforming single raters. These results were found for radiographs and MR image reading alike. Our findings suggest that combining independent ratings can improve the accuracy of lumbosacral diagnostic image reading."

Here, to study in detail the full-length PgdS structure, we analyze the low-resolution architecture of PgdS hydrolase from Bacillus subtilis in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method. Combining with other methods, like dynamic light scattering and mutagenesis analyses, a model for the full length structure and the possible substrate delivery route of PgdS are proposed. The results will provide useful hints for future investigations into the mechanisms of γ-PGA degradation by the PgdS hydrolase and may provide valuable practical information."
