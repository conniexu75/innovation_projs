https://openalex.org/W2033399365,"A widely held view in solid-state physics is that disorder precludes the presence of long-range transport in one dimension. A series of models has been recently proposed that do not conform to this view. The primary model is the random dimer model, in which the site energies for pairs of lattice sites along a linear chain are assigned one of two values at random. This model has a set of conducting states that ultimately allow an initially localized particle to move through the lattice almost ballistically. This model is applicable to the insulator-metal transition in a wide class of conducting polymers, such as polyaniline and heavily doped polyacetylene. Calculations performed on polyaniline demonstrate explicitly that the conducting states of the random dimer model for polyaniline are coincident with recent calculations of the location of the Fermi level in the metallic regime. A random dimer analysis on polyparaphenylene also indicates the presence of a set of conducting states in the vicinity of the band edge. The implications of this model for the metallic state in other polymers, including heavily doped polyacetylene, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2067469107,"The superconducting compound K(3)C(60) (with transition temperature T(c) = 19.3 kelvin at ambient pressure), formed as a single phase by reaction of alkali vapor with solids of the icosahedral C(60) molecule (buckminsterfullerene), shows a very large decrease of T(c) with increasing pressure. Susceptibility measurements on sintered pellets showing bulk superconductivity are reported up to 21 kilobars of pressure, where T(c) is already less than 8 kelvin. The results are consistent with a piling up of the density of states at the Fermi level."
https://openalex.org/W1967665130,"Of the 26 well-preserved orders of benthic marine invertebrates that have originated since the beginning of the Mesozoic, 20 first appear in onshore environments. This distribution differs significantly from that shown by well-preserved genera and families, and by the 16 poorly preserved orders. These discordances suggest that the pattern of preferential onshore origination is not an artifact of preservation or collection and that the origin of higher taxa cannot be regarded as a simple extrapolation of rates and patterns at lower levels. The onshore environment fosters production or enhances survivorship of species that initiate lineages tending to accumulate suites of derived characters and that thus are ultimately afforded high taxonomic rank."
https://openalex.org/W2033917509,"A spectacular sequence of coral-reef terraces (six steps broader than 500 meters and many minor substeps) is developed near Cape Laundi, Sumba Island, between an ancient patch reef 475 meters high and sea level. Several raised reefs have been dated with the electron spin resonance and the uranium-series dating methods. The uplift trend deduced from these reefs is 0.5 millimeter per year; most terraces, although polycyclic in origin, appear to correspond to specific interglacial stages, with the oldest terrace formed 1 million years ago. This puts them among the longest and most complete mid-Quaternary terrace sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2085875759,"Solid-state phase transitions in time-dependent mantle convection can induce diapiric flows in the upper mantle. When a deep mantle plume rises toward phase boundaries in the upper mantle, the changes in the local thermal buoyancy, local heat capacity, and latent heat associated with the phase change at a depth of 670 kilometers tend to pinch off the plume head from the feeding stem and form a diapir. This mechanism may explain episodic hot spot volcanism. The nature of the multiple phase boundaries at the boundary between the upper and lower mantle may control the fate of deep mantle plumes, allowing hot plumes to go through and retarding the tepid ones."
