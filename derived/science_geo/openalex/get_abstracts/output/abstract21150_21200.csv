https://openalex.org/W2089887078,"A major action of the microbicidal system of human neutrophils is the formation of superoxide anion (O2-) by a multicomponent oxidase that transfers electrons from the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to molecular oxygen. The mechanism of assembly and activation of the oxidase from its cytosolic and membrane-bound components is unknown, but may require the activity of a guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP)-binding component. A cytosolic GTP-binding protein (Gox) that regulates the NADPH oxidase of neutrophils was identified. Gox was purified and shown to augment the rate of O2- production in a cell-free oxidase activation system. Sequence analysis of peptide fragments from Gox identified it as Rac 2, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins. Antibody to a peptide derived from the COOH-terminus of Rac 2 inhibited O2- generation in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that Rac 2 is a regulatory component of the human neutrophil NADPH oxidase, and provide new insights into the mechanism by which this oxygen radical-generating system is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2099763381,"The functions of the 11 classes of exposed chemosensory neurons of C. elegans were tested by killing cells with a laser microbeam. One pair of neurons, the ASE neurons, is uniquely important for chemotaxis: killing the ASE neurons greatly reduced chemotaxis to cAMP, biotin, Cl-, and Na+. Additional chemosensory function is distributed among several other cell types. Thus, 3 pairs of chemosensory neurons (ADF, ASG, and ASI) contribute to a residual response to cAMP, biotin, Cl-, and Na+ after ASE is killed. Chemotaxis to lysine similarly depends on the partly redundant functions of 4 pairs of chemosensory neurons (ASE, ASG, ASI, and ASK). The combined activity of several neuron types that act in parallel might increase the fidelity of chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1966819735,"A calcitonin receptor complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned by expression of a cDNA library from a porcine kidney epithelial cell line in COS cells. The 482-amino acid receptor has high affinity for salmon calcitonin (dissociation constant Kd ≈ 6 nM) and is functionally coupled to increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The receptor shows no sequence similarity to other reported G protein-coupled receptors but is homologous to the parathyroid hormone-parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-PTHrP) receptor, indicating that the receptors for these hormones, which regulate calcium homeostasis, represent a new family of G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1574660002,"Abstract The relationship between muscarinic receptor activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the sequestration of cell surface muscarinic receptors has been examined for both intact and digitonin-permeabilized human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Addition of the aminosteroid 1-[6-[[17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino] hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122) to intact cells resulted in the inhibition of oxotremorine-M-stimulated inositol phosphate release and of Ca2+ signaling by greater than 75%. In contrast, when phospholipase C was directly activated by the addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin, inclusion of U-73122 had little inhibitory effect. Addition of U-73122 to intact cells also inhibited the agonist-induced sequestration of cell surface muscarinic receptors and their subsequent down-regulation with an IC50 value (4.1 microM) similar to that observed for inhibition of inositol phosphate release (3.7 microM). In contrast, when oxotremorine-M-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was inhibited by depletion of extracellular Ca2+, no reduction in the extent of receptor sequestration was observed. When introduced into digitonin-permeabilized cells, U-73122 more markedly inhibited inositol phosphate release elicited by either oxotremorine-M or guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) than that induced by added Ca2+. Addition of oxotremorine-M to permeabilized cells resulted in muscarinic receptor sequestration and down-regulation. Both the loss of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in permeabilized cells were inhibited by the inclusion of guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). The results indicate that the agonist-induced sequestration of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in SK-N-SH cells requires the involvement of a GTP-binding protein but not the production of phosphoinositide-derived second messenger molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2082928276,"The three-dimensional structure of an active, disulfide cross-linked dimer of the ligand-binding domain of the Salmonella typhimurium aspartate receptor and that of an aspartate complex have been determined by x-ray crystallographic methods at 2.4 and 2.0 angstrom (A) resolution, respectively. A single subunit is a four-alpha-helix bundle with two long amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal helices and two shorter helices that form a cylinder 20 A in diameter and more than 70 A long. The two subunits in the disulfide-bonded dimer are related by a crystallographic twofold axis in the apo structure, but by a noncrystallographic twofold axis in the aspartate complex structure. The latter structure reveals that the ligand binding site is located more than 60 A from the presumed membrane surface and is at the interface of the two subunits. Aspartate binds between two alpha helices from one subunit and one alpha helix from the other in a highly charged pocket formed by three arginines. The comparison of the apo and aspartate complex structures shows only small structural changes in the individual subunits, except for one loop region that is disordered, but the subunits appear to change orientation relative to each other. The structures of the two forms of this protein provide a step toward understanding the mechanisms of transmembrane signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1988256009,"Humoral immunity is important for protection against viral infection and neutralization of extracellular virus, but clearance of virus from infected tissues is thought to be mediated solely by cellular immunity. However, in a SCID mouse model of persistent alphavirus encephalomyelitis, adoptive transfer of hyperimmune serum resulted in clearance of infectious virus and viral RNA from the nervous system, whereas adoptive transfer of sensitized T lymphocytes had no effect on viral replication. Three monoclonal antibodies to two different epitopes on the E2 envelope glycoprotein mediated viral clearance. Treatment of alphavirus-infected primary cultured rat neurons with these monoclonal antibodies to E2 resulted in decreased viral protein synthesis, followed by gradual termination of mature infectious virion production. Thus, antibody can mediate clearance of alphavirus infection from neurons by restricting viral gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2012008365,"Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for generation of action potentials in excitable cells. Activation of protein kinase C slows inactivation of sodium channels and reduces peak sodium currents. Phosphorylation of a single residue, serine 1506, that is located in the conserved intracellular loop between domains III and IV and is involved in inactivation of the sodium channel, is required for both modulatory effects. Mutant sodium channels lacking this phosphorylation site have normal functional properties in unstimulated cells but do not respond to activation of protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of this conserved site in sodium channel alpha subunits may regulate electrical activity in a wide range of excitable cells."

https://openalex.org/W1546402627,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a most potent growth factor for mature hepatocytes may act as a trigger for liver regeneration. We reported that HGF strongly stimulates DNA synthesis of rabbit renal tubular cells in secondary culture (Igawa, T., Kanda, S., Kanetake, H., Saitoh, Y., Ichihara, A., Tomita, Y., and Nakamura, T. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 174, 831-838). To investigate whether or not HGF is involved in renal regeneration, we examined changes in HGF mRNA, HGF activity, and HGF receptor in the rat kidney following unilateral nephrectomy or treatment with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). In the intact kidney, the HGF mRNA increased markedly reaching a maximum 6 h after unilateral nephrectomy, followed by an increase of HGF activity at 12 h after the surgery. The marked increase in HGF mRNA and HGF activity was also found in the kidney of rats treated with CCl4. Results of in situ hybridization suggested that cells producing HGF in the kidney are endothelial cells. The number of HGF receptors on renal plasma membranes decreased to 30% of the normal value 12 h after unilateral nephrectomy, with no change in the Kd value. The HGF receptor was greatly diminished 24 h after the operation, and recovery to 60% of the normal level was evident 1 week after the operation. Because the decrease in HGF binding may result from internalization of the HGF receptor, the HGF may bind to its receptor in vivo and act as a mitogen for renal epithelial cells. HGF may function as a renotropic factor during renal regeneration after kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W2014334386,"Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) serves as the binding site for the neurotrophic growth factors. Although NGFR has been found in several embryonic tissues outside the nervous system, the function of NGFR in embryogenesis of non-neuronal organs remains unknown. NGFR is transiently synthesized by embryonic rat kidney and disappears from nephrons upon their terminal differentiation. Anti-sense oligonucleotide inhibition of NGFR expression inhibits kidney morphogenesis. Therefore, NGFR is required not only for development of the nervous system, but also for differentiation of the kidney tubules."
https://openalex.org/W2049679897,"Type I diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. A virus that was identified serologically as Kilham's rat virus (KRV) was isolated from a spontaneously diabetic rat and reproducibly induced diabetes in naive diabetes-resistant (DR) BB/Wor rats. Viral antigen was not identified in pancreatic islet cells, and beta cell cytolysis was not observed until after the appearance of lymphocytic insulitis. KRV did not induce diabetes in major histocompatibility complex-concordant and discordant non-BB rats and did not accelerate diabetes in diabetes-prone BB/Wor rats unless the rats had been reconstituted with DR spleen cells. This model of diabetes may provide insight regarding the interaction of viruses and autoimmune disease [corrected]"
https://openalex.org/W1974794546,"Macroscopic current from the microI skeletal muscle sodium channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes shows inactivation with two exponential components. The major, slower component's amplitude decreases with rapid pulsing. When microI cRNA is coinjected with rat skeletal muscle or brain mRNA the faster component becomes predominant. Individual microI channels switch between two principal gating modes, opening either only once per depolarization, or repeatedly in long bursts. These two modes differ in both activation and inactivation kinetics. There is also evidence for additional gating modes. It appears that the equilibrium among gating modes is influenced by a modulating factor encoded in rat skeletal muscle and brain mRNA. The modal gating is similar to that observed in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis."
https://openalex.org/W2076041927,"The development and stability of synaptic connections in the nervous system are influenced by the pattern of electrical activity and the competitive interaction between the adjacent nerve terminals. To investigate this influence, a culture system of nerve and muscle cells has been developed in which a single embryonic muscle cell is coinnervated by two spinal neurons. The effect of electrical activity on the synaptic efficacy was examined after repetitive electrical stimulation was applied to one or both neurons. Brief tetanic stimulation of one neuron resulted in immediate functional suppression of the synapse made by the unstimulated neuron innervating the same muscle cell. This heterosynaptic suppression was largely absent when the tetanic stimulation was applied concurrently to both neurons. This result demonstrates that activity-dependent synaptic competition can be studied in vitro at a cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W1595260818,"The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the steroid receptor gene family. In this report, we examine the nature of specific VDR DNA binding utilizing the vitamin D-responsive element derived from the human osteocalcin promoter. Association of the VDR with the human osteocalcin 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) responsive element (VDRE) in vitro was characterized on VDRE affinity columns by both weak and strong interactions. Weak interaction was a property of the VDR itself, monomeric in nature, and determined exclusively by the VDR's DNA-binding domain. Strong interaction, in contrast, was dependent upon an intact receptor molecule as well as a heterologous mammalian cell nuclear accessory factor (NAF). Heteromeric interaction between VDR and NAF was independent of the VDR DNA-binding domain, suggesting the presence of a functional dimerization domain separate from that for DNA binding. Direct association of NAF with immobilized VDR revealed that the interaction does not require the presence of DNA. Most importantly, while occupancy of the VDR by 1,25(OH)2D3 was not required for VDR interactions with either DNA or NAF, the presence of hormone increased the apparent relative affinity of the VDR for NAF approximately 10-fold. These studies suggest that high affinity association of the VDR with DNA requires both the DNA-binding domain as well as an additional independent structure located within the steroid-binding region. This protein subdomain interacts with NAF and is regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3."
https://openalex.org/W1533013905,"The glc7 mutant of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not accumulate glycogen due to a defect in glycogen synthase activation (Peng, Z., Trumbly, R. J., and Reimann, E.M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13871-13877) whereas wild-type strains accumulate glycogen as the cell cultures approach stationary phase. We isolated the GLC7 gene by complementation of the defect in glycogen accumulation and found that the GLC7 gene is the same as the DIS2S1 gene (Ohkura, H., Kinoshita, N., Miyatani, S., Toda, T., and Yanagida, M. (1989) Cell 57, 997-1007). The protein product predicted by the GLC7 DNA sequence has a sequence that is 81% identical with rabbit protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit. Protein phosphatase 1 activity was greatly diminished in extracts from glc7 mutant cells. Two forms of protein phosphatase 1 were identified after chromatography of extracts on DEAE-cellulose. Both forms were diminished in the glc7 mutant and were partly restored by transformation with a plasmid carrying the GLC7 gene. Southern blots indicate the presence of a single copy of GLC7 in S. cerevisiae, and gene disruption experiments showed that the GLC7 gene is essential for cell viability. The GLC7 mRNA was identified as a 1.4-kilobase RNA that increases 4-fold at the end of exponential growth in wild-type cells, suggesting that activation of glycogen synthase is mediated by increased expression of protein phosphatase 1 as cells reach stationary phase."
https://openalex.org/W1574842592,"The natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) are a family of three cell surface glycoproteins, each with a single transmembrane domain. Two of these receptors, designated NPR-A and NPR-B, are membrane guanylyl cyclases that synthesize cGMP in response to hormone stimulation. The third receptor, NPR-C, has been reported to function in the metabolic clearance of ligand and in guanylyl cyclase-independent signal transduction. We engineered three chimeric proteins consisting of the natriuretic peptide receptor extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG-gamma 1. These molecules provide material for detailed studies of the human receptor's extracellular domain structure and interaction with the three human natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and type-C natriuretic peptide (CNP). The homodimeric fusion proteins, designated A-IgG, B-IgG, and C-IgG, were secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by protein-A affinity chromatography. We present here the primary characterization of these fusion proteins as represented by the intrinsic hormone affinities measured by saturation binding and competition assays. The dissociation constant of 125I-ANP for A-IgG was 1.6 pM and for C-IgG, 1.2 pM. The dissociation constant of 125I-Y0-CNP (CNP with addition of tyrosine at the amino terminus) for B-IgG was 23 pM. The rank order of potency in competitive binding for A-IgG was ANP greater than BNP much greater than CNP, whereas for B-IgG the ranking was CNP much greater than ANP greater than BNP. For C-IgG, we observed ANP greater than CNP greater than or equal to BNP. These data demonstrate that the receptor-IgG fusion proteins discriminate among the natriuretic peptides in the same manner as the native receptors and provide a basis for future structural studies with these molecules. The purified fusion proteins have a variety of potential applications, one of which we illustrate by a solid phase screening assay in which rabbit sera from a series of synthetic-peptide immunizations were titered for receptor reactivity and selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1500832609,"The association of thrombin with thrombomodulin, a non-enzymatic endothelial cell surface receptor, alters the substrate specificity of thrombin. Complex formation converts thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant enzyme. Structure-function analysis of this change in specificity is facilitated by the availability of two soluble proteolytic derivatives of thrombomodulin, one consisting of the six repeated growth factor-like domains of thrombomodulin (GF1-6) and the other containing only the fifth and sixth such domains (GF5-6). Both derivatives can bind to thrombin and block fibrinogen clotting activity, though only the larger GF1-6 can stimulate the activation of protein C. To ascertain whether the substrate specificity change from fibrinogen to protein C is accompanied by structural changes in the active site of the enzyme, fluorescent dyes were positioned at different locations within the active site. A 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) dye was covalently attached to the active site serine to form dansyl-thrombin, while either a fluorescein or an anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS) dye was attached covalently to the active site histidine of thrombin via a D-Phe-Pro-Arg linkage. The environment of the dansyl dye was altered in a similar fashion when either GF1-6 or GF5-6 bound to thrombin, since a similar reduction in dansyl emission intensity was elicited by these two thrombomodulin derivatives (25 and 32%, respectively). These spectral changes, and all others in this study, were saturable and reached a maximum when the ratio of thrombomodulin derivative to thrombin was close to 1. The environments of the fluorescein and ANS dyes were also altered when GF1-6 bound to thrombin because binding resulted in emission intensity changes of -13% and +18%, respectively. In contrast, no fluorescence changes were observed when the fluorescein and ANS thrombin derivatives were titrated with GF5-6. Thus, the structure of the active site was altered by thrombomodulin both immediately adjacent to the active site serine and also more than 15 A away from it. However, the structural change far from Ser-195 was only elicited by thrombomodulin species that stimulate thrombin-dependent activation of protein C."
https://openalex.org/W2058966822,"One of the important events in synapse formation is the accumulation of neurotransmitter receptors beneath the presynaptic nerve terminal. Agrin is a component of the synaptic basal lamina that induces the clustering of acetylcholine receptors when bath-applied to muscle fibers in culture. When a cDNA encoding a putative agrin protein is transfected into cells, the molecule is secreted and concentrated on the extracellular surface. Coculture of transfected cells with muscle fibers induces the formation of receptor patches at contact sites. These results demonstrate that expression of a single gene encoding agrin confers receptor clustering that is restricted to specific sites of cell-muscle contact."
https://openalex.org/W1497166945,"We have studied the role of N-linked oligosaccharides and proteolytic processing on the targeting of cathepsin D to the lysosomes in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. In the presence of tunicamycin cathepsin D was synthesized as an unglycosylated 43-kDa proenzyme which was proteolytically processed via a 39-kDa intermediate to a 28-kDa mature form. Only a small portion was secreted into the culture medium. During intracellular transport the 43-kDa procathepsin D transiently became membrane-associated independently of binding to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Subcellular fractionation showed that unglycosylated cathepsin D was efficiently targeted to the lysosomes via intermediate compartments similar to the enzyme in control cells. The results show that in HepG2 cells processing and transport of cathepsin D to the lysosomes is independent of mannose 6-phosphate residues. Inhibition of the proteolytic processing of 53-kDa procathepsin D by protease inhibitors caused this form to accumulate intracellularly. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the procathepsin D was transported to lysosomes, thereby losing its membrane association. Procathepsin D taken up by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor also transiently became membrane-associated, probably in the same compartment. We conclude that the mannose 6-phosphate-independent membrane-association is a transient and compartment-specific event in the transport of procathepsin D."
https://openalex.org/W1525648980,"The mechanism of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in HeLa cells was investigated. TPA caused a 3-fold increase in particulate CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity in HeLa cells which correlated with decreased cytidylyltransferase activity in the cytosol. The increase in membrane-associated cytidylyltransferase was confirmed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation studies suggested that TPA had no effect on the phosphorylation state of cytidylyltransferase. Enhanced binding of cytidylyltransferase to diacylglycerol-enriched membranes has previously been shown. Diacylglycerol levels in TPA-treated HeLa cells increased approximately 2-fold (2.29 to 4.02 nmol/mg of protein) after 1 h of TPA treatment. A time course experiment showed a temporal relationship in which production of diacylglycerol appeared to signal translocation of cytidylyltransferase to membranes followed by a stimulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Diacylglycerol was further evaluated as a translocator of cytidylyltransferase by depleting HeLa cells of protein kinase C and incubating with dioctanoylglcerol. This treatment increased both membrane-associated cytidylyltransferase activity and the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis approximately 2-fold. A time course experiment with dioctanoylglycerol showed a strong positive correlation (r2 = 0.89) between the amount of particulate cytidylyltransferase activity and the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Therefore, TPA stimulates phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by causing a translocation of cytidylyltransferase from the cytosol to membranes, which appears to be mediated by increased diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1500720615,"Heterologous expression of the rat 5-HT1A receptor in stably transfected GH4C1 rat pituitary cells (clone GH4ZD10) and mouse Ltk- fibroblast cells (clone LZD-7) (Albert, P.R., Zhou, Q.-Y., VanTol, H.H.M., Bunzow, J.R., and Civelli, O. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5825-5832) was used to characterize the cellular specificity of signal transduction by the 5-HT1A receptor. We demonstrate that the 5-HT1A receptor, acting via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, can change its inhibitory signaling phenotype and become a stimulatory receptor, depending on the cell type, differentiation state, or intracellular milieu of the cell in which it is expressed. When expressed in pituitary GH4ZD10 cells, activation of 5-HT1A receptors decreased both basal and vasoactive intestinal peptide-enhanced cAMP accumulation and blocked (+/-)-Bay K8644-induced influx of calcium, inhibitory responses which are typical of neurons which endogenously express this receptor. Similarly, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) also inhibited adenylyl cyclase in fibroblast LZD-7 cells, reducing the forskolin-induced enhancement of cAMP levels by 50%, but did not alter basal cAMP levels. In contrast to GH4ZD10 cells, where 5-HT had no effect on basal or thyrotropin-releasing hormone-induced phosphatidylinositol turnover, 5-HT enhanced the accumulation of inositol phosphates and induced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i in LZD-7 cells. These dominant stimulatory actions of 5-HT, as well as the inhibitory effects, were absent in untransfected cells and displayed the potency and pharmacological specificity of the 5-HT1A receptor, indicating that the 5-HT1A subtype coupled to both inhibitory and stimulatory pathways in the fibroblast cell. The actions of 5-HT in GH and L cells were blocked by 24-h pretreatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting that inhibitory G proteins (Gi/G(o)) mediate both inhibitory and stimulatory signal transduction of the 5-HT1A receptor. However, the 5-HT-induced stimulatory pathway in fibroblasts was blocked selectively by acute (2-min) pretreatment with TPA, an activator of protein kinase C. This action of protein kinase C was potentiated by activation of protein kinase A, indicating that the expression of the stimulatory pathway of the 5-HT1A receptor in LZD-7 cells is modulated by second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W2072653261,"Genes that encode nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs) have been implicated as regulators of mammalian tumor metastasis and development in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the cellular pathways through which NDKs function are not known. One potential mechanism of regulation is phosphorylation of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound to regulatory guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins. NDK-catalyzed phosphorylation of bound GDP was investigated for the adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor (ARF), a 21-kilodalton GTP-binding protein that functions in the protein secretion pathway. Bovine liver NDK, recombinant human NDK, and the protein product of the mouse gene nm23-1, which suppresses the metastatic potential of certain tumor cells, used ARF-GDP as a substrate, thereby allowing rapid and efficient production of activated ARF (ARF-GTP) in the absence of nucleotide exchange. These data are consistent with the proposed function of NDK as an activator of a small GTP-binding protein and provide a mechanism of activation for a regulatory GTP-binding protein that is independent of nucleotide exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1516882381,"The extracytoplasmic region of the 270-kDa mannose 6-phosphate/IGF-II receptor is composed of 15 repeating domains and is capable of binding 2 mol of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P). To localize the Man-6-P binding domains, bovine receptor was subjected to partial proteolysis with subtilisin followed by affinity chromatography on pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose. Eleven proteolytic fragments ranging in apparent molecular mass from 53 to 206 kDa were isolated. Sequence analysis of six of the fragments localized their amino termini to either the beginning of domain 1 at the amino terminus of the molecule or the beginning of domain 7, according to the alignment of Lobel et al. (Lobel, P., Dahms, N. M., and Kornfeld, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2563-2570). The smallest fragment, with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa, is predicted to encompass domains 1-3. Another fragment, with an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa, is predicted to encompass domains 7-10 or 7-11. The Man-6-P binding site contained within domains 1-3 was further defined by expressing truncated forms of the receptor in Xenopus laevis oocytes and assaying their ability to bind phosphomannosyl residues. A soluble polypeptide containing domains 1-3 exhibited binding activity, whereas a polypeptide containing domains 1 and 2 did not. This indicates that domain 3 is a necessary component of one of the Man-6-P binding sites of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1595823827,"Abstract Activation of the superoxide (O2-)-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes in a cell-free system by anionic amphiphiles requires the participation of both membrane and cytosolic components. We reported that ammonium sulfate fractionation (Pick, E., Kroizman, T., and Abo, A. (1989) J. Immunol. 143, 4180-4187) and affinity chromatography on 2',5'-ADP-agarose (Shaag, D., and Pick, E. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1037, 405-412) permit separation of cytosol in two fractions (sigma 1 and sigma 2) that support O2- production by solubilized membrane synergistically. We now describe the purification of sigma 1 to near homogeneity and demonstrate that it represents a cytosolic component distinct from p47-phox and p67-phox, that are both found in fraction sigma 2. Sigma 1 was absolutely required for the full expression of amphiphile-activated NADPH-oxidase activity. This requirement was evident whether sigma 1 was added to cell-free systems composed of: (a) solubilized membrane and a sigma 2-enriched cytosolic fraction, or (b) purified cytochrome b559, incorporated in liposomes, and purified sigma 2. Sigma 1 was purified by a sequence comprising ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Superose, absorption with CM-Sepharose, anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, and gel filtration on Superose 12. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of sigma 1 of maximal purity, under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, demonstrated the presence of two proteins, of 24 and 22 kDa. On gel filtration, sigma 1 was eluted as a symmetrical peak of 46 kDa that by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed the presence of both 24- and 22-kDa bands. We suggest that, in its native form, sigma 1 might represent a complex of the 24- and 22-kDa proteins. The specific roles of each molecule in NADPH oxidase function remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2056743924,"Agrin derived from Torpedo electric organ induces the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on cultured myotubes. As a first step toward characterizing the plasma membrane receptor for agrin, we have examined agrin binding to cultured myotubes. Agrin binding is saturable as measured by radioimmunoassay and, like agrin-induced AChR clustering, requires extracellular calcium. Immunofluorescence shows that on myotubes incubated with agrin at 4 degrees C, agrin binds in a uniform, finely punctate pattern that correlates poorly with the distribution of AChRs. Myotubes stimulated with agrin at 37 degrees C for greater than or equal to 2 hr show a coclustering of agrin binding sites and AChRs. By contrast, if anti-AChR antibodies are used either to cluster or to internalize AChRs, the distribution and number of agrin binding sites remain unchanged. The aggregation and calcium dependence of the putative agrin receptor may represent important control points in postsynaptic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1530694445,"Lysosomal enzymes contain a common protein determinant that is recognized by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, the initial enzyme in the biosynthesis of mannose-6-P residues. Previously, we generated a lysosomal enzyme recognition domain by substituting two regions (lysine 203 and amino acids 265-292) of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D into a related secretory protein glycopepsinogen. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the oligosaccharides of the chimeric protein were efficiently phosphorylated (Baranski, T. J., Faust, P. L., and Kornfeld, S. (1990) Cell 63, 281-291). In the current study, incremental substitutions of cathepsin D residues into glycopepsinogen and alanine-scanning mutagenesis were utilized to define the recognition domain more precisely. A computer-generated model of the cathepsin D/pepsinogen chimeric molecule served as a guide for mutagenesis and for the interpretation of results. These studies indicate that the recognition domain is a surface patch that contains multiple interacting sites. There is a strict positional requirement for the lysine residue at position 203."
https://openalex.org/W1601218597,"The expression of collagenolytic activity by cells represents the rate-limiting step in the turnover of collagen during remodeling. The collagenase gene is transcriptionally activated in normal dermal or rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), resulting in secretion of trypsin-activatable procollagenase measuring in the range of 2.0-5.0 units/10(6) cells/48 h in the 14C-fibril assay. The addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma; 50-100 units/ml) inhibits the expression of collagenase activity by 45-80% in these cells. The IL-1 beta induction of procollagenase protein was not altered by IFN-gamma, as judged by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to collagenase and by gelatin zymography, and procollagenase mRNA was also unaltered, as assessed by Northern blot analysis. Because collagenolytic activity is also controlled by the quantity of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases present, its expression was examined by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases and by reverse gelatin zymography. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase protein was found to be unaltered or slightly less abundant in conditioned media from cultures treated with IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma when compared with that from cultures treated with IL-1 beta alone. However, the expression of the metalloproteinase activator of procollagenase, stromelysin, was found to be significantly inhibited by the addition of IFN-gamma. Addition of purified activated stromelysin to these conditioned media completely reconstituted collagenolytic activity. These observations demonstrate in an intact system that stromelysin is a specific activator necessary for the development of collagenolytic activity. Despite stromelysin's lack of catalytic activity against collagen, its expression can serve as a control point in the regulation of collagenolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1546754831,"The structure of the murine erythropoietin receptor was studied using antibodies against the intracellular part of the cloned erythropoietin receptor chain. These antibodies precipitated erythropoietin-receptor complexes from Triton X-100-solubilized cells. When the complexes were cross-linked by disuccinimidyl suberate, the 85- and 100-kDa erythropoietin-cross-linked proteins previously described were immunoprecipitated. However, these proteins were not precipitated when the complexes were denatured and reduced before immunoprecipitation. Using 1-ethyl 3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, we observed erythropoietin cross-linking with a protein of 66 kDa in addition to the 100- and 85-kDa proteins. Only the 66-kDa erythropoietin-cross-linked protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-receptor antibodies after denaturation and reduction of the complex. Thus, our results suggest that the 85- and 100-kDa proteins previously evidenced by cross-linking are associated with the cloned chain of the receptor to form a multimeric complex but these proteins seem immunologically unrelated to the cloned chain. We observed that reducing the length of molecules able to cross-link amino groups decreased the efficiency of cross-linking with the 100-kDa protein and only the 85-kDa protein was cross-linked with erythropoietin using 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. These results suggest that the 85- and 100-kDa proteins occupate slightly different positions relative to the erythropoietin molecule bound to the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1516253222,"A gene has been cloned from a DNA library from alkaliphilic Bacillus firmus OF4 that functionally complements a mutant strain of Escherichia coli, NM81, that carries a deletion for one of that strain's Na+/H+ antiporter genes (delta nhaA). The cloned alkaliphile gene restored to NM81 the ability to grow at pH 7.5 in the presence of 0.6 M NaCl and on 100 mM Li+ in the presence of melibiose, and concomitantly led to an increase in the membrane associated Na+/H+ antiport activity. The biologically active alkaliphile DNA was identified as an incomplete open reading frame, the sequence of which would encode a hydrophobic protein. The insert was used to isolate clones containing the complete open reading frame, which would be predicted to encode a protein with a molecular weight of 42,960 and multiple membrane spanning regions. When the open reading frame was expressed under the control of the T7 promoter, the gene product was localized in the membrane. Southern analysis indicated no homology between the alkaliphile gene, which we propose to call nhaC, and the nhaA gene of Escherichia coli, nor with other genes in digests of DNA from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, or Bacillus alcalophilus. Although there was also no significant similarity between the deduced protein products of the alkaliphile gene and the nhaA gene of E. coli, there was a small region of significant similarity between the deduced alkaliphile gene product and the protein encoded by a human Na+/H+ antiporter gene (Sardet, C., Franchi, A., and Pouyssegur, J. (1989) Cell 56, 271-280)."
https://openalex.org/W1500295667,"Abstract The reaction of xanthine oxidase with 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine (also called 2-oxo-6-methylpurine) has been studied under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Reaction of enzyme with substoichiometric concentrations of hydroxymethylpurine in aerobic 0.1 M 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid, 0.1 N KCl, 0.3 mM EDTA, pH 10.0, exhibits two reaction intermediates detectable by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The rate constants for formation of the first intermediate, conversion of the first to the second, and the decay of the second to give oxidized enzyme are 18, 1.2, and 0.13 s-1, respectively. The difference spectra of these two intermediates relative to oxidized enzyme are characterized by absorbance maxima at 470 and 540 nm, respectively, with extinction changes (relative to oxidized enzyme) of approximately 410 M-1 cm-1. The 0.13 s-1 decay of the second intermediate agrees well with kcat of 0.11 s-1 determined under the same conditions. Based on a comparison of the kinetics of the reaction as monitored by UV-visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry, it is concluded that these spectral intermediates arise from the molybdenum center of the enzyme in the MoIV and MoV valence states, respectively, the latter corresponding to the species exhibiting the MoV EPR signal known to be formed in the course of the reaction. This conclusion is supported by the results of experiments using cytochrome c reduction to follow the formation of superoxide production in the course of the aerobic reaction of xanthine oxidase with substoichiometric hydroxymethylpurine, which demonstrate unequivocally that the species exhibiting the very EPR signal is formed by one-electron oxidation of a MoIV species rather than direct one-electron reduction of MoVI by substrate. No evidence is found for the formation of any of the MoV EPR signals designated rapid in the present studies, and it is concluded that this species is not a bona fide catalytic intermediate in the reductive half-reaction of xanthine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1510296527,"We characterized binding and endocytosis of 125I-bovine lactoferrin by isolated rat hepatocytes. Iron-depleted (apo-Lf), approximately 30% saturated (Lf), and iron-saturated (holo-Lf) lactoferrin were used. At 4 degrees C, cells bound 125I-apo-Lf and 125I-holo-Lf with nearly identical apparent first order kinetics (t1/2 = approximately 42 min). Holo-Lf and apo-Lf competed with each other for binding. Hepatocytes bound lactoferrin optimally at pH greater than or equal to 7 but poorly at pH less than or equal to 6. Ca2+ (greater than or equal to 100 microM) enhanced Lf binding to cells, and holo-Lf remained monomeric with Ca2+ present as determined by gel filtration chromatography. With Ca2+, cells exhibited approximately 10(6) high affinity sites (Kd approximately 20 nM) and approximately 10(7) low affinity sites (Kd approximately 700 nM) for both apo- and holo-Lf. Without Ca2+, cells bound 125I-holo-Lf by the low affinity component only. EGTA and dextran sulfate together released greater than or equal to 90% 125I-Lf prebound at 4 degrees C, but individually removed separate populations of surface-bound 125I-Lf. Cells bound 125I-Lf in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner with dextran sulfate present. We conclude that the high affinity but not the low affinity sites require Ca2+; only the low affinity sites are dextran sulfate-sensitive. Neither transferrin nor asialo-orosomucoid blocked lactoferrin binding to hepatocytes. Some cationic proteins but not others inhibited lactoferrin binding. At 37 degrees C, hepatocytes endocytosed 125I-apo-Lf and 125I-holo-Lf similarly, and hyperosmolality (greater than 500 mmol/kg) blocked uptake by approximately 90%. These data support the proposal that hepatocytes regulate blood lactoferrin concentration by receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1587511968,"A cDNA clone corresponding to the entire coding region of the bovine ETB endothelin receptor mRNA was isolated from a lung cDNA library and sequenced. The cDNA encodes 441 amino acids: 26 constituting an NH2-terminal signal peptide and 415 constituting the mature receptor. The signal peptidase cleavage site was determined by direct amino acid sequencing of purified receptor. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with the available bovine ETA and rat ETB endothelin receptor sequences revealed 63 and 85% homology, respectively. Endothelin receptors of various species are known to be very sensitive to a certain metal proteinase(s) and have been shown to be converted to a lower Mr form in the absence of EDTA. The metal proteinase cleavage site was also determined by direct protein sequencing of the proteolysis product. The amino acid sequence (Ala-Gly-X-Pro-Pro-Arg) surrounding the cleavage site (between Ala-79 and Gly-80) is conserved among the ETB endothelin receptors, explaining the above mentioned proteolytic conversion from the higher to lower Mr forms observed in various species."

S., and Dunn, B. (1990) Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 16, 211-223). In this paper, a biochemical basis for the lec23 mutation is identified. The carbohydrates associated with the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) grown in Lec23 cells (Lec23/VSV) were found to possess predominantly oligomannosyl carbohydrates that bound strongly to concanavalin A-Sepharose, eluted 3 sugar eq beyond a Man9GlcNAc marker oligosaccharide on ion suppression high pressure liquid chromatography, and were susceptible to digestion with jack bean alpha-mannosidase. Monosaccharide analyses revealed that the oligomannosyl carbohydrates contained glucose, indicating a defect in alpha-glucosidase activity. This was confirmed by further structural characterization of the Lec23/VSV oligomannosyl carbohydrates using purified rat mammary gland alpha-glucosidase I, jack bean alpha-mannosidase, and 1H NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz. [3H]Glucose-labeled Glc3Man9GlcNAc was prepared from CHO/VSV labeled with [3H]galactose in the presence of the processing inhibitors castanospermine and deoxymannojirimycin. Subsequently, [3H]Glc2Man9GlcNAc was prepared by purified alpha-glucosidase I digestion of [3H]Glc3Man9GlcNAc. When these oligosaccharides were used as alpha-glucosidase substrates it was revealed that Lec23 cells are specifically defective in alpha-glucosidase I, a deficiency not previously identified among mammalian cell glycosylation mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2066011262,"Recordings of single-channel activity from cerebellar granule cells show that a component of Ca2+ entry flows through L-type Ca2+ channels that are closed at negative membrane potentials following a strong depolarization, but then open after a delay. The delayed openings can be explained if membrane depolarization drives Ca2+ channels into an inactivated state and some channels return to rest through the open state after repolarization. Whole-cell recordings show that the charge carried by Ca2+ during the tail increases as inactivation progresses, whereas the current during the voltage step decreases. Voltage-dependent inactivation may be a general mechanism in central neurons for enhancing Ca2+ entry by delaying it until after repolarization, when the driving force for ion entry is large. Modifying the rate and extent of inactivation would have large effects on Ca2+ entry through those channels that recover from inactivation by passing through the open state."
https://openalex.org/W1516133119,"Glucose-induced changes in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) were investigated using pancreatic beta-cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. Glucose, at concentrations above 3-5 mM, depolarized the beta-cell and increased pHi, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and insulin release. This increase in pHi was dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+ and was inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride, a blocker of Na+/H+ exchange. Stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester also induced an alkalinization. However, when protein kinase C activity was down-regulated, glucose stimulation still induced alkalinization. At 20 mM glucose, 10 mM NH4Cl induced a marked rise in pHi, paralleled by repolarization, inhibition of electrical activity, and decreases in both [Ca2+]i and insulin release. Reduction in [Ca2+]i was prevented by 200 microM tolbutamide, but not by 10 mM tetraethylammonium. At 4 mM glucose, NH4Cl induced a transient increase in insulin release, without changing [Ca2+]i. Exposure of beta-cells to 10 mM sodium acetate caused a persistent decrease in pHi, an effect paralleled by a small transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Acidification per se did not change the beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, not excluding that the activity of the ATP-regulated K+ channels may be modulated by changes in pHi."
https://openalex.org/W1503237397,"Yeast histidine tRNA guanylyltransferase (TGT) catalyzes in the presence of ATP the addition of GTP to the 5' end of eukaryotic cytoplasmic tRNAHis species. A study of the enzyme mechanism with purified protein showed that during the first step ATP is cleaved to AMP and PPi creating adenylylated TGT. In a second step the activated enzyme forms a stable complex with its cognate tRNA substrate. The 5'-phosphate of the tRNA is adenylylated by nucleotide transfer from the adenylylated guanylyltransferase to form A(5')pp(5')N at the 5'-end of the tRNA. Finally, the 3'-hydroxyl of GTP adds to the activated 5' terminus of the tRNA with the release of AMP. This mechanism of tRNAHis guanylyltransferase is very similar to that of RNA ligases. dATP can substitute for ATP in this reaction. Since among several guanosine compounds active in this reaction GTP is most efficiently added we believe that it is the natural substrate of TGT."
https://openalex.org/W1484846725,"The orientation of the enzyme Mg(2+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) in the transverse tubule (TT) membranes of skeletal muscle was investigated using highly purified chicken and rabbit TT vesicles. The percentage of sealed vesicles present in these preparations averaged 88 and 78%, respectively, as calculated from the detergent-induced increase in ouabain-sensitive (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, ATP-dependent ouabain binding, and lactate dehydrogenase activity (sarcoplasmic enzyme trapped in the TT vesicles). Sidedness of the sealed vesicles, estimated from latency of 5'-nucleotidase, acetylcholinesterase, and adenylate cyclase, was predominantly right-side out (69-76%, chicken TT and 62-70%, rabbit TT). In both chicken and rabbit native vesicles, high Mg(2+)-ATPase activity was detected by addition of ATP to the extravesicular medium; this activity was increased 14-12% by alamethicin pointing to the external localization of the active site. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity resulted partially inhibited by treatment of the chicken TT vesicles with proteinase K or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Concanavalin A stimulated 4-fold the chicken TT Mg(2+)-ATPase activity, an effect not potentiated by detergent permeabilization of the intact vesicles, indicating that lectin-binding sites were also solvent accessible. This stimulatory effect was not observed in native or permeabilized rabbit TT vesicles. From these results we conclude that the TT Mg(2+)-ATPase is an ectoenzyme with its nucleotide-hydrolyzing site and glycosylated regions facing the extracellular space. Inhibitors of ion-motive ATPases did not modify the enzyme activity, suggesting a different physiological role for the TT Mg(2+)-ATPase which may be involved in the regulation of muscle fiber functions affected by extracellular ATP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1524572243,"Recombinant human myoglobin mutants with the distal histidine residue replaced by Leu, Val, or Gln residues have been prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Escherichia coli. The recombinant apomyoglobin proteins have been successfully reconstituted with cobaltous protoporphyrin IX to obtain cobalt myoglobin mutant proteins, and the role of the distal histidine residue on the interaction between the bound ligand and the myoglobin molecule has been studied by EPR spectroscopy. We found that the distal histidine residue is significant in the orientation of the bound oxygen molecule. Low temperature photolysis experiments on both oxy cobalt proteins and ferric nitric oxide complexes indicated that the nature of the photolyzed form depends on the steric crowding of the distal heme pocket. To our surprise, the distal Leu mutant has a less restricted, less sterically crowded distal heme pocket than that of the distal Val mutant myoglobin, despite the fact that Leu has a larger side chain volume than Val. Our results demonstrate that the distal heme pocket steric crowding is not necessarily related to the side chain volume of the E7 residue."

https://openalex.org/W1521269507,"The steroid hormone-inducible promoter from mouse mammary tumor virus is associated with a distal negative regulatory element that represses its inherent basal activity. Deletion analysis localized the sequences required for repression to 64 base pairs of DNA between -427 and -364 with respect to the transcription initiation site. Transient transfection experiments with a series of linker scanning and small internal deletion mutations revealed two mutation-sensitive domains separated by a region of relative resistance to sequence alterations. DNase I footprinting and gel electrophoresis mobility shift experiments with crude nuclear extracts identified at least one protein-binding site within each of the two mutation-sensitive regions. An oligonucleotide corresponding to one of these sites is able to repress transcription, but only when linked to the promoter in multiple copies. This negative regulatory element functions synergistically with a promoter proximal negative element to mediate efficient promoter repression, selectively affecting basal relative to steroid hormone-induced transcription and thus increasing the ratio of promoter activity observed in the presence and absence of hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1495525226,"Abstract Cytochrome d has been postulated to be the respiratory oxidase of Azotobacter vinelandii, allowing this organism to fix nitrogen under aerobic growth conditions. We have previously cloned and characterized the structural genes for the A. vinelandii cytochrome d (cydA and cydB). The cyd genes are co-transcribed, yielding an mRNA of approximately 3.6 kilobase pairs. The level of the cyd message was 2-3-fold higher in cells that were fixing nitrogen, as compared with non-nitrogen-fixing cells. RNase protection analysis was used to determine the transcriptional start site at 275 bases upstream of the initiator ATG of cydA, and this start site was the same for nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing cells. The cyd promoter has sequence similarities to the canonical Escherichia coli promoters, which are transcribed by the major sigma 70 form of RNA polymerase. Plasmid-borne lacZ transcriptional fusions were constructed, using approximately 650 base pairs of 5'-upstream sequences of the cyd structural genes. This region had a strong promoter activity which was further up-regulated 1.5-2.5-fold upon the induction of nitrogen fixation. The cyd-lacZ fusions were characterized in a nifA- as well as an ntrA- background. Mutations in neither of these nif regulatory genes affected the constitutive expression of cyd under non-nitrogen-fixing conditions. However, the up-regulation of this promoter during the induction of nitrogen fixation was abolished only in the ntrA- background. Based on these results, the cytochrome d promoter of A. vinelandii belongs to a new class of nitrogen-regulated promoters which, unlike the authentic nif genes, does not require the ntrA gene product for its expression. The up-regulation of this promoter during nitrogen fixation, however, requires the ntrA gene product."
https://openalex.org/W64351160,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an important neuropeptide in both central and peripheral neurones whereas peptide YY (PYY) is a gut hormone present in endocrine cells in the lower bowel. Both peptides interact with multiple binding sites that have been further classified into Y1 and Y2 receptors. We have solubilized native Y2 receptors both from basolateral membranes of proximal convoluted tubules from rabbit kidney and from rat hippocampal membranes. Solubilization of functional Y2 receptors was obtained with both 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and digitonin and resulted in each case in a single class of high affinity binding sites. The soluble receptor retained the binding specificity for different peptides and long C-terminal fragments of NPY exhibited by membrane preparations. Gel filtration of solubilized receptors resulted in a single peak of specific PYY binding activity corresponding to Mr = 350,000 whereas affinity labeling revealed a major band of Mr = 60,000. Since this binding activity was inhibited by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) the Y2 receptor is probably solubilized as a receptor complex containing a G-protein along with the ligand binding protein. Y2 receptor binding sites from kidney tubular membranes were purified to homogeneity by a three-step procedure employing Mono S cation-exchange adsorption, affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-agarose beads, and affinity chromatography on NPY-Affi-Gel. Electrophoresis and silver staining of the final receptor preparation revealed a single protein with Mr = 60,000 whereas gel filtration showed a single peak at approximately Mr = 60,000. The purified protein can be affinity labeled with [125I-Tyr36]PYY, indicating that the Mr = 60,000 protein contains the ligand binding site of the Y2 receptor, and this binding is not affected by GTP gamma S. Scatchard transformation of binding data for the purified Y2 receptors was compatible with a single class of binding sites with Kd = 76 pM. The purified Y2 receptors retain their binding properties with regard to affinity and specificity for different members of the pancreatic polypeptide-fold peptide family. The specific activity of purified Y2 receptors was calculated to approximately 14.7 nmol of ligand binding/mg of receptor protein, which is consistent with the theoretical value (16.6 nmol/mg) for a pure Mr = 60,000 protein binding one PYY molecule. Purification to homogeneity thus reveals the Y2 receptor as an Mr = 60,000 glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1549741209,"Abstract Compared to other tRNAs all known histidine tRNAs have the unique feature of possessing an additional nucleotide at their 5' end. It is usually a guanosine residue but not in bacteriophage T5 tRNA which carries an additional uridine. The additional nucleotide is not encoded in eukaryotic histidine tRNA genes but is added in a post-transcriptional modification reaction (Cooley, L., Appel, B., and Soll, D. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6475-6479) by histidine tRNA guanylyltransferase (tRNAHis guanylyltransferase). Here we report the purification of this enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the determination of some of its physical properties. Six different steps including Polymin P precipitation, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, heparin-agarose, ATP-agarose, and gel filtration on Superose 12 were employed for the purification of the guanylyltransferase from an S-100 extract. A Stokes radius of 46.5 +/- 0.5 A and a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 7.8 +/- 0.2 were determined by gel filtration and rate zonal sedimentation, respectively. A relative molecular weight (Mr) of approximately 120,000 was calculated for the purified native enzyme. The Mr of the denatured protein is approximately 58,000 as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate a homodimeric (alpha 2) structure for the enzyme. Among all acceptor RNAs in unfractionated tRNA only tRNAHis is a substrate for the purified guanylyltransferase. The reaction requires ATP, a guanosine substrate, and a divalent metal ion. Treatment of guanylyltransferase with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic)-acid abolishes activity; this suggests the importance of sulfhydryl groups for enzymatic activity. The enzyme shows discrimination among different histidine tRNA species; tRNA from plant and prokaryotes are better substrates than mammalian and insect tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1499444874,"The pH dependence of the conformation of cytochrome a in bovine cytochrome c oxidase has been studied by second derivative absorption spectroscopy. At neutral pH, the second derivative spectra of the cyanide-inhibited fully reduced and mixed valence enzyme display two Soret electronic transitions, at 443 and 451 nm, associated with cytochrome a. As the pH is lowered these two bands collapse into a single transition at approximately 444 nm. pH titration of the cyanide-inhibited mixed valence enzyme suggests that the transition from the two-band to one-band spectrum obeys the Henderson Hasselbalch relationship for a single protonation event with a transition pKa of 6.6 +/- 0.1. No pH dependence is observed for the spectra of the fully reduced unliganded or CO-inhibited enzyme. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the enzyme indicate that no major disruption of protein structure occurs in the pH range 5.5-8.5 used in this study. Resonance Raman spectroscopy indicates that the cytochrome a3 chromophore remains in its ferric, cyanide-bound form in the mixed valence enzyme throughout the pH range used here. These data indicate that the transition observed by second derivative spectroscopy is not due simply to pH-induced protein denaturation or disruption of the cytochrome a3 iron-CN bond. The pH dependence observed here is in good agreement with those observed earlier for the midpoint reduction potential of cytochrome a and for the conformational transition associated with energy transduction in the proton pumping model of Malmstrom (Malmstrom, B. G. (1990) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 280, 233-241). These results are discussed in terms of a model for allosteric communication between cytochrome a and the binuclear ligand binding center of the enzyme that is mediated by ionization of a single group within the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497595281,"Proteinase K was used to degrade membrane proteins exposed at the outer (cytoplasmic) and inner (periplasmic) surface of sealed, uniformly oriented chromatophore vesicles of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Exclusive and controlled digestion of the chromatophore interior was achieved after Ca(2+)-induced fusion with large unilamellar phosphatidylglycerol liposomes containing microencapsulated enzyme. Reaction center subunit H, which served as a marker for the outer surface, was degraded to a slightly smaller product in chromatophores. This protein remained intact after liposome-chromatophore fusion, suggesting that the intermixing of lipid bilayers proceeded without significant leakage of the aqueous vesicle contents. In contrast, while cytochrome c1 was not affected in chromatophores, 70-75% was degraded within 60 min after liposome-chromatophore fusion. These results support an arrangement in which the bulk of this protein, including the mesoheme component and active site residues, faces the periplasmic side of the membrane. Although current functional models for the cytochrome bc1 complex predict that the Rieske iron-sulfur center interacts with cytochrome c1 in the periplasm, the iron-sulfur protein resisted proteolytic attack in the liposome-chromatophore fusion products under conditions that caused extensive degradation of cytochrome c1. Two cleavage products of the iron-sulfur protein were observed after the digestion of chromatophores, suggesting both a heterogeneity in the population of this protein and the exposure of at least part of its molecular mass to the cytoplasm."

These modifications of the protein have previously been shown to have a profound effect on the dioxygen reduction and proton pumping activities of the enzyme (Li, P. M., Morgan, J. E., Nilsson, T., Ma, M., and Chan, S. I. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7538; Nilsson, T., Gelles, J., Li, P. M., and Chan, S. I. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 296; Sone, N., and Nicholls, P.

In this work, the intrinsic reduction potentials and the midpoint reduction potentials of the CuA site in both these modified oxidases have been measured under various conditions in order to clarify the intramolecular electron transfer pathways in these systems. The study reveals that the intrinsic reduction potential decreases by almost 150 mV upon p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid modification whereas it increases by 100 mV upon heat treatment. In addition, the redox interactions between and the remaining metal centers are perturbed upon modification. It is argued that these results bear on the role of in the proton-pumping paradigm of cytochrome c oxidase."
