https://openalex.org/W2785803176,"In humans, TGFβ signalling is associated with lack of response to immunotherapy in immune-excluded tumours; in mouse models of this immune phenotype, robust tumour infiltration by T cells and tumour regression are observed only when checkpoint inhibition is combined with inhibition of TGFβ signalling. Immune checkpoint blockade is showing clinical promise in the treatment of several cancer types, but the determinants of response need to be better established. Sanjeev Mariathasan and colleagues show that specific immune cell phenotypes and a high neoantigen burden are predictors of good responses to therapy with atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 agent, in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Lack of response to therapy is associated with increased TGFβ signalling in fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment. Combining TGFβ blockade with immune checkpoint blockade in mouse models increases the anti-tumour efficacy of the therapy, suggesting that identifying and targeting microenvironmental regulators of anti-tumour immunity may increase the reach of immunotherapy approaches. Therapeutic antibodies that block the programmed death-1 (PD-1)–programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway can induce robust and durable responses in patients with various cancers, including metastatic urothelial cancer1,2,3,4,5. However, these responses only occur in a subset of patients. Elucidating the determinants of response and resistance is key to improving outcomes and developing new treatment strategies. Here we examined tumours from a large cohort of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who were treated with an anti-PD-L1 agent (atezolizumab) and identified major determinants of clinical outcome. Response to treatment was associated with CD8+ T-effector cell phenotype and, to an even greater extent, high neoantigen or tumour mutation burden. Lack of response was associated with a signature of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signalling in fibroblasts. This occurred particularly in patients with tumours, which showed exclusion of CD8+ T cells from the tumour parenchyma that were instead found in the fibroblast- and collagen-rich peritumoural stroma; a common phenotype among patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Using a mouse model that recapitulates this immune-excluded phenotype, we found that therapeutic co-administration of TGFβ-blocking and anti-PD-L1 antibodies reduced TGFβ signalling in stromal cells, facilitated T-cell penetration into the centre of tumours, and provoked vigorous anti-tumour immunity and tumour regression. Integration of these three independent biological features provides the best basis for understanding patient outcome in this setting and suggests that TGFβ shapes the tumour microenvironment to restrain anti-tumour immunity by restricting T-cell infiltration."
https://openalex.org/W2788975052,"Most patients with colorectal cancer die as a result of the disease spreading to other organs. However, no prevalent mutations have been associated with metastatic colorectal cancers. Instead, particular features of the tumour microenvironment, such as lack of T-cell infiltration, low type 1 T-helper cell (TH1) activity and reduced immune cytotoxicity or increased TGFβ levels predict adverse outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. Here we analyse the interplay between genetic alterations and the tumour microenvironment by crossing mice bearing conditional alleles of four main colorectal cancer mutations in intestinal stem cells. Quadruple-mutant mice developed metastatic intestinal tumours that display key hallmarks of human microsatellite-stable colorectal cancers, including low mutational burden, T-cell exclusion and TGFβ-activated stroma. Inhibition of the PD-1-PD-L1 immune checkpoint provoked a limited response in this model system. By contrast, inhibition of TGFβ unleashed a potent and enduring cytotoxic T-cell response against tumour cells that prevented metastasis. In mice with progressive liver metastatic disease, blockade of TGFβ signalling rendered tumours susceptible to anti-PD-1-PD-L1 therapy. Our data show that increased TGFβ in the tumour microenvironment represents a primary mechanism of immune evasion that promotes T-cell exclusion and blocks acquisition of the TH1-effector phenotype. Immunotherapies directed against TGFβ signalling may therefore have broad applications in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer."

Here, using vascular single-cell transcriptomics, we provide molecular definitions for the principal types of blood vascular and vessel-associated cells in the adult mouse brain. We uncover the transcriptional basis of the gradual phenotypic change (zonation) along the arteriovenous axis and reveal unexpected cell type differences: a seamless continuum for endothelial cells versus a punctuated continuum for mural cells. We also provide insight into pericyte organotypicity and define a population of perivascular fibroblast-like cells that are present on all vessel types except capillaries. Our work illustrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics to decode the higher organizational principles of a tissue and may provide the initial chapter in a molecular encyclopaedia of the mammalian vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2786186674,"Stimulating deep inside the brain Noninvasive deep brain stimulation is an important goal in neuroscience and neuroengineering. Optogenetics normally requires the use of a blue laser inserted into the brain. Chen et al. used specialized nanoparticles that can upconvert near-infrared light from outside the brain into the local emission of blue light (see the Perspective by Feliu et al. ). They injected these nanoparticles into the ventral tegmental area of the mouse brain and activated channelrhodopsin expressed in dopaminergic neurons with near-infrared light generated outside the skull at a distance of several millimeters. This technique allowed distant near-infrared light to evoke fast increases in dopamine release. The method was also used successfully to evoke fear memories in the dentate gyrus during fear conditioning. Science , this issue p. 679 ; see also p. 633"
https://openalex.org/W2337092408,"The predisposition to neuropsychiatric disease involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. However, little is known about how genetic variants impart brain dysfunction or pathology. We used transcriptomic profiling as a quantitative readout of molecular brain-based phenotypes across five major psychiatric disorders-autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and alcoholism-compared with matched controls. We identified patterns of shared and distinct gene-expression perturbations across these conditions. The degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation is related to polygenic (single-nucleotide polymorphism-based) overlap across disorders, suggesting a substantial causal genetic component. This comprehensive systems-level view of the neurobiological architecture of major neuropsychiatric illness demonstrates pathways of molecular convergence and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2746656048,"With qubit measurement and control fidelities above the threshold of fault-tolerance, much attention is moving towards the daunting task of scaling up the number of physical qubits to the large numbers needed for fault tolerant quantum computing. Here, quantum dot based spin qubits may offer significant advantages due to their potential for high densities, all-electrical operation, and integration onto an industrial platform. In this system, the initialisation, readout, single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in various qubit representations. However, as seen with other small scale quantum computer demonstrations, combining these elements leads to new challenges involving qubit crosstalk, state leakage, calibration, and control hardware which provide invaluable insight towards scaling up. Here we address these challenges and demonstrate a programmable two-qubit quantum processor in silicon by performing both the Deutsch-Josza and the Grover search algorithms. In addition, we characterise the entanglement in our processor through quantum state tomography of Bell states measuring state fidelities between 85-89% and concurrences between 73-80%. These results pave the way for larger scale quantum computers using spins confined to quantum dots."

Mure et al. report transcriptional profiles from many tissues and brain regions in baboons over a 24-hour period (see the Perspective by Millius and Ueda). The results emphasize how extensive rhythmic expression is, with more than 80% of protein-coding genes involved. They also highlight unanticipated differences between the mouse and baboon in the cycling of transcripts in various tissues. The findings provide a comprehensive analysis of circadian variation in gene expression for a diurnal animal closely related to humans. Science , this issue p. eaao0318 ; see also p. 1210"

Barik et al. demonstrate a strong light-matter interaction in a topological photonic structure (see the Perspective by Amo). They created topological edge states at the interface between two photonic, topologically distinct regions and coupled them to a single quantum emitter. The chiral nature of single-photon emission was used to inject single photons of opposite polarization into counterpropagating topological edge states. Such a topological quantum optics interface may provide a powerful platform for developing robust integrated quantum optical circuits. Science , this issue p. 666 ; see also p. 638"

https://openalex.org/W2788630243,"Collective cell migration is essential for morphogenesis, tissue remodelling and cancer invasion. In vivo, groups of cells move in an orchestrated way through tissues. This movement involves mechanical as well as molecular interactions between cells and their environment. While the role of molecular signals in collective cell migration is comparatively well understood, how tissue mechanics influence collective cell migration in vivo remains unknown. Here we investigated the importance of mechanical cues in the collective migration of the Xenopus laevis neural crest cells, an embryonic cell population whose migratory behaviour has been likened to cancer invasion. We found that, during morphogenesis, the head mesoderm underlying the cephalic neural crest stiffens. This stiffening initiates an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in neural crest cells and triggers their collective migration. To detect changes in their mechanical environment, neural crest cells use mechanosensation mediated by the integrin-vinculin-talin complex. By performing mechanical and molecular manipulations, we show that mesoderm stiffening is necessary and sufficient to trigger neural crest migration. Finally, we demonstrate that convergent extension of the mesoderm, which starts during gastrulation, leads to increased mesoderm stiffness by increasing the cell density underneath the neural crest. These results show that convergent extension of the mesoderm has a role as a mechanical coordinator of morphogenesis, and reveal a link between two apparently unconnected processes-gastrulation and neural crest migration-via changes in tissue mechanics. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in substrate stiffness can trigger collective cell migration by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in vivo. More broadly, our results raise the idea that tissue mechanics combines with molecular effectors to coordinate morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2785420592,"Subcellular membraneless assemblies are a reinvigorated area of study in biology, with spirited scientific discussions on the forces between the low-complexity protein domains within these assemblies. To illuminate these forces, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless assemblies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into kinked β sheets that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the kinked sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our kinked structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2761331534,"Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are attractive systems for quantum computing due to their long coherence times and the promise of rapid scaling using semiconductor fabrication techniques. While nearest neighbor exchange coupling of two spins has been demonstrated, the interaction of spins via microwave frequency photons could enable long distance spin-spin coupling and ""all-to-all"" qubit connectivity. Here we demonstrate strong-coupling between a single spin in silicon and a microwave frequency photon with spin-photon coupling rates g_s/(2\pi) > 10 MHz. The mechanism enabling coherent spin-photon interactions is based on spin-charge hybridization in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. In addition to spin-photon coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of a single spin in the device and quantum non-demolition spin state readout using cavity photons. These results open a direct path toward entangling single spins using microwave frequency photons."
https://openalex.org/W2786809699,"Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) generate neurons throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus. We used chronic in vivo imaging and followed genetically labeled individual NSPCs and their progeny in the mouse hippocampus for up to 2 months. We show that NSPCs targeted by the endogenous Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1) promoter undergo limited rounds of symmetric and asymmetric divisions, eliciting a burst of neurogenic activity, after which they are lost. Further, our data reveal unexpected asymmetric divisions of nonradial glia-like NSPCs. Cell fates of Ascl1-labeled lineages suggest a developmental-like program involving a sequential transition from a proliferative to a neurogenic phase. By providing a comprehensive description of lineage relationships, from dividing NSPCs to newborn neurons integrating into the hippocampal circuitry, our data offer insight into how NSPCs support life-long hippocampal neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2786541194,"Chromosome dynamics and cellular clocks Many genes undergo daily or circadian changes in their rate of transcription. Kim et al. explored the mechanism by which the circadian clock is linked to chromosome dynamics (see the Perspective by Diettrich Mallet de Lima and Göndör). They used a chromosome conformation capture technique (Hi-C) to identify the interactions of adjacent DNA fragments and determine how DNA looping that altered such interactions changed over daily cycles. The repressive transcription factor Rev-erbα, which functions as part of the mammalian clock mechanism, appears to bind to chromatin and recruit a protein complex that evicts other proteins that enhance looping, thus favoring enhancer-promoter interactions.

During slow-wave sleep, synaptic depression is dominant. Sharp wave and ripple events are transient high-frequency field oscillations that occur spontaneously during slow-wave sleep in the brain.

https://openalex.org/W2787587553,"Taking the heat together Many of the processes in living cells are mediated by protein complexes that dynamically assemble and dissociate depending on cellular needs. Tan et al. developed a method called thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) to monitor the dynamics of native protein complexes inside cells (see the Perspective by Li et al. ). The method is based on the idea that proteins within a complex will coaggregate upon heat denaturation. It uses a previously described cellular shift assay to determine melting curves for thousands of proteins and assigns a TPCA signature on the basis of similarity between the curves. The method was validated by detection of many known protein complexes. It identified cell-specific interactions in six cell lines, highlighting the potential for identifying protein complexes that are modulated by disease.

https://openalex.org/W2788938150,"Peptidoglycan is the main component of the bacterial wall and protects cells from the mechanical stress that results from high intracellular turgor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis is very similar in all bacteria; bacterial shapes are therefore mainly determined by the spatial and temporal regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis rather than by the chemical composition of peptidoglycan. The form of rod-shaped bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli, is generated by the action of two peptidoglycan synthesis machineries that act at the septum and at the lateral wall in processes coordinated by the cytoskeletal proteins FtsZ and MreB, respectively. The tubulin homologue FtsZ is the first protein recruited to the division site, where it assembles in filaments-forming the Z ring-that undergo treadmilling and recruit later divisome proteins. The rate of treadmilling in B. subtilis controls the rates of both peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division. The actin homologue MreB forms discrete patches that move circumferentially around the cell in tracks perpendicular to the long axis of the cell, and organize the insertion of new cell wall during elongation. Cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus possess only one type of peptidoglycan synthesis machinery, which is diverted from the cell periphery to the septum in preparation for division. The molecular cue that coordinates this transition has remained elusive. Here we investigate the localization of S. aureus peptidoglycan biosynthesis proteins and show that the recruitment of the putative lipid II flippase MurJ to the septum, by the DivIB-DivIC-FtsL complex, drives peptidoglycan incorporation to the midcell. MurJ recruitment corresponds to a turning point in cytokinesis, which is slow and dependent on FtsZ treadmilling before MurJ arrival but becomes faster and independent of FtsZ treadmilling after peptidoglycan synthesis activity is directed to the septum, where it provides additional force for cell envelope constriction."
https://openalex.org/W2785829537,"Chronic inflammation increases the risk of developing one of several types of cancer. Inflammatory responses are currently thought to be controlled by mechanisms that rely on transcriptional networks that are distinct from those involved in cell differentiation. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 participates in a wide variety of processes, including cholesterol and glucose metabolism in the liver, resolution of endoplasmic reticulum stress, intestinal glucocorticoid production, pancreatic development and acinar differentiation. In genome-wide association studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the vicinity of NR5A2 have previously been associated with the risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In mice, Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes the pancreas to damage, impairs regeneration and cooperates with mutant Kras in tumour progression. Here, using a global transcriptomic analysis, we describe an epithelial-cell-autonomous basal pre-inflammatory state in the pancreas of Nr5a2+/- mice that is reminiscent of the early stages of pancreatitis-induced inflammation and is conserved in histologically normal human pancreases with reduced expression of NR5A2 mRNA. In Nr5a2+/-mice, NR5A2 undergoes a marked transcriptional switch, relocating from differentiation-specific to inflammatory genes and thereby promoting gene transcription that is dependent on the AP-1 transcription factor. Pancreatic deletion of Jun rescues the pre-inflammatory phenotype, as well as binding of NR5A2 to inflammatory gene promoters and the defective regenerative response to damage. These findings support the notion that, in the pancreas, the transcriptional networks involved in differentiation-specific functions also suppress inflammatory programmes. Under conditions of genetic or environmental constraint, these networks can be subverted to foster inflammation."

Geeson and Cummins now show that phosphoric acid may also be a practical source of such compounds (see the Perspective by Protasiewicz). They isolated and characterized a phosphide salt derived from treatment of dehydrated phosphoric acid with trichlorosilane, a compound already used at the commercial scale to produce high-purity silicon.

Sirtuin family members have been largely studied in the context of aging and aging-associated diseases. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a cytoplasmic protein in the family of sirtuins that are NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylases. In this work, we studied the role of SIRT2 in regulating nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factor and the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Confocal microscopy analysis indicated that SIRT2 is localized in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes and SIRT2 levels are reduced during pathological hypertrophy of the heart. SIRT2-deficient mice develop spontaneous pathological cardiac hypertrophy, remodeling, fibrosis, and dysfunction in an age-dependent manner. Moreover, young SIRT2-deficient mice develop exacerbated agonist-induced hypertrophy. In contrast, SIRT2 overexpression attenuated agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, SIRT2 binds to and deacetylates NFATc2 transcription factor. SIRT2 deficiency stabilizes NFATc2 and enhances nuclear localization of NFATc2, resulting in increased transcription activity.

The term heart failure denotes loss of function of myocardium, which is the culmination of complex remodeling that occurs in the heart, initiated as an adaptive response to pressure overload or cardiac stressors in humans. In the failing myocardium, several functional abnormalities, including disruption of calcium homeostasis, metabolic malfunction, energy deficits, and contractile dysfunction have been recognized (1Liew C.C.

In the hypertrophic myocardium, activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) as a transcription factor plays a key role in the expression of cardiac fetal genes. Roughly 13% of the genes expressed in the human heart have the binding site for NFAT in their promoter region, whereas in advanced stages of heart failure, ∼20–40% of these genes have modified expression (20Putt M.E.

NFATc1–4 are regulated by calcium signaling, whereas NFAT5 is regulated by the hyperosmotic environment of the cell (21Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Kwon H.M. TonEBP transcriptional activator in the cellular response to increased osmolality.Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444 (12194010): 579-58510.1007/s00424-002-0849-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The protein levels and activity of NFAT is up-regulated in age-related diseases and heart failure (22Molkentin J.D. Calcineurin-NFAT signaling regulates the cardiac hypertrophic response in coordination with the MAPKs.Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63 (15276472): 467-47510.1016/j.cardiores.2004.01.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Of note, NFAT transcription factors are involved in pathological, but not physiological, forms of cardiac hypertrophy (23Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Calcineurin/NFAT coupling participates in pathological, but not physiological, cardiac hypertrophy.Circ.

Our results suggest that SIRT2 deficiency induces spontaneous heart failure in mice. SIRT2 deficiency also exacerbates agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy. On the other hand, overexpression of SIRT2 in cardiomyocytes antagonizes the agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy through repression of NFAT. In dividing cells, SIRT2 is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein, but shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm during G2/M transition (24North B.J. Verdin E. Interphase nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and localization of SIRT2 during mitosis.PLoS One. 2007; 2 (17726514): e78410.1371/journal.pone.0000784Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Because cardiomyocytes are postmitotic, we tested the localization of SIRT2 in cardiomyocytes by confocal microscopy. Our results suggest that SIRT2 is mostly cytoplasmic under basal conditions (Fig. 1A). Next, we tested whether SIRT2 localization is influenced by cardiac stressors, as previous reports suggested SIRT1, another sirtuin isoform, localization to be regulated by stress (25Tanno M. Sakamoto J. Miura T. Shimamoto K. Horio Y. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 (17197703): 6823-683210.1074/jbc.M609554200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were treated with phenylephrine (PE), α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, and its localization was tested. We did not see any major changes in the localization of SIRT2 when cells were treated with PE (Fig. 1A). These findings indicate that SIRT2 is a major cytoplasmic protein in cardiomyocytes under basal as well as stressed conditions. To understand the role of SIRT2 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we first tested the levels of SIRT2 in cardiomyocytes treated with PE or isoproterenol (ISO). We found reduced levels of SIRT2 in PE-treated cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A). Similarly, we found markedly low levels of SIRT2 in PE- or ISO-treated cells by Western blotting (Fig. 1, B and C). In the next set of experiments, we tested whether the cardiac hypertrophy is associated with reduced levels of SIRT2. We induced cardiac hypertrophy by chronically infusing the hypertrophic agonist, ISO by implanting osmotic minipumps into the peritoneal cavity of mice (26Sundaresan N.R. Gupta M. Kim G. Rajamohan S.B. Isbatan A. Gupta M.P. Sirt3 blocks the cardiac hypertrophic response by augmenting Foxo3a-dependent antioxidant defense mechanisms in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119 (19652361): 2758-277110.1172/JCI39162Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that chronic ISO infusion significantly increased the heart weight to tibia length (HW/TL) ratio, and contractile dysfunction (Fig. 1, D and E). Further quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis suggested that levels of fetal genes, ANP, and BNP were significantly increased in ISO-infused mice, indicating the development of cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 1F). Next, we analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT2 in the hypertrophied hearts. We found significantly lower levels of SIRT2 mRNA in ISO-infused heart tissues by real-time qPCR analysis (Fig. 1F). Similarly, we found markedly low levels of SIRT2 protein in ISO-infused heart samples by Western blotting (Fig. 1, G and H). In order to measure the SIRT2 levels during the initial stages of the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we analyzed the SIRT2 levels at different time points post–ISO infusion by Western blotting. Western blotting analysis suggested that SIRT2 levels reduced significantly post 2 days ISO infusion and decreased further until the day tested (Fig. 1, I and J). These data indicate that SIRT2 levels decrease during cardiac hypertrophy and its deficiency might be associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To test whether SIRT2 deficiency causes heart failure, we analyzed the cardiac structure and function of C57BL/6 SIRT2-deficient (SIRT2-KO) mice at 2 and 9 months of age. Western blotting analysis confirmed deficiency of SIRT2 in SIRT2-KO mice hearts (Fig. 2A). At 2 months of age, SIRT2-deficient mice showed no obvious cardiac phenotype (Fig. 2, B–E). Interestingly, SIRT2-deficient mice developed cardiac hypertrophy with significantly increased HW/TL ratio, wall thickness, and left ventricular internal diameter at 9 months of age (Fig. 2, B–D). Further, echocardiographic analysis of 9-month-old SIRT2-deficient mice indicated significantly reduced fractional shortening, an indicator of cardiac contractile dysfunction (Fig. 2E). SIRT2-deficient mice hearts exhibited significant down-regulation in the expression of α-MHC and up-regulation of BNP, as measured by real-time qPCR in 9-month-old SIRT2-deficient mice heart (Fig. 2F). Histological analysis indicated a significant increase in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area in SIRT2-deficient mice hearts at 9 months of age (Fig. 2, G and H). In addition, we found prominent interstitial and replacement fibrosis in the heart tissues of SIRT2-deficient mice (Fig. 2, G–I). The expression of fibrosis-associated genes, α-SMA, fibronectin-1, and collagen-1 was also up-regulated in SIRT2-deficient mice heart samples at 9 months of age (Fig. 2J). Collectively, these findings suggest that SIRT2 deficiency leads to spontaneous pathological cardiac hypertrophy, remodeling, fibrosis, and subsequent heart failure. Because SIRT2-deficient mice do not show any obvious cardiac phenotype at 2 months of age, we intended to test whether SIRT2 deficiency exacerbates agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Chronic ISO infusion by implanting osmotic minipumps into the peritoneal cavity of mice resulted in nearly 40% cardiac hypertrophy in SIRT2-KO mice, whereas wildtype mice produced almost 20% cardiac hypertrophy, as assessed by HW/TL ratio and wall thickness (Fig. 3, A and B). In SIRT2-KO mice, fractional shortening was significantly low after treatment with ISO, when compared with controls, suggesting that SIRT2 deficiency markedly impairs cardiac functions following chronic hypertrophic agonist infusion (Fig. 3C). Similarly, fibrosis was found to be significantly high in SIRT2-KO mice hearts as compared with control mice after ISO treatment (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that SIRT2 deficiency exacerbates agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophic response in mice. These findings were consistent with the previous work, where SIRT2 deficiency exacerbated Ang II–induced cardiac hypertrophy (17Tang X. Chen X.F. Wang N.Y. Wang X.M. Liang S.T. Zheng W. Lu Y.B. Zhao X. Hao D.L. Zhang Z.Q. Zou M.H. Liu D.P. Chen H.Z. SIRT2 acts as a cardioprotective deacetylase in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Circulation. 2017; 136 (28947430): 2051-206710.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028728Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because SIRT2-deficient mice lack SIRT2 in all the tissues, the role of SIRT2 on cardiac functions may or may not be directly related to its role in cardiomyocytes. To test whether SIRT2 is involved in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, we performed experiments in cultured murine cardiomyocytes. SIRT2 levels were reduced in cardiomyocytes by transfecting specific siRNA pools and their susceptibility to cardiac hypertrophy was tested. SIRT2 depletion in cardiomyocytes was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, depletion of SIRT2 in cardiomyocytes significantly increased protein synthesis as measured by [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 4B). Similarly, Western blotting analysis suggested that SIRT2-depleted cardiomyocytes exhibited increased expression of ANP at basal as well as PE- or ISO-treated conditions (Fig. 4C). Moreover, SIRT2-depleted cardiomyocytes showed perinuclear localization of ANP and sarcomere reorganization, which are hallmarks of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (26Sundaresan N.R. Gupta M. Kim G. Rajamohan S.B. Isbatan A. Gupta M.P. Sirt3 blocks the cardiac hypertrophic response by augmenting Foxo3a-dependent antioxidant defense mechanisms in mice.J. Clin.

Med. 2012; 18 (23086477): 1643-165010.1038/nm.2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). These findings indicate that SIRT2 depletion causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a cell-autonomous manner. To test whether SIRT2 activation blocks the cardiac hypertrophy, we analyzed the effect of SIRT2 overexpression in PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We infected cardiomyocytes with adenovirus expressing SIRT2 and studied the hypertrophic response to PE or ISO treatment. SIRT2 overexpression in cardiomyocytes was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4E). Cardiomyocytes were treated with PE or ISO for 48 h, and their hypertrophic response was assessed. We found that SIRT2 overexpression attenuates PE as well as ISO-stimulated protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes as measured by [3H]leucine incorporation assay (Fig. 4F). To further validate the results of leucine incorporation assay, we used an alternative nonradioactive technique, which measures global protein synthesis by monitoring the labeling of nascent peptide to puromycin (28Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. SUnSET, a nonradioactive method to monitor protein synthesis.Nat. Meth. 2009; 6 (19305406): 275-27710.1038/nmeth.1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Primary cardiomyocytes were infected with adenovirus-expressing SIRT2 and the basal and PE- or ISO-induced puromycin incorporation was measured by Western blotting using specific antibody against puromycin. Western blot analysis suggested that SIRT2 overexpression attenuates PE- as well as ISO-stimulated protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4, G and H). Further, we noted a marked reduction in PE- or ISO-induced expression and perinuclear localization of ANP, cardiomyocyte size, and sarcomere reorganization in SIRT2 overexpressing cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4, G, I, and J). Collectively, these results indicate that SIRT2 overexpression is sufficient to block agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Previous studies indicate that calcineurin-NFAT signaling regulates the cardiac hypertrophic response. NFAT transcriptionally regulates the expression of fetal genes such as ANP, Myh7, and CARP in cardiomyocytes (29Schulz R.A. Yutzey K.E. Calcineurin signaling and NFAT activation in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development.Dev. Biol. 2004; 266 (14729474): 1-1610.1016/j.ydbio.2003.10.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Because our findings suggest that SIRT2 deficiency spontaneously activates fetal gene program in the heart, we hypothesized that SIRT2 might directly control NFAT signaling in hearts. We performed Western blotting analysis to detect the expression of NFATc2, a major NFAT isoform in heart tissue of 2- and 9-month-old SIRT2-deficient mice. Results suggested that SIRT2-deficient hearts exhibit increased levels of NFATc2 at both age groups (Fig. 5A). To test the endogenous NFAT activity, we quantified the expression of IFN-γ and ADSSL1, which are well-characterized targets of NFAT in the heart (30Wen H.Y. Xia Y. Young M.E. Taegtmeyer H. Kellems R.E. The adenylosuccinate synthetase-1 gene is activated in the hypertrophied heart.J. Cell. Mol.

Our qPCR results suggested that SIRT2-deficient hearts express significantly higher levels of NFAT target genes, suggesting that SIRT2 deficiency hyperactivated NFAT in the heart (Fig. 5B). In hypertrophic hearts, dephosphorylation of NFAT transcription factor by calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, enhances nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of NFAT (23Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Calcineurin/NFAT coupling participates in pathological, but not physiological, cardiac hypertrophy.Circ.

Because our results show increased nuclear localization of NFAT in SIRT2-deficient cardiomyocytes, we expected that SIRT2 might modulate the levels and the activity of calcineurin. Interestingly, we do not find marked changes in the protein levels of calcineurin in SIRT2-deficient mice hearts at 2 months and 9 months of age (Fig. 5A). Further, confocal microscopy analysis suggested similar results (Fig. 5, C and D). Moreover, we do not see any marked changes in the activity of calcineurin in SIRT2-deficient mice hearts (Fig. 5E). These findings suggest that the increased activity of NFATc2 observed in SIRT2-deficient conditions is not associated with hyperactive calcineurin. It is well-accepted that increased calcium concentration activates calcineurin signaling in the heart (32Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. Calcium regulation of calcineurin phosphatase activity by its B subunit and calmodulin. Role of the autoinhibitory domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7814394): 340-34610.1074/jbc.270.1.340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the calcium transients in control and SIRT2-depleted cardiomyocytes by live confocal microscopy. Under basal conditions, we do not find marked differences in calcium transients in wildtype and SIRT2-depleted cardiomyocytes. Similarly, treatment of PE in SIRT2-depleted cardiomyocytes does not change calcium transients (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, cardiomyocytes overexpressing SIRT2 do not show any change in calcium transients at basal and PE-induced conditions (Fig. 5G). These findings suggest that increased nuclear localization of NFAT is not related to calcium transients in SIRT2-deficient cardiomyocytes. NFAT is known to be an acetylated protein, and acetylation of NFATc1 by acetyl transferases p300 and PCAF promotes its stability, and thereby enhances the transcriptional activity of NFATc1 during osteoclast differentiation (33Kim J.H. Kim K. Youn B.U. Jin H.M. Kim J.Y. Moon J.B. Ko A. Seo S.B. Lee K.Y. Kim N. RANKL induces NFATc1 acetylation and stability via histone acetyltransferases during osteoclast differentiation.Biochem. J. 2011; 436 (21413932): 253-26210.1042/BJ20110062Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because SIRT2 is a cytoplasmic deacetylase, and our results suggest increased levels of NFATc2 in SIRT2-deficient mice, we suspected that SIRT2 might regulate the acetylation of NFATc2. To test whether SIRT2 interacts with NFATc2, we immunoprecipitated NFATc2 from heart samples and tested its binding with SIRT2 by Western blotting. Our results suggest that SIRT2 interacts with NFATc2 (Fig. 6A). To test whether SIRT2 deacetylates NFATc2, we performed an in vitro deacetylation assay, where NFATc2 was first acetylated by p300 acetyltransferase. Subsequently, acetylated NFATc2 was incubated with either WT or SIRT2-H187Y, a catalytic mutant of SIRT2. Western blotting analysis indicated WT, but not catalytic mutant-SIRT2 markedly reduced the acetylation status of NFATc2 (Fig. 6B). These findings indicate that SIRT2 is an NFATc2 deacetylase. Because the nuclear localization of NFAT is required for its transcriptional activation, we tested the endogenous localization of NFATc2 in SIRT2-depleted murine cardiomyocytes by confocal microscopy. We found increased nuclear localization of NFATc2 in SIRT2-depleted cardiomyocytes (Fig. 6, C and D). We further validated the effect of SIRT2 on the transcription activity of NFAT by an NFAT-responsive promoter/reporter (NFAT-Luc) assay.

Typically, these pathologies are examined in discrete model systems and with limited temporal resolution, and whether these disorders co-occur is therefore unclear. To address this question, here we examined multiple physiological systems in male C57BL/6J mice following prolonged exposure to a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD). HFHSD-fed mice rapidly exhibited metabolic alterations, including obesity, hyperleptinemia, physical inactivity, glucose intolerance, peripheral insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia, ectopic lipid deposition, and bone deterioration. Prolonged exposure to HFHSD resulted in morbid obesity, ectopic triglyceride deposition in liver and muscle, extensive bone loss, sarcopenia, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired short-term memory. Although many of these defects are typically associated with aging, HFHSD did not alter telomere length in white blood cells, indicating that this diet did not generally promote all aspects of aging. Strikingly, glucose homeostasis was highly dynamic. Glucose intolerance was evident in HFHSD-fed mice after 1 week and was maintained for 24 weeks. Beyond 24 weeks, however, glucose tolerance improved in HFHSD-fed mice, and by 60 weeks, it was indistinguishable from that of chow-fed mice. This improvement coincided with adaptive β-cell hyperplasia and hyperinsulinemia, without changes in insulin sensitivity in muscle or adipose tissue. Assessment of insulin secretion in isolated islets revealed that leptin, which inhibited insulin secretion in the chow-fed mice, potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the HFHSD-fed mice after 60 weeks. Overall, the excessive calorie intake was accompanied by deteriorating function of numerous physiological systems.

Overall, the excessive calorie intake was accompanied by deteriorating function of numerous physiological systems. Excessive consumption of calories is associated with deterioration of a range of physiological systems. Although the impact of specific macronutrients per se on health is highly debated, it is clear that diets enriched in sugar and fat result in obesity. It is widely recognized that obesity is a major risk factor for numerous diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and at least nine types of cancer (1Reaven G. The metabolic syndrome or the insulin resistance syndrome? Different names, different concepts, and different goals.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin.

Hence, the epidemic of obesity spreading throughout the world represents one of the major challenges for future human health. Extensive studies in rodent models have shown that exposure to diets that resemble those commonly consumed by humans in modernized societies leads to a marked deterioration in a range of metabolic systems (2Buettner R. Schölmerich J. Bollheimer L.C.

Presumably due to enhanced palatability and/or different macronutrient compositions (i.e. protein, carbohydrate, and fat ratios) (3Solon-Biet S.M. McMahon A.C. Ballard J.W. Ruohonen K. Wu L.E.

This transition is associated with a rapid decline in whole-body insulin sensitivity (4Kahn S.E. Hull R.L. Utzschneider K.M.

Numerous laboratories have recapitulated these findings, and such diet-induced obesity models are widely used to study numerous facets of metabolic homeostasis and disease.

However, most studies involve analysis of one physiological system in isolation often with limited time resolution. Hence, there is a need for a temporal systematic analysis of multiple physiological parameters in one or more of these diet-induced obesity models to fully realize the overall impact of obesity on health as well as the temporal relationship between impairments in distinct tissues. In this study, we performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of the impact of HFHSD on a range of physiological systems in male C57BL/6J mice. We observed a time-resolved deterioration in the function of a multitude of physiological systems as mice became obese, including torpor, sarcopenia, bone loss, neurological dysfunction, as well as a range of metabolic disorders, including hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. Many of these effects emerged in a time-dependent manner, either occurring rapidly, such as bone loss, or more slowly, such as impaired short-term memory. The most complex set of adaptations was observed in glucose tolerance. HFHSD-fed mice displayed rapid glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. These changes persisted almost unchanged for 24 weeks after which glucose intolerance, but not insulin resistance, gradually improved and was ultimately resolved. This improvement was concomitant with increased β-cell mass and augmented circulating insulin concentrations. Leptin, which has previously been shown to suppress glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets, had the opposite effect in islets isolated from mice fed a HFHSD for 60 weeks, suggesting that islet responses to leptin are dependent on dietary context, and under these conditions leptin may promote insulin secretion in vivo. Our analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the temporal adaptations to excess calorie intake in a host of physiological systems, highlights the pervasive effects of diet in multiple tissues, and lays the groundwork for further studies into the interaction between diet and health. To dissect the temporal dynamics of metabolic, skeletal, and neurological responses to diet, we assessed indices of health in these systems in mice fed a control chow diet or HFHSD for 60 weeks as a model of diet-induced obesity. At 60 weeks, HFHSD-fed mice consumed ∼34% more energy per day (3.1 kcal/g for chow; 4.7 kcal/g for HFHSD) (Fig. 1, A and B) indicating that increased calorie intake in mice fed HFHSD was maintained throughout the feeding period. As expected, chow-fed mice consistently displayed a higher respiratory exchange ratio (RER), indicating predominant use of carbohydrates in both the light and dark cycles at all time points studied (Fig. 1C). RERs were lower in HFHSD-fed mice and were lowered further with increasing time on the diet. This implies both an initial switch to fat as the major energy source and continued adaptation to further increase fat use (Fig. 1C). We also observed a significant reduction in the activity of mice fed HFHSD after only 6 weeks, and this was maintained for the duration of the HFHSD feeding (Fig. 1D). Hence, HFHSD-fed mice consumed additional calories and were less physically active, placing these animals in a state of positive energy balance. Not surprisingly, the positive energy balance observed in HFHSD-fed mice resulted in gradual and profound increases in body mass (Fig. 1E) and obesity. Adiposity was not changed in chow-fed mice over the course of 60 weeks, but it rapidly increased in HFHSD-fed mice, plateauing after 40 weeks (Fig. 1F). We also measured distinct temporal patterns of ectopic triglyceride deposition in liver, quadriceps muscle, and heart (Fig. 1G). Triglycerides were elevated in quadriceps after 6 weeks of HFHSD feeding, and this was sustained for 60 weeks. In contrast, increased levels of triglycerides were only observed in liver at 24 weeks and in heart at 60 weeks (Fig. 1G). The major increase in triglyceride in muscle and liver was measured at 24 weeks of HFHSD and was concomitant with the plateau in adiposity (Fig. 1F), suggesting a link between adipose storage capacity or maximum adiposity and ectopic lipid deposition. Lean mass was not different between diet groups across the time course (Fig. 1H), while after 24 weeks of exposure to the diets, HFHSD-fed mice, but not chow-fed mice, displayed a 15% decline in mass of some specific muscles indicative of accelerated sarcopenia at these sites (Fig. 1I). Overall, mice fed a HFHSD displayed increased caloric intake, lower physical activity, and increased adiposity and body mass, providing a good model for the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity in humans. We next examined the temporal changes in a range of physiological systems in the HFHSD-fed mice as diet has been reported to have pervasive effects on health. For example, individuals with insulin resistance or diabetes have a higher incidence of bone fracture (14Devlin M.J. Van Vliet M. Motyl K. Karim L. Brooks D.J. Louis L. Conlon C. Rosen C.J. Bouxsein M.L.

Therefore, we next tested how HFHSD acutely and chronically influenced skeletal and neurological health. Aging is associated with several bone diseases. Consistent with this, chow-fed mice displayed an age-related decline in bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) between 24 and 60 weeks of the study (Fig. 2, A and B). This loss was exacerbated at 24 and 60 weeks in HFHSD-fed mice (Fig. 2, A and B). These differences were not related to changes in bone area or femur length (Fig. 2, C and D). We next assessed the microstructure of the distal femoral metaphysis by μCT scanning. Trabecular bone volume (Fig. 2, E and M–R) and trabecular number (Fig. 2, F and M–R) decreased with age in both chow- and HFHSD-fed mice. In addition, by 6 weeks HFHSD-fed mice had 33% less trabecular bone volume (Fig. 2E) and a 25% less trabecular number compared with age-matched chow-fed mice (Fig. 2F). Consistent with these observations, trabecular separation increased with age and was significantly greater in HFHSD-fed mice (Fig. 2G). Age had no effect on trabecular thickness in chow-fed mice (Fig. 2H), but trabecular thickness was increased at 24 weeks in HFHSD-fed mice but returned to baseline levels after 60 weeks (Fig. 2H). In addition, we detected age-related changes in cortical bone volume (Fig. 2I) and thickness (Fig. 2J), periosteal (Fig. 2K) and endosteal perimeters (Fig. 2L), and bone strength (polar moment of inertia) (Fig. 2S), but these parameters were not affected by diet, despite markedly greater weight in HFHSD-fed mice (Fig. 1E). Together, these data show that HFHSD feeding has a rapid and profound effect on bone microstructure without significant effects on cortical bone or bone strength. Specifically, HFHSD feeding appeared to worsen the age-related decline in trabecular bone, BMC, and BMD. Because obesity exacerbated the age-dependent decline in bone microarchitecture, we next tested whether HFHSD-fed mice exhibited signs of increased biological age per se. To do this, we assessed telomere length in white blood cells. As expected, telomere length decreased with age (Fig. 2T), but this decline was unaffected by diet. This suggests that HFHSD did not generally promote all aspects of aging and that the association found between obesity and age-related loss in bone quality is rather due to specific effects on bone. To assess brain health and cognitive function, we first assessed molecular markers of neurodegenerative disease susceptibility. Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative diseases are strongly associated with the formation of fibrillary plaques in the brain. The major components of these plaques are forms of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), Aβ40 and Aβ42, that are generated by proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. Hippocampal Aβ42 content was not changed by age or diet (Fig. 3A), but HFHSD-fed mice exhibited lower levels of the protective Aβ40 after 60 weeks compared with age-matched chow-fed controls (Fig. 3B). Despite lower Aβ40 content, we detected no difference in the Aβ-40/42 ratio between diets, although the Aβ-40/42 ratio decreased with age when both diet groups were considered together (Fig. 3C). Neurodegenerative diseases result in behavioral alterations, including depression, anxiety, and loss of short-term memory (17Ashe K.H. Learning and memory in transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease.Learn. Mem. 2001; 8 (11773429): 301-30810.1101/lm.43701Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Ballard C. Walker M. Neuropsychiatric aspects of Alzheimer's disease.Curr. Psychiatry Rep. 1999; 1 (11122905): 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We next tested whether HFHSD impaired locomotion, anxiety, or short-term memory. We first performed an Open Field Test as a measure of general activity and observed that diet had no impact on total distance traveled (Fig. 3D) or anxiety, as determined by the time spent in the center of the apparatus (Fig. 3E). Similar results were obtained when the mice were placed in an Elevated Plus Maze, a more specific test for anxiety (Fig. 3F). The Y-Maze Test assesses short term working memory by measuring spontaneous alternation within the maze. No difference was observed in the total number of arm entries between chow- and HFHSD-fed mice (Fig. 3G) suggesting that all mice had the same level of motivation, curiosity, and motor function. However, the percentage of alternations was lower in HFHSD-fed mice, indicative of a short-term working memory deficit (Fig. 3H). These data indicate that long-term HFHSD feeding impaired short-term memory in mice concomitant with a decrease in the protective Aβ40 peptide in the brain. To assess the impact of HFHSD feeding on glucose metabolism, we monitored fed and fasting glucose concentrations and glucose tolerance periodically throughout the 60-week dietary intervention. Post-prandial blood glucose concentrations did not differ between the diet groups across the 60-week time course (Fig. 4A), but fasting blood glucose concentrations were elevated in HFHSD-fed mice from 8 to 52 weeks, after which they returned to chow levels (Fig. 4B). As expected, glucose intolerance was evident in HFHSD-fed mice after 1 week on the diet (Fig. 4C). This same degree of glucose intolerance was maintained for 24 weeks (Fig. 4, C and D). Surprisingly, mice fed a HFHSD for more prolonged periods (40–60 weeks) had marked improvements in glucose tolerance compared with those fed the diet for 1–32 weeks when accounting for differences in basal glucose (Fig. 4, C and D). Over the 60-week time course, chow-fed mice did not exhibit changes in fasting or fed glucose levels or glucose tolerance (Fig. 4, A–D). To examine whether improved glucose tolerance in HFHSD-fed mice was associated with improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, we next measured insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake into white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle ex vivo. Insulin-dependent 2-deoxyglucose uptake was significantly reduced in both adipose tissue and muscles from HFHSD-fed mice after 6 weeks of feeding, and both tissues remained similarly insulin-resistant for the duration of the time course (Fig. 4, E and F). This is in line with the decreased RER (Fig. 1C) we observed in mice fed HFHSD, which may be attributed to preferential use of fatty acid over glucose for energy. Therefore, the improved glucose tolerance observed at 60 weeks of HFHSD did not correspond to improved insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. To further investigate possible mechanisms behind long-term improvements in glucose tolerance in HFHSD-fed mice, we assessed the circulating concentrations of key metabolic hormones. As expected, leptin concentrations correlated with adiposity and were already increased after only 6 weeks of HFHSD feeding (Fig. 5A). Similarly, GIP was elevated in HFHSD-fed mice at all time points (Fig. 5D), whereas interleukin-6 (IL6) was increased only after 60 weeks, and resistin levels were not significantly altered (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, HFHSD feeding affected most of these selected metabolic hormones, and the rise in GIP, a known incretin, is of interest given its role in enhancing insulin secretion and β-cell proliferation. Indeed, longitudinal analysis of circulating insulin levels over 60 weeks of HFHSD feeding revealed increased fasting and postprandial insulin levels starting from 12 weeks and plateauing at 40 weeks (Fig. 5, E and F). These time points correspond with the onset of improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 4, C and D), implying that compensatory β-cell-enhanced responsiveness may contribute to normalization of glucose tolerance. Increased circulating insulin can be driven by decreased insulin clearance, increased insulin secretion per β-cell, and/or increased β-cell mass. Insulin clearance, as measured by the C-peptide to insulin ratio, was not affected in HFHSD-fed mice after 60 weeks of feeding (Fig. 5, G–I). Therefore, we next examined how HFHSD feeding influenced pancreatic morphology and islet number (Fig. 6A). Pancreas mass was decreased by ∼33% at 60 weeks of HFHSD feeding (Fig. 6B), and the pancreas area showed a similar trend (Fig. 6C). Despite decreased pancreas mass (Fig. 6B), the total number of islets remained constant (Fig. 6D). Given the increase in average islet area (Fig. 6, E and F), this suggests an increase in total β-cell mass. This was associated with a transient increase in Ki67-positive cells at 24 weeks (Fig. 6G), suggesting that the increase in β-cell mass was likely driven by increased β-cell proliferation. Therefore, increased β-cell mass likely contributes to the progressive hyperinsulinemia observed in mice fed the HFHSD. Analysis of insulin secretion during an i.p. GTT revealed greater insulin secretion in HFHSD-fed mice at 60 weeks (Figs. 5G and 7A). Therefore, we next investigated β-cell function by examining glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in islets from chow-fed and HFHSD-fed mice (Fig. 7, B–D). We observed hypersecretion of insulin at 2 mm glucose and a reduced secretory response at 20 mm glucose in HFHSD-fed mice after 6–12 weeks on the diet. As the mice progressed on the HFHSD (>18 weeks), the secretory response normalized, such that by 60 weeks, islets from mice fed HFHSD responded similarly to chow-fed controls (Fig. 7, C and D). These data show that although HFHSD feeding induced an acute defect in GSIS, this was overcome at longer time points. Despite restored GSIS at longer HFHSD time points, these data from isolated islets do not support a sole role for an increased β-cell response to glucose in contributing to the progressive hyperinsulinemia in HFHSD-fed mice. Rather, they point to a role for increased β-cell mass and/or exposure to circulating factors such as GIP in augmenting circulating insulin concentrations. Our histochemical analysis revealed a pronounced proliferation of adipocytes in pancreata from HFHSD-fed mice (Fig. 6H). This reached a maximum at 24 weeks with adipocytes making up 5% of the total pancreas volume, and in some cases, islets were completely surrounded by adipocytes with no apparent cell-to-cell contact with acinar tissue (Fig. 6A, lower panel, right inset). Based on this observation and the fact the time course of this change coincided with the emergence of improved glucose tolerance in HFHSD mice, we surmised that the adaptive hyperinsulinemia may be due to a paracrine effect from local release of adipokines from pancreas-associated adipocytes. Based upon our profiling of circulating factors, the most likely candidate for this effect was leptin (Fig. 5A). Thus, we next examined the effect of leptin on GSIS in vitro. Consistent with the literature (19Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F.

Strikingly, leptin had no effect on GSIS in islets from HFHSD-fed mice for up to 32 weeks of feeding (Fig. 7E), indicative of leptin resistance, whereas leptin potentiated GSIS in mice fed a HFHSD for 60 weeks (Fig. 7E). Collectively, these data reveal a major effect of leptin to potentiate insulin secretion in the context of long-term calorie excess. This study provides a systematic insight into the effects of calorie excess on health. Marked deterioration of every physiological system examined was observed spanning skeletal muscle, liver, bone, brain, adipose tissue, and pancreas. Exposure of C57BL/6J mice to a HFHSD resulted in excess intake of calories, torpor, sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, lipid accumulation in muscle, pancreas, and heart tissue, pre-diabetes, bone loss, and impaired neurological function. These findings represent some of the major diseases observed in aging humans, and so this extends previous studies to show that overconsumption of calories alone is a major risk factor for numerous diseases. The temporal onset of these disorders varied considerably in the mouse, and certain systems exhibited a complex dynamic adaptive response. This was most notable for the gluco-insular axis whereby animals rapidly developed glucose intolerance that was ultimately resolved in concert with adaptive hyperinsulinemia. The latter was partly due to β-cell hyperplasia as well as a novel stimulatory effect of leptin on insulin secretion. Given that these mice also displayed hyperleptinemia, it is conceivable that this leptin “switch” plays a role in β-cell compensation under these conditions. It is noteworthy that aging to 60 weeks had limited effect on the metabolic indices measured in chow-fed control mice. This is despite the presence of a truncation mutation in the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase gene (22Toye A.A. Lippiat J.D. Proks P. Shimomura K. Bentley L. Hugill A. Mijat V. Goldsworthy M.

We provide here the first phenotypic and biochemical evidence for the role of Alx, a member of the TerC family, in manganese homeostasis. It does not appear to export manganese, but rather it intriguingly facilitates an increase in intracellular manganese concentration. These findings expand the available knowledge about the identity and mechanisms of manganese homeostasis proteins across bacteria and show that proximity to a Mn-responsive riboswitch can be used to identify new components of the manganese homeostasis machinery."

The mechanism(s) underlying the anti-inflammatory effects associated with FABP5 inhibition is poorly understood. Herein, we identify a novel mechanism through which FABP5 modulates inflammation. In mice, intraplantar injection of carrageenan induces acute inflammation that is accompanied by edema, enhanced pain sensitivity, and elevations in proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Inhibition of FABP5 reduced pain, edema, cytokine, and PGE2 levels. PGE2 is a major eicosanoid that enhances pain in the setting of inflammation, and we focused on the mechanism(s) through which FABP5 modulates PGE2 production. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGES-1) are enzymes up-regulated at the site of inflammation and account for the bulk of PGE2 biosynthesis. Pharmacological or genetic FABP5 inhibition suppressed the induction of mPGES-1 but not COX-2 in carrageenan-injected paws, which occurred predominantly in macrophages. The cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) is a major inducer of mPGES-1 during inflammation. Using A549 cells that express FABP5, IL-1β stimulation up-regulated mPGES-1 expression, and mPGES-1 induction was attenuated in A549 cells bearing a knockdown of FABP5. IL-1β up-regulates mPGES-1 via NF-κB, which activates the mPGES-1 promoter. Knockdown of FABP5 reduced the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB and attenuated mPGES-1 promoter activity. Deletion of NF-κB–binding sites within the mPGES-1 promoter abrogated the ability of FABP5 to inhibit mPGES-1 promoter activation.

https://openalex.org/W2785618570,"Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) promotes glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion and also plays a key role in glioblastoma resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Non-ionizing photodynamic therapy (PDT) has anti-tumor advantages over conventional glioblastoma therapies. Our previous studies revealed that glioblastoma U87 cells up-regulate iNOS after a photodynamic challenge and that the resulting NO not only increases resistance to apoptosis but renders surviving cells more proliferative and invasive. These findings were largely based on the effects of inhibiting iNOS activity and scavenging NO. Demonstrating now that iNOS expression in photostressed U87 cells is mediated by NF-κB, we hypothesized that (i) recognition of acetylated lysine (acK) on NF-κB p65/RelA by bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein Brd4 is crucial; and (ii) by suppressing iNOS expression, a BET inhibitor (JQ1) would attenuate the negative effects of photostress. The following evidence was obtained. (i) Like iNOS, Brd4 protein and p65-acK levels increased severalfold in photostressed cells. (ii) JQ1 at minimally toxic concentrations had no effect on Brd4 or p65-acK up-regulation after PDT but strongly suppressed iNOS, survivin, and Bcl-xL up-regulation, along with the growth and invasion spurt of PDT-surviving cells. (iii) JQ1 inhibition of NO production in photostressed cells closely paralleled that of growth/invasion inhibition. (iv) Finally, at 1% the concentration of iNOS inhibitor 1400W, JQ1 reduced post-PDT cell aggressiveness to a far greater extent. This is the first evidence for BET inhibitor targeting of iNOS expression in cancer cells and how such targeting can markedly improve therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2790838726,"Peroxiredoxin Q (PrxQ) that belonged to the cysteine-based peroxidases has long been identified in numerous bacteria, but the information on the physiological and biochemical functions of PrxQ remain largely lacking in Corynebacterium glutamicum. To better systematically understand PrxQ, we reported that PrxQ from model and important industrial organism C. glutamicum, encoded by the gene ncgl2403 annotated as a putative PrxQ, played important roles in adverse stress resistance. The lack of C. glutamicum prxQ gene resulted in enhanced cell sensitivity, increased ROS accumulation, and elevated protein carbonylation levels under adverse stress conditions. Accordingly, PrxQ-mediated resistance to adverse stresses mainly relied on the degradation of ROS. The physiological roles of PrxQ in resistance to adverse stresses were corroborated by its induced expression under adverse stresses, regulated directly by the stress-responsive ECF-sigma factor SigH. Through catalytical kinetic activity, heterodimer formation, and bacterial two-hybrid analysis, we proved that C. glutamicum PrxQ catalytically eliminated peroxides by exclusively receiving electrons from thioredoxin (Trx)/thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) system and had a broad range of oxidizing substrates, but a better efficiency for peroxynitrite and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the conserved Cys49 and Cys54 are the peroxide oxidation site and the resolving Cys residue, respectively. It was also discovered that C. glutamicum PrxQ mainly existed in monomer whether under its native state or functional state. Based on these results, a catalytic model of PrxQ is being proposed. Moreover, our result that C. glutamicum PrxQ can prevent the damaging effects of adverse stresses by acting as thioredoxin-dependent monomeric peroxidase could be further applied to improve the survival ability and robustness of the important bacterium during fermentation process."
https://openalex.org/W2786436455,"Thyroglobulin (TG) is the most abundant thyroid gland protein, a dimeric iodoglycoprotein (660 kDa). TG serves as the protein precursor in the synthesis of thyroid hormones tetraiodothyronine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The primary site for T3 synthesis in TG involves an iodotyrosine acceptor at the antepenultimate Tyr residue (at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein). The carboxyl-terminal region of TG comprises a ch olin e sterase- l ike (ChEL) domain followed by a short unique tail sequence. Despite many studies, the monoiodotyrosine donor residue needed for the coupling reaction to create T3 at this evolutionarily conserved site remains unidentified. In this report, we have utilized a novel, convenient immunoblotting assay to detect T3 formation after protein iodination in vitro, enabling the study of T3 formation in recombinant TG secreted from thyrocytes or heterologous cells. With this assay, we confirm the antepenultimate residue of TG as a major T3-forming site, but also demonstrate that the side chain of this residue intimately interacts with the same residue in the apposed monomer of the TG dimer. T3 formation in TG, or the isolated carboxyl-terminal region, is inhibited by mutation of this antepenultimate residue, but we describe the first substitution mutation that actually increases T3 hormonogenesis by engineering a novel cysteine, 10 residues upstream of the antepenultimate residue, allowing for covalent association of the unique tail sequences, and that helps to bring residues Tyr2744 from apposed monomers into closer proximity."
https://openalex.org/W2794111349,"Increasing evidence indicates that altered reelin signaling could contribute to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that reelin protein and mRNA levels were increased in the AD brain (particularly at advanced Braak stages in apolipoprotein E4 noncarriers), compared with that of control subjects. The β-amyloid (Aβ) protein impairs reelin activity and increases reelin expression through a mechanism that is not yet understood. To explore that mechanism, we examined the effect of Aβ aa 1–42 (Aβ42) on DNA methylation of the RELN promoter and the processing of reelin receptor apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells because ApoER2 C-terminal fragments (CTFs), generated after reelin binding, regulate reelin expression. We found that Aβ42 decreased nuclear levels of DNA-methyltransferase 1. However, RELN promoter methylation did not change in Aβ42- treated cells or in AD brain extracts. Instead, the levels of ApoER2-CTF appeared significantly lower in Aβ42-treated cells and in AD extracts from advanced Braak stages of apolipoprotein E4 noncarriers. Our data show that ApoER2- CTF levels are decreased, whereas reelin expression is increased in AD brain at advanced Braak stages and after Aβ treatment, supporting the view that ApoER2-CTF exerts a modulatory role on reelin expression.—Mata-Balaguer, T., Cuchillo-Ibañez, I., Calero, M., Ferrer, I., Sáez-Valero, J.

https://openalex.org/W2788997796,"Boar taint is an offensive odour and/or taste from a proportion of non-castrated male pigs caused by skatole and androstenone accumulation during sexual maturity. Castration is widely used to avoid boar taint but is currently under debate because of animal welfare concerns. This study aimed to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with potential effects on boar taint compounds to improve breeding possibilities for reduced boar taint. Danish Landrace male boars with low, medium and high genetic merit for skatole and human nose score (HNS) were slaughtered at ~100 kg. Gene expression profiles were obtained by RNA-Seq, and genotype data were obtained by an Illumina 60K Porcine SNP chip. Following quality control and filtering, 10,545 and 12,731 genes from liver and testis were included in the eQTL analysis, together with 20,827 SNP variants. A total of 205 and 109 single-tissue eQTLs associated with 102 and 58 unique genes were identified in liver and testis, respectively. By employing a multivariate Bayesian hierarchical model, 26 eQTLs were identified as significant multi-tissue eQTLs. The highest densities of eQTLs were found on pig chromosomes SSC12, SSC1, SSC13, SSC9 and SSC14. Functional characterisation of eQTLs revealed functions within regulation of androgen and the intracellular steroid hormone receptor signalling pathway and of xenobiotic metabolism by cytochrome P450 system and cellular response to oestradiol. A QTL enrichment test revealed 89 QTL traits curated by the Animal Genome PigQTL database to be significantly overlapped by the genomic coordinates of cis-acting eQTLs. Finally, a subset of 35 cis-acting eQTLs overlapped with known boar taint QTL traits. These eQTLs could be useful in the development of a DNA test for boar taint but careful monitoring of other overlapping QTL traits should be performed to avoid any negative consequences of selection."
https://openalex.org/W2794420547,"The globotriaosylceramide Gb3 is a glycosphingolipid expressed on a subpopulation of germinal center B lymphocytes which has been recognized as the B cell differentiation antigen CD77. Among tumoral cell types, Gb3/CD77 is strongly expressed in Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) cells as well as other solid tumors including breast, testicular and ovarian carcinomas. One known ligand of Gb3/CD77 is Verotoxin-1 (VT-1), a Shiga toxin produced in specific E. coli strains. Previously, we have reported that in BL cells, VT-1 induces apoptosis via a caspase-dependent and mitochondria-dependent pathway. Yet, the respective roles of various apoptogenic factors remained to be deciphered. Here, this apoptotic pathway was found to require cleavage of the BID protein by caspase-8 as well as activation of two other apoptogenic proteins, BAK and BAX. Surprisingly however, t-BID, the truncated form of BID resulting from caspase-8 cleavage, played no role in the conformational changes of BAK and BAX. Rather, their activation occurred under the control of full length BID (FL-BID). Indeed, introducing a non-cleavable form of BID (BID-D59A) into BID-deficient BL cells restored BAK and BAX activation following VT-1 treatment. Still, t-BID was involved along with FL-BID in the BAK-dependent and BAX-dependent cytosolic release of CYT C and SMAC/DIABLO from the mitochondrial intermembrane space: FL-BID was found to control the homo-oligomerization of both BAK and BAX, likely contributing to the initial release of CYT C and SMAC/DIABLO, while t-BID was needed for their hetero-oligomerization and ensuing release amplification. Together, our results reveal a functional cooperation between BAK and BAX during VT-1-induced apoptosis and, unexpectedly, that activation of caspase-8 and production of t-BID were not mandatory for initiation of the cell death process."

Syk activation induced by genomic rearrangement has been linked to certain T-cell lymphomas, and Syk inhibitors have been shown to prolong survival of patients with B-cell lineage malignancies. Syk is activated either by its interaction with a double-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (pITAM), which induces rearrangements in the Syk structure, or by the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues. In addition to its immunoreceptor function, Syk is activated downstream of integrin pathways, and integrins bind to the same region in Syk as does pITAM. However, it is unknown whether integrins and pITAM use the same mechanism to activate Syk. Here, using purified Syk protein and fluorescence-based enzyme assay we investigated whether interaction of the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain with the Syk regulatory domain causes changes in Syk activity similar to those induced by pITAM peptides. We observed no direct Syk activation by soluble integrin peptide, and integrin did not compete with pITAM-induced activation even though at high concentrations, the integrin cytoplasmic domain peptide competed with Syk’s substrate. However, clustered integrin peptides induced Syk activation, presumably via a transphosphorylation mechanism. Moreover, the clustered integrins also activated a Syk variant in which tyrosines were replaced with phenylalanine (Y348F/Y352F), indicating that clustered integrin–induced Syk activation involved other phosphorylation sites.

https://openalex.org/W2791119718,"Purpose To evaluate whether, and to which extent, experienced radiologists are able to visually correctly differentiate transient from persistent subsolid nodules from a single CT examination alone and to determine CT morphological features to make this differentiation. Materials and methods We selected 86 transient and 135 persistent subsolid nodules from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) database. Four experienced radiologists visually assessed a predefined list of morphological features and gave a final judgment on a continuous scale (0–100). To assess observer performance, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated. Statistical differences of morphological features between transient and persistent lesions were calculated using Chi-square. Inter-observer agreement of morphological features was evaluated by percentage agreement. Results Forty-nine lesions were excluded by at least 2 observers, leaving 172 lesions for analysis. On average observers were able to differentiate transient from persistent subsolid nodules ≥ 10 mm with an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67–0.82). Nodule type, lesion margin, presence of a well-defined border, and pleural retraction showed significant differences between transient and persistent lesions in two observers. Average pair-wise percentage agreement for these features was 81%, 64%, 47% and 89% respectively. Agreement for other morphological features varied from 53% to 95%. Conclusion The visual capacity of experienced radiologists to differentiate persistent and transient subsolid nodules is moderate in subsolid nodules larger than 10 mm. Performance of the visual assessment of CT morphology alone is not sufficient to generally abandon a short-term follow-up for subsolid nodules."
