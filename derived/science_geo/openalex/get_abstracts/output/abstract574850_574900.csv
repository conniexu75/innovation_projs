https://openalex.org/W2560234750,"Changes in gamma oscillations (20–50 Hz) have been observed in several neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)1–40 and Aβ 1–42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Aβ. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer’s-disease-associated pathology. Mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline; driving neurons to oscillate at gamma frequency (40 Hz) reduces levels of amyloid-β peptides. Disrupted gamma rhythms—oscillations in the brain's neuronal circuits at around 20–50 Hz—are hallmarks of various neurological disorders and have been seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease and specific mouse models of the disease. Li-Huei Tsai and colleagues show that gamma oscillations are also disrupted in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and find reduced gamma prior to plaque formation and cognitive decline. Remarkably, by training neurons to oscillate at gamma frequency (40 Hz) in multiple mouse models including APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, amyloid-β peptide levels could be reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2560722699,"CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is one of 19 members of the chemokine receptor subfamily of human class A G-protein-coupled receptors. CCR2 is expressed on monocytes, immature dendritic cells, and T-cell subpopulations, and mediates their migration towards endogenous CC chemokine ligands such as CCL2 (ref. 1). CCR2 and its ligands are implicated in numerous inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases including atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, neuropathic pain, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as cancer. These disease associations have motivated numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials (see http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) in search of therapies that target the CCR2-chemokine axis. To aid drug discovery efforts, here we solve a structure of CCR2 in a ternary complex with an orthosteric (BMS-681 (ref. 6)) and allosteric (CCR2-RA-[R]) antagonist. BMS-681 inhibits chemokine binding by occupying the orthosteric pocket of the receptor in a previously unseen binding mode. CCR2-RA-[R] binds in a novel, highly druggable pocket that is the most intracellular allosteric site observed in class A G-protein-coupled receptors so far; this site spatially overlaps the G-protein-binding site in homologous receptors. CCR2-RA-[R] inhibits CCR2 non-competitively by blocking activation-associated conformational changes and formation of the G-protein-binding interface. The conformational signature of the conserved microswitch residues observed in double-antagonist-bound CCR2 resembles the most inactive G-protein-coupled receptor structures solved so far. Like other protein-protein interactions, receptor-chemokine complexes are considered challenging therapeutic targets for small molecules, and the present structure suggests diverse pocket epitopes that can be exploited to overcome obstacles in drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2560581185,"The concept of randomness plays an important part in many disciplines. On the one hand, the question of whether random processes exist is fundamental for our understanding of nature. On the other, randomness is a resource for cryptography, algorithms and simulations. Standard methods for generating randomness rely on assumptions about the devices that are often not valid in practice. However, quantum technologies enable new methods for generating certified randomness, based on the violation of Bell inequalities. These methods are referred to as device-independent because they do not rely on any modelling of the devices. Here we review efforts to design device-independent randomness generators and the associated challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2560790409,"A central hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques chiefly consisting of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the brain interstitium. Aβ largely exists in two isoforms, 40 and 42 amino acids long, but a large body of evidence points to Aβ(1-42) rather than Aβ(1-40) as the cytotoxic form. One proposed mechanism by which Aβ exerts toxicity is the formation of ion channel pores that disrupt intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. However, previous studies using membrane mimetics have not identified any notable difference in the channel forming properties between Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42). Here, we tested whether a more physiological environment, membranes excised from HEK293 cells of neuronal origin, would reveal differences in the relative channel forming ability of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of both Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42). Aβ preparations were characterized with transmission electron microscopy and thioflavin T fluorescence. Aβ was then exposed to the extracellular face of excised membranes, and transmembrane currents were monitored using patch clamp. Our data indicated that Aβ(1-42) assemblies in oligomeric preparations form voltage-independent, non-selective ion channels. In contrast, Aβ(1-40) oligomers, fibers, and monomers did not form channels. Ion channel conductance results suggested that Aβ(1-42) oligomers, but not monomers and fibers, formed three distinct pore structures with 1.7-, 2.1-, and 2.4-nm pore diameters. Our findings demonstrate that only Aβ(1-42) contains unique structural features that facilitate membrane insertion and channel formation, now aligning ion channel formation with the differential neurotoxic effect of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2560303620,"Endogenous viral elements found in a marine protozoan have a function in defence against infection by giant viruses. Matthias Fischer and Thomas Hackl show here that endogenous viral elements found in a marine protozoan have a function in defence against infection by giant viruses. Virophages are a recently discovered group of DNA viruses that are obligate parasites of protist-infecting giant DNA viruses such as mimivirus. Fischer and Hackl find mavirus, a virophage sharing an evolutionary origin with a class of self-synthesizing DNA transposons called Maverick/Polinton elements, integrates into the genome of the marine protozoan Cafeteria roenbergensis. Superinfection of the protozoan in vitro with the giant virus Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV) induces the production of infectious mavirus particles, which are released upon host cell lysis and can then suppress CroV replication in other CroV-infected flagellate populations. Endogenous viral elements are increasingly found in eukaryotic genomes1, yet little is known about their origins, dynamics, or function. Here we provide a compelling example of a DNA virus that readily integrates into a eukaryotic genome where it acts as an inducible antiviral defence system. We found that the virophage mavirus2, a parasite of the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV)3, integrates at multiple sites within the nuclear genome of the marine protozoan Cafeteria roenbergensis4. The endogenous mavirus is structurally and genetically similar to eukaryotic DNA transposons and endogenous viruses of the Maverick/Polinton family5,6,7. Provirophage genes are not constitutively expressed, but are specifically activated by superinfection with CroV, which induces the production of infectious mavirus particles. Virophages can inhibit the replication of mimivirus-like giant viruses and an anti-viral protective effect of provirophages on their hosts has been hypothesized2,8. We find that provirophage-carrying cells are not directly protected from CroV; however, lysis of these cells releases infectious mavirus particles that are then able to suppress CroV replication and enhance host survival during subsequent rounds of infection. The microbial host–parasite interaction described here involves an altruistic aspect and suggests that giant-virus-induced activation of provirophages might be ecologically relevant in natural protist populations."

https://openalex.org/W2560015074,"Unlike spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, the majority of the stars in massive elliptical galaxies were formed in a short period early in the history of the Universe. The duration of this formation period can be measured using the ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative enrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe] probes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy, including younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time mergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we must study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which [Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z~1.4, with [Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z~1.6) was probed by stacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average [Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use of index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors that are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at even earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full spectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern shortly after the major star-forming phase (z>2). Here we report a measurement of [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1. With [Mg/Fe]=0.59+/-0.11, this galaxy is the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice the Mg enhancement of similar-mass galaxies today. The abundance pattern of the galaxy is consistent with enrichment exclusively by core-collapse supernovae and with a star-formation timescale of 0.1-0.5 Gyr - characteristics that are similar to population II stars in the Milky Way. With an average past SFR of 600-3000 Msol/yr, this galaxy was among the most vigorous star-forming galaxies in the Universe."
https://openalex.org/W2560729083,"Climate models show that ice-sheet melt will dominate sea-level rise over the coming centuries, but our understanding of ice-sheet variations before the last interglacial 125,000 years ago remains fragmentary. This is because terrestrial deposits of ancient glacial and interglacial periods are overrun and eroded by more recent glacial advances, and are therefore usually rare, isolated and poorly dated. In contrast, material shed almost continuously from continents is preserved as marine sediment that can be analysed to infer the time-varying state of major ice sheets. Here we show that the East Greenland Ice Sheet existed over the past 7.5 million years, as indicated by beryllium and aluminium isotopes (10Be and 26Al) in quartz sand removed by deep, ongoing glacial erosion on land and deposited offshore in the marine sedimentary record. During the early Pleistocene epoch, ice cover in East Greenland was dynamic; in contrast, East Greenland was mostly ice-covered during the mid-to-late Pleistocene. The isotope record we present is consistent with distinct signatures of changes in ice sheet behaviour coincident with major climate transitions. Although our data are continuous, they are from low-deposition-rate sites and sourced only from East Greenland. Consequently, the signal of extensive deglaciation during short, intense interglacials could be missed or blurred, and we cannot distinguish between a remnant ice sheet in the East Greenland highlands and a diminished continent-wide ice sheet. A clearer constraint on the behaviour of the ice sheet during past and, ultimately, future interglacial warmth could be produced by 10Be and 26Al records from a coring site with a higher deposition rate. Nonetheless, our analysis challenges the possibility of complete and extended deglaciation over the past several million years."
https://openalex.org/W2560839866,"Recording extracellulary from neurons in the brains of animals in vivo is among the most established experimental techniques in neuroscience, and has recently become feasible in humans. Many interesting scientific questions can be addressed only when extracellular recordings last several hours, and when individual neurons are tracked throughout the entire recording. Such questions regard, for example, neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory consolidation, and the generation of epileptic seizures. Several difficulties have so far limited the use of extracellular multi-hour recordings in neuroscience: Datasets become huge, and data are necessarily noisy in clinical recording environments. No methods for spike sorting of such recordings have been available. Spike sorting refers to the process of identifying the contributions of several neurons to the signal recorded in one electrode. To overcome these difficulties, we developed Combinato: a complete data-analysis framework for spike sorting in noisy recordings lasting twelve hours or more. Our framework includes software for artifact rejection, automatic spike sorting, manual optimization, and efficient visualization of results. Our completely automatic framework excels at two tasks: It outperforms existing methods when tested on simulated and real data, and it enables researchers to analyze multi-hour recordings. We evaluated our methods on both short and multi-hour simulated datasets. To evaluate the performance of our methods in an actual neuroscientific experiment, we used data from from neurosurgical patients, recorded in order to identify visually responsive neurons in the medial temporal lobe. These neurons responded to the semantic content, rather than to visual features, of a given stimulus. To test our methods with multi-hour recordings, we made use of neurons in the human medial temporal lobe that respond selectively to the same stimulus in the evening and next morning."
https://openalex.org/W2560698626,"Catechol chemistry is used as a crosslinking tool abundantly in both natural organisms (e.g. mussels, sandcastle worms) and synthetic systems to achieve the desired mechanical properties. Despite this abundance and success, the crosslinking chemistry is still poorly understood. In this study, to simplify the system, yet to capture the essential chemistry, model compounds 4-methyl catechol and propylamine are used. The reaction of 4-methyl catechol (2 mM) with propylamine (6 mM) is carried out in the presence of NaIO4 (2 mM) in 10 mM Na2CO3 aqueous solution. A variety of spectroscopic/spectrometric and chromatographic methods such as 1H NMR, LC-MS, and UV-VIS are used to track the reaction and identify the products/intermediates. It is found that the crosslinking chemistry of a catechol and an amine is both fast and complicated. Within five minutes, more than 60 products are formed. These products encompass 19 different masses ranging from molecular weight of 179 to 704. By combining time-dependent data, it is inferred that the dominant reaction pathways: the majority is formed via aryloxyl-phenol coupling and Michael-type addition, whereas a small fraction of products is formed via Schiff base reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2560455606,"BMAL1, the nonredundant transcription factor in the core molecular clock, has been implicated in cardiometabolic diseases in mice and humans. BMAL1 controls the cyclic trafficking of Ly6chi monocytes to sites of acute inflammation. Myeloid deficiency of Bmal1 also worsens chronic inflammation in diet-induced obesity. We studied whether myeloid Bmal1 deletion promotes atherosclerosis by enhancing monocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions. By generating Bmal1FloxP/FloxP;LysMCre mice on the Apoe-/- background, we showed that Bmal1 deletion in myeloid cells increased the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Bmal1 deficiency in monocytes and macrophages resulted in an increased total number of lesional macrophages in general and Ly6chi infiltrating monocyte-macrophages in particular, accompanied by skewed M2 to M1 macrophage phenotype. Ly6chi and/or Ly6clo monocyte subsets in blood, spleen, and bone marrow were not altered. Cell tracking and adoptive transfer of Ly6chi monocytes showed Bmal1 deficiency induced more trafficking of Ly6chi monocytes to atherosclerotic lesions, preferential differentiation of Ly6chi monocytes into M1 macrophages, and increased macrophage content and lesion size in the carotid arteries. We demonstrated that Bmal1 deficiency in macrophages promotes atherosclerosis by enhancing recruitment of Ly6chi monocytes to atherosclerotic lesions.-Huo, M., Huang, Y., Qu, D., Zhang, H., Wong, W.

https://openalex.org/W2560156171,"We investigated the regulatory effect of glucosamine (GlcN) for the production of nitric oxide (NO) and expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) under various glucose conditions in macrophage cells. At normal glucose concentrations, GlcN dose dependently increased LPS-stimulated production of NO/iNOS. However, GlcN suppressed NO/iNOS production under high glucose culture conditions. Moreover, GlcN suppressed LPS-induced up-regulation of COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNAs under 25 mm glucose conditions yet did not inhibit up-regulation under 5 mm glucose conditions. Glucose itself dose dependently increased LPS-induced iNOS expression. LPS-induced MAPK and IκB-α phosphorylation did not significantly differ at normal and high glucose conditions. The activity of LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and DNA binding of c-Rel to the iNOS promoter were inhibited under high glucose conditions in comparison with no significant changes under normal glucose conditions. In addition, we found that the LPS-induced increase in O-GlcNAcylation as well as DNA binding of c-Rel to the iNOS promoter were further increased by GlcN under normal glucose conditions. However, both O-GlcNAcylation and DNA binding of c-Rel decreased under high glucose conditions. The NF-κB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression under high glucose conditions but it did not influence iNOS induction under normal glucose conditions. In addition, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibited NF-κB DNA binding and c-Rel O-GlcNAcylation only under high glucose conditions. By blocking transcription with actinomycin D, we found that stability of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA was increased by GlcN under normal glucose conditions.

Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in inflammatory mediator and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is expressed predominantly by microglia and macrophages by sensing danger or foreign signals. NO leads macrophages with cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Nitric oxide and macrophage function.Annu. Rev.

Exogenous GlcN, which enters the HBP bypassing fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase is taken into cells by glucose transporters (GLUT-1, GLUT-2, and GLUT-4) after which it is phosphorylated and further metabolized (3Shikhman A.R.

More recently, we demonstrated that GlcN inhibits the transcription of inflammatory genes via regulation of O-GlcNAcylation of transcription factors. For example, LPS-mediated iNOS induction is suppressed by GlcN by regulating c-Rel O-GlcNAcylation and subsequent NF-κB activity in both microglia and macrophage cells (16Hwang S.Y. Hwang J.S.

NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitors of NF-κB, inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins including IκBα and IκBβ. In response to stimulation, IκB becomes phosphorylated and is subjected to degradation after ubiquitination. This accompanies NF-κB translocation to the nucleus where the protein activates transcription (21Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-κB activity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4079) Google Scholar). Vertebrate NF-κB transcription complexes can be any of a variety of homo- and heterodimers formed by the subunits RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (a product of p105), and p52 (a product of p100) (22Ghosh S.

The target gene specificity of NF-κB is thought to arise from a number of factors. Some factors include the specific NF-κB complexes that are in different cell types, the distinct κB target site binding specificities of different NF-κB complexes, and the different protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications that NF-κB complexes (24Hoffmann A.

Therefore, the excessive caloric intake might be associated with the pathogenesis of both obesity-related complications and chronic inflammation. Indeed, free fatty acids have been shown to activate the LPS receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (27Shi H. Kokoeva M.V. Inouye K. Tzameli I. Yin H. Flier J.S. TLR4 links innate immunity and fatty acid-induced insulin resistance.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3015-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Free fatty acid may also induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages (27Shi H. Kokoeva M.V. Inouye K. Tzameli I. Yin H. Flier J.S. TLR4 links innate immunity and fatty acid-induced insulin resistance.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3015-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). High-glucose concentrations are also involved in inflammatory processes (28Esposito K. Nappo F. Marfella R. Giugliano G. Giugliano F. Ciotola M. Quagliaro L. Ceriello A. Giugliano D. Inflammatory cytokine concentrations are acutely increased by hyperglycemia in humans: role of oxidative stress.Circulation. 2002; 106: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 29Mohanty P. Hamouda W. Garg R. Aljada A. Ghanim H. Dandona P. Glucose challenge stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by leucocytes.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2970-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). LPS modulates the generation of an inflammatory mediator in macrophages in hyperglycemic models (30Hua K.F. Wang S.H. Dong W.C. Lin C.Y. Ho C.L. Wu T.H. High glucose increases nitric oxide generation in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages by enhancing activity of protein kinase C-α/δ and NF-κB.Inflamm. Res. 2012; 61: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, inflammatory responses are obviously associated with glucotoxicity in diabetic conditions. Hyperglycemia-associated metabolic syndrome promotes abnormally elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation, which participates in the glucotoxicity (31Issad T. Masson E. Pagesy P. O-GlcNAc modification, insulin signaling and diabetic complications.Diabetes Metab. 2010; 36: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Baudoin L. Issad T. O-GlcNAcylation and Inflammation: a vast territory to explore.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2015; 5: 235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar33Ma J. Hart G.W. Protein O-GlcNAcylation in diabetes and diabetic complications.Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2013; 10: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The association between hyperglycemia and metabolic syndrome-associated inflammation is well established yet the involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in those events is obscure. Therefore, exploring the regulation of O-GlcNAcylation and its functional implications in inflammatory regulation under different glucose settings is important. In this study, we investigated the potential of both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of GlcN to regulate NO/iNOS induction as well as O-GlcNAcylation in macrophage cells under normal and high glucose culture conditions. GlcN demonstrated an inverse effect on LPS-mediated iNOS induction and O-GlcNAcylation and DNA binding of c-Rel between normal and high glucose conditions. Therefore, GlcN or the HBP metabolic pathway likely regulates inflammation and the related signaling pathway depends on nutrient availability. Previous reports by our group showed that GlcN inhibits LPS-induced NO production (13Hwang S.Y. Hwang J.S. Kim S.Y. Han I.O. Glucosamine inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase induction by inhibiting expression of NF-κB/Rel proteins at the mRNA and protein levels.Nitric Oxide. 2013; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Hwang S.Y.

Glucosamine exerts a neuroprotective effect via suppression of inflammation in rat brain ischemia/reperfusion injury.Glia. 2010; 58: 1881-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the dose-dependent effect of GlcN on LPS-caused NO synthesis under increasing glucose concentrations. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with culture medium containing zero, normal (5 mm), or high glucose (25, 50, or 100 mm) in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/ml) and/or GlcN (5 mm). Concentrations higher than 20 mm were considered as analogous to a diabetic condition within the cell culture system. The nitrite levels (an index of NO production) in culture medium were compared after 24 h. LPS produced detectable NO generation at concentrations higher than 5 mm glucose conditions. Furthermore, LPS-induced NO generation was dose dependently increased at various glucose concentrations (Fig. 1A). The addition of GlcN 2 h before LPS administration resulted in a complicated effect on NO generation as per glucose concentration. GlcN increased LPS-mediated NO generation at normal glucose conditions but GlcN strongly inhibited LPS-mediated NO generation at concentrations higher than 25 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined dose effects of GlcN on NO production and cell viability in RAW264.7 cells in response to LPS. The level of nitrite in culture medium at 24 h of LPS stimulation was increased by GlcN in a dose-dependent manner at normal glucose culture conditions. However, LPS-induced NO production was dose dependently inhibited by GlcN at 25 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 1B, upper panels) as previously demonstrated (13Hwang S.Y. Hwang J.S. Kim S.Y. Han I.O. Glucosamine inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase induction by inhibiting expression of NF-κB/Rel proteins at the mRNA and protein levels.Nitric Oxide. 2013; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Hwang S.Y. Shin J.H. Hwang J.S. Kim S.Y. Shin J.A. Oh E.S. Oh S. Kim J.B. Lee J.K. Han I.O. Glucosamine exerts a neuroprotective effect via suppression of inflammation in rat brain ischemia/reperfusion injury.Glia. 2010; 58: 1881-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GlcN inhibited cell death that was induced by LPS under 25 mm glucose conditions. Conversely, GlcN yielded a minimal effect on cell death under 5 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 1B, lower panels). Morphological examinations indicated that GlcN protected cells against LPS-mediated cell death at 48 h under both 5 and 25 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 1C). The effect of GlcN on LPS-mediated induction of proinflammatory genes was examined under normal or high glucose conditions. Raw264.7 cells were incubated with culture medium containing normal glucose (5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm) in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/ml) and/or GlcN (5 mm). LPS-initiated iNOS expression at 24 h was increased by GlcN under 5 mm glucose culture conditions. Conversely, GlcN inhibited iNOS and COX-2 protein expression in cells under 25 mm glucose culture conditions (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined the effect of GlcN on the activity of the iNOS promoter under ambient glucose conditions. GlcN suppressed the activity of the iNOS promoter at 25 mm glucose conditions, as previously described (15Hwang S.Y. Shin J.H. Hwang J.S. Kim S.Y. Shin J.A. Oh E.S. Oh S. Kim J.B. Lee J.K. Han I.O. Glucosamine exerts a neuroprotective effect via suppression of inflammation in rat brain ischemia/reperfusion injury.Glia. 2010; 58: 1881-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, GlcN stimulated reporter activity of the iNOS promoter under 5 mm conditions (Fig. 2B). Levels of mRNA encoding iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β were increased by LPS and their expressions were strongly inhibited by GlcN under 25 mm conditions. At 5 mm culture conditions, GlcN stimulated LPS-induced iNOS mRNA. However, LPS-stimulated mRNA expression of COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α were all not significantly influenced by GlcN at 5 mm glucose conditions. LPS-mediated expression of IL-1β was inhibited by GlcN at 5 mm conditions (Fig. 2C). We verified the GlcN effect on LPS-induced iNOS mRNA expression using primary cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages; GlcN was inhibited at 25 mm conditions but stimulated at 5 mm conditions (Fig. 2D). We have verified that GAPDH expression was not changed by glucose and/or GlcN (data not shown). We examined the time course of expression of mRNA encoding iNOS, and that of protein expression per se, in RAW264.7 cells exposed to LPS (100 ng/ml) under 5 or 25 mm glucose culture conditions. Furthermore, we determined how GlcN affected induction of such expression. iNOS protein was detected as early as 6 h LPS stimulation at both 5 and 25 mm glucose. GlcN stimulated iNOS expression at 5 mm glucose but was relatively ineffective at 25 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 3A). LPS-induced expression of iNOS was more distinct at 12 h. GlcN was further stimulated at concentrations of 5 mm glucose but slightly inhibited under 25 mm glucose. Likewise, the increase in iNOS mRNA by LPS was inhibited by GlcN at 12 and 24 h of LPS stimulation under 25 mm glucose conditions. Contrastingly, LPS-induced iNOS mRNA was stimulated by GlcN at all time points examined at 5 mm glucose concentration (Fig. 3B). To explore any dependence of possible differential regulation of GlcN for iNOS induction on glucose-regulated transcription factors or ER stress responses, we examined iNOS, C/EBP-δ, C/EBP-β, and GRP78 protein induction levels in RAW264.7 cells. Cells cultured in increasing concentrations of glucose (0, 5, 25, 50, and 100 mm) displayed increased iNOS expression in response to LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Under the same conditions, the expression of C/EBP-δ, C/EBP-β, and GRP78 were all reduced by glucose in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of LPS (Fig. 4A). C/EBP-β expression was less distinctly reduced by glucose in the presence of LPS. Next, we determined the effect of GlcN on the expression of C/EBP-δ, C/EBP-β, and GRP78 under 5 or 25 mm glucose conditions. C/EBP-β was not significantly influenced by LPS and/or GlcN at 5 or 25 mm glucose. At 5 mm glucose, the expression of C/EBP-δ was stimulated by LPS but inhibited by GlcN. However, at 25 mm glucose, GlcN further increased LPS-increased C/EBP-δ protein expression (Fig. 4B). GRP78 protein was expressed in a lower level at 25 mm glucose than at 5 mm glucose conditions. However, GRP78 expression was significantly increased by 5 mm GlcN in 25 mm glucose with or without LPS. In addition, GRP78 was slightly increased by GlcN in the presence of LPS in 5 mm glucose condition. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by LPS, and the effect of GlcN on such signaling, was examined 30 min, 2 h, and 12 h after LPS (100 ng/ml) addition under 5 or 25 mm glucose culture conditions. LPS increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in RAW264.7 cells at both 5 and 25 mm glucose conditions. GlcN did not significantly affect the extent of any LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK 30 min after LPS addition under 5 or 25 mm glucose. A reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation by GlcN was evident 12 h after LPS addition under both 5 and 25 mm glucose conditions. LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK was reduced in the presence of GlcN at 12 h after LPS addition at 25 mm glucose but not at 5 mm glucose (Fig. 5, A and B). IκBα was both phosphorylated and degraded by LPS at 30 min. GlcN did not influence degradation nor phosphorylation of IκBα at either 5 or 25 mm glucose conditions. We compared the effect of GlcN on LPS-induced NF-κB activation between normal and high glucose conditions. LPS stimulated nuclear translocation of c-Rel and p50 in RAW264.7 cells maintained at both 5 and 25 mm glucose culture conditions. Conversely, p65 nuclear translocation was increased at only 25 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 6A). Nuclear translocations of p65, c-Rel, and p50 in response to LPS were inhibited by GlcN at 25 mm glucose, but were not significantly influenced under 5 mm glucose (Fig. 6A). Next, we examined the effects of LPS and/or GlcN on NF-κB activation using the NF-κB-reporter construct. LPS activated the NF-κB reporter at 25 mm glucose but less strongly at 5 mm glucose. GlcN inhibited NF-κB activity under 25 mm glucose conditions but did not significantly exhibit any influence at 5 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 6B). To determine whether LPS and/or GlcN directly regulated the binding of Rel family proteins to promoter DNA, we assayed the ability of Rel proteins to bind to a biotinylated oligonucleotide corresponding to the distal NF-κB site. This site (−957 to −977 in the mouse iNOS promoter) is important regarding gene induction by LPS (34Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. Role of transcription factor NF-κB/Rel in induction of nitric-oxide synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with LPS for 24 h induced increases in the binding levels of both c-Rel and p50 at both 5 and 25 mm glucose concentrations. Furthermore, p65 binding also increased at 25 mm glucose. LPS-stimulated binding of p65, c-Rel, and p50 were all suppressed by GlcN at 25 mm glucose yet these bindings were all not affected by GlcN at 5 mm glucose (Fig. 6C). To examine the physiological relevance of such DNA binding, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. LPS induced an increase in the binding of c-Rel to the endogenous iNOS promoter both in 5 and 25 mm glucose conditions. In contrast, binding was suppressed by GlcN at 25 mm glucose but not influenced under 5 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 6D). This suggests a regulatory role for GlcN in LPS-mediated iNOS induction that may be controlled by regulating the chromatin mobilization of c-Rel proteins. We have previously reported that LPS and/or GlcN regulate iNOS induction via post-translational O-GlcNAcylation of c-Rel (16Hwang S.Y. Hwang J.S. Kim S.Y. Han I.O. O-GlcNAcylation and p50/p105 binding of c-Rel are dynamically regulated by LPS and glucosamine in BV2 microglia cells.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 169: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We performed wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) pulldown assays using WGA-conjugated agarose beads that specifically precipitate proteins containing N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylneuramic acid. RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and/or GlcN (5 mm) for 24 h under 5 or 25 mm glucose conditions. O-GlcNAcylation of total cell lysates was stimulated by GlcN at 5 mm glucose compared with no significant changes by GlcN at 25 mm glucose (Fig. 7A, upper panels). The amount of c-Rel protein in the WGA precipitate was increased by LPS and this increase was inhibited by GlcN at the 25 mm glucose conditions, as previously described (16Hwang S.Y. Hwang J.S. Kim S.Y. Han I.O. O-GlcNAcylation and p50/p105 binding of c-Rel are dynamically regulated by LPS and glucosamine in BV2 microglia cells.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 169: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, WGA binding of c-Rel in response to LPS was dramatically increased by GlcN at the 5 mm glucose conditions (Fig. 7A, lower panels). These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation of c-Rel or a protein that interacts with c-Rel is differentially regulated by GlcN depending on glucose concentrations. We further confirmed O-GlcNAcylation changes of total and c-Rel proteins in response to LPS and/or GlcN under 5 mm glucose conditions by labeling O-GlcNAc with galactosyltransferase using [3H]galactose as a substrate. O-GlcNAcylation of total nucleocytoplasmic proteins was increased by GlcN regardless of LPS presence (Fig. 7B, upper panel). O-GlcNAcylation of c-Rel determined by [3H]galactose labeling demonstrated that c-Rel O-GlcNAcylation at 5 mm glucose was slightly increased by GlcN and further increased by LPS plus GlcN (Fig. 7B, lower panels). Next, we compared O-GlcNAcylation of nuclear and cytosolic c-Rel and p65 in response to LPS and/or GlcN under 5 or 25 mm g"

Changes in the environment can affect this component of biodiversity and can, in turn, affect different processes, including some ecosystem services. This study aimed to determine the effect of forest loss on species richness, abundance and functional diversity of Neotropical bats. To this end, we identified six landscapes with increasing loss of forest cover in the Huasteca region of the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. We captured bats in each landscape using mist nets, and calculated functional diversity indices (functional richness and functional evenness) along with species richness and abundance. We analyzed these measures in terms of percent forest cover. We captured 906 bats (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae), including 10 genera and 12 species. Species richness, abundance and functional richness per night are positively related with forest cover. Generalized linear models show that species richness, abundance and functional richness per night are significantly related with forest cover, while seasonality had an effect on abundance and functional richness. Neither forest cover nor season had a significant effect on functional evenness. All these findings were consistent across three spatial scales (1, 3 and 5 km radius around sampling sites). The decrease in species, abundance and functional richness of bats with forest loss may have implications for the ecological processes they carry out such as seed dispersal, pollination and insect predation, among others."
https://openalex.org/W2560552599,"We propose a new meta-heuristic algorithm named Levy flights multi-verse optimizer (LFMVO), which incorporates Levy flights into multi-verse optimizer (MVO) algorithm to solve numerical and engineering optimization problems. The Original MVO easily falls into stagnation when wormholes stochastically re-span a number of universes (solutions) around the best universe achieved over the course of iterations. Since Levy flights are superior in exploring unknown, large-scale search space, they are integrated into the previous best universe to force MVO out of stagnation. We test this method on three sets of 23 well-known benchmark test functions and an NP complete problem of test scheduling for Network-on-Chip (NoC). Experimental results prove that the proposed LFMVO is more competitive than its peers in both the quality of the resulting solutions and convergence speed."
https://openalex.org/W2560251994,"Although increasingly popular as a laboratory species, very little is known about the peripheral auditory system of the naked mole-rat, Heterocephalus glaber. In this study, middle and inner ears of naked mole-rats of a range of ages were examined using micro-computed tomography and dissection. The ears of five other bathyergid species (Bathyergus suillus, Cryptomys hottentotus, Fukomys micklemi, Georychus capensis and Heliophobius argenteocinereus) were examined for comparative purposes. The middle ears of bathyergids show features commonly found in other members of the Ctenohystrica rodent clade, including a fused malleus and incus, a synovial stapedio-vestibular articulation and the loss of the stapedius muscle. Heterocephalus deviates morphologically from the other bathyergids examined in that it has a more complex mastoid cavity structure, poorly-ossified processes of the malleus and incus, a ‘columelliform’ stapes and fewer cochlear turns. Bathyergids have semicircular canals with unusually wide diameters relative to their radii of curvature. How the lateral semicircular canal reaches the vestibule differs between species. Heterocephalus has much more limited high-frequency hearing than would be predicted from its small ear structures. The spongy bone forming its ossicular processes, the weak incudo-stapedial articulation, the columelliform stapes and (compared to other bathyergids) reduced cochlear coiling are all potentially degenerate features which might reflect a lack of selective pressure on its peripheral auditory system. Substantial intraspecific differences were found in certain middle and inner ear structures, which might also result from relaxed selective pressures. However, such interpretations must be treated with caution in the absence of experimental evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2560369188,"A number of point mutations in the intracellular Ca2+-sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) are arrhythmogenic, yet their underlying mechanisms are not clear. These mutations generally decrease Ca2+ binding to CaM and impair inhibition of CaM-regulated Ca2+ channels like the cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR2), and it appears that attenuated CaM Ca2+ binding correlates with impaired CaM-dependent RyR2 inhibition. Here, we investigated the RyR2 inhibitory action of the CaM p.Phe142Leu mutation (F142L; numbered including the start-Met), which markedly reduces CaM Ca2+ binding. Surprisingly, CaM-F142L had little to no aberrant effect on RyR2-mediated store overload-induced Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells compared with CaM-WT. Furthermore, CaM-F142L enhanced CaM-dependent RyR2 inhibition at the single channel level compared with CaM-WT. This is in stark contrast to the actions of arrhythmogenic CaM mutations N54I, D96V, N98S, and D130G, which all diminish CaM-dependent RyR2 inhibition. Thermodynamic analysis showed that apoCaM-F142L converts an endothermal interaction between CaM and the CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) of RyR2 into an exothermal one. Moreover, NMR spectra revealed that the CaM-F142L-CaMBD interaction is structurally different from that of CaM-WT at low Ca2+. These data indicate a distinct interaction between CaM-F142L and the RyR2 CaMBD, which may explain the stronger CaM-dependent RyR2 inhibition by CaM-F142L, despite its reduced Ca2+ binding. Collectively, these results add to our understanding of CaM-dependent regulation of RyR2 as well as the mechanistic effects of arrhythmogenic CaM mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2560097799,"While the Mediterranean Sea has been designated as a Global Biodiversity Hotspot, assessments of cetacean population abundance are lacking for large portions of the region, particularly in the southern and eastern basins. The challenges and costs of obtaining the necessary data often result in absent or poor abundance information. We applied capture-recapture models to estimate abundance, survival and temporary emigration of odontocete populations within a 2,400 km2 semi-enclosed Mediterranean bay, the Gulf of Corinth. Boat surveys were conducted in 2011–2015 to collect photo-identification data on striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba, short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis (always found together with striped dolphins in mixed groups) and common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus, totaling 1,873 h of tracking. After grading images for quality and marking distinctiveness, 23,995 high-quality photos were included in a striped and common dolphin catalog, and 2,472 in a bottlenose dolphin catalog. The proportions of striped and common dolphins were calculated from the photographic sample and used to scale capture-recapture estimates. Best-fitting robust design capture-recapture models denoted no temporary emigration between years for striped and common dolphins, and random temporary emigration for bottlenose dolphins, suggesting different residency patterns in agreement with previous studies. Average estimated abundance over the five years was 1,331 (95% CI 1,122–1,578) striped dolphins, 22 (16–32) common dolphins, 55 (36–84) “intermediate” animals (potential striped x common dolphin hybrids) and 38 (32–46) bottlenose dolphins. Apparent survival was constant for striped, common and intermediate dolphins (0.94, 95% CI 0.92–0.96) and year-dependent for bottlenose dolphins (an average of 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.95). Our work underlines the importance of long-term monitoring to contribute reliable baseline information that can help assess the conservation status of wildlife populations."
https://openalex.org/W2560418830,"The activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is controlled through their lateral association in the plasma membrane. RTKs are believed to form both homodimers and heterodimers, and the different dimers are believed to play unique roles in cell signaling. However, RTK heterodimers remain poorly characterized, as compared with homodimers, because of limitations in current experimental methods. Here, we develop a FRET-based methodology to assess the thermodynamics of hetero-interactions in the plasma membrane. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, we use it to study the hetero-interactions between three fibroblast growth factor receptors—FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3—in the absence of ligand. Our results show that all possible FGFR heterodimers form, suggesting that the biological roles of FGFR heterodimers may be as significant as the homodimer roles. We further investigate the effect of two pathogenic point mutations in FGFR3 (A391E and G380R) on heterodimerization. We show that each of these mutations stabilize most of the heterodimers, with the largest effects observed for FGFR3 wild-type/mutant heterodimers.

Thus, significant efforts have been dedicated to the development of RTK-specific therapies with high specificity and low toxicity. One class of anti-cancer drugs on the market specifically aims to inhibit RTK dimerization, because it is an important regulator of function. The best known example of these drugs is Herceptin, an antibody raised against the extracellular domain of HER2, which is often overexpressed in breast cancer (15Hynes N.E. Lane H.A.

Although Herceptin treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes in some cases, the performance of this treatment and other RTK-targeted molecular therapies has not reached expectations (4Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M.

RTKs readily form homodimers, but they also participate in hetero-interactions with other RTKs, often other members of the same family. Heterodimerization between RTKs is believed to be a means of signal amplification and diversification. RTK heterodimers have been shown to enhance receptor activation and downstream signaling, as compared with homodimers (1Schlessinger J.

For instance, the ErbB2·ErbB3 heterodimer is known as the most biologically active and the most pro-tumorigenic of all ErbB homodimers and heterodimers (4Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E.

ERBB receptors and cancer: the complexity of targeted inhibitors.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of RTK heterodimerization is only rudimentary, in part because of a paucity of methods that provide quantitative information about heterodimer formation (18Tzahar E.

Thus, the extent of heterodimerization between members of an RTK family remains unknown. Often, even the identities of RTK partners that engage in hetero-interactions are unknown, and this can significantly impede the design of high efficacy therapeutics that target RTK dimerization. Here, we introduce a novel FRET-based technique that overcomes the limitations of previous methods employed to study heterodimers in the plasma membrane. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we apply it to study heterodimerization within the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family of RTKs. We use truncated receptors in which the IC domains have been substituted with fluorescent proteins to allow for FRET detection. Measurements are performed in plasma membrane vesicles, derived from cells using an osmotic stress buffer (22Del Piccolo N. Placone J. He L. Agudelo S.C. Hristova K.

Chem. 2012; 84: 8650-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As the receptors are expressed in cells prior to vesicle production, they undergo all post-translational modifications. FRET is measured with the quantitative imaging-FRET (QI-FRET) method (23Chen L. Novicky L. Merzlyakov M. Hristov T. Hristova K.

FGFR homodimerization seems to prime the receptors for efficient activation by the ligand, and thus unliganded FGFR dimers appear to be important intermediates in the signal transduction process (8Sarabipour S.

We seek to determine the heterodimerization propensities of truncated FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and compare them to the homodimerization propensities, in the absence of ligand. We further seek to examine FGFR heterodimer formation in the presence of two different pathogenic point mutations in FGFR3: G380R and A391E. The G380R mutation in the TM domain of FGFR3 is found in 98% of all achondroplasia cases.

Multiple consequences of a single amino acid pathogenic RTK mutation: the A391E mutation in FGFR3.PLoS One. 2013; 8e56521Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although both mutations introduce a charged amino acid into the TM domain of the same receptor, the resulting phenotypes are substantially different. It has been hypothesized that this difference in phenotype might be explained by disparate perturbations to FGFR heterodimers (27Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J.

The bracket notation indicates two-dimensional species concentration. The three association constants can be written as shown below.

Methods Affymetrix HG U133A and Plus 2.0 array datasets with information on metastasis-free, disease-free or overall survival were accessed via public repositories. Time restricted Cox regression models were used to identify genes associated with metastasis during or after the first three years post-surgery (early- and late-type genes). A sequential validation study design, with two non-adjuvantly treated discovery cohorts (n = 409) and one validation cohort (n = 169) was applied and identified genes were further evaluated in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients (n = 923), as well as in patients with non-small cell lung (n = 1779), colon (n = 893) and ovarian (n = 922) cancer. Results Ten late- and 243 early-type genes were identified in adjuvantly untreated breast cancer. Adjustment to clinicopathological factors and an established proliferation-related signature markedly reduced the number of early-type genes to 16, whereas nine late-type genes still remained significant. These nine genes were associated with metastasis-free survival (MFS) also in a non-time restricted model, but not in the early period alone, stressing that their prognostic impact was primarily based on MFS more than three years after surgery. Four of the ten late-type genes, the ribosome-related factors EIF4B, RPL5, RPL3, and the tumor angiogenesis modifier EPN3 were significantly associated with MFS in the late period also in a meta-analysis of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer cohorts. In contrast, only one late-type gene (EPN3) showed consistent survival associations in more than one cohort in the other cancer types, being associated with worse outcome in two non-small cell lung cancer cohorts. No late-type gene was validated in ovarian and colon cancer. Conclusions Ribosome-related genes were associated with decreased risk of late metastasis in both adjuvantly untreated and tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. In contrast, high expression of epsin (EPN3) was associated with increased risk of late metastasis. This is of clinical relevance considering the well-understood role of epsins in tumor angiogenesis and the ongoing development of epsin antagonizing therapies."

Although multiple shell protein structures are known for several microcompartment types, additional uncharacterized components complicate systematic investigations of shell architecture. We report here the structures of all four proteins proposed to form the shell of an uncharacterized microcompartment designated the Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium microcompartment (RMM), which, along with crystal interactions and docking studies, suggests possible models for the particle’s vertex and edge organization.

Bacteria differ fundamentally from eukaryotes in that they lack the ability to form membrane-bound organelles to segregate aspects of their metabolism. Some bacteria are, however, able to bypass this limitation by encapsulating enzymes catalyzing critical steps of a problematic metabolic pathway in a protein shell; the resulting 100-nm scale bodies are known as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs). 2The abbreviations used are: BMCbacterial microcompartmentRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseRMMRhodococcus and Mycobacterium microcompartmentPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationIDinter-domainICinter-chain.

Ecologically, the most important BMCs are the anabolic carboxysomes, which facilitate carbon fixation in cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophs (2Espie G.S. Kimber M.S.

Carboxysomes and their structural organization in prokaryotes.Nanomicrobiology. 2014; 10.1007/978–1-4939–1667-2_4Google Scholar); a variety of BMCs in heterotrophic bacteria also support the catabolism of a variety of small organic compounds (4Chowdhury C.

Well characterized examples of microcompartments include the two varieties of carboxysomes (α and β) that fix carbon dioxide using Rubisco, as well as the propanediol utilization (pdu), and ethanolamine utilization (eut) microcompartments. Available evidence for less well characterized microcompartments suggests roles in the catabolism of ethanol, choline, 6-deoxyhexoses, and other small molecules (5Seedorf H. Fricke W.F. Veith B.

The emergent pattern is that microcompartments typically catalyze successive steps in pathways where the intermediates are toxic and/or volatile (7Kerfeld C.A. Erbilgin O. Bacterial microcompartments and the modular construction of microbial metabolism.Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23: 22-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Encapsulation of the enzymes within a large (∼100 nm diameter) selectively permeable polyhedral proteinaceous shell therefore serves to bring sequentially acting active sites into spatial proximity, while the selectivity and limited porosity of the shell helps impede the escape of problematic intermediates (8Yeates T.O.

The organization of the microcompartment shell has been of considerable research interest; assembly appears to echo patterns previously identified in the organization of icosahedral viruses, but the constituent proteins are not homologous. The facets of the shell are built from members of a single protein family (pfam00936) with a core structure composed of a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet flanked by three α-helices in a thioredoxin-like topology; six copies of this domain then form a basic hexagonal tile that can be packed into extended sheets (Fig. 1) (10Kerfeld C.A.

Biol. 2014; 426: 2328-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At least one (and generally several) such protein has been identified in every candidate microcompartment identified to date, and, in systems where the shell composition has been quantified, these bacterial microcompartment-hexameric shell proteins (BMC-H) are the most abundant components of the shell. More recently, a second deeply divergent branch of this family was identified in Cso1D in α-carboxysomes (14Klein M.G. Zwart P. Bagby S.C. Cai F. Chisholm S.W. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. Kerfeld C.A. Identification and structural analysis of a novel carboxysome shell protein with implications for metabolite transport.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This protein has only very weak sequence similarity to BMC-H proteins, and indeed, the topology of the basic structural domain is permuted, with two permuted domains linked in a head-to-tail fusion. These proteins are here termed BMC-FP (BMC fused, permuted) proteins (note that we use BMC-FP to denote only fused, permuted, and double-ringed proteins, such as CcmP and Cso1D). Only three copies of the protein are required to form a pseudohexagonal ring, but in both known examples two such rings oligomerize face to face forming a double-ring that has been suggested to form a locally double-layered shell (14Klein M.G.

BMC-FPs are only associated with a subset of microcompartments and have only been previously characterized in carboxysomes. Other variants on the pfam00936 family are also found, including permuted hexameric proteins (e.g. EutS and PduU) (16Tanaka S. Sawaya M.R. Yeates T.O.

In addition to BMC-H proteins, the other protein family that seems absolutely required for forming a functional microcompartment shell is pfam03319. These small proteins are built as a five-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel that oligomerizes with four other chains to form a truncated pentameric pyramid (20Tanaka S. Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Cai F. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. Yeates T.O. Atomic-level models of the bacterial carboxysome shell.Science. 2008; 319: 1083-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests that voids left in the 5-fold symmetric vertices of the shell are capped by these bacterial microcompartment-pentameric shell (BMC-P) proteins (20Tanaka S. Kerfeld C.A.

Interestingly, many microcompartments contain several paralogs of these BMC-P proteins (up to seven), suggesting that they may have roles beyond acting as simple plugs. In this work, we investigate a member of a family of functionally uncharacterized microcompartments, previously identified in members of the Actinomycetales genus (22Jorda J. Lopez D. Wheatley N.M. Yeates T.O. Using comparative genomics to uncover new kinds of protein-based metabolic organelles in bacteria.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); in the absence of an experimentally confirmed function, we adopt the terminology of Axen et al. (1Axen S.D. Erbilgin O. Kerfeld C.A. A taxonomy of bacterial microcompartment loci constructed by a novel scoring method.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2014; 10e1003898Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), terming these RMM (Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium microcompartment) microcompartments. We have focused on Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2 155 for this work; M. smegmatis is a close saprophytic relative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and being non-pathogenic and fast growing, a variety of tools (including transformation, protein expression and genome-wide knockouts) have been developed in M. smegmatis to facilitate use of this organism as a model. The operon associated with the RMM in M. smegmatis contains open reading frames for four shell protein homologs and four enzymes, as well as a possible additional structural protein, a transcription regulator, and an amino acid permease-like transporter. The only enzyme from an RMM operon that has been enzymatically characterized is a short chain alcohol dehydrogenase that has been shown to possess l-1-amino-2-propanol dehydrogenase activity (23Kataoka M. Nakamura Y. Urano N. Ishige T. Shi G. Kita S. Sakamoto K. Shimizu S. A novel NADP+-dependent l-1-amino-2-propanol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis MAK154: a promising enzyme for the production of double chiral aminoalcohols.Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 2006; 43: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Encoded enzymes that have not been catalytically characterized, but from sequence homology, the operon includes a class III aminotransferase, an aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase, and a protein with distant homology to aminoglycoside phosphotransferases. This operon can be induced in Rhodococcus by the addition of 1-amino-2-propanol (24Urano N. Kataoka M. Ishige T. Kita S. Sakamoto K. Shimizu S. Genetic analysis around aminoalcohol dehydrogenase gene of Rhodococcus erythropolis MAK154: a putative GntR transcription factor in transcriptional regulation.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 89: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Together, this suggests that the initial substrate is either 1-amino-2-propanol, and/or a small amino alcohol, or a closely related metabolite. The products that would ultimately enter general metabolism remain unclear. The shell proteins include a BMC-H protein, a BMC-P protein, and two BMC-FP proteins. Intriguingly, this is the smallest number of shell proteins associated with any known microcompartment (tied with the α-carboxysome in Prochlorococcus MED4, which has two BMC-P proteins); this suggests that that the RMM may be a usefully tractable system for characterizing and modeling microcompartment shell assembly. We report here for the first time X-ray structures for all shell components of a single microcompartment (all obtained from a single organism), revealing intriguing new insights into how these shell proteins might interact and function. The pentameric shell protein (BMC-P) MSM0273 crystallized in space group P3121 and diffracted to a resolution of 1.6 Å. The asymmetric unit contained five protomers arranged into a pentamer. Of the 87 native amino acids, one chain is missing only the last residue, while the last 9–10 residues are disordered in the other four. Each protomer consists of a single pfam03319 domain, organized around a five-stranded antiparallel β-barrel (1, −2, 3, 5, −4 topology) (Fig. 2A). The axis of this barrel lies within the plane of the pentamer, radiating out from the central pore. The long β1-β2 loop (β1a) extends out toward an adjacent protomer, which in turn pairs with β5 and an extended region of the C terminus. In the one chain where ordered, the extended C terminus forms a β-strand along the outside edge of β1 extending outward from the β-barrel. A short six-residue α-helix is inserted into the β4-β5 loop; the N-terminal end of this helix lines the central pore of the pentamer. Searching with DALI reveals that EutN (PDB code 2Z9H), GrpN (PDB code 4I7A), CcmL (PDB code 2QW7), and CsoS4 (HnCsoS4, PDB code 2RCF) are the closest structural homologs, with Z-scores in the range of 12–13 (25Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3051) Google Scholar). Sequence identity to EutN is closest at 35%. These structures all generally resemble one another, with MSM0273 having a shorter β2-β3 loop and a shorter C terminus than most homologs. Similar to homologous structures, a pore is formed at the 5-fold axis and is lined by the N-terminal end of α1; the hydroxyl group and amide nitrogen of Ser-56 lines an electropositive hydrophilic pore ∼5 Å in diameter (Fig. 3, A–C). MSM0272 is a BMC-H protein that is 68% identical to Clostridium EutM and 59% identical to Salmonella PduA. The structure of MSM0272 was determined at a resolution of 2.2 Å, with an Rfree of 23.3%. Crystals were in the space group P43 with two complete hexamers in the asymmetric unit. At minimum, all protomers have residues 4–88 (of 93) ordered, while chain A (the most complete chain with the lowest atomic displacement parameters) is missing only residue 1, which is likely removed by methionine amino peptidase. MSM0272, as expected for a BMC-H protein, is built as a hexamer of single pfam00936 domains, with a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (with a 2, −3, 1, −4 topology) that has two α-helices packed onto one face (Fig. 2B). The C terminus forms a third helix-like structure that packs onto the equivalent sheet face on an adjacent protomer. Six protomers are organized into a hexameric ring that has a regular hexagonal outline, with near straight edges and distinct convex and concave (where α3 is located) faces. Although α3 is well defined with up to three hydrogen bonds in a 310 pattern in one protomer, in others these residues only form a single hydrogen bond and more resemble two adjacent turns. The structural flexibility of this region, especially the disorder of residues 89–93 in many protomers is interesting, as this region in the close homolog PduA is proposed to mediate interactions with terminal helical peptides from encapsulated residues (26Fan C. Cheng S. Liu Y. Escobar C.M. Crowley C.S. Jefferson R.E. Yeates T.O. Bobik T.A. Short N-terminal sequences package proteins into bacterial microcompartments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7509-7514Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Fan C. Cheng S. Sinha S. Bobik T.A. Interactions between the termini of lumen enzymes and shell proteins mediate enzyme encapsulation into bacterial microcompartments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 14995-15000Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In PduA, this helix is required to recruit PduP to the microcompartment, with His-81, Val-84, and Leu-88 (here His-81, Leu-84, and Phe-88) being the critical residues. The relative mobility of these residues, with Phe-88 disordered in 7 of the 12 protomers, suggests that this helix may be able to reorganize to maximize interactions with the targeting peptide. In common with other BMC-H proteins, a small pore is formed where all six protomers meet at the 6-fold rotational axis and is lined by a β-hairpin motif (between β2 and β3). In common with most BMC-H proteins, this turn has a sequence ΦGZGX, where Φ is a small hydrophobic residue; X is any residue; and Z is the residue that immediately lines the pore (note that the full diversity of BMC-H proteins includes more radical variants, including significant insertions and deletions into this loop (1Axen S.D. Erbilgin O. Kerfeld C.A. A taxonomy of bacterial microcompartment loci constructed by a novel scoring method.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2014; 10e1003898Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); however, these have not been structurally characterized, and an understanding of the characteristics of the pore they form is lacking). This pore-lining residue is important as its ability to interact with adjacent copies of the motif helps define pore diameter, conformation, and flexibility, while its properties define the interactions any ligands will be able to form as they pass through the pore. Most commonly, this pore-lining residue is small and polar, generally serine (in CcmK1, CcmK2, and CcmK4 from the β-carboxysome) or glycine (CsoS1A and CsoS1C from the α-carboxysome). In MSM0272, the pore-lining residue is an aspartate, Asp-40, which by default carries a negative charge, resulting in a pore environment with crowded carboxylate groups that should strongly repel one another. In the structure, the side chains of Asp-40 protrude on the convex face of the protein, forming a ring of carboxylates that face the solvent (Fig. 3, D–G). The carboxylate generally makes hydrogen bonds only to water molecules, although the nearby placement of the Lys-12 ζ-amine from the same or an adjacent protomer (generally around 3.5 Å, but not hydrogen bonded) helps stabilize the excess negative charge while adopting several alternative conformations; in some orthologs, Arg-12 is found to substitute. Two additional nearby acidic groups, Glu-10 and Glu-70, ensure that the convex face of the hexamer is highly acidic. Pore diameter is 5 Å (i.e. the diameter of the largest object that could readily pass through) at the Asp-40 amide nitrogen (which is relatively fixed), and a slightly narrower 4.5 Å at the level of the carboxylate group, which is more mobile. Interestingly, the second independent hexamer in the crystal displays an asymmetric conformation. Here Asp-40 of one chain is inserted into the pore, making a hydrogen bond to the amide backbone of an adjacent Asp-40; this conformation constricts the pore to 3.0 Å diameter (Fig. 3G). MSM0271 crystallized in space group P6322, diffracted to a resolution of 2.7 Å, and was refined to an Rfree of 22.4%. The asymmetric unit contains a trimer of protomers arranged in a ring, with each copy of the chain being largely identical (r.m.s.d. values of 0.2 Å or less). A second trimer related by crystallographic symmetry completes the hexameric double ring structure. Residues 10 to the C terminus (218) are ordered in all three protomers; however, residues 31–36 in the β1-α1 loop are disordered in all protomers (with 29 and 30 also disordered in one chain). MSM0275 crystallized in space group C2221 and diffracted to a resolution of 2.1 Å. The asymmetric unit contains six protomers arranged as a dimer of trimers. Of the 202 amino acids in the native protein 189 (chain E) to 201 (chain A), amino acids could be traced. Up to seven additional amino acids derived from the hexahistidine tag were ordered in chains A and B, forming a short antiparallel four α-helical bundle with tags from adjacent hexamers; this motif mediates the main packing interactions in the c direction between layers of molecules arranged in the a/b plane (not depicted). MSM0271 and MSM0275 are tandem domain shell proteins. The protomer is built from a pair of fused, permuted pfam00936 domains, each with a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (1, −2, 4, −3 and 5, −6, 8, −7 topology for the N- and C-terminal repeats respectively). Two α-helices α2 and α3 (α5 and α6 in the C-terminal domain) pack on one face of the β-sheet, while α1 (α4) is part of a long loop-helix-loop motif inserted between β1 and β2 (β4 and β5) packs on the opposite face and mediates interaction between adjacent rings. Although the protomeric organizations of MSM0271 and MSM0275 closely resemble one another (see Fig. 2, C and D; the chains can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 0.69 Å), MSM0275 and MSM0271 hexamers show emergent differences. MSM0275 rings associate in a manner similar to CsoS1D and CcmP, where interactions are mediated largely by α1 packing on its C-terminal domain equivalent helix, α4. The 2-fold symmetry axis run through the diagonals of the hexagon. MSM0271 uniquely has its domains offset by 60°, so α1 packs onto α1 and α4 packs onto α4; the internal symmetry axis therefore runs through the centers of the facets of the hexagon (Fig. 2, C and D). This unique arrangement requires two distinct sets of interactions to hold the rings together. It is worth noting that the two rings in MSM0271 and MSM0275 are not properly oriented to form a double-layered sheet with canonical BMC-H-like interactions. This is because, as noted previously for CcmP (15Cai F. Sutter M. Cameron J.C. Stanley D.N. Kinney J.N. Kerfeld C.A. The structure of CcmP, a tandem bacterial microcompartment domain protein from the β-carboxysome, forms a subcompartment within a microcompartment.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16055-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the two trimeric rings are not appropriately aligned but rather are offset by about 10°. One way to envision this is to map the locations of the 3-fold axes at the corners of the (pseudo)hexamers were these hexamers to partake in canonical facet packing (as seen in PduA; Fig. 4A). These axes are offset in the two layers (triangles in Fig. 2, C and D), meaning that BMC-FP proteins cannot pack into facet-like sheets with both rings simultaneously. The concave-to-concave interactions between rings in MSM0271 and MSM0275 create a substantive enclosed volume of space. Similar to what has previously been seen with the CsoS1D and CcmP structures (14Klein M.G. Zwart P. Bagby S.C. Cai F. Chisholm S.W. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. Kerfeld C.A.

In MSM0271 and MSM0275, this interaction seems especially strong, as it is stabilized by an additional inter-chain hydrogen bond contributed by Gln-82 (Gln-70). Arg-81 also packs on Gly-171 and Ala-172 of the topologically equivalent loop from the C-terminal repeat. In CsoS1D and CcmP, this conformation is present in only one ring, while the second ring adopts an open conformation that reveals a substantial (∼13 Å wide) pore. In MSM0271 and MSM0275, the rings on both protomers are closed, blocking access to the central cavity from outside. Atomic displacement parameters for these residues are similar to the rest of the structure, giving little indication of a tendency to opening by order-to-disorder transitions. All six copies of MSM0275 in the asymmetric unit can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. 0.29–0.55 Å. The only region where the protomeric structures diverge significantly is in the α1-helix and the loops connecting this motif to β1-β2 in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 4F). Residues Trp-24–Asn-33 are disordered in two of the six protomers. In one protomer, chain F, all residues are ordered and very closely match the conformation of the equivalent residues in CsoS1D and CcmP, in a conformation that we will refer to as the retracted conformation. Two additional chains (A and B) closely match this conformation, but residues 29–32 are displaced up to 2 Å from the site of chain F. In chain D, the C-terminal end"

One natural process that could facilitate the recovery of reef ecosystems is coral recruitment, which can be influenced by the benthic organisms in a local habitat. We experimentally tested both a global stressor (increased seawater temperature) and a local stressor (exposure to microcolin A, a natural product from a common marine benthic cyanobacterium) to determine how these stressors impacted coral larval sublethal stress, survival and settlement. Larvae of Porites astreoides had the same survival and settlement as the controls after exposure to increased temperature alone, but elevated temperature did cause oxidative stress. When exposed to natural concentrations of microcolin A, larval survival and settlement were significantly reduced. When larvae were exposed to these two stressors sequentially there was no interactive effect; but when exposed to both stressors simultaneously, there was a synergistic reduction in larval survival and an increase in oxidative stress more than in either stressor treatment alone. Increased seawater temperatures made larvae more susceptible to a concurrent local stressor disrupting a key process of coral reef recovery and resilience. These results highlight the importance of understanding how interactive stressors of varying spatial scales can impact coral demographics."
https://openalex.org/W2560658872,"Small-scale fisheries are important to livelihoods and subsistence seafood consumption of millions of fishers. Sea cucumbers are fished worldwide for export to Asia, yet few studies have assessed factors affecting socioeconomics and wellbeing among fishers. We interviewed 476 men and women sea cucumber fishers at multiple villages within multiple locations in Fiji, Kiribati, Tonga and New Caledonia using structured questionnaires. Low rates of subsistence consumption confirmed a primary role of sea cucumbers in income security. Prices of sea cucumbers sold by fishers varied greatly among countries, depending on the species. Gender variation in landing prices could be due to women catching smaller sea cucumbers or because some traders take advantage of them. Dissatisfaction with fishery income was common (44% of fishers), especially for i-Kiribati fishers, male fishers, and fishers experiencing difficulty selling their catch, but was uncorrelated with sale prices. Income dissatisfaction worsened with age. The number of livelihood activities averaged 2.2–2.5 across countries, and varied significantly among locations. Sea cucumbers were often a primary source of income to fishers, especially in Tonga. Other common livelihood activities were fishing other marine resources, copra production in Kiribati, agriculture in Fiji, and salaried jobs in New Caledonia. Fishing other coastal and coral reef resources was the most common fall-back livelihood option if fishers were forced to exit the fishery. Our data highlight large disparities in subsistence consumption, gender-related price equity, and livelihood diversity among parallel artisanal fisheries. Improvement of supply chains in dispersed small-scale fisheries appears as a critical need for enhancing income and wellbeing of fishers. Strong evidence for co-dependence among small-scale fisheries, through fall-back livelihood preferences of fishers, suggests that resource managers must mitigate concomitant effects on other fisheries when considering fishery closures. That is likely to depend on livelihood diversification programs to take pressure off co-dependent fisheries."

However, this inevitably induces macrophage-mediated immune response against the graft, limiting its therapeutic efficacy. Monitoring the magnitude of the immune response using imaging tools would be useful for prolonging graft survival and increasing the therapy longevity. Minimally invasive quantitative detection of activated macrophages by medical imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging targets translocator protein (TSPO), which is highly expressed on mitochondrial membrane, especially in activated macrophage. N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy) phenyl]-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-acetamide (DPA-714) is known as a TSPO ligand used in clinical settings. We herein hypothesized that immune rejection of the transplanted iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) of allogeneic origin may be quantitated using 18F-DPA-714-PET imaging study. iPSC-CM cell-sheets of C57BL/6 mice origin were transplanted on the surface of the left ventricle (LV) of C57BL/6 mice as a syngeneic cell-transplant model (syngeneic Tx group), or Balb/c mice as an allogeneic model (allogeneic Tx group). 18F-DPA-714-PET was used to determine the uptake ratio, calculated as the maximum standardized uptake value in the anterior and septal wall of the LV. The uptake ratio was significantly higher in the allogeneic Tx group than in the syngeneic group or the sham group at days 7 and day 10 after the cell transplantation. In addition, the immunochemistry showed significant presence of CD68 and CD3-positive cells at day 7 and 10 in the transplanted graft of the allogeneic Tx group. The expression of TSPO, CD68, IL-1 beta, and MCP-1 was significantly higher in the allogeneic Tx group than in the syngeneic Tx and the sham groups at day 7. The 18F-DPA-714-PET imaging study enabled quantitative visualization of the macrophages-mediated immune rejection of the allogeneic iPSC-cardiac. This imaging tool may enable the understanding and monitoring host-immune response of the host, allogeneic cell transplantation therapy."

The p85 subunit of PI3K consists of an SH3 domain, a RhoGAP domain, and two SH2 domains, which are designated as nSH2 and cSH2 for the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains, respectively. The consensus SH2-binding sequence of Grb2 and Gads is pYXNX, whereas that of p85, either nSH2 or cSH2, is pYXXM. Although these three adaptor molecules activate different signaling pathways downstream of CD28 as mentioned above, the SH2 domains of all the molecules can bind to CD28 at the same site, YMNM, after the phosphorylation of its first Tyr. Because our previous report showed that both nSH2 and cSH2 of p85 have a higher affinity to pYMNM than Grb2 and Gads (15Higo K. Oda M. Morii H. Takahashi J. Harada Y. Ogawa S. Abe R. Quantitative analysis of CD28 interaction with cytoplasmic adapter molecules Grb2, Gads and p85 PI3K by surface plasmon resonance.Immunol. Invest. 2014; 43: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it is likely that the high affinity of p85 SH2 to CD28 results in a sequestration of CD28 from other SH2 domains, although we need to know the relative concentration of the proteins to draw such a conclusion. However, both Grb2-CD28 and Gads-CD28 interactions are also important for CD28-mediated co-stimulation. It remains unclear how these three adaptor molecules structurally bind to CD28 and elicit the proper co-stimulatory function of CD28. We have recently reported the crystal structure of Grb2 SH2 complexed with a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide derived from CD28 (16Higo K. Ikura T. Oda M. Morii H. Takahashi J. Abe R. Ito N. High resolution crystal structure of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a phosphopeptide derived from CD28.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e74482Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that the peptide adopted the twisted U-type conformation. Here, we report the crystal structures and the thermodynamic analyses of Gads SH2, p85 nSH2, and cSH2 in complex with the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide derived from CD28. The structures reveal the bent conformation of CD28-derived peptide in Gads SH2, whereas the extended conformation is observed in both p85 nSH2 and cSH2. The conformational variations of the peptide together with the detailed interaction manner between the peptide and SH2s confirm the results of the thermodynamic analyses. High resolution structures of 1.20, 0.90, and 1.10 Å for Gads SH2, p85 nSH2, and cSH2, respectively, reported here should also be good templates for further computational analysis, such as molecular dynamics simulations and rational design of new ligands. All the SH2 domains analyzed in this study were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins but purified in GST-free form after the thrombin digestion. The sequence homology between Gads SH2 and Grb2 SH2 is 55.9%, and that between p85 nSH2 and cSH2 is 35.2% (Fig. 1). Our first construct for the Gads SH2 (Trp58–His155) expression has an additional 5 residues, GSPEF, at the N terminus that is a cloning artifact and remained attached even after digestion by thrombin, similar to the construct for Grb2 SH2 whose crystal structure was previously determined at 1.35-Å resolution (16Higo K. Ikura T. Oda M. Morii H. Takahashi J. Abe R. Ito N. High resolution crystal structure of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a phosphopeptide derived from CD28.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e74482Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the protein was successfully crystallized in complex with CD28-derived 8-residue phosphopeptide, SDpYMNMTP, designated as OctP, its diffractions were limited to a relatively low resolution (∼3 Å). To improve the resolution, we expressed Gads SH2 with the C-terminal 6 residues (Arg150–His155) deleted, but only the free form of Gads SH2 was crystallized (data not shown). Our final construct has shorter N-terminal additional residues, Gly-Ser, and the original C terminus, His155, which produced high quality crystals in complex with OctP. The additional sequence, Gly-Ser, was necessary because of thrombin digestion. The modification of N and C termini of Gads SH2 described above had little effect on its CD28 binding (data not shown). Consequently, a similar approach was taken for both p85 nSH2 (Asn325–Lys430) and cSH2 (Glu614–Ala720) where the proteins were expressed with two additional residues, Gly-Ser, at the N terminus and co-crystallized with Oct-P. For crystallization experiments, all the SH2 domains were concentrated to about 1 mm in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Freeze-dried OctP was suspended in the same buffer, and the suspended solution was added to SH2 solutions in apparent molar ratios of ∼2:1. Crystals of Gads SH2, p85 nSH2, and cSH2 in complex with OctP were obtained from the following screening buffers: 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, and 20% (v/v) (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol for Gads SH2-OctP complex; 100 mm sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6), 30% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 2000, and 200 mm ammonium sulfate for p85 nSH2-OctP complex; and 100 mm sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6), 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 200 mm ammonium acetate for p85 cSH2-OctP complex. The crystals appeared within 2 weeks and grew with maximum dimensions as follows: 0.1 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm for Gads SH2-OctP, 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm for p85 nSH2-OctP, and 0.1 × 0.2 × 1 mm for p85 cSH2-OctP. The crystal structure of Gads SH2 complexed with OctP was determined at 1.20-Å resolution (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The overall structure of Gads SH2 consists of a central antiparallel β-sheet flanked by two α-helices, which is similar to that of Grb2 and other SH2 domains (Fig. 2B) reported previously (17Liu B.A. Engelmann B.W. Nash P.D. The language of SH2 domain interactions defines phosphotyrosine-mediated signal transduction.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of p85 nSH2 and cSH2 complexed with OctP were also determined at 0.90- and 1.10-Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 1). These complexes also show similar structures to that of Gads SH2 (Fig. 2, E and F). The root mean square deviations of main-chain structures between Grb2 SH2 and Gads SH2, Gads SH2 and p85 nSH2, and p85 nSH2 and cSH2 are 0.428, 1.320, and 0.875 Å, respectively. Despite the high similarity of the overall structures, the recognition mechanism of the phosphopeptide is quite different between Gads SH2 and p85 SH2 domains, probably reflecting the differences in consensus amino acid sequences, as described below.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsGads-OctPnSH2-OctPcSH2-OctPData collectionWavelength (Å)0.70000.98000.9800Space groupP212121P1P212121Unit cell parametersa/b/c (Å)33.60/53.34/108.3027.59/31.24/32.2540.60/41.44/64.85α/β/γ (°)73.28/85.38/71.73Resolution (Å)50-1.20 (1.27-1.20)30.9-0.90 (0.95-0.90)50-1.10 (1.13-1.10)No. of observations403,340359,798385,500No. of unique reflections61,48465,07645,133Completeness (%)99.3 (99.3)89.5 (81.1)100 (100)Average I/σ(I)14.5 (3.7)18.1 (4.0)17.7 (6.3)Redundancy6.6 (6.7)5.5 (3.9)8.5 (6.9)RsymaRsym = ΣΣi|I(h) − I(h)i|/ΣΣiI(h) where I(h) is the mean intensity after rejection.

Open table in a new tab The recognition mode of Gads SH2 for CD28 phosphopeptide is very similar to that of Grb2 SH2. The side chains of Arg65, Arg83, Ser87, and Ser93 together with the main chain of Gln86 are involved in a salt bridge and hydrogen bonding with the phosphate group (Fig. 3A). The main chains of Lys106 and Leu117 interact with Asn at pY+2 via hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3B). The bound OctP adopts a bent conformation (Fig. 3C), similar to a type I β-turn but different from the canonical conformation, as reported previously in Grb2 SH2-peptide complex (16Higo K. Ikura T. Oda M. Morii H. Takahashi J. Abe R. Ito N. High resolution crystal structure of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a phosphopeptide derived from CD28.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e74482Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The bulky side chain of Trp121 in Grb2 SH2 is considered to force the bound peptide into the bent conformation. Because this Trp residue is conserved as Trp118 in Gads SH2 and its side chain orientation is stabilized by the cation-π interaction with another conserved residue, Arg139, OctP is also forced to bend in the complex with Gads SH2 to avoid steric hindrance. In contrast, OctP is in a more extended conformation in the crystal structures of p85 nSH2 and cSH2 complexes as we modeled previously (16Higo K. Ikura T. Oda M. Morii H. Takahashi J. Abe R. Ito N. High resolution crystal structure of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a phosphopeptide derived from CD28.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e74482Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The residue Asn at pY+2 is exposed to the solvent and does not interact with any residues in either p85 nSH2 or cSH2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Instead, the side chain of Met at pY+3, which is oriented toward the solvent in the structure of Gads SH2 complexed with OctP, sticks into the hydrophobic pocket of both p85 nSH2 and p85 cSH2 (Fig. 4, A and B). The pockets are formed by Ile381, Phe392, Leu413, Tyr416, and Leu420 in p85 nSH2 and corresponding residues of Cys670, Phe681, Leu703, His706, and Leu710 in p85 cSH2, respectively. Interestingly, Met at pY+3 occupies almost the same position for Trp118 of Gads SH2. There is neither a Trp nor a bulky residue at this position in both p85 nSH2 and cSH2 as the corresponding residue is Ser393 and Ala682 for p85 nSH2 and cSH2, respectively. The lack of bulky residue and slight conformational changes in this region allow Met at pY+3 to reach the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 4, C and D). The absence of a bulky residue in p85 nSH2 and cSH2 also allows OctP to adopt extended conformations. The two SH2 domains in p85 show a similar molecular recognition toward the phosphate group of the phosphotyrosine; the salt bridge and hydrogen bonding to the phosphate group are formed with the side chains of Arg340, Arg358, Ser361, and Thr369 in p85 nSH2 (Fig. 4E) and with the side chains of Arg631, Arg649, Ser651, and Ser652 in p85 cSH2. However, p85 cSH2 has an additional unique cation-π interaction between the side chain of Arg631 and aromatic ring of the phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4F), which is not observed in p85 nSH2. This additional interaction seems to contribute to binding of the phosphotyrosine residue more tightly than in p85 nSH2. The interactions of CD28-derived 12-amino acid phosphopeptide SDpYMNMTPRRP, designated as DdcP, with SH2 domains of Gads, Grb2, and p85 were analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Because of the low solubility of OctP, more soluble DdcP was used for the ITC experiments. Fig. 5, A–D, show the typical ITC profile of CD28 binding to SH2 domains, and the thermodynamic parameters are summarized in Table 2. All interactions between CD28 and SH2 domains showed exothermic reactions. The binding affinity of Gads SH2 was similar to that of Grb2 SH2, and their binding thermodynamics were comparable. The binding affinities of p85 nSH2 and cSH2 were higher than those of Grb2 SH2 and Gads SH2 mainly because of the favorable enthalpy change (ΔH). In comparison with the two SH2 domains of p85, the binding affinity of cSH2 was about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of nSH2 mainly because of the favorable ΔH. The heat capacity changes (ΔCp) for binding were successfully obtained from temperature-dependent ΔH changes in the range of 15–30 °C and are summarized in Table 2. The p85 cSH2 domain had the largest ΔCp value of the group.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for interaction between CD28 phosphopeptide and SH2 domains of Grb2, Gads, and PI3K at 25 °CnKaThe values were calculated from ΔH measured at four different temperatures between 15 and 30 °C.ΔGΔHTΔSΔCpaThe values were calculated from ΔH measured at four different temperatures between 15 and 30 °C./mkcal/molkcal/mol KGrb2 SH20.974.39 × 105−7.76−7.250.51−0.202Gads SH20.964.04 × 105−7.64−7.75−0.10−0.149p85 nSH20.993.67 × 106−8.85−18.39−9.44−0.229nSH2 S393W0.971.75 × 106−8.51−16.61−8.10p85 cSH20.972.15 × 107−10.00−21.86−11.86−0.244cSH2 A628W0.975.97 × 106−9.24−21.66−12.42a The values were calculated from ΔH measured at four different temperatures between 15 and 30 °C. Open table in a new tab The residues Ser393 in nSH2 and Ala628 in cSH2, corresponding to Trp118 in Gads, were mutated to Trp, and the binding thermodynamics of mutants to DdcP were analyzed using ITC (Table 2). Upon mutation, the binding affinities were slightly lower than those of wild types but still higher than those of Grb2 SH2 and Gads SH2. The crystal structure analyses of three SH2 domains, Gads SH2, p85 nSH2, and p85 cSH2, in complex with a CD28-derived peptide showed details of their peptide recognition, and the structures correlate well with their binding thermodynamics. The most striking result of the study is that the same CD28-peptide is recognized in a different manner, especially in the conformation of the bound peptide, despite the fact that they share high sequence similarity. In the case of p85 nSH2 and cSH2, the bound peptide showed an extended conformation, and Met at pY+3 position makes hydrophobic interactions with the protein (Fig. 6B). In contrast, Gads SH2 has a series of bulky residues, Phe105, Trp118, and Arg139, to force the phosphopeptide to adopt a bent conformation (Fig. 6A), similar to the conformation seen in Grb2 SH2 (16Higo K. Ikura T. Oda M. Morii H. Takahashi J. Abe R. Ito N. High resolution crystal structure of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a phosphopeptide derived from CD28.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e74482Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As a result, Met at pY+3 loses contact with the protein, and Asn at pY+2, needed for the specific interaction, forms hydrogen bonds with the protein. Thr and Pro at pY+4 and pY+5 also make no contact with Grb2 SH2. The bent conformation and fewer contacts with less hydrophobic interaction between OctP peptide and Grb2/Gads SH2 would be the reason for the lower binding affinity than those in p85 nSH2 and cSH2 as determined by our ITC experiments (Table 2). The larger ΔCp values in p85 nSH2 and cSH2 also support the larger hydrophobic interactions (18Spolar R.S. Livingstone J.R. Record Jr., M.T.

Freire E. Thermodynamics of structural stability and cooperative folding behavior in proteins.Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 313-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the previous mutational study in Grb2 (20Papaioannou D. Geibel S. Kunze M.B. Kay C.W. Waksman G. Structural and biophysical investigation of the interaction of a mutant Grb2 SH2 domain (W121G) with its cognate phosphopeptide.Protein Sci. 2016; 25: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), our mutational study also supports the notion that the Trp residue, corresponding to Trp118 in Gads, is not the determining factor for the conformation of bound phosphopeptide (Table 2). The binding affinity of p85 cSH2 was about 10-fold higher than that of p85 nSH2. This can be explained by the different recognition for the phosphotyrosine of CD28. In p85 cSH2, the side chain of Arg631 is located at the closed site of the phosphotyrosine side chain forming cation-π interaction (Fig. 4F). In p85 nSH2, the corresponding residue, Arg340, is located far from the phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4E). This additional interaction in cSH2 would contribute to the favorable binding enthalpy change. It should also be noted that the binding enthalpy change of p85 cSH2 is a significantly larger value compared with the other SH2 domains analyzed in this study and has been reported previously (21O'Brien R. Rugman P. Renzoni D. Layton M. Handa R. Hilyard K. Waterfield M.D. Driscoll P.C. Ladbury J.E. Alternative modes of binding of proteins with tandem SH2 domains.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The favorable ΔH is partially compensated by the unfavorable entropy change (ΔS), which is a general phenomenon of biomolecular interactions (22Oda M. Furukawa K. Ogata K. Sarai A. Nakamura H.

The binding thermodynamics of Grb2 SH2, p85 nSH2, and p85 cSH2 to phosphopeptides different from the CD28 peptide have been reported previously (21O'Brien R. Rugman P. Renzoni D. Layton M. Handa R.

Thermodynamic and structural analysis of phosphotyrosine polypeptide binding to Grb2-SH2.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10006-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of Grb2 SH2 to the Shc-derived phosphopeptide SpYVNVQ is about 10 times higher than that to DdcP02, SDpYMNMTPRRPG (24McNemar C. Snow M.E. Windsor W.T. Prongay A. Mui P. Zhang R.

The NMR structure of Grb2 SH2 in complex with Shc-derived peptide showed that the Shc peptide forms a β-turn (25Ogura K. Tsuchiya S. Terasawa H. Yuzawa S. Hatanaka H. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. Conformation of an Shc-derived phosphotyrosine-containing peptide complexed with the Grb2 SH2 domain.J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is slightly different from the twisted conformation of CD28-peptide bound to Grb2 SH2. This would be mainly due to the residue at pY+3, Val of Shc peptide and Met of CD28 peptide. The side chain of Met would prevent the bound peptide from forming a canonical β-turn, resulting in the decreased binding affinity. The binding affinity of p85 nSH2 to platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-derived phosphopeptide SVDpYVDMSK is similar to that of the CD28 peptide (23Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Measurement of the binding of tyrosyl phosphopeptides to SH2 domains: a reappraisal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In comparison with the binding of cSH2 to the PDGFR-derived phosphopeptide GGpYMDMSKDESVDYVPML, both enthalpy and entropy changes for the binding to the CD28 peptide are more negative, more favorable enthalpy change and less favorable entropy change (23Ladbury J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2560381055,"The membrane protein RFT1 is essential for normal protein N-glycosylation, but its precise function is not known. RFT1 was originally proposed to translocate the glycolipid Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol (needed to synthesize N-glycan precursors) across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, but subsequent studies showed that it does not play a direct role in transport. In contrast to the situation in yeast, RFT1 is not essential for growth of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, enabling the study of its function in a null background. We now report that lack of T. brucei RFT1 (TbRFT1) not only affects protein N-glycosylation but also glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor side-chain modification. Analysis by immunoblotting, metabolic labeling, and mass spectrometry demonstrated that the major GPI-anchored proteins of T. brucei procyclic forms have truncated GPI anchor side chains in TbRFT1 null parasites when compared with wild-type cells, a defect that is corrected by expressing a tagged copy of TbRFT1 in the null background. In vivo and in vitro labeling experiments using radiolabeled GPI precursors showed that GPI underglycosylation was not the result of decreased formation of the GPI precursor lipid or defective galactosylation of GPI intermediates in the endoplasmic reticulum, but rather due to modifications that are expected to occur in the Golgi apparatus. Unexpectedly, immunofluorescence microscopy localized TbRFT1 to both the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi, consistent with the proposal that TbRFT1 plays a direct or indirect role in GPI anchor glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus. Our results implicate RFT1 in a wider range of glycosylation processes than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2560838255,"Oncogenic FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and FGFR3 mutations are target candidates for small molecule inhibitors in bladder cancer (BC). Because FGFR3 and TACC3 genes are located very closely on chromosome 4p16.3, detection of the fusion by DNA-FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) is not a feasible option. In this study, we developed a novel RNA-FISH assay using branched DNA probe to detect FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human BC samples.The RNA-FISH assay was developed and validated using a mouse xenograft model with human BC cell lines. Next, we assessed the consistency of the RNA-FISH assay using 104 human BC samples. In this study, primary BC tissues were stored as frozen and FFPE tissues. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were independently detected in FFPE sections by the RNA-FISH assay and in frozen tissues by RT-PCR. We also analyzed the presence of FGFR3 mutations by targeted sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from deparaffinized FFPE sections.FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts were identified by RNA-FISH and RT-PCR in mouse xenograft FFPE tissues using the human BC cell lines RT112 and RT4. These cell lines have been reported to be fusion-positive. Signals for FGFR3-TACC3 fusions by RNA-FISH were positive in 2/60 (3%) of non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and 2/44 (5%) muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) patients. The results of RT-PCR of all 104 patients were identical to those of RNA-FISH. FGFR3 mutations were detected in 27/60 (45%) NMIBC and 8/44 (18%) MIBC patients. Except for one NMIBC patient, FGFR3 mutation and FGFR3-TACC3 fusion were mutually exclusive.We developed an RNA-FISH assay for detection of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in FFPE samples of human BC tissues. Screening for not only FGFR3 mutations, but also for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts has the potential to identify additional patients that can be treated with FGFR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2560737393,"Mitochondria play a central role in pancreatic β-cell nutrient sensing by coupling their metabolism to plasma membrane excitability and insulin granule exocytosis. Whether non-nutrient secretagogues stimulate mitochondria as part of the molecular mechanism to promote insulin secretion is not known. Here, we show that PKC signaling, which is employed by many non-nutrient secretagogues, augments mitochondrial respiration in INS-1E (rat insulinoma cell line clone 1E) and human pancreatic β cells. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, accelerates mitochondrial respiration at both resting and stimulatory glucose concentrations. A range of inhibitors of novel PKC isoforms prevent phorbol ester-induced respiration. Respiratory response was blocked by oligomycin that demonstrated PKC-dependent acceleration of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Enhanced respiration was observed even when glycolysis was bypassed or fatty acid transport was blocked, which suggested that PKC regulates mitochondrial processes rather than upstream catabolic fluxes. A phosphoproteome study of phorbol ester-stimulated INS-1E cells maintained under resting (2.5 mM) glucose revealed a large number of phosphorylation sites that were altered during short-term activation of PKC signaling. The data set was enriched for proteins that are involved in gene expression, cytoskeleton remodeling, secretory vesicle transport, and exocytosis. Interactome analysis identified PKC, C-Raf, and ERK1/2 as the central phosphointeraction cluster. Prevention of ERK1/2 signaling by using a MEK1 inhibitor caused a marked decreased in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced mitochondrial respiration. ERK1/2 signaling module therefore links PKC activation to downstream mitochondrial activation. We conclude that non-nutrient secretagogues act, in part, via PKC and downstream ERK1/2 signaling to stimulate mitochondrial energy production to compensate for energy expenditure that is linked to β-cell activation.-Santo-Domingo, J., Chareyron, I., Dayon, L., Galindo, A.

Methods Data were collected from 15,407 individuals enrolled in the first through the fifth phases of the Korea Health Panel Survey (2008–2012) using structured questionnaires examining retirement, morbidities, and health-related behaviors. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine demographic and clinical characteristics’ effects on ill health retirement. Lost years of working life expectancy were calculated for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results Older, female, and manual workers were more likely to experience ill health retirement, as were respondents reporting poor health-related habits (e.g., heavy drinking, irregular meals, less sleep hours, obesity, and no regular exercise). The chronic diseases most closely associated with ill health retirement were, in order, psychiatric disease, ophthalmologic disease, neurologic disease, infectious disease, and musculoskeletal diseases. The average reduction in working life expectancy was 9.73 years. Conclusions Our study results can help contribute to the development of strategies for reducing the risk of ill health retirement and promoting sustainable labor force participation in an aging society."
https://openalex.org/W2560473623,"The present study was conducted in pregnant rhesus monkeys to determine the rapidity and extent to which BPA reaches the fetal compartment following oral ingestion, and the 24-hr fate of BPA. To assess metabolism changes during the course of pregnancy, we compared BPA biotransformation during the second and third trimesters in the same animals, measuring the levels of sulfated, gluronidated, and free BPA in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and fetal serum. All animals showed measurable unconjugated and conjugated BPA in the fetal compartment and slow clearance compared to maternal serum. There were higher levels of BPA-G in amniotic fluid at 150 days gestation compared to 100 days gestation, as well as higher levels of BPA-G than BPA-S. We also monitored 3H-BPA (and metabolites) in key tissues and excreta from a mother and fetus and from a non-pregnant female. The elimination of radioactivity was rapid, but residues were still detectable 24 hr after dosing in all tissues analyzed. These data suggest that, in primates, rapid maternal processing of BPA does not alleviate the risk of exposure to the developing fetus. This study elevates concerns about levels of current BPA human exposure from potentially a large number of unknown sources and the risks posed to developing fetuses."
https://openalex.org/W2560128090,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) expands the scope of a conventional pairwise meta-analysis to simultaneously compare multiple treatments, which has an inherent appeal for clinicians, patients, and policy decision makers. Two recent reports have shown that the impact of excluding a treatment on NMAs can be substantial. However, no one has assessed the impact of excluding a trial from NMAs, which is important because many NMAs selectively include trials in the analysis. This article empirically examines the impact of trial exclusion using both the arm-based (AB) and contrast-based (CB) approaches, by reanalyzing 20 published NMAs involving 725 randomized controlled trials and 449,325 patients. For the population-averaged absolute risk estimates using the AB approach, the average fold changes across all networks ranged from 1.004 (with standard deviation 0.004) to 1.072 (with standard deviation 0.184); while the maximal fold changes ranged from 1.032 to 2.349. In 12 out of 20 NMAs, a 1.20-fold or larger change is observed in at least one of the population-averaged absolute risk estimates. In addition, while excluding a trial can substantially change the estimated relative effects (e.g., log odds ratios), there is no systematic difference in terms of changes between the two approaches. Changes in treatment rankings are observed in 7 networks and changes in inconsistency are observed in 3 networks. We do not observe correlations between changes in treatment effects, treatment rankings and inconsistency. Finally, we recommend rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, logical study selection process, and reasonable network geometry to ensure robustness and generalizability of the results of NMAs."
https://openalex.org/W2560444044,"Epidemic HIV-2 (groups A and B) emerged in humans circa 1930-40. Its closest ancestors are SIVsmm infecting sooty mangabeys from southwestern Côte d'Ivoire. The earliest large-scale serological surveys of HIV-2 in West Africa (1985-91) show a patchy spread. Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau had the highest prevalence rates by then, and phylogeographical analysis suggests they were the earliest epicenters. Wars and parenteral transmission have been hypothesized to have promoted HIV-2 spread. Male circumcision (MC) is known to correlate negatively with HIV-1 prevalence in Africa, but studies examining this issue for HIV-2 are lacking.We reviewed published HIV-2 serosurveys for 30 cities of all West African countries and obtained credible estimates of real prevalence through Bayesian estimation. We estimated past MC rates of 218 West African ethnic groups, based on ethnographic literature and fieldwork. We collected demographic tables specifying the ethnic partition in cities. Uncertainty was incorporated by defining plausible ranges of parameters (e.g. timing of introduction, proportion circumcised). We generated 1,000 sets of past MC rates per city using Latin Hypercube Sampling with different parameter combinations, and explored the correlation between HIV-2 prevalence and estimated MC rate (both logit-transformed) in the 1,000 replicates.Our survey reveals that, in the early 20th century, MC was far less common and geographically more variable than nowadays. HIV-2 prevalence in 1985-91 and MC rates in 1950 were negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.546, IQR: -0.553--0.546, p≤0.0021). Guinea-Bissau and Côte d'Ivoire cities had markedly lower MC rates. In addition, MC was uncommon in rural southwestern Côte d'Ivoire in 1930.The differential HIV-2 spread in West Africa correlates with different historical MC rates. We suggest HIV-2 only formed early substantial foci in cities with substantial uncircumcised populations. Lack of MC in rural areas exposed to bushmeat may have had a role in successful HIV-2 emergence."

In this research, we present a comprehensive view of trans-states brain connectivity variation based on continuous scalp EEG, extending beyond traditional stimuli-lock averaging or restriction to short time scales of hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset. The scalp EEG was collected under three conditions: quiet, memory, and control. The only difference between the memory and control conditions was that in the memory condition, subjects made an effort to retain information. We started our investigation with calibrations of Pearson correlation in EEG analysis and then derived two indices, link strength and node connectivity, to make comparisons between different states. Finally, we constructed and studied trans-state brain connectivity variation topography. Comparing memory and control states with quiet state, we found that the beta topography highlights links between T5/T6 and O1/O2, which represents the visual ventral stream, and the gamma topography conveys strengthening of inter-hemisphere links and weakening of intra-hemisphere frontal-posterior links, implying parallel inter-hemisphere coordination combined with sequential intra-hemisphere coordination when subjects are confronted with visual stimuli and a motor task. For comparison between memory and control states, we also found that the node connectivity of T6 stands out in gamma topography, which provides strong proof from scalp EEG for the information binding or relational processing function of the temporal lobe in memory formation. To our knowledge, this is the first time for any method to effectively capture brain connectivity variation associated with working memory from a relatively large scale both in time (from a second to a minute) and in space (from the scalp). The method can track brain activity continuously with minimal manual interruptions; therefore, it has promising potential in applications such as brain computer interfaces and brain training."

https://openalex.org/W2560336729,"Railway and metro transport systems (RS) are becoming one of the popular choices of transportation among people, especially those who live in urban cities. Urbanization and increasing population due to rapid development of economy in many cities are leading to a bigger demand for urban rail transit. Despite being a popular variant of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), it appears that the universal formula or techniques to solve the problem are yet to be found. This paper aims to develop an optimization algorithm for optimum route selection to multiple destinations in RS before returning to the starting point. Bee foraging behaviour is examined to generate a reliable algorithm in railway TSP. The algorithm is then verified by comparing the results with the exact solutions in 10 test cases, and a numerical case study is designed to demonstrate the application with large size sample. It is tested to be efficient and effective in railway route planning as the tour can be completed within a certain period of time by using minimal resources. The findings further support the reliability of the algorithm and capability to solve the problems with different complexity. This algorithm can be used as a method to assist business practitioners making better decision in route planning."

However, little were known about the possible effect of auricular electro-acupuncture (AEA) on diabetic rats. Thus, we designed this study to investigate the effect of AEA on streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Method Forty male Sprague_Dawley (SD) rats were injected with STZ, at the end of 8th week after injection, animals were randomly divided into four groups and received 2 weeks-treatment(10 times) respectively: control group(CON,n = 10, no stimulation), sham auricular electro-acupuncture group(SEA,n = 10, low frequency EA on earlobes), auricular eletro-acupuncture group(AEA,n = 10, low frequency EA on ear point ‘stomach’), and ST-36 group(ST-36,n = 10, low frequency EA on ST-36). Gastrointestinal (GI) motility was measured by GI transit rate. ICCs(c-kit+ expression) in antrum were analyzed by Immunohistochemistry and western blotting. NO level in blood serum were detected by Griess Reagent, and nNOSmRNA expression in antrum were determined by Real-time PCR. Results GI transit rate and ICCs(c-kit+ expression) in antrum of AEA group have the tendency to increase compared with CON group, but had no statistics difference (P>0.05). nNOSmRNA expression in antrum of AEA group was dramatically increased compared with CON group (P = 0.037). Conclusions Low frequency EA on ear ‘stomach’ point could significantly up-regulate nNOS mRNA expression and ameliorate the ICCs networks partly in gastric antrum of STZ -induced diabetic rats, which may has benefits on regulating the GI motility."
https://openalex.org/W2560321604,"Transferring mouse mutations into specific mouse strain backgrounds can be critical for appropriate analysis of phenotypic effects of targeted genomic alterations and quantitative trait loci. Speed congenic breeding strategies incorporating marker-assisted selection of progeny with the highest percentage target background as breeders for the next generation can produce congenic strains within approximately 5 generations. When mating selected donor males to target strain females, this may require more than 1 year, with each generation lasting 10 to 11 weeks including 3 weeks of gestation and 7 to 8 weeks until the males reach sexual maturity. Because ovulation can be induced in female mice as early as 3 weeks of age, superovulation-aided backcrossing of marker-selected females could accelerate the production of congenic animals by approximately 4 weeks per generation, reducing time and cost. Using this approach, we transferred a transgenic strain of undefined genetic background to >99% C57BL/6J within 10 months, with most generations lasting 7 weeks. This involved less than 60 mice in total, with 9 to 18 animals per generation. Our data demonstrate that high-speed backcrossing through the female germline is feasible and practical with small mouse numbers."
https://openalex.org/W2560677798,"The Escherichia coli origin of replication, oriC, comprises mostly binding sites of two proteins: DnaA, a positive regulator, and SeqA, a negative regulator. SeqA, although not essential, is required for timely initiation, and during rapid growth, synchronous initiation from multiple origins. Unlike DnaA, details of SeqA binding to oriC are limited. Here we have determined that SeqA binds to all its sites tested (9/11) and with variable efficiency. Titration of DnaA alters SeqA binding to two sites, both of which have overlapping DnaA sites. The altered SeqA binding, however, does not affect initiation synchrony. Synchrony is also unaffected when individual SeqA sites are mutated. An apparent exception was one mutant where the mutation also changed an overlapping DnaA site. In this mutant, the observed asynchrony could be from altered DnaA binding, as selectively mutating this SeqA site did not cause asynchrony. These results reveal robust initiation synchrony against alterations of individual SeqA binding sites. The redundancy apparently ensures SeqA function in controlling replication in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2560432673,"Animals navigate their environment using a variety of senses and strategies. This multiplicity enables them to respond to different navigational requirements resulting from habitat, scale and purpose. One of the challenges social animals face is how to reunite after periods of separation. We explore a variety of possible mechanisms used to reunite the members of a cheetah coalition dispersed within a large area after prolonged separation. Using GPS data from three cheetahs reuniting after weeks of separation, we determined that 1) the likelihood of purely coincidental reunion is miniscule 2) the reunion occurred in an area not normally frequented 3) with very little time spent in the region in advance of the reunion. We therefore propose that timely encounter of scent markings where paths cross is the most likely mechanism used to aid the reunion."

Casting virtual shadows on real and virtual objects is one of the topics of research being conducted in this area. In this paper, we propose a new method for creating complex AR indoor scenes using real time depth detection to exert virtual shadows on virtual and real environments. A Kinect camera was used to produce a depth map for the physical scene mixing into a single real-time transparent tacit surface. Once this is created, the camera's position can be tracked from the reconstructed 3D scene. Real objects are represented by virtual object phantoms in the AR scene enabling users holding a webcam and a standard Kinect camera to capture and reconstruct environments simultaneously. The tracking capability of the algorithm is shown and the findings are assessed drawing upon qualitative and quantitative methods making comparisons with previous AR phantom generation applications. The results demonstrate the robustness of the technique for realistic indoor rendering in AR systems."
https://openalex.org/W2560069479,"Research on infants’ reasoning abilities often rely on looking times, which are longer to surprising and unexpected visual scenes compared to unsurprising and expected ones. Few researchers have examined more precise visual scanning patterns in these scenes, and so, here, we recorded 8- to 11-month-olds’ gaze with an eye tracker as we presented a sampling event whose outcome was either surprising, neutral, or unsurprising: A red (or yellow) ball was drawn from one of three visible containers populated 0%, 50%, or 100% with identically colored balls. When measuring looking time to the whole scene, infants were insensitive to the likelihood of the sampling event, replicating failures in similar paradigms. Nevertheless, a new analysis of visual scanning showed that infants did spend more time fixating specific areas-of-interest as a function of the event likelihood. The drawn ball and its associated container attracted more looking than the other containers in the 0% condition, but this pattern was weaker in the 50% condition, and even less strong in the 100% condition. Results suggest that measuring where infants look may be more sensitive than simply how much looking there is to the whole scene. The advantages of eye tracking measures over traditional looking measures are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2560427433,"Despite significant advances in tissue engineering such as the use of scaffolds, bioreactors and pluripotent stem cells, effective cardiac tissue engineering for therapeutic purposes has remained a largely intractable challenge. For this area to capitalise on such advances, a novel approach may be to unravel the physiological mechanisms underlying the development of tissues that exhibit rhythmic contraction yet do not originate from the cardiac lineage. Considerable attention has been focused on the physiology of the avian lymph heart, a discrete organ with skeletal muscle origins yet which displays pacemaker properties normally only found in the heart. A functional lymph heart is essential for avian survival and growth in ovo. The histological nature of the lymph heart is similar to skeletal muscle although molecular and bioelectrical characterisation during development to assess mechanisms that contribute towards lymph heart contractile rhythmicity have not been undertaken. A better understanding of these processes may provide exploitable insights for therapeutic rhythmically contractile tissue engineering approaches in this area of significant unmet clinical need. Here, using molecular and electrophysiological approaches, we describe the molecular development of the lymph heart to understand how this skeletal muscle becomes fully functional during discrete in ovo stages of development. Our results show that the lymph heart does not follow the normal transitional programme of myogenesis as documented in most skeletal muscle, but instead develops through a concurrent programme of precursor expansion, commitment to myogenesis and functional differentiation which offers a mechanistic explanation for its rapid development. Extracellular electrophysiological field potential recordings revealed that the peak-to-peak amplitude of electrically evoked local field potentials elicited from isolated lymph heart were significantly reduced by treatment with carbachol; an effect that could be fully reversed by atropine. Moreover, nifedipine and cyclopiazonic acid both significantly reduced peak-to-peak local field potential amplitude. Optical recordings of lymph heart showed that the organ’s rhythmicity can be blocked by the HCN channel blocker, ZD7288; an effect also associated with a significant reduction in peak-to-peak local field potential amplitude. Additionally, we also show that isoforms of HCN channels are expressed in avian lymph heart. These results demonstrate that cholinergic signalling and L-type Ca2+ channels are important in excitation and contraction coupling, while HCN channels contribute to maintenance of lymph heart rhythmicity."
