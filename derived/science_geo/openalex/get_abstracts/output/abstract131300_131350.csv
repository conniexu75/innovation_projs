https://openalex.org/W2108482850,"Normal human cells undergo a finite number of cell divisions and ultimately enter a nondividing state called replicative senescence. It has been proposed that telomere shortening is the molecular clock that triggers senescence. To test this hypothesis, two telomerase-negative normal human cell types, retinal pigment epithelial cells and foreskin fibroblasts, were transfected with vectors encoding the human telomerase catalytic subunit. In contrast to telomerase-negative control clones, which exhibited telomere shortening and senescence, telomerase-expressing clones had elongated telomeres, divided vigorously, and showed reduced staining for β-galactosidase, a biomarker for senescence. Notably, the telomerase-expressing clones have a normal karyotype and have already exceeded their normal life-span by at least 20 doublings, thus establishing a causal relationship between telomere shortening and in vitro cellular senescence. The ability to maintain normal human cells in a phenotypically youthful state could have important applications in research and medicine."

In robo mutants, too many axons cross and recross the midline. Here we show that robo encodes an axon guidance receptor that defines a novel subfamily of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins that is highly conserved from fruit flies to mammals. For those axons that never cross the midline, Robo is expressed on their growth cones from the outset; for the majority of axons that do cross the midline, Robo is expressed at high levels on their growth cones only after they cross the midline. Transgenic rescue experiments reveal that Robo can function in a cell-autonomous fashion. Robo appears to function as the gatekeeper controlling midline crossing."
https://openalex.org/W2093351885,"Antagonists of several growth factor signaling pathways play important roles in developmental patterning by limiting the range of the cognate inducer. Here, we describe an antagonist of FGF signaling that patterns apical branching of the Drosophila airways. In wild-type embryos, the Branchless FGF induces secondary branching by activating the Breathless FGF receptor near the tips of growing primary branches. In sprouty mutants, the FGF pathway is overactive and ectopic branches are induced on the stalks of primary branches. We show that FGF signaling induces sprouty expression in the nearby tip cells, and sprouty acts nonautonomously and in a competitive fashion to block signaling to the more distant stalk cells. sprouty encodes a novel cysteine-rich protein that defines a new family of putative signaling molecules that may similarly function as FGF antagonists in vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W1971642218,"The influence of ion composition, pH, and peptide concentration on the conformation and activity of the 37-residue human antibacterial peptide LL-37 has been studied. At micromolar concentration in water, LL-37 exhibits a circular dichroism spectrum consistent with a disordered structure. The addition of 15 mm HCO3−, SO42−, or CF3CO2− causes the peptide to adopt a helical structure, with approximately equal efficiency, while 160 mm Cl− is less efficient. A cooperative transition from disordered to helical structure is observed as the peptide concentration is increased, consistent with formation of an oligomer. The extent of α-helicity correlates with the antibacterial activity of LL-37 against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Two homologous peptides, FF-33 and SK-29, containing 4 and 8 residue deletions at the N terminus, respectively, require higher concentrations of anions for helix formation and are less active than LL-37 against Escherichia coli D21. Below pH 5, the helical content of LL-37 gradually decreases, and at pH 2 it is entirely disordered. In contrast, the helical structure is retained at pH over 13. The minimal inhibitory concentration of LL-37 againstE. coli is 5 μm, and at 13–25 μm the peptide is cytotoxic against several eukaryotic cells. In solutions containing the ion compositions of plasma, intracellular fluid, or interstitial fluid, LL-37 is helical, and hence it could pose a danger to human cells upon release. However, in the presence of human serum, the antibacterial and the cytotoxic activities of LL-37 are inhibited.

However, in the presence of human serum, the antibacterial and the cytotoxic activities of LL-37 are inhibited. During the past decade, the widespread appearance of naturally occurring antibacterial peptides has been firmly established. Their abundance, tissue distribution, and in vitro activity suggest an essential role in biological defense systems (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). In mammals, antibacterial peptides such as defensins have been located in circulating leukocytes, where they are a part of the intracellular bactericidal machinery (2Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Other peptides, such as those belonging to the cathelicidin family, are released upon stimulation and exert their activity extracellularly (3Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Recently, several broad spectrum bactericidal peptides have been found to be expressed or induced at surface epithelia, probably providing an effective barrier for invading bacteria (4Schonwetter B.S. Stolzenberg E.G. Zasloff M.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1645-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 5Diamond G. Russel J.P. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence comparison of gene-encoded antibacterial peptides from vertebrate reveals a pronounced heterogeneity. In general, they can be divided into four major groups according to composition and secondary structure. One group, which includes the defensins, is folded into an antiparallel β-sheet structure, containing three disulfide bridges (2Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). A second group, which includes cecropins and magainins, exhibits an α-helical structure (8Boman H.G. Faye I. Gudmundsson G.H. Lee J.-Y. Lidholm D.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 9Bevins C.L. Zasloff M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 395-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). A third group comprises peptides that form loop structures with one or more disulfide bridges, such as bactenecin (10Romeo D. Skerlavaj B. Bolognesi M. Gennaro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9573-9575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fourth group comprises peptides with a high content of specific amino acid, such as the proline-arginine-rich peptide PR-39 (11Agerberth B. Lee J.-Y. Bergman T. Carlquist M. Boman H.G. Mutt V. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the tryptophan-rich peptide indolicidin (12Selsted M.E. Novotny M.J. Morris W.L. Tang Y.Q. Smith W. Cullor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4292-4295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these very diverse structural motifs, many of these peptides are membrane-active, containing an amphiphilic secondary structure (13White S.H. Wimbley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar,14Agerberth B. Gunne H. Odeberg J. Kogner P. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). They kill bacteria mainly by lysis, and some are also cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells. However, the nonlytic PR-39 adopts a nonamphiphilic polyproline-helix at low temperature (15Cabiaux V. Agerberth B. Johansson J. Homble F. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and kills bacteria by interrupting both DNA and protein synthesis (16Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human cathelicidin peptide LL-37 was originally predicted from a cDNA clone, and the putative active peptide was synthesized as FA-LL-37 (14Agerberth B. Gunne H. Odeberg J. Kogner P. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Later, the mature active peptide LL-37 (two residues shorter at the N-terminal end than the predicted peptide) was isolated from degranulated granulocytes (17Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Odeberg J. Bergman T. Olsson B. Salcedo R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). LL-37 exhibits moderate antibacterial activity in Luria-Bertani (LB) 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Luria-Bertani; FDA, fluorescein diacetate; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; PBL, peripheral blood leukocytes; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Luria-Bertani; FDA, fluorescein diacetate; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; PBL, peripheral blood leukocytes; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. medium, but upon the addition of medium E (a salt medium used for culturingEscherichia coli (18Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) a pronounced increase of the antibacterial activity was noticed. This enhancement of the activity was shown to correlate with induction of an α-helical structure (14Agerberth B. Gunne H. Odeberg J. Kogner P. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We have found the α-helical conformation of LL-37 to be anion-, pH-, and concentration-dependent. The extent of α-helical content correlates well with the observed antibacterial activity. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of LL-37 against E. coli D21 was determined to 5 μm, and at 3–5 times this concentration, the peptide also exhibits cytotoxic activity toward eukaryotic cells. This means that LL-37, when released, could cause host cell damage. A mechanism for protection from such potentially harmful effects appears to be in place in the circulation, since we find that the cytotoxic activity of LL-37 is inhibited by human serum. Porcine and human sera were purchased from Sigma and from the Department of Transfusion Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden), respectively. The composition of medium E (18Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is 0.8 mm MgSO4, 9.6 mm citric acid, 57.4 mmK2HPO4, and 16.7 mmNaNH4HPO4. Compositions of the physiological salt solutions used were as follows: for plasma, 113.0 mmNaCl, 24.0 mm NaHCO3, 0.6 mmMgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 3.9 mm KCl; for interstitial fluid, 117.0 mm NaCl, 27.0 mm NaHCO3, 0.6 mmMgCl2, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 4.0 mm KCl; for intracellular fluid, 70.0 mmK2HPO4, 12.0 mm NaHCO3, 17.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mmCaCl2 (19Fernlund P. Fex G. Hansson A. Stenflo J. Lundh B. Laurells Klinisk Kemi i Praktisk Medicin. 6th Ed. Studentlitteratur, Lund, Sweden1991: 59Google Scholar). All physiological salt solutions were adjusted to pH 7.3 with 2 m HCl. The amino acid sequences of LL-37 and the N-terminally truncated forms FF-33 and SK-29 are shown in Fig. 1. Peptide synthesis was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer using standard solid-phase procedures (for review, see Ref. 20Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Starting fromt-butoxycarbonyl-Ser(benzyl)-OCH-phenylacetamidomethyl resin (0.67 mmol/g), t-butoxycarbonyl amino acid derivatives were used with reactive side chains protected as follows: serine and threonine, benzyl; lysine, 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl; glutamate and aspartate, benzyl ester; and arginine, 4-toluenesulfonyl. Double couplings were performed for arginine, glutamine, and asparagine residues. The synthesis was halted after 29 cycles, and 16 of the resin was removed, yielding the 29-residue peptide, SK-29. For the remaining part of the resin, the synthesis continued for another four cycles, and again 16 of the resin was removed, yielding the 33-residue peptide, FF-33. The synthesis was then completed after another four cycles, giving the 37-residue peptide LL-37. The peptides were cleaved from the resins with liquid hydrogenfluoride/anisole/methylsulfide (10:1:1, v/v/v) for 60 min at 0 °C. The cleavage products were washed with diethylether to remove scavengers and protecting groups, extracted in 30% acetic acid, and lyophilized. The peptides were further purified by HPLC (Waters) on a reversed phase Vydac C18 column (The Separation Group), using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (15–60% in 40 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular masses were determined with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization instrument (Lasermat 2000, Finnigan MAT) and were in all cases in agreement with the calculated masses. CD spectra were recorded on either a Jasco J-720 (Jasco Inc.) or an Aviv 62DS (Aviv Associates Inc.) spectropolarimeter. All spectra were recorded at 0.5 nm/point resolution, and data were reported as differences in molar absorptivities (Δε = εL − εR) of the backbone amide bond (m−1 cm−1). Peptide concentration was 40 μm unless otherwise noted. Helical content was estimated by obtaining the average of the following values: percentage of helix = (Δε208 − 1.21)/−11.22 (21Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 108-116Crossref Scopus (3310) Google Scholar) and percentage of helix = (Δε222 − 0.91)/−11.82 (22Morrisett J.D. David J.S. Pownall H.J. Gotto A.M.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For determination of the concentration dependence of the peptide CD, concentrations between 10−7 and 10−3m were measured in cuvettes with path lengths between 0.1 and 50 mm. An inhibition zone assay in thin (1-mm) agarose plates seeded with E. coli D21 orBacillus megaterium Bm11 was used. 1% (w/v) agarose in LB broth was supplemented with different single salt solutions or medium E. Antibacterial activity in “salt-free” medium was determined by omitting NaCl from the LB medium. Bacteria were grown overnight on agar plates containing streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and were then inoculated in LB medium. Bacteria were added to the agarose mixture just before plating to a concentration of 6 × 104 cells/ml. Small wells (3-mm diameter, 3-μl volume) were punched out of the plates, and a dilution serie of a given peptide (starting with 5 μg/μl in water) was applied. For serum inhibition studies, LL-37 was dissolved at a concentration of 1 μg/μl in water, human serum, or porcine serum, with 3 μl applied of each sample. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, the diameters of bacteria-free zones were measured. For the MIC value, E. coli D21 was grown to late log phase. Approximately 2000 bacteria were incubated in LB supplemented with medium E and different peptide concentrations (ranging from 20 to 0.31 μm in 1:1 dilution steps) for 3 h. The lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth was taken as the MIC value. The cytotoxic effect of LL-37 was determined by the ability of intracellular eukaryotic esterases to hydrolyze fluorescein diacetate (FDA) to free fluorescein, followed by flow cytometric analysis (23Norden M.A. Kurzynski T.A. Bownds S.E. Callister S.M. Schell R.F. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LL-37 was incubated with either trypomastigote forms ofTrypanosoma cruzi (Tulahuén strain (24Taliaferro W.H. Pizzi T. J. Infect. Dis. 1955; 96: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)), obtained from the culture supernatant of L-929 infected cells, human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), or the T-cell line MOLT. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin, in the absence or presence of indicated dilutions of LL-37, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Serum inhibition of cytotoxicity was analyzed by using serial dilutions of human serum (40–0%), 50 μm LL-37, and PBL. After 12–16 h, cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended to 2 × 106/ml and incubated with 1 mg/ml FDA in phosphate-buffered saline, (a 100-fold dilution from a stock FDA in acetone). After incubating 15 min at 37 °C, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and 105 events were then analyzed in a FACScan flow-cytometer (Beckton & Dickinson). The percentage of nonviable cells was determined as the number of events showing fluorescein staining after LL-37 incubation as compared with control cells incubated with RPMI 1640 medium alone. In 20 mm SO42− at a concentration of 10−3m, the CD spectrum of LL-37 is dominated by double minima (222 and 208 nm) and a single maximum (195 nm) characteristic of an α-helical secondary structure (25Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). At this concentration, the α-helical content is estimated to be 50%. This helical conformation is lost in a cooperative fashion upon dilution of the peptide in 20 mm SO42−buffer. The existence of an isodichroic point (204 nm) is consistent with a two-state helix-coil equilibrium (26Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 1675-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). At the lowest concentration measured (10−7m), the CD spectrum of LL-37 has lost essentially all α-helical character and now contains a single pronounced minimum at about 200 nm. The position of the minimum undergoes a blue shift with decreased peptide concentration (Fig. 2 A). This is expected as the small amount of remaining helical structure is lost and further supports the notion of a largely disordered peptide at concentrations below 10−6m. Taken together, this highly cooperative concentration-dependent helix-coil equilibrium is highly reminiscent of the monomer-oligomer transitions common to peptide sequences capable of forming amphipathic α-helices (e.g. melittin; Ref. 27Kaiser E.T. Kézdy F.J. Science. 1984; 223: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Preliminary analysis of the concentration-dependent CD and sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicates that a significant portion of the helical form of LL-37 is a tetramer (data not shown). We cannot at present rule out the presence of higher molecular weight oligomers. At a concentration of 40 μm, the CD spectrum of LL-37 in water exhibits a minimum around 200 nm, which is indicative of a highly disordered conformation (see Fig. 5 A). Upon the addition of 15 mm Na2SO4, NaHCO3, or NaCF3CO2, a conformational change occurs, as evidenced by spectra containing minima at 208 and 222 nm and a maximum around 195 nm (Fig. 2 B). Based on these spectra, the helicities in the presence of these salts are similar (Fig. 2 B) and are estimated to be about 40%. The addition of up to 40% (v/v) trifluoroethanol to LL-37 in water results in approximately 30% helical content (data not shown). 15 mmNaCl affects the structure of LL-37 to a very limited extent (Fig. 2 B), and replacement of Na+ with Mg2+ does not have any effect on the structural transitions observed, which shows that the structural changes are predominantly caused by the SO42−, HCO3−, and CF3CO2− anions. Given the clear cut effects of the anion composition and concentration on the secondary structure of LL-37, we next examined the peptide conformation in solutions with ion compositions similar to those of various physiological environments. Fig. 3 shows that LL-37 adopts an α-helical conformation virtually identical to that in medium E in solutions containing ion compositions that mimic those of human plasma, interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. The helicity of LL-37 in salt solutions as inferred from CD measurements is reduced at low pH. Below pH 5, a transition to a disordered conformation is evident, and at pH 2–3, the CD spectrum is practically identical to that in water (Fig. 4). The original α-helical structure is regained upon raising the pH (not shown). In contrast, the helical content is retained at pH values over 13 (Fig. 4), and the addition of 50 mm NaOH to LL-37 dissolved in water causes a transition to a helical conformation (not shown). Fig. 5 A shows the CD spectra of LL-37 (40 μm) in water and after the addition of various salts. The addition of medium E or 84 mm SO42− results in the most pronounced helix formation. 160 mm Cl−induces formation of helical structure, but the helical content is only about half of that observed with medium E or 84 mmSO42− (Fig. 5 A). The antibacterial activity of LL-37 in the presence of these ions was determined using an inhibition zone assay. The activity toward the Gram-positive bacterium B. megaterium Bm11 closely correlates with the helical content (Fig. 5 B). The activities in medium E, 5 and 84 mmNa2SO4, and 12 mmNaHCO3 are similar and significantly higher than that in 160 mm NaCl, which in turn is higher than the activity observed in “salt-free” medium (Fig. 5 B). The same trend is observed for the activity toward the Gram-negative bacteriumE. coli D21 (Fig. 5 C), except that the activity in 12 mm NaHCO3 is reduced, probably due to the different compositions of the membranes for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the MIC value for LL-37 againstE. coli D21 in LB supplemented with medium E was found to be approximately 5 μm. Further support for a direct relation between helical content and antibacterial activity comes from analyses of N-terminally truncated versions of LL-37. The helical content of LL-37, FF-33, or SK-29 each increases with increasing SO42−concentration (Fig. 6 A). All peptides show a isodichroic point at 203–204 nm upon salt titration (not shown), consistent with a two-state helix-coil transition. The shorter peptides require significantly higher concentrations of SO42− for induction of maximal helical content, approximately 300 mm for FF-33 and SK-29 compared with about 30 mm for LL-37. This is reflected in their respective activities against E. coli D21 in 5 mm Na2SO4, where LL-37 is more active than FF-33 or SK-29 (Fig. 6 B). In medium E, LL-37 and FF-33 are equally active and significantly more active than the shorter SK-29 peptide (Fig. 6 C). Correlation of pH with the antibacterial activity could not be determined, since the bacterial test strains do not grow well at extremes of pH. However, values were obtained for E. coliD21 at pH 4.3, where the inhibition zones were, depending on the peptide concentration, 40–85% of the zones obtained at pH 7. The cytotoxic effect of LL-37 was studied by FDA incorporation using three different types of eukaryotic cells: trypomastigotes of the protozoan parasite T. cruzi, a T lymphocyte cell line (MOLT), and PBL. For these cell types, toxicity is clearly observed at 13–25 μm of LL-37, and gradually increases at higher concentrations (Fig. 7). Our data show that the active helical conformation of LL-37 is cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells in the ion compositions and at pH values that are encountered under physiological conditions. Thus, LL-37, if released extracellularly, could be harmful to human cellsin vivo. However, such potential effects are apparently attenuated by one or several factors present in human serum, since the cytotoxic effect is reduced when human serum is included in the assay. In the absence of serum, 50 μm LL-37 results in 81% nonviable cells, while in the presence of 40% serum, 38% nonviable cells are found. In addition, the antibacterial activity of LL-37 is lost completely when the peptide is first dissolved in human serum and significantly reduced in porcine serum (Fig. 8). In contrast, the porcine antibacterial peptide PR-39, which is nonlytic (16Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is equally active if the peptide is first dissolved in water, human serum, or porcine serum (Fig. 8). We interpret the bactericidal activity of the peptide dissolved in water (Fig. 8) as being the result of the conformational inducing effects of medium E in the agarose plate. Control experiments indicate that the observed inhibition is not likely to be caused by proteolytic degradation of LL-37. After incubation in human plasma for 20 h at 25 °C, the peptide elutes at the identical position as untreated LL-37 upon reversed phase HPLC, and the mass value determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry is identical to that of intact LL-37. The cooperative concentration-dependent α-helix formation of LL-37 is consistent with a system in which largely unfolded monomeric peptide (the dominant form at <10−5m) is in equilibrium with an α-helical oligomer form. This is indeed the expected behavior of an amphiphilic α-helix such as LL-37 (Figs. 1 and 2). The driving force of oligomerization and concomitant α-helix formation is then expected to be due largely to the hydrophobic effect, i.e. efficient removal of the apolar face from contact with the solution to form the interior of the oligomer, leaving the polar face exposed. In this context, the effect of some ions (SO42−, HCO3−, CF3CO2− and to a significantly lesser extent Cl−) in promoting helix formation in LL-37 can be rationalized from their ability to “salt out” nonpolar groups, commonly referred to as the Hofmeister effect (see Refs. 28Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 262-264Google Scholar and 29Baldwin R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2056-2063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The salting out of apolar groups is thought to result from the effect of ions on the surface tension of water. By increasing the surface tension of water the exposure of hydrophobic surface becomes more unfavorable. In proteins, the salting out effect is often a manifestation of reduced solubility at high salt concentrations (>1 m), hence the name. However, the salting out of an amphiphilic α-helix like LL-37 should result in a shift of the equilibrium toward the oligomer form at lower salt concentrations, which we observe as increased helical content of the peptide. Ionic interactions along the polar face of the amphiphilic helix also appear to play a role in the conformation of LL-37. Salt bridges in helices, formed by location of residues with acidic and basic side chains, respectively, in positions i and i + 3 or i + 4, which are close in a helical conformation, specifically stabilize the helical conformation (30Scholtz J.M. Baldwin R.L. Gutte B. Peptides: Synthesis, Structures and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 171-192Google Scholar). LL-37 contains nine such potential ion pairs (Fig. 1). In addition, LL-37 contains seven locations where residues with basic side chains are located both in positions i and i + 3 or i + 4, but no instances where two negative charges are in such positions (Fig. 1). It is likely that the anion-induced folding of LL-37 into a helical structure at near neutral pH (Figs. 2 B and 5 A) is at least in part caused by reducing repulsive forces between positively charged residues located in the seven (i, i + 3/i + 4) positions. The unfolding of α-helical LL-37 at low pH (Fig. 4) could be brought about by protonation of acidic side chains with concomitant losses of stabilizing complimentary (i, i + 3/i + 4) side chain ion pairs, since destabilizing interactions between positive residues are expected to be largely unaffected at low pH. This in turn suggests that, in the present case, i, i + 3/i + 4 ion pairs are more helix-stabilizing than the corresponding hydrogen bonds between protonated Asp or Glu side chains and positively charged side chains. In contrast, Marqusee and Baldwin (31Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) found that, in 16–17-residue model peptides, Glu0–Lys+hydrogen bonds are roughly as effective as the Glu−–Lys+ salt bridge in stabilizing the helix. However, an important caveat is that in their model system all peptides were shown to be monomeric, whereas LL-37 is clearly an oligomer when helical. Finally, at pH > 13, where the side chains of Lys and Arg are uncharged, complimentary side chain ion pairs are again lost, but so are repulsive forces between basic side chains. This does not cause a net destabilization of the LL-37 helical fold (Fig. 4). The helical, oligomeric conformation of LL-37 is apparently a requirement for activity, since the highest antibacterial activity correlates to maximal helical content, while intermediate and low activities correspond to less helical content and disordered secondary structure (Fig. 5). This indicates that optimal antibacterial activity of LL-37 requires an oligomeric α-helical structure prior to interacting with the bacterial membrane. Hence, for LL-37 the bacterial membrane alone cannot be a major determinant for folding into an active conformation, as has been claimed for the cecropins (32Steiner H. Andreu D. Merrifield R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 939: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In cystic fibrosis, the innate immunity of the lung is compromised, leading to repeated bacterial infections. This defect has been claimed to depend on inactivation of human β-defensin-1, which is inactive at high NaCl concentrations (33Goldman M.J. Anderson G.M. Stolzenberg E.D. Kari U.P. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 553-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that changes in the microenvironment, such as e.g. those encountered in cystic fibrosis lung, could influence the conformation of antibacterial peptides and thus modulate their activities. To determine if peptide length influences the conformation and/or biological activity, the two N-terminally truncated variants FF-33 and SK-29 were synthesized. In 5 mmNa2SO4, LL-37 has considerable helicity, while FF-33 is significantly less helical (Fig. 6 A). Accordingly, LL-37 is more active against E. coli D21 than FF-33 at this salt concentration (Fig. 6 B). The antibacterial activity of FF-33 in medium E, however, is similar to that of LL-37 (Fig. 6 C), showing that the four N-terminal amino acids as such are not essential for the antibacterial activity. Recently, a mouse cathelicidin, murine cathelin-like protein, was identified (34Popsueva A.E. Zinovjeva M.V. Visser J.W.M. Zijlmans J.M.J.M. Fibbe W.E. Belyavsky A.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), where the C-terminal 37 residues have 43% sequence identity with LL-37, indicating that murine cathelin-like protein is the mouse homologue of human LL-37. A 29-residue putative antibacterial peptide derived from the C-terminal part of murine cathelin-like protein exhibited a disordered structure both in water and in medium E and had no antibacterial activity (34Popsueva A.E. Zinovjeva M.V. Visser J.W.M. Zijlmans J.M.J.M. Fibbe W.E. Belyavsky A.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, the corresponding human peptide SK-29 does adopt an α-helical secondary structure and is antibacterial in salt solutions. However, SK-29 requires higher concentrations of SO42− for induction of maximal helical content compared with LL-37 (Fig. 6 A). In line with this result, the antibacterial activity of SK-29 againstE. coli D21 is lower than that of LL-37 both in 5 mm Na2SO4 and medium E (Fig. 6, B and C). Many antibacterial peptides (e.g. defensins (2Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), indolicidin (35Schluesener H.J. Radermacher S. Melms A. Jung S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 47: 199-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), BMAP-27 (36Skerlavaj B. Gennaro R. Bagella L. Merluzzi L. Risso A. Zanetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28375-28381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and LL-37) also exhibit cytotoxic effects against eukaryotic cells, but usually at higher concentrations compared with the bactericidal activity. The differences in effective bactericidal and cytotoxic concentrations could lie in the different membrane compositions of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. However, the primary structures of BMAP-27 and BMAP-28 influence their membrane specificities, since the hydrophobic C-terminal tail of these peptides is needed for cytotoxic, but not antibacterial, effect (36Skerlavaj B. Gennaro R. Bagella L. Merluzzi L. Risso A. Zanetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28375-28381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). LL-37 lacks a hydrophobic tail, suggesting a different mechanism for its cytotoxicity. Cytotoxic effects may well be physiologically relevant at sites of inflammation, where antibacterial/cytotoxic peptides are induced in epithelial cells and/or recruited from granulocytes (5Diamond G. Russel J.P. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 7Frohm M. Agerberth B. Ahangari G. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Lidén S. Wigzell H. Gudmundsson G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15258-15263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This could result in a high local concentration of peptide, leading to cytotoxicity. Examples of protective mechanisms against cytotoxic activities in the circulation do exist, where for example α2-macroglobulin works as a scavenger for the defensins (37Panyutich A. Ganz T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the antibacterial (Fig. 8) and cytotoxic activities of LL-37 are inhibited by human serum. Since we have no indication of degradation of LL-37 in human serum, it is possible that this inhibition reflects binding of LL-37 to a serum protein. In conclusion, LL-37 requires an α-helical, oligomeric conformation for optimal antibacterial activity, and this conformation is dependent on LL-37 concentration and several factors in the microenvironment. Potentially harmful cytotoxic effects exerted by LL-37 against host cells are apparently attenuated by one or several factors in human serum. We thank Carina Palmberg and Berit Olsson for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2018348038,"We have used gene targeting to examine the role of the G alpha subunit, G(olf), in olfactory signal transduction. Mice homozygous for a null mutation in G(olf) show a striking reduction in the electrophysiological response of primary olfactory sensory neurons to a wide variety of odors. Despite this profound diminution in response to odors, the topographic map of primary sensory projections to the olfactory bulb remains unaltered in G(olf) mutants. Greater than 75% of the G(olf) mutant mice are unable to nurse and die within 2 days after birth. Rare surviving homozygotes mate and are fertile, but mutant females exhibit inadequate maternal behaviors. Surviving homozygous mutant mice also exhibit hyperactive behaviors. These behavioral phenotypes, taken together with the patterns of G(olf) expression, suggest that G(olf) is required for olfactory signal transduction and may also function as an essential signaling molecule more centrally in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2081342248,"We have developed a technique that allows mechanical and ligand-binding events in a single myosin molecule to be monitored simultaneously. We describe how steps in the ATPase reaction are temporally related to mechanical events at the single molecule level. The results show that the force generation does not always coincide with the release of bound nucleotide, presumably ADP. Instead the myosin head produces force several hundreds of milliseconds after bound nucleotide is released. This finding does not support the widely accepted view that force generation is directly coupled to the release of bound ligands. It suggests that myosin has a hysteresis or memory state, which stores chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1966673980,"NMDA receptors, a class of glutamate-gated cation channels with high Ca2+ conductance, mediate fast transmission and plasticity of central excitatory synapses. We show here that gene-targeted mice expressing NMDA receptors without the large intracellular C-terminal domain of any one of three NR2 subunits phenotypically resemble mice made deficient in that particular subunit. Mice expressing the NR2B subunit in a C-terminally truncated form (NR2B(deltaC/deltaC) mice) die perinatally. NR2A(deltaC/deltaC) mice are viable but exhibit impaired synaptic plasticity and contextual memory. These and NR2C(deltaC/deltaC) mice display deficits in motor coordination. C-terminal truncation of NR2 subunits does not interfere with the formation of gateable receptor channels that can be synaptically activated. Thus, the phenotypes of our mutants appear to reflect defective intracellular signaling."

We report the molecular isolation of oep using a positional cloning approach. The oep gene encodes a novel EGF-related protein with similarity to the EGF-CFC proteins cripto, cryptic, and FRL-1. Wild-type oep protein contains a functional signal sequence and is membrane-associated. Following ubiquitous maternal and zygotic expression, highest levels of oep mRNA are found in the gastrula margin and in axial structures and forebrain. Widespread misexpression of both membrane-attached and secreted forms of oep rescues prechordal plate and forebrain development in mutant embryos but does not lead to the ectopic induction of these cell types in wild-type fish. These results establish an essential but permissive role for an EGF-related ligand during vertebrate gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W2004202674,"Acetylcholine (ACh) released from the stimulated vagus nerve decreases heart rate via modulation of several types of ion channels expressed in cardiac pacemaker cells. Although the muscarinic-gated potassium channel I(KACh) has been implicated in vagally mediated heart rate regulation, questions concerning the extent of its contribution have remained unanswered. To assess the role of I(KACh) in heart rate regulation in vivo, we generated a mouse line deficient in I(KACh) by targeted disruption of the gene coding for GIRK4, one of the channel subunits. We analyzed heart rate and heart rate variability at rest and after pharmacological manipulation in unrestrained conscious mice using electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry. We found that I(KACh) mediated approximately half of the negative chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation and adenosine on heart rate. In addition, this study indicates that I(KACh) is necessary for the fast fluctuations in heart rate responsible for beat-to-beat control of heart activity, both at rest and after vagal stimulation. Interestingly, noncholinergic systems also appear to modulate heart activity through I(KACh). Thus, I(KACh) is critical for effective heart rate regulation in mice."

RGS9 mRNA expression is specific for photoreceptor cells, and RGS9 protein colocalizes with other phototransduction components to photoreceptor outer segment membranes. The RGS domain of RGS9 accelerates GTP hydrolysis by the visual G protein transducin (G alpha(t)), and this acceleration is enhanced by the gamma subunit of the phototransduction effector cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEgamma). These unique properties of RGS9 match those of the rod outer segment GAP and implicate it as a key element in the recovery phase of visual transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2144950416,"Hop is a 60-kDa protein characterized by its ability to bind the two chaperones, hsp70 and hsp90. We have tested the function of Hop using an assay for the refolding of denatured firefly luciferase. We show that Hop is involved in the process of refolding thermally denatured firefly luciferase in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Hop also stimulates refolding by hsp70 and Ydj-1 in a purified refolding system. Hsp90 can also stimulate refolding, and optimal refolding is observed in the presence of both Hop and hsp90. Similar stimulation was observed when Hop was replaced by its yeast homolog Sti1. In assays of the binding of Hop to hsp70 and hsp90, Hop preferentially forms a complex with ADP-bound hsp70, and this process is unaffected by the presence of hsp90. Hop does not alter the ATPase activity or the rate of ADP dissociation of hsp70. Hop also appears to bind to the ADP-bound form of hsp90, blocking the ATP-dependent conversion of hsp90 to a form capable of interacting with p23. Conversely, once p23 is bound to hsp90, Hop binding is diminished. These results confirm that Hop provides a physical link between hsp70 and hsp90 and also indicate that Hop modulates the activities of both of these chaperone proteins.

Of the two, hsp70 is the more widely studied and has been extensively characterized in bacteria (DnaK), in yeast (Ssa and Ssb), and in several compartments of higher eukaryotes. hsp70s are composed of two domains as follows: a 45-kDa, amino-terminal nucleotide-binding domain and a 25-kDa, carboxyl-terminal peptide-binding domain. Through a cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and nucleotide exchange, denatured proteins are alternately bound and released to effect protein folding (1Hartl F.U.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 129-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Substrates bind transiently to the ATP-bound form of hsp70, but when ATP is hydrolyzed the binding is stabilized (3Greene L.E. Zinners R. Naficy S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2967-2973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Release of the substrate occurs when ADP is exchanged for ATP (4Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). hsp70 function is modulated by members of the hsp40 family in higher eukaryotes, Ydj1 in yeast, and DnaJ in bacteria. These proteins are known to stimulate the ATPase activity of their respective hsp70s (5Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, some studies suggest that hsp40s may act independently to recognize and bind unfolded polypeptides to prevent aggregation and target them to hsp70 (9Cyr D.M.

In bacteria, DnaK function is also dependent on a nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE, but no eukaryotic cytoplasmic homolog has been identified (6Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C.

B., and Toft, D. O. Endocr. Rev., 18, 306–360.Google Scholar, 14Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The intermediate complex contains hsp70 and Hop (also called p60), the human homolog of the yeast stress-induced protein STI1, plus some hsp90 and Hip (also called p48) (15Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This progresses to a complex containing less hsp70 and Hop, more hsp90, and the hsp90-binding proteins p23 and one of three large immunophilins (FKBP51, FKBP52, or cyclophilin 40). The appearance of this complex correlates with the final step of receptor maturation (17Johnson J.L. Corbiser R. Stensgard B. Toft D.O. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The mechanistic details of hsp90 function are still unclear. However, it does appear that similar hsp90 complexes are utilized in the maturation of a number of different target proteins (20Chang H.J. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell.

Cell Stress & Chaperones. 1996; 1: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The functions of the accessory proteins that bind to hsp90 are only beginning to be understood. Hop is an abundant, stress-induced protein (22Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) associated with hsp90 and hsp70 in dynamic complexes in reticulocyte lysate and found as a component of intermediate steroid receptor complexes (15Chen S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Hop has been shown to be necessary for the in vitro assembly of steroid receptors with hsp90 (15Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Its yeast homolog, STI1 (24Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), is almost entirely complexed with hsp90 (25Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that this protein functions along with hsp90. Since hsp70 and hsp90 are not associated with one another in its absence, yet each associates individually or in a ternary complex with Hop, it appears that Hop is responsible for the organization of this complex (15Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Johnson J.L. Corbiser R. Stensgard B. Toft D.O. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Hop has recently been reported to stimulate the ATPase activity of hsp70 and to increase hsp70's affinity for ATP, thus serving the role of nucleotide exchange factor for hsp70, analogous to the role of GrpE in prokaryotic systems (27Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In assays of passive chaperoning activity, Hop does not have any productive interactions with the denatured substrates citrate synthase or β-galactosidase (28Bose S. Weikl W. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 29Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, one recent study suggests that Hop is associated with luciferase during the refolding process in reticulocyte lysate (30Thulasiraman V. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13443-13450Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An assay for the chaperone-mediated refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase has been described previously. In this system, the chaperones hsp70 and Ydj-1 are absolute requirements for the refolding process, and hsp90 can enhance refolding under some conditions (8Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We used this assay to investigate the role of Hop in protein refolding. Hop is involved in refolding in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and can significantly stimulate refolding using purified chaperones. Hop binds to hsp70 and hsp90 in a nucleotide-dependent manner and may also modulate the functions of these two chaperones. Mouse monoclonal antibody F5 was prepared against avian p60/Hop as described previously (16Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell.

Mouse monoclonal antibody 4F3 was prepared against chicken hsp90 and does not cross-react with rabbit hsp90 (31Smith D.F. Mol.

Hansen and W. J. Welch and has been described previously (8Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This antiserum cross-reacts with several J proteins important to the refolding process. Antibody ST2 is a mouse monoclonal IgG prepared against STI1. Purified STI1 (see below) was used as the antigen and for screening by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. Balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 100 μg of antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Splenocytes were fused with myeloma cell line Sp2/0-Ag 14, and hybridomas were selected and screened by conventional methods. hsp90 was prepared by the overexpression of human hsp90β in Sf9 cells using the system of Alnemri and Litwack (33Alnemri E.S.

Cell lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography followed by ATP-agarose column chromatography. This was precipitated using ammonium sulfate (75% saturation), and the redissolved hsp70 was fractionated by 16/60 Superdex 200 FPLC. Only the monomer peak of hsp70 was used. The preparation was approximately 97% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Western blot analysis using rabbit antiserum against Hdj-1 showed no contamination by J proteins. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Human Hop expressed in bacteria was prepared essentially as described previously (35Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J.

Bacterial lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography followed by hydroxylapatite column chromatography. Additional purification was achieved by fractionating the pool from hydroxylapatite on a Mono Q FPLC column (10/10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl. The fractions containing Hop were pooled, dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. The preparation was approximately 94% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Western blot analysis using rabbit antiserum against Hdj-1 showed no contamination by J proteins. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. A bacterial expression system for Ydj1p was generously supplied by Dr. Avrom Caplan and has been described previously (36Caplan A.J.

Bacterial lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography followed by hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The preparation was approximately 80% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. The cDNA for STI1 ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae was obtained from Elizabeth Craig (24Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This was placed in a pET-11 vector and expressed inEscherichia coli. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication in 3 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm monothioglycerol, pH 7.5, and the protease inhibitors pepstatin, 2 μg/ml, leupeptin, 2 μg/ml, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm. STI1 was extracted as a soluble protein, and after centrifugation, it was loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column that was washed with 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm thioglycerol, pH 7.5, and eluted with a 0–0.4 m KCl gradient. Fractions containing STI1 were pooled and loaded on a hydroxylapatite column that was washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm thioglycerol, and 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.4, and eluted with a gradient of 10–400 mm potassium phosphate. Fractions containing STI1 were pooled and loaded onto a 16/60 Superdex 200 sizing column and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.25 m KCl, pH 7.5. The fractions containing STI1 were pooled and dialyzed into 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. The preparation was greater than 98% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. The bacterial expression and purification of human p23 has been described (18Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble fraction of bacterial lysate was fractionated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography followed by phenyl-Sepharose (hp1660) FPLC, dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. The preparation was greater than 99% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Tris buffer (TB) was as follows: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, and 2 mm DTT. Stability buffer (SB) was as follows: 25 mm Tricine-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% Triton X-100. Luciferase refolding assays were performed as described previously (8Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase, 100 nm in SB, was heat-denatured at 40 °C to ∼0.2% of its original activity. This was diluted 10-fold into reticulocyte lysate or a refolding mixture containing purified chaperone proteins, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system in TB. The refolding mixture was incubated at 25 °C to promote folding, and at the indicated times following addition of denatured luciferase, aliquots were removed, and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer. The luciferase activities were expressed as a percent of control samples of the same luciferase concentration that was not denatured. The hsp70-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP was measured essentially as described previously (38Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Assays containing 2 μm hsp70, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 μl were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. A 10-μl aliquot was removed before the start of each incubation, and additional aliquots were removed after 10, 20, and 30 min of incubation and added to 500 μl of an acidified charcoal suspension. The charcoal, along with the nucleotides, was pelleted, and the amount of free phosphate in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The binding of Hop or STI1 to hsp70 and hsp90 was measured by combining the appropriate proteins (∼10 μg each) in 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. In some cases, ATP or ADP was included (see figure legends). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, chilled on ice, and combined with 25-μl pellets of protein A-Sepharose containing either antibody F5 against Hop or ST2 against STI1. After incubation for 1 h in ice, the resin pellets were washed, extracted into SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Samples containing 1 μm hsp70, ∼0.2 μCi of [α32P]ATP, and 1 μm total ATP in 25 μl of TB were incubated with or without 250 nm Hop at 37 °C for 30 min to allow hsp70 to bind and hydrolyze the ATP. These were cooled on ice and then diluted 2-fold into TB containing some combination of 1 mm free ATP and/or 0.1 mg/ml bovine carboxymethylated-α-lactalbumin (CMLA) and incubated again at 37 °C to allow release of the labeled nucleotide from hsp70. A 9-μl aliquot was removed prior to the start of each incubation, and additional aliquots were removed after 1, 2, 4, and 8 min of incubation and filtered through nitrocellulose filters. Each filter was washed twice with 1 ml of TB, and the amount of bound nucleotide on each filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The abilities of Hop and p23 to bind to hsp90 were measured by combining 220 nm hsp90 with 10 μm ATP or 10 μm ADP in 200 μl of 20 mm Na2MoO4, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then chilled and incubated an additional 10 min on ice. Hop and/or p23 were added to the samples either before or after the 30 °C incubation. Samples were combined with 25-μl pellets of protein A-Sepharose conjugated with either antibody JJ3 against p23 or F5 against Hop and incubated for 90 min on ice. The resin pellets were washed 4 times with TB, extracted into SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hop is involved in the process of refolding firefly luciferase in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we added thermally denatured luciferase to a refolding mixture containing reticulocyte lysate dialyzed in TB, with ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system and incubated the reaction at 25 °C to promote refolding. We inhibited Hop's function in reticulocyte lysate using monoclonal antibody F5 (15Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), then used this lysate in refolding experiments (not shown). As increasing amounts of F5 antibody are added to the lysate used to refold denatured firefly luciferase, the initial rate of the refolding reaction (measured after 15 min) is progressively reduced by as much as 25%. As the time course of refolding proceeds, the inhibition caused by F5 antibody gradually decreases until there is about a 10% difference in the extent of refolding after 60 min. We also used lysates treated with high salt (0.4 m KCl) followed by immune depletion of Hop for luciferase refolding (Fig. 1, A and B). High salt treatment of reticulocyte lysate followed by buffer exchange decreases the initial rate of refolding by about 40%. Immune depletion of Hop from high salt-treated lysate further reduces the initial rate of luciferase refolding compared with control preparations by up to 25% (Fig. 1, A and B). After two rounds of depletion, Hop was undetectable by Western blot analysis in the reticulocyte lysate preparations. Supplementing Hop-depleted lysate with purified human Hop at 0.1, 0.3, or 1 μm restores the refolding ability of the lysate (Fig. 1 A), but addition of purified Hop to control lysate that has not been depleted of Hop causes a small loss in refolding ability (Fig. 1 B), most likely the result of exceeding the optimal concentration of Hop. After 80 min of refolding time, the extent of refolding in control preparations is not significantly different than in untreated lysate. However, considerably less luciferase is refolded during 80 min in Hop-depleted preparations (Fig. 1 B). When Hop is depleted from reticulocyte lysate at normal salt concentrations, the rate of refolding is reduced by about 13 (not shown). In this case, the addition of purified Hop only partially restores the lost activity. The most probable explanation for this result is that other chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 which are known to associate with Hop and play a role in refolding are being coprecipitated and are no longer available for refolding. These results show that the refolding of luciferase in reticulocyte lysate is influenced by Hop, but Hop is clearly not an essential component of the refolding machinery. We used purified chaperone proteins in the luciferase refolding assay to characterize further Hop's role in refolding. Thermally denatured luciferase was added to a refolding mixture containing purified chaperone proteins, ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system and allowed to refold at 25 °C; the results are shown in Fig. 2 A. In the absence of either hsp70 or Ydj, no individual chaperone or combination of chaperones is able to mediate luciferase refolding. When hsp70 and Ydj are both present in the refolding reaction, a significant amount of luciferase refolding occurs, as described previously (8Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and this can be further stimulated by the addition of either Hop or hsp90. We see a dramatic stimulation in the rate and extent of luciferase refolding when both Hop and hsp90 are added to hsp70 and Ydj. This effect is most pronounced during the early stages of refolding (30 min) where greater than 10-fold stimulation is observed compared with a 2–3-fold stimulation for Hop or hsp90 alone. Identical results are obtained when STI1 is substituted for Hop in this assay (Fig. 2 B). The optimal concentration of Hop for a particular refolding reaction is in large part determined by hsp90. In the absence of hsp90, the optimal concentration of Hop in refolding reactions is greater than 100 nm (Fig. 3 A). When hsp90 is present, additional stimulation of refolding occurs along with a decrease in the optimal concentration for Hop to a range of 10–100 nm. This 10-fold decrease in the most effective concentration makes Hop optimum for refolding at a concentration similar to that of the substrate luciferase (10 nm). STI1 showed a very similar pattern of concentration dependence with a higher concentration (1 μm) being most effective in the absence of hsp90 and low to moderate concentrations (10–100 nm) being more effective when hsp90 is present (not shown). Hop and hsp90 also have effects on the concentration of hsp70 required for the refolding process as shown in Fig. 3 B. The optimal concentration range for hsp70 is quite narrow since excess hsp70 is very inhibitory. hsp70 is most effective at a concentration of approximately 350 nm for refolding in the presence of 80 nm Ydj. Addition of either Hop or hsp90 causes a slight increase in the requirement for hsp70 in addition to providing a stimulation to the refolding process at most hsp70 concentrations. When Hop and hsp90 are added together to the refolding mixture, the effective concentration range for hsp70 is shifted to a higher level and dramatically broadened, yielding a highly effective refolding mixture at hsp70 concentrations from ∼350 nm up to ∼4 μm. We were interested in determining Hop's mechanism of action in the luciferase refolding assay, particularly those assays in which hsp90 was absent. Gross and Hessefort (27Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have recently isolated and characterized a Hop homolog from rabbit reticulocyte lysate which they call RF-hsp70. They found that this protein stimulated the ATPase activity and nucleotide dissociation rate of hsp70. We wanted to confirm these activities using highly purified human Hop. Fig. 4 shows the results of an ATPase assay in which the hydrolysis of ATP by hsp70 is determined by measuring free phosphate release over a time course in the presence or absence of Hop. Ydj, which is known to stimulate the ATPase activity of hsp70 (5Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), was used as the positive control. ATP hydrolysis is clearly enhanced in the presence of either 25 or 250 nm Ydj, but the presence of 0.22 or 2.2 μm Hop did not alter hsp70's ATPase activity either in the absence or presence of Ydj. In the absence of hsp70, no significant hydrolysis of ATP was catalyzed by Ydj or Hop. Consistent with this result, we have found that Hop binds preferentially to the ADP-bound form of hsp70 (see below). A factor that stimulates ATP hydrolysis would be expected to associate with the ATP-bound form of the protein to then effect hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2019250475,"While nerve growth factor (NGF) is best known for its trophic functions, recent experiments indicate that it can also cause cell death during development by activating the neurotrophin receptor p75. We now identify microglial cells as the source of NGF as a killing agent in the developing eye. When the retina is separated from the surrounding tissue before colonization by microglial cells, no NGF can be detected, and cell death is dramatically reduced. It is restored by the addition of microglial cells, an effect that is blocked by NGF antibodies. NGF adsorbed at the surface of beads, but not soluble NGF, mimics the killing action of microglial cells. These results indicate an active role for macrophages in neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W2081246829,"Glycine receptors (GlyRs) contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain stem and spinal cord. GlyR subunits are expressed in the developing neocortex, but a neurotransmitter system involving cortical GlyRs has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we show that GlyRs in immature neocortex are excitatory and activated by a nonsynaptically released endogenous ligand. Of the potential ligands for cortical GlyRs, taurine is by far the most abundant in the developing neocortex. We found that taurine is stored in immature cortical neurons and that manipulations known to elevate extracellular taurine cause GlyR activation. These data indicate that nonsynaptically released taurine activates GlyRs during neocortical development. As fetal taurine deprivation can cause cortical dysgenesis, it is possible that taurine influences neocortical development by activating GlyRs."

By using both the 293 cell line and primary neonatal rat postmitotic striatal neuron cultures, we show here that DA induces apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Concomitant with the apoptosis, DA activates the JNK pathway, including increases in JNK activity, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and subsequent increase in c-Jun protein. This DA-induced JNK activation precedes apoptosis and is persistently sustained during the process of apoptosis. Transient expression of a dominant negative mutant SEK1(Lys → Arg), an upstream kinase of JNK, prevents both DA-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. A dominant negative c-Jun mutant FLAGΔ169 also reduces DA-induced apoptotic cell death. Anti-oxidants N-acetylcysteine and catalase, which serve as scavengers of reactive oxygen species generated by metabolic DA oxidation, effectively block DA-induced JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis. Thus, our data suggest that DA triggers an apoptotic death program through an oxidative stress-involved JNK activation signaling pathway.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that DA may also serve as a neurotoxin and thereby participates in the neurodegenerative process. This includes ischemia (1Buisson A. Callebert J. Mathieu E. Plotkine M. Boulu R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), local exposure to high concentrations of excitatory amino acids (2Filloux F. Wamsley J. Synapse. 1991; 8: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and treatment with methamphetamine (3Schmidt C. Ritter J. Sonsalla P. Hanson G. Gibb J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 233: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar, 4O'Dell S. Weihmuller F. Marshall J. Brain Res. 1991; 564: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The DA availability in animal striatum is significantly increased in the above cases. In the case of hypoxia, the striatal DA levels are increased by up to 1100% of control levels (5Akiyama Y. Koshimura K. Ohue T. Lee K. Miwa S. Yamagata S. Kikuchi H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Direct injection of high concentration of DA (0.025–0.5 m) into the striatal area results in neurodegeneration (6Hastings T. Lewis D. Zigmond M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). DA, 6-OH-DA, and other monoamines are also neurotoxic when directly applied to cell cultures (7Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Nardi N. Offen D. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A. Neurosci.

The mechanism of DA neurotoxicity is highly linked to oxidative metabolism. With respect to its molecular structure, DA contains an unstable catechol moiety. DA can oxidize spontaneously in vitro or through an enzyme-catalyzed reaction in vivoto form reactive oxygen species (ROS), free radicals, and quinones (10Hastings T.G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 11Graham D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 633-643PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cohen G. Heikkila R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2447-2452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the human substantia nigra, the DA oxidation products may further polymerize to form another neurotoxin, neuromelanin (13Jellinger K. Kienzl E. Rumpelmair G. Riederer P. Stachelberger H. Ben-Shachar D. Youdim M.B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These oxidation products can damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA (14Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Although the cause of age-related degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, the oxidative stress induced by DA is believed a major pathological factor. In the “free radical hypothesis,” the neurodegeneration in PD is considered to result from high exposure of these dopaminergic neurons to ROS, especially generated by oxidation of DA (15Adams J.D.J. N O.I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 16Olanow C.W. Arendash G.W. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1994; 7: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by postmortem studies showing that in the substantia nigra of PD brain, there are increased indices of oxidative stress, increased levels of iron, increased lipid peroxidation, decreased mitochondrial complex I activity, and decreased levels of glutathione (GSH) (17Hirsch E.C. Brandel J.-P. Galle P. Javoy-Agid F. Agid Y. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 18Jenner P. Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 1993; 146: 6-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, in vitro studies show that DA (0.01–1 mm) and its metabolic product, 6-OH-DA, can induce apoptosis associated with ROS in a variety of cell types. These include both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, for example primary neonatal rat striatal cell cultures (19Shinkai T. Zhang L. Mathias S. Roth G. J. Neurosci.

However, the molecular events involved in the processes of DA-induced apoptosis are unknown. Recent evidence suggests that the JNK (also called SAPK) pathway may play an important role in triggering apoptosis in response to free radicals generated by ultraviolet and gamma radiation, or direct application of H2O2, or inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1) (25Chen Y.-R.

Overexpression of dominant negative mutants of components in the JNK pathway, such as ASK1(K709R), SEK1(Lys → Arg) (both are upstream kinases), and c-Jun Δ169 (a downstream target), can effectively prevent the apoptosis (29Verheij M.

Given the role of the JNK pathway in initiating apoptosis, we test here the hypothesis that DA-induced apoptosis may also be mediated by JNK activation. We have used both 293 cells and primary neonatal rat striatal cell cultures to test this hypothesis. Our results indicate that DA indeed triggers cellular apoptosis through an oxidation-linked JNK activation pathway. Antibodies against JNK-1 and GST were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-c-Jun was from Oncogene. Antibodies against phospho-specific c-Jun (Ser-63) II and phospho-specific SAPK/JNK were from New England Biolabs. Anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody was from Kodak. Dopamine was from Research Biochemicals. A dominant negative SEK1(Lys → Arg) vector was provided by Dr. L. Zon and J. Kyriakis; pCDFLAGΔ169 DNA was from Dr. L. Rubin and J. Ham. The 293 cells were maintained in IMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For primary neonatal striatal cell cultures, the procedures were described previously (33Mesco E. Joseph J. Roth G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The striata of neonatal rats (Wistar rat colony of Gerontology Research Center, NIA, National Institutes of Health) were dissected and pooled in Hank's balanced salt solution at 4 °C. Cells were enzymatically dispersed by a mixture of 0.15% collagenase and 0.001% DNase. The cells were then plated on polyethyleneimine-coated chamber slides and cultured in a medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 3 days, 5 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside was included to inhibit growth of glial cells and fibroblasts. Cell culture medium was routinely changed every 3 to 4 days. Cells were used after 20 days in culture to perform experiments. To determine changes in JNK activity, phosphorylation of c-Jun and c-Jun protein levels in 293 cells, we incubated the cells with DA in 1% serum-containing medium to reduce background. Apoptosis was determined under the same conditions. In striatal cell cultures, the cells were treated with DA in the complete medium. The procedure for extraction of DNA was followed as described (23Walkinshaw G. Waters C. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 293 cells were used to isolate DNA for each sample. Cells were harvested by gentle scraping and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended with TE buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 20 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C. To remove high molecular weight DNA, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The samples were then sequentially extracted with equal volumes of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 5m NaCl and 2 volumes of ethanol at −70 °C overnight. The DNA was resuspended with TE buffer, and the RNA was digested by 0.1 mg/ml RNase for 3 h at 30 °C. The samples were run on 1.4% agarose gels containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and DNA was visualized under UV light. For detection of apoptotic cells, the cells were first washed twice with cold PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The fixed cells were washed again with PBS and stained with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution for 30 min. The apoptotic cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. Cells containing condensed or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. Data are expressed as percentage of apoptotic cells in total counted cells. Lipofectin® reagent was used to transfect cDNA plasmids by following the protocol provided by manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, the cells were fed with complete medium for 1 additional day. These cells were then used for experiments. For determination of JNK activity and anti-JNK1 immunoblotting, cell extracts were prepared as follows. Stimulated cells were scraped into tubes and collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed with cold PBS and solubilized with ice-cold JNK lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The cellular extract was then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm to remove debris. The supernatant was used immediately or aliquoted and stored at −70 °C for further use. For anti-phospho-specific c-Jun and c-Jun immunoblotting, we have used different procedures. Stimulated cells were collected as described above. The cell pellets were washed with cold PBS, solubilized with hot SDS lysis buffer (80–90 °C) consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and heated for 10 min at 90 °C. The lysates were then sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged for 20 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were used to perform SDS-PAGE or stored at −70 °C. The procedures described by Coso et al. (34Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were used with a slight modification. Clarified cell lysates (200 μg of proteins) were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of polyclonal anti-JNK1 and then incubated with 20 μl of Sepharose A-conjugated protein A for an additional 1 h. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with cold PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, once with cold 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl, and once with cold kinase reaction buffer consisting of 12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, 3.3 μm DTT, and 3 μg of substrate GST-c-Jun-(1–98) in kinase reaction buffer for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 10 μl of 5 × Laemmli loading buffer. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated substrate c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. The optical density of autoradiograms was determined using the NIH Image program. The kinase activity was expressed as fold of control. Equal amounts of lysate protein (40 μg/lane) were run on either 10 or 8–16% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose blots were first blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mmNaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) and then incubated with primary antibodies (JNK-1, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Ser(P)-73-specific c-Jun and phospho-SAPK/JNK, 1:1000, New England Biolabs; monoclonal c-Jun, 1:1000, Oncogen; monoclonal anti-Flag M2, 1:1000, Kodak) in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactivity was detected by sequential incubation of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Renaissance substrate (DuPont). For immunocytochemical studies, cells were first washed twice with cold PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Immunostaining was performed according to the procedures provided by the manufacturer for the ABC Elite kit. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat or horse serum for 1 h in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody (polyclonal anti-D2 receptor, 1:1000, Chemicon; monoclonal anti-Flag M2, 1:1000, Kodak) overnight at 4 °C in a TBST solution. They were sequentially incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibody, ABC reagents for 1 h, and then exposed for 5 min to a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, and chromogen, 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride. The positive staining cells were examined under a light microscope. Two methods were used depending on the detergents used in the preparation of cell lysates. The protein concentration in cellular extracts containing Triton X-100 was determined by Bio-Rad protein reagent (Bio-Rad), and protein in the lysates containing SDS was measured by MicroBCA kit (Pierce product). We have chosen human embryo kidney 293 cells and neonatal striatal cell cultures as non-neuronal and neuronal cells, respectively, to study the apoptotic effect of dopamine. One of the biochemical features of apoptosis is the early onset of specific endonuclease cleavage of cellular DNA into a nucleosome ladder (35Wyllie A. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). Considering the limited amount of material available from neonatal rat striatal cell cultures, we first used 293 cells to find optimal conditions for DA-induced apoptosis by examining DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder). 293 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and grown to about 80% confluency. The cells were then exposed to DA in IMEM containing 1% serum. As expected, DA induced a typical apoptotic DNA ladder with a 200-base pair range increase (Fig. 1, A and B). DA induced DNA fragments in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Exposure of 293 cells to 500 μm DA resulted in DNA cleavage beginning at 16 h and reaching a maximum at 30 h (Fig. 1 A). Within 30 h of exposure, DA induced DNA fragmentation at concentrations from 100 μmto at least 500 μm (Fig. 1 B). We have repeated these experiments at least 3 times and observed similar time- and concentration-dependent patterns. DA-induced nuclear changes were evaluated under a fluorescence microscope using DAPI staining. In control cells, the nuclei showed uniform staining, indicating that cells were healthy and nuclei were intact. With 500 μm DA treatment for 30 h, some nuclei exhibited typical apoptotic characteristics, such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation (not shown). Apoptotic cells represented 70 ± 5.3% (n = 4) of those cells. Some floating dead cells were also observed at this time point. Based on these observations, we chose maximal stimulation with 500 μm DA for 30 h to observe the DA apoptotic effect in neonatal rat striatal cell cultures. Neonatal rat striatal cells were prepared and cultured for 20 days. To identify striatal cell cultures, we examined expressions of D2-dopamine receptor protein and mRNA, respectively. For receptor protein, we immunostained the cell cultures with anti-D2R antibody. As expected, the cultures showed positive anti-D2R staining of 40–60% of cells. The D2R was mostly located on the cell surface. These cells were not stained by the same dilution of normal rabbit serum (data not shown). Receptor mRNA levels were detected by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction as described (36Giros B. Sokoloff P. Martres M.-P. Riou J.-F. Emorine L. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1989; 342: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar,37Valerio A. Alberici A. Tinti C. Spano P. Memo M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As expected, these cells expressed both D2RL and D2RS isoforms (data not shown). In agreement with previous report of autoradiography by 3H-labeled ligand receptor binding (33Mesco E. Joseph J. Roth G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the neonatal rat striatal cell cultures contain D2R expressing neurons. These cells were used to observe apoptotic effects of DA. DA (500 μm) was added for 24 h, and the cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Under a light microscope, the apoptotic cells appeared round and shrunken (indicated by arrows in the lower left panel of Fig. 1 C). Corresponding to these changes, the nuclei appeared typically condensed and fragmented by DAPI staining (lower right panel, Fig. 1 C). Some cells also underwent early apoptosis as indicated by strong chromatin fluorescence although they appeared similar in cell size (lower right panel, Fig. 1 C). The apoptotic cells represented about 31 ± 4.6% (n = 5) of the total population. Thus, our results suggest that DA induces apoptosis in both non-neuronal and neuronal cells. Activation of the JNK pathway has been implicated in initiating apoptosis in several cases. These include deprivation of NGF from sympathetic neurons and NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (30Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R. Greenberg M. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 32Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and exposure of the cells to lethal dosages of γ and UV-c irradiation (25Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that DA-induced apoptosis may involve the JNK pathway, we examined the effects of DA on this pathway, which include JNK activation, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and the amount of c-Jun in both 293 cells and neonatal rat striatal cell cultures. We first characterized the JNK assay using 293 cells (Fig. 2). The kinase activity was linear with reaction times between 0 to 30 min and remained steady from 30 to 60 min. The kinase activity was also linear with the cell protein concentration between 0 and 200 μg and saturated between 200 and 500 μg of protein. Based on these results, we used 200 μg of cell lysate protein and 30-min reaction times for further experiments. DA stimulated the JNK pathway in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of 1% serum, 293 cells were stimulated by application of 500 μmDA for various times. Cellular lysates were prepared and JNK activity determined with anti-JNK1 immunocomplex kinase assay. DA induced JNK activity up to 9.3-fold compared with controls when the cells were stimulated for 3 h (Fig. 3 A). This DA-stimulated JNK activation was sustained for at least 27 h in our time course studies (from 3 to 30 h, Fig. 3 A). The JNK activation was accompanied by a small increase (10–20%) in JNK1 protein determined by Western immunoreactivity with anti-JNK1 from time 0 to 30 h (Fig. 3 A). This small increase in JNK1 immunoreactivity may be due to reduced migration of phosphorylated JNK1 enzyme. Following the activation of JNK1, phosphorylation of c-Jun, a target of JNK1, was also increased during DA stimulation. The phosphorylated c-Jun was detected using anti-specific phospho-c-Jun (Fig. 3 A). Corresponding to the time course of JNK1 activation by DA, phosphorylation of c-Jun began at 3 h and reached a maximum at 23 h. DA also increased the amount of c-Jun with a similar time course to phosphorylation of c-Jun. At 30 h, all activation of the JNK pathway including JNK activity, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and synthesis of c-Jun was decreased. This may be due to apoptotic cell death at this time point as was shown in Fig. 1 A. We have also examined the concentration effect of DA on the JNK pathway. 293 cells were exposed to different concentrations of DA from 1 to 500 μm in the presence of 1% serum. For determination of JNK activation, the cells were stimulated with DA for 3 h. For detection of c-Jun protein, the cells were exposed to DA for 23 h. DA stimulated the JNK pathway in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). This activation of the JNK pathway by DA is detectable at 100 μm and increased with elevated concentrations (Fig. 3 B). This dose-response activation of the JNK pathway was shown by a 32P incorporation kinase assay and increase of anti-c-Jun immunoreactive protein (Fig. 3 B). DA had little or no effect on the amount of JNK1 protein determined by anti-JNK1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 B). DA also stimulated the JNK pathway in neonatal rat striatal cell cultures. A paradigm of DA stimulation similar to that for 293 cells was used except that the striatal cell cultures were maintained in complete culture medium. Like the"

Either loss of odr-3 function or overexpression of odr-3 causes severe olfactory defects, and odr-3 function is essential in the ASH neurons that sense noxious chemical and mechanical stimuli. In the nociceptive neurons, ODR-3 may interact with OSM-9, a channel similar to the mammalian capsaicin receptor implicated in pain sensation; in AWC olfactory neurons, ODR-3 may interact with another signal transduction pathway. ODR-3 exhibits an unexpected ability to regulate morphogenesis of the olfactory cilia. In odr-3 null mutants, the fan-like AWC cilia take on a filamentous morphology like normal AWA cilia, whereas ODR-3 overexpression in AWA transforms its filamentous cilia into a fan-like morphology."

Overexpression of comm is also dosage-sensitive and leads to a phenotype identical to robo loss-of-function. Comm controls Robo expression; increasing Comm leads to a reduction of Robo protein.

https://openalex.org/W2100140713,Blastomeres in C. elegans embryos execute lineage programs wherein the fate of a cell is correlated reproducibly with the division sequence by which that cell is born. We provide evidence that the pop-1 gene functions to link anterior–posterior cell divisions with cell fate decisions. Each anterior cell resulting from an anterior–posterior division appears to have a higher level of nuclear POP-1 protein than does its posterior sister. Genes in the C. elegans Wnt pathway are required for this inequality in POP-1 levels. We show that loss of pop-1(+) activity leads to several types of anterior cells adopting the fates of their posterior sisters. These results suggest a mechanism for the invariance of blastomere lineages.

A sax-3::GFP fusion gene is expressed in developing neurons during axon outgrowth, and sax-3 function is required at the time of axon guidance, suggesting that this gene mediates cell interactions during guidance decisions."

Thus, a system capable of dynamic regulated addition and removal of the sugar analogous to a kinase/phosphatase system is present in cells.A major function of O-GlcNAc may be to compete with phosphorylation for sites on proteins (1Haltiwanger R.S. Busby S. Grove K. Li S. Mason D. Medina L. Moloney D.J. Philipsberg G.A. Scartozzi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W.

Since GlcNAc is neutral, it is possible that it would have different effects on protein function than a strongly negatively charged phosphate group. Thus, competition between GlcNAc and phosphate for similar sites would add an extra level of control to signal transduction cascades in cells. Alternatively, O-GlcNAc or phosphate could affect protein activity in a similar manner, although the modifications would be the result of different signaling cascades. In either case, only one modification could occur at an individual site at any one time. Evidence indicating that this type of competition occurs has been obtained by demonstration that the sites of glycosylation on both RNA polymerase II (4Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and c-Myc (8Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) coincide with known phosphorylation sites. Even so, direct modulation of the level of phosphate on a protein by changing the level of glycosylation on the same protein has not yet been demonstratedin vivo.Selective inhibitors of protein kinases and phosphatases have been used extensively to modulate the level of phosphate on proteins as an approach to determine the functional implications of phosphorylation. By analogy to the phosphorylation system, specific inhibitors of either the O-GlcNAcase or O-GlcNAc transferase would be valuable tools in the study of the function of the O-GlcNAc modification. In the present study, we sought to address two goals. First, we wanted to examine the feasibility of using a known in vitro inhibitor of the O-GlcNAcase for modulation ofO-GlcNAc levels on proteins in vivo. Second, if such modulation was feasible, we wanted to test the hypothesis thatO-GlcNAc and phosphate compete on proteins by determining whether alterations in the level of O-GlcNAc on a given protein would result in changes in the level of phosphorylation of the same protein. In these studies, we have utilized the potent in vitro inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, PUGNAc (17Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to address these goals.DISCUSSIONOur main goal in the studies described here was to determine whether inhibitors could be used to modulate O-GlcNAc levels on proteins in cells. We have examined the feasibility of using a knownin vitro inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, PUGNAc, on cultured mammalian cells in vivo. Our data demonstrate that we can in fact increase the level of O-GlcNAc on numerous proteins in a variety of cell types using this inhibitor. The increase in O-GlcNAc appears to be due to a specific inhibition of the O-GlcNAcase, since PUGNAc had no effect on the other components of the O-GlcNAc glycosylation machinery (O-GlcNAc transferase or UDP-GlcNAc). The increase inO-GlcNAc is the result of a true increase in the sugar to protein ratio and not just accumulation of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, since we saw no increase in the amount of Sp1 protein in PUGNAc-treated cells. In addition, PUGNAc was non-toxic, indicating that at the levels tested it did not have negative effects on cell growth. These results indicate that PUGNAc can be used to inhibit theO-GlcNAcase in vivo, resulting in a general increase in O-GlcNAc levels on numerous proteins.In addition to demonstrating that PUGNAc can be used to increaseO-GlcNAc levels on proteins in cells, we have used the inhibitor to test the hypothesis that protein modifications byO-GlcNAc and phosphate are reciprocally related to one another. PUGNAc had no effect on the overall phosphorylation pattern in HT29 cells, indicating that the major phosphoproteins in these cells are not affected by changes in O-GlcNAc levels, perhaps because many of these proteins are not modified withO-GlcNAc. These results also suggest that PUGNAc does not have any global detrimental effect on the protein phosphorylation machinery. In contrast, when we looked specifically at a protein known to be modified with both O-GlcNAc and phosphate (Sp1 (5Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar,23Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar)), we observed that the increase in O-GlcNAc caused by PUGNAc was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation. The decrease in phosphorylation following the PUGNAc treatment was smaller than the corresponding increase in O-GlcNAc levels, indicating that some phosphorylation sites on Sp1 may be unaffected by changes inO-GlcNAc levels. It is likely that there is not complete overlap between the glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. Neither the sites of glycosylation nor phosphorylation on Sp1 are known, so we cannot conclusively state that O-GlcNAc and phosphate compete for identical sites, although at least three Class IO-GlcNAc sites (1Haltiwanger R.S. Busby S. Grove K. Li S. Mason D. Medina L. Moloney D.J. Philipsberg G.A. Scartozzi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) are discernible in the sequence (24Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). These sites could also be modified by proline-directed or mitogen-activated protein kinases. Nonetheless, these results suggest that glycosylation and phosphorylation are in a reciprocal relationship on this particular protein. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of altering the level of phosphorylation by increasing the level of O-GlcNAc on a protein in vivo, and it serves as an important step toward understanding the role ofO-GlcNAc on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in cellular function.Although the majority of the PUGNAc-induced increase in terminal GlcNAc moieties in cells was due to O-GlcNAc, a small increase in terminal GlcNAc on N-glycans also occurred. Since PUGNAc is a known inhibitor of lysosomal hexosaminidases (25Horsch M. Hoesch L. Vasella A. Rast D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), this is most likely the result of inhibition of lysosomal hexosaminidases and accumulation of N-glycans bearing terminal GlcNAc moieties. Alternatively, PUGNAc could be indirectly affecting the biosynthesis ofN-glycans by some unknown mechanism. The fact that PUGNAc had little or no effect on UDP-GlcNAc pools suggests that the effect is not being mediated through alterations in the nucleotide sugar pools in the cell.The inhibition of the O-GlcNAcase in HT29 cells resulted in a increase in O-GlcNAc levels on essentially allO-GlcNAc-modified proteins (see Fig. 3). This suggests that the O-GlcNAcase which has been purified and characterized (17Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is the enzyme responsible for the removal of O-GlcNAc from most proteins in these cells. Alternatively, if otherO-GlcNAcase enzymes exist, PUGNAc may have similar inhibitory effects on these activities as well. Interestingly, the extent of PUGNAc-induced changes on different proteins varied somewhat. The increase in O-GlcNAc on Sp1 was greater than that seen on the proteins analyzed in Fig. 3, suggesting that the rate ofO-GlcNAc turnover may differ from protein to protein. Similar increases in O-GlcNAc levels were seen in HT29, NIH-3T3 cells, and CV-1 cells, although much smaller changes were seen in HeLa cells. The reason for differences in the effect of PUGNAc on the HeLa cells is not clear. It may be the result of lower rates ofO-GlcNAc turnover in these cells. If the cells express low levels of O-GlcNAcase then they will not be greatly affected by PUGNAc. Tissue searches of the O-GlcNAcase enzyme activity demonstrated variability from tissue to tissue (17Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the expression levels may vary. Alternatively, PUGNAc may be efficiently excluded from HeLa cells, preventing significant intracellular accumulation of the inhibitor.Despite the fact that removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins was inhibited, the growth rate of all of the cells examined was unaffected by continued exposure to PUGNAc. This suggests that turnover ofO-GlcNAc is not essential for cell growth. Effective inhibitors of the O-GlcNAc transferase will need to be developed before it can be determined how the lack ofO-GlcNAc on proteins affects growth. It is somewhat surprising that there is no growth effect, especially in light of the finding that changes in O-GlcNAc also affect phosphorylation of proteins like Sp1. The results suggest that the presence ofO-GlcNAc does not inhibit growth but may stimulate growth. Since several sites of O-GlcNAc modification resemble mitogen-activated protein kinase sites, it is possible that the presence of O-GlcNAc or phosphate on a protein at these sites may have a similar growth stimulatory effect. Thus, instead of competition at individual sites, there may be sharing of sites by different systems that are responding to different sets of upstream signals, both resulting in cell growth. Further work comparing the effects of O-GlcNAc to the effects of phosphate on a protein's function when the modifications occur at the same site needs to be done before such conclusions can be drawn.Our results on the lack of growth effects are somewhat in conflict with a preliminary report by Snow and co-workers (2Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.I. Arnold C.S. Snow D.M. Ye Z. Cheng X. DellaManna D. Caine D.S. Earles B.J. Akimoto Y. Cole R.N. Hayes B.K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Snow D.M. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. Hart G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 6 (abstr.): 357aGoogle Scholar). They demonstrated that expression of galactosyltransferase in the cytoplasm of Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in rapid cell death. The galactosyltransferase put a galactose “cap” on O-GlcNAc moieties in the cytoplasm. They concluded that the galactose prevented turnover of O-GlcNAc, and thus, turnover ofO-GlcNAc must be essential for cell viability (2Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.I. Arnold C.S. Snow D.M. Ye Z. Cheng X. DellaManna D. Caine D.S. Earles B.J. Akimoto Y. Cole R.N. Hayes B.K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Snow D.M. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. Hart G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 6 (abstr.): 357aGoogle Scholar). In view of our data, an alternative interpretation may be that unmodified GlcNAc moieties are essential for cell viability, possibly to allow interaction with specific GlcNAc receptors. Other workers (27Felin M. Doyennette-Moyne M.-A. Hadj-Sahraoui Y. Aubery M. Hubert J. Sève A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown the existence of GlcNAc-binding proteins in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Treatment with PUGNAc causes an accumulation of terminal GlcNAcs and may have no effect on the binding of these GlcNAc-binding proteins. Capping with galactose would “hide” theO-GlcNAcs and prevent these essential interactions resulting in cell death. Alternatively, the galactose capping could cause detrimental conformational changes or protein-protein interactions that result in cell death.The use of PUGNAc to selectively alter the level of glycosylation of proteins in cells is a valuable new tool for the study of the role ofO-GlcNAc on individual proteins. There is a great deal of interest in identifying specific inhibitors of the O-GlcNAc transferase, which will be extremely useful for loweringO-GlcNAc levels in cells for similar types of studies. In combination, these types of inhibitors will be invaluable for assessing the role of O-GlcNAc on individual proteins. Others have shown that O-GlcNAc levels can be reduced by lowering UDP-GlcNAc levels in cells (28Sayeski P.P. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15237-15243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The treatments required to lower UDP-GlcNAc levels are somewhat drastic (either glucose starvation or treatment with nonspecific amidotransferase inhibitors such as 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine). These treatments will affect all forms of glycosylation containing GlcNAc or GalNAc (N-glycans, mucin-type O-glycans, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, glycosaminoglycans, glycosphingolipids, and O-GlcNAc) and must be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, intriguing results have been generated with this approach. Recently, it was shown that the transcriptional activation of certain genes (28Sayeski P.P. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15237-15243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as well as the degradation rate of Sp1 (29Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) could be dramatically affected by reducedO-GlcNAc levels. As inhibitors such as PUGNAc are used more widely, further insights into the function of O-GlcNAc modification of proteins will be possible.

Thus, a system capable of dynamic regulated addition and removal of the sugar analogous to a kinase/phosphatase system is present in cells. A major function of O-GlcNAc may be to compete with phosphorylation for sites on proteins (1Haltiwanger R.S. Busby S. Grove K. Li S. Mason D. Medina L. Moloney D.J. Philipsberg G.A. Scartozzi R.

Since GlcNAc is neutral, it is possible that it would have different effects on protein function than a strongly negatively charged phosphate group. Thus, competition between GlcNAc and phosphate for similar sites would add an extra level of control to signal transduction cascades in cells. Alternatively, O-GlcNAc or phosphate could affect protein activity in a similar manner, although the modifications would be the result of different signaling cascades. In either case, only one modification could occur at an individual site at any one time. Evidence indicating that this type of competition occurs has been obtained by demonstration th"

Two distinct mechanisms for immune tolerance have been defined that operate during early bone marrow stages of B cell development: apoptosis, which eliminates clones of cells, and receptor editing, which spares the cells but genetically reprograms their autoreactive antigen receptors through nested immunoglobulin L chain gene rearrangements. We show here that sensitivity to antigen-induced apoptosis arises relatively late in B cell development and is preceded by a functionally distinct developmental stage capable of receptor editing. This regulation compartmentalizes clonal selection from receptor selection."

Throughout this period, the optic lobes show NADPH-diaphorase activity and stain with an antibody to nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The NOS inhibitor L-NAME, the NO scavenger PTIO, the sGC inhibitor ODQ, and methylene blue, which inhibits NOS and guanylate cyclase, each caused the disorganization of retinal projections and extension of photoreceptor axons beyond their normal synaptic layers in vitro. The disruptive effects of L-NAME were prevented with the addition of 8-bromo-cGMP. These results suggest NO and cGMP act to stabilize retinal growth cones at the start of synaptic assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2083259022,"We have developed an assay using permeabilized cells to monitor fragmentation of the Golgi complex that occurs during mitosis. Golgi stacks, in permeabilized interphase normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, upon incubation with mitotic extracts undergo extensive fragmentation, and the fragmented Golgi membranes are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. We find that the continued presence of p34cdc2, the mitosis initiation kinase, is not necessary for Golgi fragmentation. Instead, fragmentation depends on cytosolic mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1 or MAPKK1). However, the known cytoplasmic substrates for MEK1, ERK1, and ERK2 are not required for this process. Interestingly, we find a Golgi-associated ERK, which we propose as the likely target for MEK1 in Golgi fragmentation."

As the direct connection between holoFet3p biosynthesis and the phenotype of yeast defective in copper transport into the secretory pathway provides an opportunity to assay the function of putative copper-transporting ATPases, the current study employed this approach to define the structure and function relationship of the Menkes disease protein. Oligonucleotide primers synthesized with EcoRI linkers were used to amplify the portion of the Menkes cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1046–1356 in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. using Klentaq polymerase (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR product was subsequently ligated into pGEX4T-3, confirmed by automated sequencing (Perkin-Elmer), and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 for protein expression and purification as described (18Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 64: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.6 absorbance units and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Harvested bacteria were treated with lysozyme and sonicated at 4 °C, and soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was redissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 6m urea and again centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted to 1 murea with PBS, pooled with the initial soluble fraction, and applied to glutathione-agarose beads. Bound fusion protein was eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and dialyzed extensively against PBS, pH 7.4. The purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was used to produce rabbit polyclonal antisera (Animal Pharm Services), which was characterized as described previously (8Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E.

HeLa and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors for 20 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 ×g at 4 °C. Proteins (100 μg) from the supernatant were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry transfer (Novablot). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS and then incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of antiserum for 1 h at room temperature, followed by several washes with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20. For blocking experiments, antisera was preincubated with an excess of fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, washed, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Life Science, Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in ice-cold acetone, and analyzed as described previously (8Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The coding region of the human Menkes disease gene was obtained by PCR of a human HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH) using oligonucleotides corresponding to known Menkes gene sequence. cDNAs were amplified with Klentaq polymerase (CLONTECH). The gene was isolated in three portions, and each of the gene fragments was subcloned by T overhang into pCRII (Invitrogen): 1) initiator ATG-BamHI (amino acids 1–591), 2)BamHI-KpnI (amino acids 592–1107), and 3)KpnI-stop codon TAA (amino acids 1108–1500). AnXbaI site and consensus Kozak sequence (GCCACC) were engineered into the cDNA immediately preceding the initiator ATG, and an XbaI site was introduced after the stop codon. A silent mutation (T to C) was introduced at nucleotide 6 to abolish theBamHI site at the start of the gene to allow for three-part ligation of the fragments into the XbaI site of yeast vector pVT103U (19Vernet T.

All strains were grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic media (Bio101) or the appropriate dropout medium supplemented with 2% glucose. IHY5 yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (21Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Yeast were grown to saturation in the appropriate synthetic media, transferred to copper- and iron-deficient media, grown for 6 h at 30 °C, and then diluted to an A 600 of 0.01 into parallel cultures containing either copper- and iron-deficient media or the appropriate synthetic media. Growth was evaluated after 36–64 h by measuring the A 600 of each culture. Growth rates were normalized by dividing the A 600 in copper- and iron-deficient media by the A 600 in synthetic media and represented as a percentage of wild type growth. The assay for 64Cu incorporation into Fet3p was performed as described (23Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.-J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

The analysis of the Menkes protein presented in this study was guided by the previously predicted polytopic membrane structure of the protein based on sequence homology and hydropathy analyses (3Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar, 4Chelly J. Tümer Z. Tønneson T. Petterson A. Ishikawa-Brush Y. Tommerup N.

Fig. 1 presents a schematic topological model of the Menkes protein, which highlights the conserved protein domains. The Menkes protein contains four signature motifs of the P-type ATPases: the phosphatase domain (TGEA), an invariant aspartate residue (DKTGT), a conserved cysteine and proline (CPC) in the proposed cation transduction channel, and an ATP binding sequence (GDGIND). The protein also contains six characteristic copper binding domains at its amino terminus (MXCXXC) as well as a conserved histidine and proline within an SEHPL motif of unknown function, which is present in the homologous Wilson protein and in which a histidine to glutamine alteration is the most commonly identified mutation in patients with Wilson disease (24Thomas G.R.

In addition, point mutations in the DNA of patients with Menkes disease have been described at positions corresponding to amino acid residues alanine 629 and glycine 1,019 (26Tümer Z. Lund C. Tolshave J. Vural B. Tønneson T. Horn N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). As the Menkes-specific antiserum previously reported (8Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) had limited utility in exploring amino-terminal mutations of the Menkes protein, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum was produced against the large cytoplasmic loop of the Menkes protein (indicated by a dotted line in Fig. 1) to detect the expression of the wild type and mutant Menkes proteins within cells. This antiserum recognized a protein of approximately 178 kDa in HeLa cell lysates but not in HepG2 cell lysates (Fig. 2), and the protein signal was not observed when the antiserum was preincubated with excess fusion protein (Fig. 2 B). A lower nonspecific band at approximately 80 kDa was also detected. Indirect immunofluorescence with the antiserum on HeLa cells resulted in perinuclear staining (Fig. 2 C), consistent with previous reports on thetrans-Golgi localization of the Menkes protein (8Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A.

Gen. 1997; 6: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For the structure and function analysis of the Menkes protein, a cDNA encompassing the open reading frame of the Menkes gene was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A yeast expression vector harboring the Menkes cDNA was used to transform a strain of S. cerevisiae deficient inCCC2, the yeast Menkes/Wilson disease gene homologue. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from ccc2Δ (IHY5) yeast transformed with this Menkes cDNA indicated that the transformed yeast abundantly expressed Menkes protein (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Differential glycosylation or aberrant migration of the protein during SDS-PAGE under the conditions used for the yeast lysate may have accounted for the decrease in apparent molecular weight. To evaluate the function of the expressed protein, wild type (IHY4) yeast and ccc2Δ (IHY5) yeast transformed with either vector or the Menkes cDNA were pulse-labeled with 64Cu, and copper incorporation into the multicopper oxidase Fet3p was directly detected by autoradiography of membrane extracts separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 B, expression of the Menkes protein in ccc2Δ yeast resulted in copper incorporation into Fet3p (lane 3) similar to the level observed in wild type yeast (lane 1). Since the oxidase activity of Fet3p is copper-dependent, the enzymatic function of Fet3p from the 64Cu-labeled membrane extracts was assayed. Fig. 3 C shows that Fet3p oxidase activity paralleled copper incorporation into Fet3p, both in wild type yeast (lane 1) and ccc2Δ yeast transformed with the Menkes cDNA (lane 3). Because the assay of Fet3p oxidase activity accurately reflected the incorporation of copper into the protein, the copper status of Fet3p was evaluated by this method throughout the remainder of the study. To examine the structure-function relationship of the Menkes protein, point mutations corresponding to the amino acid substitutions P1001A, H1086Q, A629P, and G1019D were introduced into the Menkes cDNA sequence (indicated in boldface in Fig. 1). In addition, the six copper binding domains at the amino terminus of the Menkes protein were mutated from MXCXXC to MXSXXS to create Menkes protein mutants with five, four, three, two, one, or no functional copper binding sites remaining (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analyses of lysates fromccc2Δ yeast transformed with these cDNAs demonstrated that each of the mutant proteins was expressed at a level comparable to the wild type Menkes protein (Fig. 4, lane 2 versus lanes 3–6 and lane 8 versus lanes 9–14). To evaluate the effect of these structural mutations on Menkes protein function, the growth rate of ccc2Δ yeast transformants in copper-deficient media was examined. Fet3p activity decreases when yeast are grown in copper-deficient media, and this decrease has been correlated to a decrease in growth rate (15Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the growth of fet3Δ yeast in copper- and iron-deficient media was 3% that of the growth of wild type (IHY4) yeast (Fig. 5 A). Since Fet3p activity in ccc2Δ yeast is restored upon expression of functional Menkes protein (Fig. 3 C), the growth of ccc2Δ yeast transformed with the mutant Menkes constructs in copper- and iron-deficient media was evaluated. ccc2Δ yeast transformed with vector exhibited 2% of the growth of yeast transformed with the wild type Menkes protein, and the P1001A, H1086Q, A629P, and G1019D mutations all demonstrated reduced growth (5, 11, 47, and 11%, respectively) as compared with yeast expressing the wild type Menkes protein (Fig. 5 B). Evaluated through the same assay, the Menkes proteins with mutations in one or two copper binding domains exhibited 83 and 79% that of wild type growth, whereas Menkes proteins with mutations in the first three, four, five, or all six copper binding domains demonstrated negligible growth in the copper- and iron-deficient media (Fig. 5 C). The examination of growth in copper-deficient media suggested that copper-dependent Fet3p activity was compromised in theccc2Δ yeast expressing the mutant Menkes proteins. To assess copper transport into the secretory pathway by the mutant Menkes proteins more directly, Fet3p oxidase activity in membrane extracts of the transformed ccc2Δ yeast was evaluated. The expression of Menkes mutant proteins P1001A, H1086Q, and G1019D inccc2Δ yeast did not restore copper incorporation into Fet3p, as evidenced by negligible Fet3p oxidase activity (upper panel of Fig. 6, lanes 5, 6, and 8). In contrast, the A629P substitution in the Menkes protein resulted in a decrease in Fet3p oxidase activity (lane 7) as compared with the wild type Menkes transformant (lane 4), indicating some Fet3p copper incorporation. These results were not due to variations in the amount of Fet3p among transformants, as evidenced by immunoblot analysis of Fet3p on identical membrane fractions (Fig. 6, lower panel). The Fet3p oxidase assay was subsequently used to analyze the role of the copper binding domains in Menkes protein function. Successive rounds of site-directed mutagenesis on the Menkes cDNA produced Menkes mutant proteins defective in one to six copper binding domains as diagrammed in Fig. 7 A. Evaluation of Fet3p copper incorporation indicated that expression of the Menkes protein lacking one copper binding domain resulted in Fet3p oxidase activity comparable to that observed with the wild type Menkes protein (upper panel of Fig. 7 B, comparelanes 2 and 3), the mutant Menkes protein lacking two copper binding domains resulted in slightly less Fet3p activity (lane 4), and the mutants lacking three to six copper binding domains were devoid of copper-dependent Fet3p oxidase activity (lanes 6–8), despite equal expression of Fet3p between strains as indicated by immunoblot analysis of Fet3p on identical membrane fractions (Fig. 7 B, lower panel). The data presented in this study demonstrate that the Menkes disease protein functions to deliver copper into the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. The ability of the Menkes protein to deliver copper to Fet3p is common to Ccc2p (16Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and the Wilson disease protein (11Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the original observations in Menkes patient fibroblasts of elevated intracellular copper (27Goka T.J. Stevenson R.E. Hefferan P.M. Howell R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 604-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28Camakaris J. Danks D.M. Ackland L. Cartwright E. Borger P. Cotton R.G.H. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The data are also consistent with recent studies on the localization of the yeast Menkes homologue Ccc2p to a late or post-Golgi compartment (30Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as well as immunocytochemical studies that have localized the human and rodent Menkes protein to the trans-Golgi network (8Yamaguchi Y.

Gen. 1997; 6: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) where this ATPase would be positioned to transport copper for incorporation into nascent cupro enzymes within the secretory pathway. The discovery that the Menkes protein can deliver copper to a ceruloplasmin homologue, a role normally attributed to the Wilson protein in humans and Ccc2p in yeast, indicates that the Menkes protein can interact with upstream and downstream proteins within the Fet3p pathway of copper transport and thus appears to be functionally synonymous with other copper-transporting ATPases. This concept is further supported by the finding that Menkes proteins harboring the P1001A and H1086Q mutations cannot restore copper incorporation into Fet3p (Fig. 6), comparable to previous findings with the analogous mutants of the Wilson protein (11Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The inability of the P1001A mutant to restore Fet3p oxidase activity supports the proposed role of the conserved proline residue in the transduction of copper through the membrane channel formed by the copper-transporting ATPases (7Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The H1086Q Menkes mutation parallels the H1070Q mutation in the Wilson protein, the most common point mutation identified in patients with Wilson disease (24Thomas G.R. Forbes J.R. Robert E.A. Walshe J.M. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Although the H1086Q mutation is not a known Menkes disease mutation, the similar abrogation of Fet3p activity observed to result from these Wilson and Menkes mutant proteins, together with the conservation of the histidine among all the reported copper-transporting ATPases, suggests that the histidine plays a fundamental structural role in the function of these proteins, perhaps as a site for protein-protein interaction (25Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. Chernov I. Ross B.M. Kaplan J.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although the Menkes gene locus demonstrates a propensity toward frameshifts, splice site mutations, and nonsense mutations (26Tümer Z. Lund C. Tolshave J. Vural B. Tønneson T. Horn N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar, 31Das S. Levinson B. Whitney S. Vulpe C. Packman S. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 883-889PubMed Google Scholar), the data presented here suggest that the spectrum of mutations uncovered by patient DNA analysis may be influenced more by chromosomal dynamics of the gene locus rather than the biology of the transporter, since the most commonly occurring mutation in Wilson disease similarly compromises Menkes protein function. The common function of these ATPases has been questioned by a recent report that certain murine cell types express both the Menkes and the Wilson disease proteins, leading to the proposal of disparate functions for these ATPases (32Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Packman S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The current data, together with recent findings of copper-dependent relocalization for both the Wilson and Menkes proteins in cells, suggest that the physiologically different roles that the Menkes and Wilson proteins assume in human biology may be attributed to the differences in their expression patterns and not differences in cellular function. The A629P and G1019D disease mutations in the Menkes protein are the only reported missense mutations that occur in predicted soluble domains of the protein (26Tümer Z. Lund C. Tolshave J. Vural B. Tønneson T. Horn N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). Although no function has yet been attributed to glycine 1,019, alanine 629 resides in the “stalk” region of the Menkes protein, which is prone to mutations in Menkes disease and has been proposed to function in joining the copper binding domains to the ATPase core (26Tümer Z. Lund C. Tolshave J. Vural B. Tønneson T. Horn N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of both the A629P and G1019D mutants in ccc2Δ yeast results in reduced growth in copper-deficient media (Fig. 5) and a decrease but not a deficiency in Fet3p oxidase activity for the A629P mutation (Fig. 6), suggesting that copper transport in patients with this mutation is not absent but only impaired. This finding implies that disease may result when lowered levels of copper transport by the Menkes protein cannot meet the metabolic demands of the cell. The distinction between decreased and deficient copper transport by the Menkes protein mutants may have significant clinical relevance and may in part explain the variable response of patients to copper therapy (33Tümer Z. Horn N. Tønneson T. Christodoulou J. Clark J.T.R. Sarkar B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 11-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Kaler S.G. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alternatively, since in mammalian cells the Menkes and Wilson proteins traffic within the cell in response to the cellular copper concentration (9Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 11Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), these Menkes protein mutants may be defective in copper-dependent trafficking, analogous to observed mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator that affect transport indirectly through mislocalization of the protein (35Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Analysis of trafficking by the Menkes protein and its mutants will require expression in mammalian cells, as specific post-Golgi sorting compartments do not appear to be morphologically conserved between yeast and mammalian cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that a soluble form of the Menkes amino-terminal domain containing the six MXCXXC motifs binds six molar equivalents of copper, suggesting one copper atom/metal binding motif (36Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The current data (Fig. 7) suggest that the Menkes protein may not bind six copper atoms in vivo or that the bound copper atoms are not directly transported through the protein channel. The sudden interruption of copper transport upon mutation of the third copper binding motif, as opposed to a linear decrease in Fet3p activity, suggests either the loss of a critical interaction site or steric constraints in transferring copper from the remaining copper binding motifs to the ATPase core. Steric hindrance is unlikely since Ccc2p and the C. elegans ATPase contain only two and three copper binding motifs, respectively, within a commensurately shorter amino terminus. The potential loss of an interaction site has supporting evidence in recent data demonstrating an interaction between the copper binding motifs of Ccc2p and Atx1p, the copper chaperone to Ccc2p in the yeast Fet3p copper transport pathway (37Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 238: 853-856Crossref Scopus (589) Google Scholar). A recent study also indicates that mutation of the two cysteine residues in the copper binding domain of the human Atx1p homologue, HAH1 (23Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.-J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), abrogates copper binding by the motif as well as copper delivery to Fet3p (38Hung I.H. Casareno R.L.B. Labesse G. Mathews F.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 1749-1754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The current data may thus suggest that the third copper binding domain plays a critical role in the transfer of copper from HAH1 to the Menkes protein. The finding that the copper binding domains within the Menkes amino terminus are not functionally equivalent despite the conservation of the copper binding amino acids between domains indicates that additional residues must dictate specificity in the transfer of copper between proteins. These residues may reside within or near the copper binding sites or alternatively, may occur distantly within the protein where they would function as a site for protein-protein interaction. The experiments presented in this study identify the Menkes protein as a member of a mechanistically conserved family of copper-transporting P-type ATPases, which function to transport copper into the secretory compartment of eukaryotic cells. These studies lend insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms in Menkes disease, in which defective placental copper transport during a critical window period in central nervous system development may result in the irreversible neurological deficits observed in Menkes patients. The intracellular transport and export of copper through this family of proteins are likely to occur through an ordered mechanism of copper transfer from the point of cellular entry to exit, guided by specific interactions between proximal proteins within the pathway. Disorders of copper transport caused by mutations within the Menkes protein may thus be classified into categories of functional disruptions affecting chaperone interaction, copper binding, copper transport, or protein trafficking. Further molecular analysis of Menkes protein function based upon this framework may thus provide novel therapeutic approaches to prevent or ameliorate the consequences of disordered copper metabolism in affected patients.

https://openalex.org/W2051990160,"We show that a functional component of the C. elegans mitotic machinery regulates X chromosome gene expression. This protein, MIX-1, is a member of the dosage compensation complex that associates specifically with hermaphrodite X chromosomes to reduce their gene expression during interphase. MIX-1 also associates with all mitotic chromosomes to ensure their proper segregation. Both dosage compensation and mitosis are severely disrupted by mix-1 mutations. MIX-1 belongs to the SMC protein family required for mitotic chromosome condensation and segregation in yeast and frogs. Thus, an essential, conserved component of mitotic chromosomes has been recruited to the dosage compensation process. Rather than dosage compensation and mitosis being achieved by two separate sets of related genes, these two processes share an identical component, indicating a common mechanism for establishing higher order chromosome structure and proper X chromosome gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2053035086,"A transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i occurs throughout the cell as sea urchin embryos enter anaphase of the first cell cycle. The transient just precedes chromatid disjunction and spindle elongation. Microinjection of calcium chelators or heparin, an InsP3 receptor antagonist, blocks chromosome separation. Photorelease of calcium or InsP3 can reverse the block. Nuclear reformation is merely delayed by calcium antagonists at concentrations that block chromatid separation. Thus, the calcium signal triggers the separation of chromatids, while calcium-independent pathways can bring about the alterations in microtubule dynamics and nuclear events associated with anaphase progression. That calcium triggers chromosome disjunction alone is unexpected. It helps explain previous conflicting results and allows the prediction that calcium plays a similar role at anaphase in other cell types."

Two distinct domains of dynamin are implicated in the interactions with dynamin GTPase activators. Microtubules and Grb2 bind to the carboxyl-terminal proline/arginine-rich domain (PRD), whereas phosphoinositides bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. In this study we tested the effect of different phosphoinositides on dynamin GTPase activity and found that the best activator is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate followed by 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-benzyloxyphosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate was a weak activator and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate did not activate GTPase at all. We then addressed the question of whether both domains of dynamin, PRD and PH, can be engaged simultaneously, and determined the effects of dual occupancy on dynamin GTPase activity. We found that Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate together increased the dynamin GTPase activity up to 4-fold higher than that obtained by these activators tested separately, and also reduced the dynamin concentration required for half-maximal activities by 3-fold. These results indicate that both stimulators can bind to dynamin simultaneously resulting in superactivation of dynamin GTPase activity.

The mechanisms by which these interactions regulate dynamin GTPase activity are poorly understood. Until recently it was believed that all dynamin activators interact with a carboxyl-terminal domain of approximately 100 residues designated PRD 1The abbreviations used are: PRD, proline/arginine-rich domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI(3,4)P2, 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-benzyloxyphosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PI(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PI(3,4,5)P3, 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-benzyloxyphosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. for its high content of prolines (P) and arginines (R).

As expected, this truncated dynamin was not activable by Grb2 or microtubules, but was stimulated by PI(4,5)P2, presumably due to an interaction with the PH domain. This paper addresses two related issues. First, how do specific phosphoinositides affect the GTPase activity of dynamin? The inositol rings of phosphoinositides can be modified at multiple positions by specific kinases and phosphatases, some of which have been implicated in membrane trafficking events (30De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). If there is specificity in the activation of dynamin by phosphoinositides, then these lipid modifying enzymes are potential regulators of the endocytic process. Second, since dynamin has two interaction sites, the PRD and the PH domain, can these sites be occupied simultaneously and, if so, what is the consequence of simultaneous occupancy for GTPase activation? Phosphocellulose (P11) and diethylaminoethylcellulose (DE52) were from Whatman. Methyl sulfonate (SP)-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Biotech. PI(4,5)P2, PI(4)P, and phosphatidylcholine were from Calbiochem. 1-O-(1,2-Di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-benzyloxyphosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate ((PI(3,4,5)P3) and 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-benzyloxyphosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4-bis-phosphate (PI(3,4)P2) were gifts from Dr. C-S. Chen, University of Kentucky. Protease inhibitors, taxol, papain, thrombin, and GTP were from Sigma. [γ-32P]GTP was from Amersham. Dynamin I was purified from bovine brains following a procedure described previously (31Earnest S. Khokhlatchev A. Albanesi J.P. Barylko B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh bovine brains were homogenized in an Omnimixer with 3 volumes of buffer A, which contains 0.1 m MES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium azide, and a mixture of protease inhibitors: 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each ofN α-benzoyl-l-arginine methyl ester, N α-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The extract following centrifugation was chromatographed on three consecutive ion-exchange columns: DE52-cellulose, P11 phosphocellulose, and SP-Sepharose. Fractions enriched in dynamin were then mixed with microtubules and ultracentrifuged. Dynamin, which co-sediments with microtubules, was released by addition of 10 mm GTP. The supernatant was finally passed through a DE52 column to remove any traces of tubulin. All purification steps were carried out using buffer A and columns were eluted with buffer A containing NaCl. To remove the carboxyl-terminal PRD, dynamin was proteolyzed with papain at 30 °C for 20 min at an enzyme to dynamin ratio of 1:1000 (w/w). Papain was first activated by incubation on ice for 15 min in a solution containing 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Digestion was terminated by adding iodoacetic acid to a final concentration of 5 mm and the digest was mixed with GST-Grb2 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose to remove PRD fragments and any traces of undigested dynamin. This treatment yields fragments of 53 and 32 kDa which are noncovalently associated to each other (29Lin H.-C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GST-Grb2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in a pGEX-2T vector and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B using a standard procedure. Grb2 was obtained by thrombin cleavage of GST-Grb2 in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 4 h at room temperature. Approximately 130 NIH units of thrombin were used to digest 4 mg of GST-Grb2 attached to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The identity of released Grb2 was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Grb2 antibodies and anti-GST antibodies. NH2-terminal sequencing confirmed that GST-Grb2 was cleaved at the expected site, producing full-length Grb2. Tubulin was purified according to the procedure of Williams and Lee (32Williams R.C. Lee J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but MES rather than PIPES buffer was used. Stable microtubules were obtained by polymerization of tubulin in the presence of taxol at a 2-fold molar excess to tubulin dimer. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared by dissolving phospholipids in chloroform and drying them under a stream of argon. Dried lipids were dissolved in 0.1m MES, pH 7.0, and sonicated for 10 min at maximum power (Bath sonicator model W185; Heat System Ultrasonics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Phosphoinositide vesicles were prepared as mixtures with phosphatidylcholine (PC) at a 1:9 molar ratio (33Lin K.-M. Wenegieme E. Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium was performed on a Beckman XLA Analytical Ultracentrifuge. The data (absorbances at 280 nm) were collected from cell radii of 6.8–7.2 cm, with a step size of 0.001 cm. Five scans were averaged in the final output. The initial concentrations of GST-Grb2 and Grb2 were 0.2 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. Sedimentation analyses of GST-Grb2 and Grb2 were performed in the same buffer (0.1 m MES, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaN3). GST-Grb2 was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, and Grb2 at 15,000 rpm in rotor An-60ti using a 12-mm double-sector centerpiece. The background absorbance was estimated by overspeeding at 40,000 rpm until a flat baseline was obtained. The overspeed absorbances were 0.019 and 0.018 for Grb2 and GST-Grb2, respectively. The partial specific volume of Grb2 was calculated to be 0.73 ml/g by the method of Cohn and Edsall (34Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943Crossref Google Scholar). The actual molecular masses of Grb2 and GST-Grb2 were calculated to be 26 and 52 kDa, respectively. GTPase activities were measured by the release of32Pi from [γ-32P]GTP (35Korn E.D. Collins J.H. Maruta H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) after incubation at 37 °C in buffer A containing additionally 1 mm MgGTP. The reaction times varied from 2 to 30 min, depending on dynamin or lipid concentrations, to ensure that less than 15% of GTP was hydrolyzed. Dynamin was preincubated with lipids and/or Grb2 for 10 min at room temperature prior to initiation of the reaction by addition of 5 mm MgGTP. In some experiments (as indicated in the figure legends) buffer A contained additionally 0.1m NaCl. Although a high concentration of MES was used in these assays, this zwitterionic buffer contributes little to the ionic strength of the solution. Except in the case where the effect of salt was examined (Fig. 3), all GTPase assays were carried out at low ionic strength, allowing a comparison of our results with those of other investigators, who also employ low salt assay conditions (16Robinson P.J.

Samples were placed in a 1-cm path length cuvette and absorbance at 340 nm was determine using a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer. Protein concentration was determined as described by Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) as modified by Matsudaira and Burgess (39Matsudaira P.T. Burgess D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Inositol phospholipids, which have been implicated in the regulation of dynamin GTPase activity, are subject to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at multiple positions of the inositol ring. Here we show that the site of inositol phosphorylation is a key determinant for dynamin activation. The order of efficacy is PI(4,5)P2 > PI(3,4,5)P3 > PI(4)P (Fig. 1). At concentrations below 1 μm, PI(4)P is somewhat more effective than PI(3,4,5)P3. However, maximal PI(4)P stimulated activity is only about 50 min−1, less than half the value obtained with PI(3,4,5)P3 and about one-third of PI(4,5)P2 stimulated activity. PI(3,4,)P2, which has the same charge as PI(4,5)P2, is by far the least effective activator, providing no stimulation even at concentrations as high as 40 μm. We then asked if PI(3,4)P2 binds to dynamin despite its inability to stimulate GTPase activity. In a competition assay, PI(4,5)P2 stimulated activity was measured in the presence of various concentrations of PI(3,4)P2. If PI(3,4)P2 binds to dynamin, it should displace PI(4,5)P2 from its binding site and thus inhibit GTPase activity. However, no inhibition by PI(3,4)P2 was observed, even at a 10-fold molar excess over PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, PI(3,4)P2 has a much lower affinity for dynamin than PI(4,5)P2, or binds at a different site on the molecule. Dynamin contains two potential sites for phosphoinositide binding, the PH domain and the highly basic carboxyl-terminal PRD. Ionic charges promote the associations of anionic phospholipids with the PRD and interactions are significantly reduced at physiological ionic strength (14Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, by measuring lipid-stimulated GTPase activity in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, as in Fig. 3, it is likely that interactions with the PH domain predominate. In Fig. 3 we show the dependence of GTPase specific activity on dynamin concentration, at fixed concentrations of phosphoinositides. Unlike most enzymes, the specific activity of dynamin is not invariant as a function of dynamin concentration, but increases in a highly cooperative manner (15Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This presumably reflects the well established propensity of dynamin to self-associate and the consequent increase in GTPase activity that is coupled to this self-association. We had previously shown that PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles provide a multivalent surface that allows cooperative increases in GTPase activity even at relatively low dynamin concentrations (29Lin H.-C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 indicates that PI(4,5)P2 retains its ability to support high specific activity at 100 mm NaCl whereas salt greatly diminishes the efficacies of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4)P. Therefore, under conditions more closely resembling those in the cell, only PI(4,5)P2 appears to be a potent stimulator of dynamin activity. The sensitivity of the PI(3,4,5)P3-dynamin interaction to ionic strength raised the possibility that this phosphoinositide binds primarily to the PRD. However, this proved not to be the case. To examine this, we deleted the PRD by papain treatment of dynamin, which yields two non-covalently associated fragments of 53 and 32 kDa. The 53-kDa fragment contains the GTP-binding site (thus originating from the NH2-terminal portion of dynamin), whereas the 32-kDa fragment contains the PH domain and extends to the beginning of the PRD (Fig. 4, see also Ref. 29Lin H.-C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As we showed in a prior study, the 53/32-kDa fragments are activated by PI(4,5)P2, but not by microtubules or Grb2. Activation of the papain fragments by phosphoinositides follows the basic pattern observed with intact dynamin: PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 are the best activators, PI(4)P is much less effective, and PI(3,4)P2 fails to activate. Therefore, at low ionic strength, PI(3,4,5)P3 binds at least as well as PI(4,5)P2 to a truncated dynamin lacking the PRD. This result agrees with that of Salim et al. (28Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) who demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance that PI(3,4,5)P3can bind to expressed dynamin PH domains at low ionic strength but not in the presence of 1 μm Ca2+ and 2 mm Mg2+, which more closely reflect physiological conditions. Our results also suggest that a phosphate at the 5-position of the inositol ring is necessary for high levels of activation, whereas a phosphate at the 3-position reduces the phospholipid activation of dynamin. Most in vitro activators of dynamin GTPase activity, including microtubules and SH3-containing proteins, interact solely with the carboxyl-terminal PRD (14Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 18Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Instead, activation by phosphoinositides involves interactions outside the PRD, presumably with the PH domain (Ref. 29Lin H.-C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 4). This raises the question of whether or not phosphoinositides and PRD-binding proteins can interact simultaneously with dynamin and, if so, how simultaneous binding influences GTPase activation. To address this question we set out to determine the effect of Grb2, an SH3-containing protein, on phosphoinositide-stimulated GTPase activity. First it was necessary to determine the extent to which Grb2 alone could stimulate dynamin activity. All previous studies have utilized expressed fusion proteins of Grb2 and GST. However, since GST has a tendency to dimerize (40Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Fromage N. Arnoux B. Becquart J. Ducruix A. Science. 1995; 268: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), these GST-Grb2 fusion proteins are also predominantly dimeric, as we verified by sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 6 A). This multivalency poses a particular problem when considering dynamin GTPase activation, which can even occur upon cross-linking with anti-dynamin antibodies (36Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prepared nonfusion Grb2 by thrombin cleavage of GST-Grb2 (Fig. 5), and verified its monomeric nature by sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 6 B). Fig. 7 shows that the nonfusion Grb2 stimulates dynamin activity in a dose-dependent manner which plateaus at greater than 2 μm Grb2. In contrast, GST-Grb2 yields a biphasic activation which peaks at 0.5 μm GST-Grb2. These differences may be a consequence of the different complex-forming abilities of Grb2 versusGST-Grb2. A low speed co-sedimentation assay revealed that both molecules can cross-link dynamin into large networks (Fig. 8 A). Under conditions wherein dynamin alone, GST-Grb2 alone, and Grb2 alone remain soluble (13,000 × g, 15 min), mixtures of dynamin with either GST-Grb2 or Grb2 are pelletable. The formation of a large complex is also demonstrated by a rapid increase in turbidity when Grb2 or GST-Grb2 are added to dynamin. The traces shown in Fig. 8 Bwere obtained using 0.1 μm dynamin and 2 μmGrb2 or GST-Grb2. Clearly, GST-Grb2, which is tetravalent, is a more potent dynamin cross-linker than the divalent Grb2. The nature of these differences is still unclear, although it is possible to draw an analogy with the antigen-antibody precipitin reaction (41Hood L.E. Weissman I.L. Wood W.B. Wilson J.H. Immunology. 2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 48-54Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”).Figure 5Electrophoretic analysis of GST-Grb2 and Grb2.

A, co-sedimentation assay. Dynamin (0.3 μm) was mixed with 1 μm of either Grb2 or GST-Grb2, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended to equal volumes as supernatants and aliquots of each were electrophoresed. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Molecular weights of markers are shown on the left. B, turbidity was measured as absorbance at 340 nm. Cuvettes contained 0.1 μm dynamin I. At a time designated by the arrow, 2 μm Grb2 or GST-Grb2 were added. In the absence of dynamin, neither Grb2 nor GST-Grb2 gave any increase in absorbance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Grb2 activates dynamin GTPase to maximal levels of only 50–60 min−1. Therefore, if Grb2 competes with PI(4,5)P2 for dynamin binding, it should inhibit PI(4,5)P2 stimulated activity. Instead, dynamin specific activity in the presence of both Grb2 and PI(4,5)P2 is considerably higher than the additive activities obtained if the two activators were introduced separately. At 4 μm Grb2, PI(4,5)P2-stimulated GTPase activity was about double that obtained in the absence of Grb2 (Fig. 9). This synergistic effect of Grb2 and phospholipids on GTPase activation provides strong evidence that these two molecules can bind simultaneously to dynamin. The experiments shown in Fig. 9 were carried out at a fixed concentration of dynamin (0.1 μm). However, as shown above, there is a highly cooperative increase in PI(4,5)P2-stimulated GTPase activity as a function of dynamin concentration. In view of the synergy between Grb2 and PI(4,5)P2, we checked if the cooperative dynamin dependence of activity was also affected by the joint presence of both activators. Fig. 10 shows that Grb2 activates GTPase slightly, compared with the large increase obtained with PI(4,5)P2 alone. However, in the presence of both Grb2 and PI(4,5)P2, there is a marked shift in the dynamin concentration dependence from that obtained in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 alone. At 4 μmPI(4,5)P2, half-maximal activities occur at 0.11 μm dynamin. The effect of adding Grb2, also at 4 μm, reduces these dynamin concentration dependences approximately 3-fold, to 0.032 μm. The synergistic activation by Grb2 and phosphoinositides is particularly prominent at suboptimal levels of dynamin. For example, at 0.05 μmdynamin the GTPase activity is 4-fold higher in the presence of both activators than in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 alone. Since Grb2 has two SH3 domains and dynamin has multiple potential SH3-binding motifs within its PRD, a plausible explanation for the synergistic activation is that Grb2 cross-links dynamin molecules into a cluster by virtue of its two SH3 domains and thus increases its effective concentration on the phospholipid vesicles surface. In this paper we present two observations pertinent to the regulation of dynamin: first, at physiological ionic strength dynamin GTPase activity is stimulated by PI(4,5)P2, less so by PI(3,4,5)P3, but not at all by PI(4)P or PI(3,4)P2, and second, another dynamin activator, Grb2, binds to dynamin simultaneously with PI(4,5)P2, resulting in synergistic rather than additive stimulation of activity. Previously, we had shown that the GTPase activity of dynamin is stimulated by liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2, even in the absence of its COOH-terminal proline and arginine-rich domain (29Lin H.-C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This domain was earlier thought to participate in all interactions leading to GTPase activation. It is likely that PI(4,5)P2stimulates GTPase activity by interacting with the dynamin PH domain, because recombinant PH domains bind to phosphoinositides and dynamin mutants lacking the PH domain are not activated by these phospholipids (27Zheng J. Cahill S.M. Lemmon M.A. Fushman D. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 28Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I.

In the present study we found that PI(3,4,5)P3 is also a potent stimulator of dynamin, but only at low ionic strength. In contrast, PI(4)P and PI(3,4)P2 are poor activators under all conditions examined. These results prompt us to speculate that in cells, dynamin activity can be reduced or terminated by the action of a phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphatase, such as synaptojanin, which converts PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4)P and PI(3,4)P2, respectively (42McPherson P.S.

Synaptojanin is enriched at clathrin-coated pits and interacts with amphiphysin, a dynamin-binding protein also enriched at the coated pit (42McPherson P.S. Garcia E. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Grb2, an adaptor protein that consists of two SH3 domains flanking a central SH2 domain, binds exclusively to the dynamin PRD (17Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Presumably, Grb2 stimulates dynamin GTPase activity as a consequence of cross-linking the enzyme by virtue of its two SH3 domains. We found that dynamin and Grb2 form large complexes, as monitored by light scattering and low-speed centrifugation. Although the role of Grb2 in endocytosis is uncertain, it has been speculated to serve as a linker between activated tyrosine kinase receptors and dynamin (45Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Until now, all in vitro studies of Grb2-dynamin interactions have employed bacterially-expressed fusion proteins with GST. We treated GST-Grb2 with thrombin to obtain nonfusion Grb2 and confirmed that it is monomeric, in contrast to GST-Grb2 which is predominantly dimeric. Thus, GST-Grb2 contains four dynamin-binding SH3 domains whereas Grb2 itself has only two, presumably accounting for the greater efficacy of GTPase stimulation by GST-Grb2 which we observed. The biphasic nature of GTPase activation by GST-Grb2 is analogous to the precipitin reaction between antigens and antibodies (41Hood L.E. Weissman I.L. Wood W.B. Wilson J.H. Immunology. 2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 48-54Google Scholar). In the presence of excess GST-Grb2, single dynamin molecules are coated by multiple molecules of GST-Grb2, thus preventing the formation of a cross-linked dynamin lattice needed for GTPase activation. Monomeric Grb2, which is bivalent, would be expected to yield a similar drop in GTPase activity but at higher concentrations than those obtained with the tetravalent GST-Grb2. Because dynamin GTPase activity is stimulated by cross-linking, even with anti-dynamin antibodies (36Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), our results suggest that previous reports of dynamin activation by GST-SH3 fusion proteins should be re-evaluated and that only monomeric SH3-containing species should be used in the future to avoid artifactual cross-linking caused by GST dimerization. Compared with PI(4,5)P2, Grb2 by itself is a relatively weak stimulator of dynamin GTPase activity. Its major effect on activity is the synergistic stimulation with PI(4,5)P2which is most pronounced at low dynamin concentrations. Because there is no evidence for an interaction between Grb2 and PI(4,5)P2, the simplest explanation for this synergy involves simultaneous binding of the two activators to dynamin. For example, Grb2 may cluster dynamin molecules by cross-linking their SH3 binding domains, thus increasing the effective concentration of dynamin bound to PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. In the absence of Grb2, dynamin molecules would be dispersed on the liposome surface until high enough concentrations were reached to promote the dynamin-dynamin interactions required for high enzymatic activity. The ability of dynamin to interact simultaneously with phospholipids and Grb2 raises the possibility of simultaneous interaction with other SH3-containing proteins such as amphiphysin (20Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The importance of amphiphysin for dynamin targeting was highlighted by the recent study of Shupliakov et al. (46Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) who introduced expressed amphiphysin SH3 domains into lamprey neurons, displacing dynamin from the coated pit and blocking synaptic membrane recycling. There is strong evidence that SH3-binding motifs in the PRD are required to target dynamin to coated pit regions of the plasma membrane (19Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Likewise, it appears that phosphoinositides bind to the dynamin PH domain and potently stimulate GTPase activity by this interaction. Based on these results and our current observations, we propose the following model for dynamin regulation: dynamin is first recruited to the coated pit by SH3-containing protein, e.g. Grb2 or amphiphysin. Once there, dynamin's interaction with the membrane is strengthened by the binding of its PH domain with PI(4,5)P2and, perhaps, PI(3,4,5)P3 which may also orient dynamin to favor its polymerization. In a similar manner, binding of β-adrenergic receptor kinase to Gβγ is favored by the presence of both inositol phospholipids and Gβγ on the membrane (47Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the case of dynamin, these phospholipids also promote self-association and GTPase stimulation, which could be reversed by the enzymatic action of a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase, e.g.synaptojanin. This model is highly speculative, but it incorporates the key observation presented in this paper, i.e. that phospholipids and SH3-containing proteins bind simultaneously to distinct domains of the dynamin molecule and synergistically activate dynamin GTPase. We thank Dr. Ching-Shih Chen for providing phospholipids (PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2). We also thank Irma Rodman for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2023302157,"The Clostridium histolyticum 116-kDa collagenase consists of four segments, S1, S2a, S2b, and S3. A 98-kDa gelatinase, which can degrade denatured but not native collagen, lacks the C-terminal fragment containing a part of S2b and S3. In this paper we have investigated the function of the C-terminal segments using recombinant proteins. Full-length collagenase degraded both native type I collagen and a synthetic substrate, Pz-peptide, while an 88-kDa protein containing only S1 and S2a (S1S2a) degraded only Pz-peptide. Unlike the full-length enzyme, S1S2a did not bind to insoluble type I collagen. To determine the molecular determinant of collagen binding activity, various C-terminal regions were fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase. S3 as well as S2bS3 conferred collagen binding. However, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with a region shorter than S3 exhibited reduced collagen binding activity. S3 liberated from the fusion protein also showed collagen binding activity, but not S2aS2b or S2b. S1 had 100% of the Pz-peptidase activity but only 5% of the collagenolytic activity of the full-length collagenase. These results indicate that S1 and S3 are the catalytic and binding domains, respectively, and that S2a and S2b form an interdomain structure.

Collagens are the major protein constituents of the extracellular matrix and the most abundant proteins in all higher organisms (1Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987Google Scholar). The tightly coiled triple helical collagen molecule assembles into water-insoluble fibers or sheets which are cleaved only by collagenases, and are resistant to other proteinases. Various types of collagenases, which differ in substrate specificity and molecular structure, have been identified and characterized. Bacterial collagenases differ from vertebrate collagenases in that they exhibit broader substrate specificity (2Peterkofsky B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 453-471Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Birkedal-Hansen H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 140-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Clostridium histolyticum collagenase is the best studied bacterial collagenase (4Mookhtiar K.A. Van Wart H.E. Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 116-126PubMed Google Scholar) and is widely used as a tissue-dispersing enzyme (5Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar, 6Worthington C.C. Worthington Enzyme Manual: Collagenase. Worthington Biochemical Co., Freehold, NJ1988Google Scholar). This enzyme is unique in that it can degrade both water-insoluble native collagens and water-soluble denatured ones, can attack almost all collagen types, and can make multiple cleavages within triple helical regions (4Mookhtiar K.A. Van Wart H.E. Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 116-126PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of collagenases have provided insight into the high-ordered structure of collagens (7French M.F. Bhown A. Van Wart H.E. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Mallya S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Van Wart H.E. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the structure-function relationship of this unique enzyme is not known. Multiple forms of collagenase are produced by C. histolyticum. Seven different forms have been identified, and they are divided into two classes based on possible similarities in their amino acid sequences and their specificities toward peptide substrates (9Van Wart H.E. Steinbrink D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6520-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In a previous study (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we have cloned and sequenced acolH gene encoding the 116-kDa collagenase (ColH), which is abundant in many commercial enzymes (11Steinbrink D.R. Bond M.D. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2771-2776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of ColH with those of the Vibrio alginolyticus (12Takeuchi H. Shibano Y. Morihara K. Fukushima J. Inami S. Keil B. Gilles A.-M. Kawamoto S. Okuda K. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Clostridium perfringenscollagenases (13Matsushita O. Yoshihara K. Katayama S. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a segmental structure for these enzymes (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ColH has been shown to consist of four segments, S1, S2a, S2b, and S3, and S2a and S2b are homologous. The molecular masses of S1, S2a, S2b, and S3 are 78.1, 10.0, 9.9, and 14.1 kDa, respectively (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S1 contains the sequence HEXXH, a consensus motif located at the catalytic center of zinc-metalloproteases. A 98-kDa gelatinase that copurified with ColH hydrolyzed denatured but not native collagen. The two enzymes possessed identical N-terminal sequences and their peptide maps were almost identical. Therefore, the 98-kDa gelatinase is probably produced by cleaving off a C-terminal peptide from ColH (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to suspect that the C-terminal peptide forms a functional domain, which is involved in either providing accessibility to or binding of the enzyme to collagen. To gain insights into the structure-function relationships of C. histolyticum collagenases, we have attempted a molecular dissection of ColH by constructing recombinant derivatives of the enzyme. In this paper, we examined the collagen binding activities of various C-terminal peptides fused to the C terminus of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CB buffer, collagen binding buffer; FP, fusion protein; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. to localize the collagen-binding domain. We have also examined the enzymatic activities of C-terminal truncated species toward native type I collagen and a synthetic peptide substrate. C. histolyticum JCM 1403 (ATCC 19401) was obtained from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (Saitama, Japan). Bacillus subtilis DB104 (14Kawamura F. Doi R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 442-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to produce the recombinant collagenases. Escherichia coli DH5α (15Bethesda Research Laboratories Focus. 1986; 8: 9Google Scholar) was used for the construction of all recombinant plasmids. Plasmid pCHC116Δ3 was generated by nested deletion of pCHC116 (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from its 3′ end. The plasmid contains a colH gene fragment from nucleotide 2,719 to 3,391 (numbered as in Ref. 10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes the C-terminal segments of ColH, S2b, and S3. E. coli BL21 and the pGEX-4T series plasmids (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) were used as a host-vector system for the production of GST fusion proteins. A ColH fraction containing the gelatinase, prepared from C. histolyticum cultures as described previously (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as partially purified ColH. ColH purified from cultures of recombinantB. subtilis DB104 (16Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Ohhira I. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used as recombinant ColH (rColH). Recombinant B. subtilis strains were grown as described previously (16Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Ohhira I. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For screening recombinant plasmids, E. coli DH5α transformants were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. For the preparation of GST fusion proteins, all recombinant E. coli BL21 cells were grown in 2YT-G medium consisting of the following ingredients: 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 20 g of glucose, and 100 mg of ampicillin/liter. The expression of fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). An N-terminal peptide of ColH, consisting of S1 and S2a (S1S2a), was constructed as follows. A 2.9-kilobase HaeIII-PstI fragment containing the colH′ gene (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into the EcoRV and PstI sites of Bluescript II KS(+). Into the downstreamSacI site of the resulting plasmid (pCHC200) a synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-GCTTAATTAATTAAGCAGCT-3′, was inserted so that translation from a colH′ transcript terminates at the TAA codon. The resulting plasmid was designated as pCHC201. A 3.1-kilobaseBssHII fragment, which encodes amino acids 1 to 766, (numbered as in Ref. 10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to S1S2a plus an extra 5-amino acid stretch (Ala-Arg-Gly-Ile-His), was isolated from pCHC201 and then ligated into the SmaI site of pHY300PLK. The resulting plasmid was introduced into B. subtilis DB104. The transformant was grown, and the culture supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration as described elsewhere (16Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Ohhira I. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The fractions with Pz-peptidase activity after gel filtration were applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (Ether-Toyopearl, bed volume 14 ml; Toso, Tokyo, Japan), which was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing ammonium sulfate (40% saturation). Proteins were eluted by a 280-ml linear gradient from 40 to 0% ammonium sulfate in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). The Pz-peptidase activity eluted at 29% ammonium sulfate. The active fraction was dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5), and then applied to a MonoQ column. Chromatography was performed as described elsewhere (16Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Ohhira I. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) except that the pH was changed to 8.5. A recombinant N-terminal peptide containing only S1 was produced as follows. An oligonucleotide encoding the C-terminal peptide of S1 (Val564 to Ser683) followed by a stop codon was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using two primers (5′-GTGCCTTTTGTAGCTGATGA-3′ and 5′-CCGCGGTTAGGAATCACCTTCGTTTGGTA-3′) and pCHC201 plasmid DNA. The amplified fragment was cloned into the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). An 0.33-kilobaseSphI-SacII fragment of this plasmid was substituted for a 0.61-kilobase SphI-SacII fragment of pCHC201. S1 was purified from cultures of recombinantB. subtilis as described above. An inactive ColH mutant was produced as follows. Replacement of the GAA codon encoding Glu416, one of the residues forming a putative catalytic center, with a GAT codon (Asp) was performed using pCHC201 plasmid DNA and a Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), according to the instruction of the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides, 5′-GCAAATAATGTGTATAATCATGTCTAAATAATTC-3′ and 5′-GTGACTGGTGAGGCCTCAACCAAGTC-3′, were used as a mutagenic primer and a selection primer, respectively. The mutant enzyme, designated as rColH(E416D), was produced using a shuttle vector, pAT19 (17Trieu-Cuot P. Carlier C. Poyart-Salmeron C. Courvalin P. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (16Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Ohhira I. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The GST gene fusion system was employed to construct fusion proteins between GST and ColH C-terminal segments. A DNA fragment encoding segments 2a and 2b (S2aS2b, Pro678-Asp860) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pCHC11 plasmid DNA (10Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a 5′-primer, 5′-CCCGGGCCAAACGAAGGTGATTCCAA-3′, and a 3′-primer, 5′-CTCGAGTTAATCTGTAATCTTAATCTTCA-3′. A DNA fragment encoding segment 2b (S2b, Glu767-Asp860) was also obtained in the same way using pCHC302 plasmid DNA, 5′-pGEX primer (Pharmacia), and the same 3′-primer as described above. These fragments were cloned into pT7Blue T-vector. They were inserted into pGEX-4T-2 vector DNA to express the enzyme fragments as GST fusion proteins. E. coliDH5α competent cells were transformed with each ligation mixture by electroporation. After the nucleotide sequence of each fusion gene was confirmed, E. coli BL21 was transformed with the recombinant plasmid. Each clone was grown in 100 ml of 2YT-G medium to an optical density at 600 nm of 2.5, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. Purification of the fusion protein was performed with a glutathione-Sepharose column (bed volume, 0.5-ml; Pharmacia) as described by the manufacturer. The fusion proteins for S2aS2b and S2b were designated as FP342 and FP344, respectively. GST fusion proteins for C-terminal fragments of various lengths were also constructed. The insert DNA fragment in pCHC116Δ3 (see above) encoding S2b plus S3 (S2bS3) was deleted from its 5′ end using appropriate restriction enzymes. Each fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of a suitable GST fusion vector of the pGEX-4T series (Pharmacia) so that the reading frame is intact. After the nucleotide sequence of each fusion gene was confirmed, fusion proteins carrying varying length C-terminal fragments were produced as described above, and designated as FP302–FP306. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The DNA ligation kit was a product of Takara Shuzo. All recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to confirm the reading frame on an automated nucleotide sequencer (model ABI PRISM 377, Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). An ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, FS (Perkin-Elmer), and pGEX primers (Pharmacia) were used for sequencing the GST fusion constructs. A Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (Amersham Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and M13 dye primers (Perkin-Elmer) were used for sequencing all other constructs. The activities of the recombinant collagenases were determined using Pz-peptide (4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Arg, Sigma) or insoluble collagen from bovine achilles tendon (Worthington Biochemical Co., Freehold, NJ), as described elsewhere (16Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Ohhira I. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The GST activity of GST fusion proteins was assayed using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as described in the supplier's protocol. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. All the assays were carried out in triplicate. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using 7.5, 12.5, or 15% polyacryamide gels, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R as described previously (20Jin F. Matsushita O. Katayama S.-I. Jin S. Matsushita C. Minami J. Okabe A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 230-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Band intensity was determined using a flat bed scanner and the public domain computer program, NIH Image (developed at the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, and available from the Internet by anonymous FTP from zippy.nimh.nih.gov). Two hundred picomoles of the isolated C-terminal fragments obtained from fusion proteins (FP302, FP305, FP342, and FP344) were blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using ProSorb devices (Perkin-Elmer) as described by the supplier. Twenty amino acid residues from the N terminus were determined for each fragment on an automatic protein sequencer (Model 492, Perkin-Elmer). All the isolated fragments possessed the expected N-terminal amino acid sequences. A GST fusion protein containing S2bS3 (FP302, 1.1 mg) was cleaved by incubation with 10 units of thrombin for 5 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C to remove glutathione, and the cleaved N-terminal GST fragment was removed by adding glutathione-Sepharose beads (100 μl). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min and the bead treatment was repeated three times. The supernatant was dialyzed against 2 liters of distilled water at 4 °C for 12 h with two changes, filtrated through an 0.45-μm filter, and lyophilized. The sample was dissolved in 100 μl of distilled water, mixed with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (10 mg/ml of 50% ethanol), and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (model Kompact MALDI III, Kratos, Manchester, United Kingdom) with BSA as an internal standard. Collagen binding was assayed as follows, unless otherwise stated. Five milligrams of insoluble collagen (type I, C-9879; Sigma) were added to an Ultrafree microcentrifugal device with an 0.22-μm low-binding Durapore membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which was placed in a microcentrifuge tube. All steps were carried out at room temperature. Two hundred microliters of collagen binding buffer (CB buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) were added to swell the collagen fibers. After incubation for 30 min, the tube was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Centrifugation was repeated after changing the direction of the tube in the rotor. The collagen precipitate was resuspended in 60 μl of CB buffer containing 100 pmol of enzyme and incubated for 30 min. The filtrate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and used for GST assay or analysis by SDS-PAGE. To determine the binding affinities of rColH(E416D) and various C-terminal segments by Scatchard plot analysis, the collagen binding assay was carried out with the following modification. Collagen was washed with 200 μl of CB buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer containing various concentrations (25–400 μg/ml) of the mutant enzyme or various fragments. A calibration curve was constructed for each sample by densitometory after SDS-PAGE, and was used to quantitate their amounts in the filtrates. The results obtained by triplicate assay were analyzed on a Scatchard plot, and the dissociation constant (Kd) and the number of binding sites on insoluble collagen (B max) for each protein were determined by the least-square method. To examine collagen binding, 6 μg of ColH in 60 μl of CB buffer was added to 5 mg of swollen collagen. After the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged, a 20-μl sample of the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, the gelatinase but not ColH was detectable in the filtrate, suggesting that ColH but not the gelatinase binds to insoluble type I collagen. Various smaller polypeptides were also detected in the filtrate. These might have resulted from hydrolysis of insoluble collagen by ColH. To inhibit the collagenolytic activity of ColH, the incubation was carried out at 4 °C for 30 min, and then the filtrate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The gelatinase was again detectable but neither ColH nor the smaller polypeptides were detected in the filtrate, indicating that ColH binds collagen without degrading it at 4 °C. Therefore, subsequent collagen binding assays of active collogenases were carried out at 4 °C. The difference in the collagen-binding capability of the two enzymes suggests that the C-terminal peptide which is absent in the gelatinase is involved in collagen binding. However, it has not yet been proved that the 98-kDa gelatinase is produced from ColH by cleaving off the C-terminal region. To test this possibility, two recombinant enzymes, 116-kDa rColH and its truncated form consisting of S1S2a were purified from cultures of recombinant B. subtilis cells. Twenty-five picomoles of each enzyme were mixed with 5 mg of swollen insoluble collagen, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. A sample containing 1 μg of protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). While the full-length rColH bound to insoluble collagen, the truncated form did not. Activities against insoluble collagen and Pz-peptide, a synthetic water-soluble substrate, were determined for the two recombinant polypeptides (Table I). The Pz-peptide hydrolyzing activity of the truncated form was 73% of that of rColH, while its collagenolytic activity was only 7%. This result suggests that the C-terminal peptide is required for binding and hydrolysis of insoluble collagen.Table ICollagenase and Pz-peptidase activities of recombinant collagenasesEnzymeCollagenasePz-peptidaseunits/pmolrColH0.164 ± 0.0060.0859 ± 0.0036rColH′(S1S2a)0.0116 ± 0.00590.0629 ± 0.0048rColH′(S1)0.00857 ± 0.001540.123 ± 0.006 Open table in a new tab The C-terminal peptide, S2bS3, was fused to the C terminus of GST to see if it conferred the ability to bind to collagen on GST. The apparent molecular mass of the fusion protein estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3), 51 kDa, agreed with the 50,526 Da value calculated from the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene. The fusion protein was cleaved by thrombin and SDS-PAGE showed two peptides. One migrated to the same position as the product generated by cleavage of GST alone (26 kDa), and the other (28 kDa) reacted with anti-collagenase antiserum (data not shown). The peptide was purified, its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined, and it coincided with the predicted sequence. Its apparent molecular mass differed from the value (24,378 Da) calculated for the S2bS3 containing peptide. To determine the molecular mass more accurately, the peptide was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Its molecular mass was determined to be 24,370 Da and the reason for its abnormal mobility in SDS-PAGE is unknown. Samples of the GST fusion protein before and after cleavage with thrombin were combined, added to CB buffer containing BSA, chicken ovalbumin, and horse myoglobin (6 μg each) and then the final volume was adjusted with CB buffer to 60 μl. After incubation with 5 mg of insoluble collagen, and centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). All proteins except the fusion protein and S2bS3 were present in the filtrate, indicating that S2bS3 and the GST fusion protein specifically bound to collagen. To determine the collagen binding condition, the S2bS3 peptide was incubated with insoluble collagen under various conditions. When 20 μg of the peptide was incubated with varying amounts of insoluble collagen for 30 min at room temperature, it was almost completely bound to 10 mg or more collagen. When 20 μg of the peptide was incubated with 15 mg of collagen for varying times, approximately 70% of the peptide bound to collagen after 2 min, and the binding reached its maximal level after 30 min. It was shown that the binding capacity of collagen for the S2bS3 peptide is more than 2 μg/mg collagen, and that incubation at room temperature for 30 min is sufficient for completion of the binding reaction. The effect of pH on collagen binding was examined by determining the GST activity of the GST fusion protein in the filtrate after incubating using the standard assay except the buffer was changed to: 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl containing 5 mmCaCl2 (pH 5.0) or CB buffer (pH 7.0) or CB buffer (pH 9.0). Mean ± S.D. of collagen binding at pH 5, 7, and 9 were 97.9 ± 0.0, 97.5 ± 0.3, and 100 ± 0.0%, respectively. The Pz-peptidase activity of rColH determined in these buffers was 0.98 ± 0.98, 76.5 ± 2.4, and 60.1 ± 1.2 units/nmol, respectively. When 5 mm EDTA was added to the buffer in place of 5 mm CaCl2, the Pz-peptidase activity of rColH was completely inhibited, while the collagen binding activity of the GST fusion was 88.6 ± 1.2%. The addition of gelatin at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml to CB buffer did not affect binding of the GST fusion protein (96.0 ± 0.2%). The addition of sodium chloride at a final concentration of 1.5 m slightly affected binding (92.3 ± 0.3%). Two truncated peptides, S1S2a and S2bS3, exhibited Pz-peptidase and collagen binding activities, respectively. Given the homology between S2a and S2b, it appears that S3 is a collagen-binding domain, and that S2b and possibly S2a form an interdomain structure. To examine this possibility, S2bS3 was deleted to various lengths from its N terminus and fused to the C terminus of GST (Fig. 4 A). The fusion proteins were purified to homogeneity as shown in Fig. 4 B. These fusion proteins were incubated with insoluble collagen, and the GST activities in the filtrates were determined (Table II). Since GST activity differed slightly from one fusion protein to another, the collagen binding activity of each fusion protein was determined by calculating the difference of the GST activity in supernatants incubated with and without collagen. As the C-terminal peptide was shortened, collagen binding activity decreased. However, the binding activity of the fusion protein containing S3 (FP305) was still high, being more than 90% of that containing S2bS3 (FP302). When the C-terminal peptide was shorter than S3, binding decreased significantly. The fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin, and the ability of the C-terminal peptides to bind insoluble collagen were tested by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 C). S3 alone bound collagen and the shorter peptide bound weakly, as was expected. The difference in band intensity between peptides incubated with and without collagen matched the binding activity of the corresponding fusion protein determined by its GST activity.Table IICollagen binding activities of the fusion proteins carrying various sizes of the ColH C-terminal fragmentFusion protein (fragment)Collagen binding%FP302 (Glu767–Arg981)98.7 ± 0.0FP303 (Gln811–Arg981)96.1 ± 0.3FP304 (Thr839–Arg981)85.3 ± 1.1FP305 (Pro861–Arg981)91.2 ± 0.6FP306 (Ile886–Arg981)64.8 ± 2.6GST1.1 ± 1.8 Open table in a new tab Since GST is known to exist as a dimer (21Henderson R.M.

Therefore, the GST fusion proteins are not suitable for the quantitative evaluation of the collagen binding affinity of various C-terminal segments. Thus, the fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin, and the collagen binding assay was performed with varying concentrations of the purified C-terminal peptides. Scatchard analysis of the data (Fig. 5) showed that S3 alone bound to insoluble collagen with low but significant affinity (Kd = 1.59 × 10−5m) and high capacity (B max = 1.01 nmol/mg collagen), while neither S2a2b nor S2b bound. S2bS3 showed biphasic plots, one with higher affinity (Kd = 3.39 × 10−7m, B max = 0.201 nmol/mg collagen) and the other with low affinity (Kd = 2.11 × 10−6m, B max = 0.628 nmol/mg collagen). The affinity of the full-length enzyme was determined by using rColH(E416D), in which the Glu416 residue forming the putative catalytic center is replaced by an Asp residue. This replacement aboli"

To elucidate how the expression of the GATA-2 gene is controlled, we isolated themouse GATA-2 (mGATA-2) gene. Transcription of mGATA-2 mRNAs was found to initiate from two distinct first exons, both of which encode entirely untranslated regions, while the remaining five exons are shared by each of the two divergent mRNAs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that GATA-2 mRNA initiated at the upstream first exon (IS) in Sca-1+/c-kit+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, whereas mRNA that initiates at the downstream first exon (IG) is expressed in all tissues and cell lines that express GATA-2. While the structure of the IG exon/promoter shows high similarity to those of the Xenopus and human GATA-2 genes, the IS exon/promoter has not been described previously. When we examined the regulation contributing to IS transcription using transient transfection assays, we found that sequences lying between −79 and −61 are critical for the cell type-specific activity of the IS promoter. DNase I footprinting experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the binding of transcription factors to this region. These data indicate that the proximal 80 base pair region of IS promoter is important for the generation of cell type-specific expression of mGATA-2 from the IS exon.

GATA-2 is a member of the GATA transcription factor family that binds to a common consensus sequence motif (A/T)GATA(A/G) through a highly conserved zinc finger DNA binding domain (1Yamamoto M.

The tissue distribution of GATA-2 is wider than that of GATA-1, i.e. GATA-2 is expressed not only in several hematopoietic lineages that also express GATA-1 but in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, in the embryonic brain, and in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, kidney, liver, and cardiac muscle (1Yamamoto M.

The expression profile of GATA-2 during the development of hematopoietic tissues has been studied most extensively in Xenopus and zebrafish. In Xenopus, low levels of maternal GATA-2 are present in early embryogenesis (15Partington G.A. Bertwistle D. Nicolas R.H. Kee W.J. Pizzey J.A. Patient R.K. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) while zygotic expression of GATA-2 is localized in the ventro-lateral ectoderm and mesoderm, in blood cells, and in the central nervous system (16Zon L.I. Mather C. Burgess S. Bolce M.E. Harland R.M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10642-10646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Walmsley M.E. Guille M.J. Bertwistle D.

Biol. 1994; 165: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A ventralizing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family member, BMP-4, inducesXenopus GATA-2 expression (19Maeno M. Mead P.E. Kelley C. Xu R. Kung H. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Zon L.I. Blood. 1996; 88: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In zebrafish, GATA-2 is initially detected in the ventral ectoderm (20Detrich III, H.W. Kieran M.W. Chan F.Y. Barone L.M. Yee K. Rundstadler J.A. Pratt S. Ransom D. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10713-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). High levels of GATA-2 are expressed at the boundary of the embryo and the yolk syncytial layer, and then by the 2–5 somite stage, in the presumptive hematopoietic progenitors that border the anterior and posterior of the embryo (20Detrich III, H.W. Kieran M.W. Chan F.Y. Barone L.M. Yee K. Rundstadler J.A. Pratt S. Ransom D. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10713-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, zygotic GATA-2 induction in vertebrates is coincident with the commencement of hematopoiesis, suggesting that GATA-2 is intimately involved in the development of hematopoietic cell lineages.

Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). GATA-2-null mutant mice die of severe anemia at approximately 10 to 11 days post coitus during embryonic development (21Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) and manifest a broad hematopoietic deficit. These studies demonstrated that GATA-2 plays a unique and crucial role in the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. It should be noted that GATA-2 expression is not found in mature hematopoietic cells (22Jippo T. Mizuno H. Xu Z. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 993-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nagai T. Harigae H. Ishihara H. Motohashi H. Minegishi N. Tsuchiya S. Hayashi N. Gu L. Andres B. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1994; 84: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a human bone marrow cell culture system or in an in vitro ES cell differentiation, GATA-2 expression was down-regulated coordinately with the progression of erythroid and myeloid cell differentiation (12Labbaye C. Valtieri M. Barberi T. Meccia E. Masella B. Pelosi E. Condorelli G.L. Testa U. Peschle C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2346-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Leonard M. Brice M.

A. 1995; 92: 4601-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, forced expression of GATA-2 in an avian erythroid cell line caused the proliferation of immature cells and markedly inhibited terminal erythroid differentiation (25Briegel K. Lim K.C. Plank C. Beug H. Engel J.D. Zenke M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1097-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These results taken together suggested that the expression of GATA-2 is related to proliferativeversus differentiated capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells and that suppression of GATA-2 activity might be essential for hematopoietic differentiation. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms controlling GATA-2 transcription may offer insight into the earliest aspects of hematopoietic cellular differentiation and may also give rise to a means of experimentally manipulating the proliferationversus differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. In this study, we have isolated and characterized the murine GATA-2 gene. We found that GATA-2 expression is regulated by two distinct promoters. One is used in general in the tissues and cell lines that express GATA-2, so we refer to this as the IG promoter. The structure of the IG promoter is homologous to that of the previously reportedXenopus and human GATA-2 gene promoters (26Brewer A.C. Guille M.J. Fear D.J. Partington G.A. Patient R.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Fleenor D.E. Langdon S.D. deCastro C.M. Kaufman R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The other promoter regulates the expression of GATA-2 specifically in hematopoietic cells, thus we refer to this as the IS promoter. Since this promoter has not been described elsewhere and displays lineage-restricted utilization, we have also characterized the regulatory domains that specify IS promoter activity. A C57Bl2/J mouse genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened with a random primed 0.6-kbp SacI fragment, encoding the 5′ region of mGATA-2 cDNA, and a 0.8-kbp fragment from the HindIII site in exon VI to the poly(A) of mGATA-2 cDNA. Both fragments were derived from an mGATA-2 cDNA clone, which we previously isolated from a fetal mouse liver cDNA library (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB000096). 2N. Suwabe, N. Minegishi, and M. Yamamoto, unpublished data. Hybridization and washing were carried out as described previously (23Nagai T. Harigae H. Ishihara H. Motohashi H. Minegishi N. Tsuchiya S. Hayashi N. Gu L. Andres B. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1994; 84: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blot hybridization, and insert DNA in the positive phages was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) vector (Stratagene). Sequences for the exon-intron boundaries and promoter and upstream regions were determined using aTaq polymerase cycle sequencing system and an automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Genomic DNA (25 μg) was isolated from an adult C57Bl2/J mouse and digested with BamHI and SacI. After electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, the DNA fragments were transferred hydrodynamically to a Zeta Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules) using a solution containing 0.4 m NaOH and 0.6m NaCl. The DNA fragments were cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation and hybridized to a 32P-labeled mGATA-2 cDNA fragment (0.8-kbp HindIII fragment corresponding to a part of exon VI). Hybridization and washing of the membranes were performed at 65 °C following the manufacturer protocol. A mouse mast cell line P815 (generously provided by Dr. A. Ichikawa) and T cell line BW5147 (from ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience). Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells DS19 (from Dr. Shigeru Sassa at the Rockefeller University) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse ProB cell line Ba/F3 (28Nakamura Y. Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Science. 1992; 257: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% WEHI-3B cell (29Matsuzaki Y. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Tomita T. Isoda M. Loh D.Y. Nakauchi H. Blood. 1997; 89: 853-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) conditioned medium. Bone marrow cell preparation, antibody staining, and four-color FACS sorting were performed as described previously (29Matsuzaki Y. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Tomita T. Isoda M. Loh D.Y. Nakauchi H. Blood. 1997; 89: 853-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before sorting the Sca-1+/c-kit+ fraction, cells were reacted with a mixture of biotinylated rat monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse differentiation antigens (lin−) Gr-1, Mac-1, B220, TER119, CD4 and CD8, and cells positive for these monoclonal antibodies were removed using streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Biomag; Perseptive Diagnostics). The monoclonal antibodies used were RA-6B2 (anti-B220), RA3–8C5 (anti-Gr-1, Pharmingen), TER119 (from Dr. Tatsuo Kina, Kyoto University), M1/70 (anti-Mac1), PK136 (anti-NK1.1), CD4, CD8, 5a-8 (anti-Thy-1.2, Dainippon Pharmaceutical), ACK-2 (anti-c-kit, from Dr. Shin-ichi Nishikawa, Kyoto University), and Sca-1 (anti-Ly 6A/E, Pharmingen). Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on a 1.0% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a Zeta Probe GT membrane. A NotI-SacI-digested cDNA fragment (0.6 kbp, containing 118 bp of exon IS, entire exon II, and 233 bp of exon III), a PstI-SacI-digested genomic DNA fragment (0.6 kbp, containing IS), and aBamHI-SacI genomic DNA fragment (0.75 kbp, containing IG) were used as probes. After exposure, membranes were stripped and rehybridized to a probe for ribosomal RNA (from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank). Ten μg of RNA from normal mouse tissues or total RNA from 1 × 105 cells of each FACS-sorted lineage marker-positive fraction and from 5 × 104 cells of Sca-1+/c-kit+ and/or Lin−fractions were reverse transcribed by Superscript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) with random hexamer or oligo-dT primer. Products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and one-tenth of the products was used in each PCR reaction. PCR reactions (35 cycles at 96 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 60 s) were performed using primer 1 (5′-ACAAAAGCGGCTGTCTGCGCGACG-3′), primer 2 (5′-CACCCCTATCCCGTGAATCCG-3′), and primer 3 (5′-AGCTGTGCTGCCTCCATGTAGTTAT-3′). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cell lines and normal mouse tissues using RNAzol B (TEL-TEST) or ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Two mGATA-2 genomic fragments were subcloned into pBluescript KS(+); one was a 610-bpPstI-SacI fragment containing the 5′ flanking sequence, IS exon, and the sequence 3′ to the IS exon, and the other was a 760-bp BamHI-SacI fragment containing the 5′ flanking region, IG exon, and the sequences 3′ to the exon IG. The constructs were linearized by SpeI and BamHI, respectively, and a labeled antisense RNA was synthesized from the T7 promoter of the plasmid using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison). Total RNA samples (100 μg) from P815 and Ba/F3 cells were hybridized to the labeled transcript for 12 h at 45 °C. The RNA samples were digested with an RNase mixture (Ambion), and the sizes of the RNA hybrids were determined by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Yeast tRNA (Sigma) and total RNA from DS19 cells were used as negative controls to detect nonspecific bands. Radiolabeled RNA size markers were synthesized using an RNA marker template set (Wako Pure Chemicals). An oligonucleotide, 5′-CCGGCTCCGGCCCCTCTGCATCCTC-3′, was labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo, Osaka). The labeled primer (1 pmol) was annealed to 50 μg of total RNA from P815 cells or tRNA for 90 min at 65 °C and then slowly cooled to room temperature in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), and 1 mm EDTA. Reverse transcription was initiated using 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a solution containing 50 mm KCl, 23 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 20 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 mmdNTPs and 150 μg of actinomycin-D/ml and incubated for 60 min at 42 °C. The template was then digested with RNase A (2 μg) for 15 min at 37 °C followed by phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and size fractionation on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The TaqTrack sequencing system (Promega) was used to generate a sequence ladder of the IG exon with the same primer. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from P815 cells with Oligotex-dT30 (TaKaRa). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) assay was performed utilizing the AmpliFINDER 5′-RACE system (CLONTECH). Two μg of poly (A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed, and mGATA-2 cDNA with the transcription initiation site was amplified using oligonucleotide antisense primer mG23 (5′-AGCGGCGTGGCTGGTCGGCC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 211 to 192 of the IS exon) and primers for the tailed linker sequence. Another antisense primer used for PCR amplification was mG26 (5′-CGCAGGCAGCCGCTTTTGTC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 124 to 105 of the IS exon). PCR products were subcloned into a pGEMT vector (Promega), and their sequences were determined. Plasmids for functional assay of the IS promoter and upstream regions were constructed as follows. AKpnI-NotI fragment that covers −6.0 kbp to +177 bp region (transcription start site of IS exon was set as +1) was ligated to pGL2-Basic plasmid (Promega), which was cleaved with bothKpnI and SacI, resulting in pGL-6.0IS. pGL2-Basic contains the firefly luciferase (LUC) gene as a reporter. Similarly, HincII-NotI (−1580 to +177), EcoRI-NotI (−670 to +177), PstI-NotI (−165 to +177), SpeI-NotI (−145 to +177), and SmaI-NotI (−86 to +177) fragments were ligated to the KpnI/SacI double digested pGL2-Basic, generating pGL-1580IS, pGL-670IS, pGL-165IS, pGL-145IS, and pGL-86IS, respectively. pGL-50IS containing −50 to +177 was prepared from the pGL-165IS using a directional deletion system (TaKaRa). A DNA fragment spanning from 79 bp upstream of the transcription start site of IS exon to the NcoI site at the translation start site in the second exon was ligated to KpnI-XhoI double digested pGL2-Basic, resulting in pGL-79ISIG-II. TheNcoI site was blunted by mung bean nuclease (TaKaRa) so that the construct does not contain the mGATA-2 translation start site. Similarly, DNA fragments from the NotI site in the IS exon, from the KpnI site at −2.0 kbp upstream from the IG exon, and from the BamHI site at −482 bp 5′ to the IG exon to theNcoI site were ligated to theKpnI-XhoI double digested pGL2-Basic (pGLNot-II, pGL-2.0IG-II, and pGL-482IG-II). pGL-79ISΔIG-II was generated from pGL-79ISIG-II by deletingSacI fragment. pGL-128IS, pGL-115IS, pGL-79IS, and pGL-61IS, containing the sequences from −128, −115, −79, or −61 to +177 of IS exon, respectively, and pGL-125IG, pGL-103IG, pGL-31IG, and pGL-19IG, containing the sequences from −125, −103, −31, or −19 to +37 of IG exon, respectively, were prepared by PCR using sequence-specific oligonucleotides. Internal promoter mutants were constructed by substituting the sequence between −80 and −35 of pGL-145IS with a series of overlapping oligonucleotides containing mutations. The authenticity of these mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. P815 cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs by the DEAE-dextran method as described (30Choi O. Engel J.D. Nature. 1986; 323: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transfection of plasmid DNAs into Ba/F3 and BW5147 cell lines was carried out by electroporation following methods previously described (31Bockamp E.O. MacLaughlin F. Murrell A.M. Gottgens B. Robb G.L. Begley C.G. Green A.R. Blood. 1995; 86: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. DS19 cells were transfected using DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N, N, N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate; Boehringer-Mannheim). LUC activity in the total cellular extract was determined using an Autolumat luminometer (Bethorude), and the activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity of a co-transfected pENL control plasmid (32Onodera K. Yomogida K. Suwabe N. Takahashi S. Muraosa Y. Hayashi N. Ito E. Gu L. Rassoulzadegan M. Engel J. Yamamoto M. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). pGL2-Control (Promega) was used for a positive control. The mean and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments in duplicate were determined. Nuclear extract was prepared from P815 and DS19 cells as described (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar), and DNA-binding proteins were purified further by DNA-cellulose (Sigma) column chromatography (34Emerson B.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A fraction eluted with 250 mm ammonium sulfate was dialyzed to 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol and was concentrated using Molcut II (Millipore). DNase I footprinting was performed as described previously (35Galas D. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). The IS promoter and upstream promoter regions (−145 to −11) were first subcloned into pBluescript SK(+), and 20 μg of the plasmid was digested by EagI and KpnI for sense probe and byXhoI and SacI for antisense probe. These fragments were purified and labeled with [32P]dCTP with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (TaKaRa). Aliquots of the probes (2 × 104 cpm) were mixed with the purified nuclear extract (0.3 to 1.5 μg) in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm KCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 250 μg of poly(dA-dT/dA-dT) (Sigma) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. DNase I (0.15 unit) was then added to the protein-DNA mixture. After incubation for 2 min in a 25 °C water bath, the reaction was stopped by addition of 30 μl of stop solution (1.5m sodium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml tRNA). DNA fragments were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described in the previous section, and EMSA was carried out as described (1Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed, and the resulting double-stranded DNA was used as probes. Probes used for DNA-binding assays correspond to −85 to −51 (5′-GGCACCCTCCTGCCCCCCTGCGGCGTTCCCTCCCC-3′). Poly(dA-dT/dA-dT) was used as a nonspecific competitor, and 100-fold excesses of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as sequence-specific competitors. Sequences of the mutant oligonucleotides used as competitors were identical to those used in the LUC mutant reporter constructs. Probes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 1.5 μg of partially purified nuclear extract. The mixture was then electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide gels. For supershift and knockout analysis, 2 μl of anti-Sp1 or anti-AP-2 antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the mixture 1 h before the start of incubation. To begin to analyze the regulatory mechanisms controlling transcription in the mGATA-2 gene, genomic DNA fragments containing the gene were cloned and characterized. Using the 5′ end region and the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of an mGATA-2 cDNA clone, which was previously isolated from a fetal liver cDNA library, a mouse genomic library was screened, and the recovered recombinants were plaque-purified. Twelve independent mGATA-2 bacteriophage λ genomic clones were characterized by restriction enzyme site mapping and Southern blot hybridization. The genomic phage clones were found to be largely overlapping and to cover the entire coding region of the mGATA-2 locus of approximately 14 kbp (Fig. 1 A). We had previously isolated human GATA-2 cDNA and genomic clones and also determined the gene structure including a first exon (23Nagai T. Harigae H. Ishihara H. Motohashi H. Minegishi N. Tsuchiya S. Hayashi N. Gu L. Andres B. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1994; 84: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3H. Ishihara and M. Yamamoto, unpublished observations. We found that the 5′ end sequence of the human GATA-2 cDNA, corresponding to the first exon, did not show high similarity with that of mouse GATA-2 cDNA, whereas other regions show remarkable sequence similarity. Indeed, the structures of theXenopus (26Brewer A.C. Guille M.J. Fear D.J. Partington G.A. Patient R.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and human GATA-2 genes (27Fleenor D.E. Langdon S.D. deCastro C.M. Kaufman R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were recently reported, and these were found to be highly homologous to each other. However, we did not find strong similarity in either of those structures to the mouse first exon sequence. For this reason, we speculated that there might be an alternative first exon for the mGATA-2 gene in addition to the one we had identified in both genomic and cDNA clones. To test this hypothesis, we first carried out Southern blot analysis of the genomic phage clones using the 5′ end of the human cDNA as a probe. This test was successful and identified a separate first exon to the one already identified. The two alternative first exons and their associated promoters are apparently both functional since mRNAs containing one or the other first exon were detected by RNA blot analyses (see below). We also searched for the human IS promoter/exon by Southern blotting of the hGATA-2 genomic phage clones, using the mouse IS promoter/exon fragment as a probe. However, we could not find the IS exon in our hGATA-2 genomic phage clones (data not shown), probably because those genomic clones contained only 4-kbp sequences upstream of the IG exon and, therefore, insufficient 5′ sequences to include the IS promoter and exon. The mGATA-2 gene is therefore composed of seven exons (Fig. 1 A). The two distinct first exons are named IS and IG for the upstream and downstream exons, respectively, and both encode only 5′ UTR sequence. The common second exon contains the initiation codon for translation of the mGATA-2 protein. The amino and carboxyl zinc fingers are encoded in exons IV and V, respectively. The basic amino acid tail region (36Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3′ UTR, and the two polyadenylation signals (37Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are located within exon VI. The exon-intron boundaries conform to the general splicing consensus (Fig. 1 B). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA confirmed the presence of bands of the predicted size from the restriction map of the phage clones (Fig. 1 C).

https://openalex.org/W2066113543,"The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-60gene encodes two actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin proteins which are implicated in the regulation of actin filament assembly in body wall muscle. We examined the interaction of recombinant UNC-60A and B proteins with actin and found that they differentially regulate actin filament dynamics. Co-pelleting assays with F-actin showed that UNC-60A depolymerized but did not remain bound to F-actin, whereas UNC-60B bound to but did not depolymerize F-actin. In the pH range of 6.8–8.0, the apparent activities of UNC-60A and B did not change although UNC-60A showed greater actin-depolymerizing activity at higher pH. These activities were further confirmed by a light scattering assay and electron microscopy. The effects of these proteins on actin polymerization were quite different. UNC-60A inhibited polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, UNC-60B strongly inhibited the nucleation process but accelerated the following elongation step. However, an excess amount of UNC-60B increased the amount of unpolymerized actin. These results indicate that UNC-60A depolymerizes actin filaments and inhibits actin polymerization, whereas UNC-60B strongly binds to F-actin without depolymerizing it and, through binding to G-actin, changes the rate of actin polymerization depending on the UNC-60B:actin ratio. These data suggest that the two UNC-60 isoforms play differential roles in regulating actin filament dynamics in vivo.

These data suggest that the two UNC-60 isoforms play differential roles in regulating actin filament dynamics in vivo. Myofibrils are highly differentiated forms of actin cytoskeleton that are specialized for muscle contraction, but the mechanisms by which these complex and precise structures are assembled and maintained are largely unknown. Actin, a major component of thin filaments, has an inherent tendency to polymerize into filaments in vitro. However, the assembly of actin in developing muscle is regulated, and consequently, about 40% of actin is present in a monomeric form (1Shimizu N. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In embryonic chicken skeletal muscle, proteins that bind to G-actin to prevent them from polymerization have been identified as profilin (2Ohshima S. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 105: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin depolymerizing factor; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethyl-amino)propyl]carbodiimide; Pi, inorganic phosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin depolymerizing factor; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethyl-amino)propyl]carbodiimide; Pi, inorganic phosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and cofilin (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis has shown that the concentrations of these three proteins are sufficient for sequestering most of G-actin at a late stage of embryonic muscle (5Nagaoka R. Minami N. Hayakawa K. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are responsible for regulating actin filament assembly.ADF and cofilin are highly conserved proteins, are members of an ADF/cofilin family having 25–71% homology, and are found in diverse organisms. ADF/cofilin binds to both G- and F-actin at a stoichiometry of 1:1 and regulates the rate of actin polymerization (reviewed in Ref.6Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Recently, ADF/cofilin has been shown to affect the on/off rates at both ends of F-actin, which results in the enhancement of treadmilling (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). This function is necessary for the actin-based motility ofListeria monocytogenes (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 8Rosenblatt J. Agnew B.J. Abe H. Bamburg J.R. Mitchison T.J. J.

Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).A muscle-specific function for ADF/cofilin has been suggested by two examples. These are a mammalian muscle-specific cofilin (M-cofilin) (10Ono S. Minami N. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15280-15286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two ADF/cofilin homologues encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-60 gene (11McKim K.S. Matheson C. Marra M.A. Wakarchuk M.F. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mammalian M-cofilin is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles (10Ono S. Minami N. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15280-15286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its exact function is unknown. Mutations in the unc-60 gene result in slow moving or paralyzed nematodes (11McKim K.S. Matheson C. Marra M.A. Wakarchuk M.F. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Waterston R.H. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 271-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 13McKim K.S. Heschl M.F. Rosenbluth R.E. Baillie D.L. Genetics. 1988; 118: 49-59PubMed Google Scholar). By electron microscopy, unc-60 mutant muscle has large accumulations of thin filaments especially at the ends of muscle cells but only a few thin filaments scattered among thick filaments that are present in normal numbers and roughly organized into A-bands (12Waterston R.H. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 271-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, unc-60 is required for proper positioning and the correct number of thin filaments in nematode striated muscle. Theunc-60 gene has been shown to encode two transcripts, sharing only a single exon encoding the initiator methionine, and two homologous proteins of the ADF/cofilin family (11McKim K.S. Matheson C. Marra M.A. Wakarchuk M.F. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These proteins, called UNC-60A and UNC-60B, are 165 and 152 amino acids long, respectively, and are 36% identical and 72% similar. Biochemical studies on members of the ADF/cofilin family in other organisms suggest that the UNC-60 proteins regulate actin polymerization. But, analysis of the primary structures of the UNC-60 isoforms does not allow us to predict how their biochemical properties might be different. We need to know the precise biochemical properties of the UNC-60 proteins to understand the role of unc-60 in muscle development. To address this question, we studied the biochemical characteristics of two UNC-60 proteins, and found that they regulate actin filament dynamics in different manners. The results suggest that two UNC-60 proteins have physiologically distinct functions.DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that the two ADF/cofilin proteins that are generated by alternative splicing of the unc-60 gene have differential functions in regulating actin dynamics. This is the first clear demonstration of functional diversity for the ADF/cofilin family in a single organism. So far, 3 and 2 ADF/cofilin proteins have been found in mammals and chickens, respectively, but their functional differences are not clear. Previously, ADF (or destrin) and cofilin had been characterized as functionally distinct proteins. ADF primarily depolymerizes F-actin and does not bind to F-actin (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Giuliano K.A. Khatib F.A. Hayden S.M. Daoud E.W. Adams M.E. Amorese D.A. Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6624-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas cofilin binds to both G- and F-actin and depolymerizes F-actin in a pH-sensitive manner (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14410-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent refined biochemical studies on the activities of human and chicken ADF have shown that ADF, like cofilin, binds to F-actin at pHs between 6.5 and 7.1 and shows increasing actin-depolymerizing activity at pHs between 7.1 and 8.0 (24Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Although the activities of UNC-60A and B are different, both of them are functionally related to members of the ADF/cofilin family that have been characterized previously. The actin-depolymerizing activity of UNC-60A is quite similar to that of Acanthamoeba actophorin (29Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Williams Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), echinoderm depactin (20Mabuchi I. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and most of ADF/cofilins at alkaline pH. In addition, the profile of the effect of UNC-60A on actin polymerization kinetics is similar to that of chicken ADF (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These activities can be explained by its strong G-actin binding ability that results in depolymerization of F-actin and sequestering G-actin to inhibit polymerization. The ability of UNC-60B to bind to F-actin has been observed for vertebrate ADF and cofilin at neutral pH (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,25Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, its lack of ability to depolymerize actin is a unique feature of UNC-60B. The effect of UNC-60B on the kinetics of actin polymerization is consistent with that observed for actophorin (29Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Williams Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chicken cofilin (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and plant ADF (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Our results that substoichiometric amounts of UNC-60B accelerated, but that excess UNC-60B inhibited the rate of polymerization, can be interpreted as follows. UNC-60B binds to G-actin to inhibit polymerization, whereas it preferentially binds to F-actin which causes the enhancement of the rate of actin assembly. This effect might be due to the change in the on rate at the barbed end of actin filaments as has been shown for plant ADF (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the acceleration of polymerization is still unclear. Recently, binding of cofilin to F-actin has been shown to change the twist of the filament (19McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Likewise, UNC-60B may cause a conformational change in the actin filament leading to a more competent state for polymerization.Our results that inorganic phosphate inhibit the activities of both UNC-60A and B strongly suggest that UNC-60A and B preferentially bind to ADP-actin rather than ATP-actin. Preferential binding to ADP-actin appears to be a common property of ADF/cofilin family members (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 22Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,35Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and is likely to contribute to an acceleration of the off rate at the pointed end of F-actin (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Probably, this is the case for UNC-60A because it rapidly depolymerizes F-actin. However, because UNC-60B does not depolymerize F-actin, it implies that UNC-60B-bound F-ADP-actin is physiologically significant. Therefore, it is of interest to examine whether UNC-60B-bound F-actin behaves differently from F-actin alone. Previously, porcine cofilin has been shown to inhibit the binding of tropomyosin and myosin to F-actin (16Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, a future goal will be to investigate the ability of UNC-60B-bound F-actin to bind to some other actin-binding proteins.The differences in the activities of the UNC-60 proteins are likely to result from their structural differences. The sequence identity between UNC-60A and UNC-60B is 36%, which is considerably lower than the group of mammalian ADF/cofilins (three members are 70% identical). However, both UNC-60A and UNC-60B are about 30% homologous to all three members of mammalian ADF/cofilins, and no outstanding similarity to a particular protein was detected. One obvious difference is that UNC-60A is 13 amino acids longer than UNC-60B. The alignment of the two sequences shows that an extra eight amino acids exist in UNC60A from Ile-50 to Asp-57 (Fig. 1, shown by underline). The equivalent region of yeast cofilin consists of the outer most strand of β-sheet and is exposed on the surface of the molecule (30Fedorov A.A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Drubin D.G. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the function of this region is unknown. In addition, this sequence contains four acidic residues, which are likely to affect the charge distribution on the molecular surface. Because charged amino acids on cofilin have been shown to be important in its actin-binding (31Moriyama K. Yonezawa N. Sakai H. Yahara I. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7240-7244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the extra sequence in UNC-60A may be responsible for its functional difference from UNC-60B.The differential activities of UNC-60 proteins presented here strongly suggest that the two homologous proteins have physiologically distinct functions. The fine structure genetic map (13McKim K.S. Heschl M.F. Rosenbluth R.E. Baillie D.L. Genetics. 1988; 118: 49-59PubMed Google Scholar) and our preliminary genomic sequencing of viable unc-60 alleles has revealed that all the mutations are found within the coding region for unc-60B, 2S. Ono, D. L. Baillie, and G. M. Benian, unpublished data. implying that UNC-60B has a specific role in thin filament assembly in muscle cells. Our results on the effect of UNC-60B on the polymerization kineticsin vitro suggests that, during muscle development, when actin concentration is low initially, UNC-60B inhibits actin polymerization, but later, when actin concentration is high (1Shimizu N. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), UNC-60B accelerates actin polymerization and thus the formation of thin filaments. This function of UNC-60B is directly relevant to that of ADF/cofilin in vertebrate muscle. ADF/cofilin is involved in the regulation of actin assembly in chicken embryonic muscles (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, a muscle-type cofilin isoform is expressed in mammalian skeletal and cardiac muscles (10Ono S. Minami N. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15280-15286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although its function in muscle cells is not yet clear. UNC-60A may be widely involved in the many processes which require actin dynamics. ADF/cofilin has been shown to be essential for cytokinesis (33Gunsalus K.C. Bonaccorsi S. Williams E. Verni F. Gatti M. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1243-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 34Abe H. Obinata T. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and endocytosis (9Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), which are universal events in a broad range of cells. Accordingly, C. elegans should have an ADF/cofilin which is expressed in a variety of cells in addition to a muscle-specific isoform. Currently, we are raising antibodies against UNC-60A and UNC-60B and plan to determine tissue distribution of both proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. Myofibrils are highly differentiated forms of actin cytoskeleton that are specialized for muscle contraction, but the mechanisms by which these complex and precise structures are assembled and maintained are largely unknown. Actin, a major component of thin filaments, has an inherent tendency to polymerize into filaments in vitro. However, the assembly of actin in developing muscle is regulated, and consequently, about 40% of actin is present in a monomeric form (1Shimizu N. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In embryonic chicken skeletal muscle, proteins that bind to G-actin to prevent them from polymerization have been identified as profilin (2Ohshima S. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 105: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin depolymerizing factor; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethyl-amino)propyl]carbodiimide; Pi, inorganic phosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin depolymerizing factor; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethyl-amino)propyl]carbodiimide; Pi, inorganic phosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and cofilin (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis has shown that the concentrations of these three proteins are sufficient for sequestering most of G-actin at a late stage of embryonic muscle (5Nagaoka R. Minami N. Hayakawa K. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are responsible for regulating actin filament assembly. ADF and cofilin are highly conserved proteins, are members of an ADF/cofilin family having 25–71% homology, and are found in diverse organisms. ADF/cofilin binds to both G- and F-actin at a stoichiometry of 1:1 and regulates the rate of actin polymerization (reviewed in Ref.6Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Recently, ADF/cofilin has been shown to affect the on/off rates at both ends of F-actin, which results in the enhancement of treadmilling (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). This function is necessary for the actin-based motility ofListeria monocytogenes (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 8Rosenblatt J. Agnew B.J. Abe H. Bamburg J.R. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and for actin turnover in cortical actin patches in yeast (9Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). A muscle-specific function for ADF/cofilin has been suggested by two examples. These are a mammalian muscle-specific cofilin (M-cofilin) (10Ono S. Minami N. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15280-15286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two ADF/cofilin homologues encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-60 gene (11McKim K.S. Matheson C. Marra M.A. Wakarchuk M.F. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mammalian M-cofilin is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles (10Ono S. Minami N. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15280-15286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its exact function is unknown. Mutations in the unc-60 gene result in slow moving or paralyzed nematodes (11McKim K.S. Matheson C. Marra M.A. Wakarchuk M.F. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Waterston R.H. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 271-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 13McKim K.S. Heschl M.F. Rosenbluth R.E. Baillie D.L. Genetics. 1988; 118: 49-59PubMed Google Scholar). By electron microscopy, unc-60 mutant muscle has large accumulations of thin filaments especially at the ends of muscle cells but only a few thin filaments scattered among thick filaments that are present in normal numbers and roughly organized into A-bands (12Waterston R.H. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 271-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, unc-60 is required for proper positioning and the correct number of thin filaments in nematode striated muscle. Theunc-60 gene has been shown to encode two transcripts, sharing only a single exon encoding the initiator methionine, and two homologous proteins of the ADF/cofilin family (11McKim K.S. Matheson C. Marra M.A. Wakarchuk M.F. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These proteins, called UNC-60A and UNC-60B, are 165 and 152 amino acids long, respectively, and are 36% identical and 72% similar. Biochemical studies on members of the ADF/cofilin family in other organisms suggest that the UNC-60 proteins regulate actin polymerization. But, analysis of the primary structures of the UNC-60 isoforms does not allow us to predict how their biochemical properties might be different. We need to know the precise biochemical properties of the UNC-60 proteins to understand the role of unc-60 in muscle development. To address this question, we studied the biochemical characteristics of two UNC-60 proteins, and found that they regulate actin filament dynamics in different manners. The results suggest that two UNC-60 proteins have physiologically distinct functions. DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that the two ADF/cofilin proteins that are generated by alternative splicing of the unc-60 gene have differential functions in regulating actin dynamics. This is the first clear demonstration of functional diversity for the ADF/cofilin family in a single organism. So far, 3 and 2 ADF/cofilin proteins have been found in mammals and chickens, respectively, but their functional differences are not clear. Previously, ADF (or destrin) and cofilin had been characterized as functionally distinct proteins. ADF primarily depolymerizes F-actin and does not bind to F-actin (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Giuliano K.A. Khatib F.A. Hayden S.M. Daoud E.W. Adams M.E. Amorese D.A. Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8931-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Bamburg J.R. Harris H.E. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Nishida E. Muneyuki E. Maekawa S. Ohta Y. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6624-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas cofilin binds to both G- and F-actin and depolymerizes F-actin in a pH-sensitive manner (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14410-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent refined biochemical studies on the activities of human and chicken ADF have shown that ADF, like cofilin, binds to F-actin at pHs between 6.5 and 7.1 and shows increasing actin-depolymerizing activity at pHs between 7.1 and 8.0 (24Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Although the activities of UNC-60A and B are different, both of them are functionally related to members of the ADF/cofilin family that have been characterized previously. The actin-depolymerizing activity of UNC-60A is quite similar to that of Acanthamoeba actophorin (29Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Williams Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), echinoderm depactin (20Mabuchi I. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and most of ADF/cofilins at alkaline pH. In addition, the profile of the effect of UNC-60A on actin polymerization kinetics is similar to that of chicken ADF (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These activities can be explained by its strong G-actin binding ability that results in depolymerization of F-actin and sequestering G-actin to inhibit polymerization. The ability of UNC-60B to bind to F-actin has been observed for vertebrate ADF and cofilin at neutral pH (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,25Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, its lack of ability to depolymerize actin is a unique feature of UNC-60B. The effect of UNC-60B on the kinetics of actin polymerization is consistent with that observed for actophorin (29Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Williams Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chicken cofilin (4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and plant ADF (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Our results that substoichiometric amounts of UNC-60B accelerated, but that excess UNC-60B inhibited the rate of polymerization, can be interpreted as follows. UNC-60B binds to G-actin to inhibit polymerization, whereas it preferentially binds to F-actin which causes the enhancement of the rate of actin assembly. This effect might be due to the change in the on rate at the barbed end of actin filaments as has been shown for plant ADF (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the acceleration of polymerization is still unclear. Recently, binding of cofilin to F-actin has been shown to change the twist of the filament (19McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Likewise, UNC-60B may cause a conformational change in the actin filament leading to a more competent state for polymerization.Our results that inorganic phosphate inhibit the activities of both UNC-60A and B strongly suggest that UNC-60A and B preferentially bind to ADP-actin rather than ATP-actin. Preferential binding to ADP-actin appears to be a common property of ADF/cofilin family members (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 22Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,35Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and is likely to contribute to an acceleration of the off rate at the pointed end of F-actin (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Probably, this is the case for UNC-60A because it rapidly depolymerizes F-actin. However, because UNC-60B does not depolymerize F-actin, it implies that UNC-60B-bound F-ADP-actin is physiologically significant. Therefore, it is of interest to examine whether UNC-60B-bound F-actin behaves differently from F-actin alone. Previously, porcine cofilin has been shown to inhibit the binding of tropomyosin and myosin to F-actin (16Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, a future goal will be to investigate the ability of UNC-60B-bound F-actin to bind to some other actin-binding proteins.The differences in the activities of the UNC-60 proteins are likely to result from their structural differences. The sequence identity between UNC-60A and UNC-60B is 36%, which is considerably lower than the group of mammalian ADF/cofilins (three members are 70% identical). However, both UNC-60A and UNC-60B are about 30% homologous to all three members of mammalian ADF/cofilins, and no outstanding similarity to a particular protein was detected. One obvious difference is that UNC-60A is 13 amino acids longer than UNC-60B. The alignment of the two sequences shows that an extra eight amino acids exist in UNC60A from Ile-50 to Asp-57 (Fig. 1, shown by underline). The equivalent region of yeast cofilin consists of the outer most strand of β-sheet and is exposed on the surface of the molecule (30Fedorov A.A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Drubin D.G. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the function of this region is unknown. In addition, this sequence contains four acidic residues, which are likely to affect the charge distribution on the molecular surface. Because charged amino acids on cofilin have been shown to be important in its actin-binding (31Moriyama K. Yonezawa N. Sakai H. Yahara I. Nishida E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the extra sequence in UNC-60A may be responsible for its functional difference from UNC-60B.The differential activities of UNC-60 proteins presented here strongly suggest that the two homologous proteins have physiologically distinct functions.

This effect might be due to the change in the on rate at the barbed end of actin filaments as has been shown for plant ADF (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the acceleration of polymerization is still unclear. Recently, binding of cofilin to F-actin has been shown to change the twist of the filament (19McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Likewise, UNC-60B may cause a conformational change in the actin filament leading to a more competent state for polymerization. Our results that inorganic phosphate inhibit the activities of both UNC-60A and B strongly suggest that UNC-60A and B preferentially bind to ADP-actin rather than ATP-actin. Preferential binding to ADP-actin appears to be a common property of ADF/cofilin family members (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 22Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,35Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and is likely to contribute to an acceleration of the off rate at the pointed end of F-actin (7Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Probably, this is the case for UNC-60A because it rapidly depolymerizes F-actin. However, because UNC-60B does not depolymerize F-actin, it implies that UNC-60B-bound F-ADP-actin is physiologically significant. Therefore, it is of interest to examine whether UNC-60B-bound F-actin behaves differently from F-actin alone. Previously, porcine cofilin has been shown to inhibit the binding of tropomyosin and myosin to F-actin (16Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, a future goal will be to investigate the ability of UNC-60B-bound F-actin to bind to some other actin-binding proteins. The differences in the activities of the UNC-60 proteins are likely to result from their structural differences. The sequence identity between UNC-60A and UNC-60B is 36%, which is considerably lower than the group of mammalian ADF/cofilins (three members are 70% identical). However, both UNC-60A and UNC-60B are about 30% homologous to all three members of mammalian ADF/cofilins, and no outstanding similarity to a particular protein was detected. One obvious difference is that UNC-60A is 13 amino acids longer than UNC-60B. The alignment of the two sequences shows that an extra eight amino acids exist in UNC60A from Ile-50 to Asp-57 (Fig. 1, shown by underline). The equivalent region of yeast cofilin consists of the outer most strand of β-sheet and is exposed on the surface of the molecule (30Fedorov A.A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Drubin D.G. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the function of this region is unknown. In addition, this sequence contains four acidic residues, which are likely to affect the charge distribution on the molecular surface. Because charged amino acids on cofilin have been shown to be important in its actin-binding (31Moriyama K. Yonezawa N. Sakai H. Yahara I. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7240-7244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the extra sequence in UNC-60A may be responsible for its functional difference from UNC-60B. The differential activities of UNC-60 proteins presented here strongly suggest that the two homologous proteins have physiologically distinct functions. The fine structure genetic map (13McKim K.S. Heschl M.F. Rosenbluth R.E. Baillie D.L. Genetics. 1988; 118: 49-59PubMed Google Scholar) and our preliminary genomic sequencing of viable unc-60 alleles has revealed that all the mutations are found within the coding region for unc-60B, 2S. Ono, D. L. Baillie, and G. M. Benian, unpublished data. implying that UNC-60B has a specific role in thin filament assembly in muscle cells. Our results on the effect of UNC-60B on the polymerization kineticsin vitro suggests that, during muscle development, when actin concentration is low initially, UNC-60B inhibits actin polymerization, but later, when actin concentration is high (1Shimizu N. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), UNC-60B accelerates actin polymerization and thus the formation of thin filaments. This function of UNC-60B is directly relevant to that of ADF/cofilin in vertebrate muscle. ADF/cofilin is involved in the regulation of actin assembly in chicken embryonic muscles (3Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, a muscle-type cofilin isoform is expressed in mammalian skeletal and cardiac muscles (10Ono S. Minami N. Abe H. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15280-15286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although its function in muscle cells is not yet clear. UNC-60A may be widely involved in the many processes which require actin dynamics. ADF/cofilin has been shown to be essential for cytokinesis (33Gunsalus K.C. Bonaccorsi S. Williams E. Verni F. Gatti M. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1243-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 34Abe H. Obinata T. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and endocytosis (9Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), which are universal events in a broad range of cells. Accordingly, C. elegans should have an ADF/cofilin which is expressed in a variety of cells in addition to a muscle-specific isoform. Currently, we are raising antibodies against UNC-60A and UNC-60B and plan to determine tissue distribution of both proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2143430700,"The Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1, SHP-1, is highly expressed in all hematopoietic cells as well as in many non-hematopoietic cells, particularly in some malignant epithelial cell lines. In hematopoietic cells, SHP-1 negatively regulates multiple cytokine receptor pathways. The precise function and the targets of SHP-1 in non-hematopoietic cells, however, are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that SHP-1 associates with both the tyrosine-phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in MCF-7 and TRMP cells. Through the use of mutant PDGF receptors and performing peptide competition for immunoprecipitation, it was determined that SHP-1 independently associates with the PDGF receptor and p85 and that its N-terminal SH2 domain is directly responsible for the interactions. Overexpression of SHP-1 in TRMP cells transfected with the PDGF receptor markedly inhibited PDGF-induced c-fos promoter activation, whereas the expression of three catalytically inactive SHP-1 mutants increased the c-fos promoter activation in response to PDGF stimulation. These results indicate that SHP-1 might negatively regulate PDGF receptor-mediated signaling in these cells. Identification of the association of SHP-1 with the PDGF receptor and p85 in MCF-7 and TRMP cells furthers our understanding of the function of SHP-1 in non-hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061756216,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the metabolic degradation of saturated fatty acids is exclusively confined to peroxisomes. In addition to a functional β-oxidation system, the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids requires auxiliary enzymes, including a Δ2,Δ3-enoyl-CoA isomerase and an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. We found both enzymes to be present in yeast peroxisomes. The impermeability of the peroxisomal membrane for pyrimidine nucleotides led to the question of how the NADPH needed by the reductase is regenerated in the peroxisomal lumen. We report the identification and functional analysis of theIDP3 gene product, which is a yeast peroxisomal NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. The newly identified peroxisomal protein is homologous to the mitochondrial Idp1p and cytosolic Idp2p, which both are yeast NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases. Yeast cells lacking Idp3p grow normally on saturated fatty acids, but growth is impaired on unsaturated fatty acids, indicating that the peroxisomal Idp3p is involved in their metabolic utilization. The data presented are consistent with the assumption that peroxisomes of S. cerevisiae contain the enzyme equipment needed for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids, including an NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, a putative constituent of a peroxisomal NADPH-regenerating redox system.

Peroxisomes harbor variable metabolic pathways that differ depending on cell type, developmental stage, and food supply (1Tolbert N.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In reference to the multiplicity of cellular functions and to the ability of cells to adjust the enzymatic equipment as well as the size and number of these organelles in response to the cellular demand, peroxisomes are appropriately called multipurpose organelles (3Opperdoes F.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 255-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The importance of peroxisomes for cellular function is especially emphasized by a number of inherited diseases in humans that are caused by peroxisomal dysfunction and usually have profound clinical consequences (4Lazarow P.B. Moser H.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2287-2324Google Scholar). A typical metabolic pathway of peroxisomes is the β-oxidation of fatty acids (5Cooper T.G. Beevers H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3514-3520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lazarow P.B. DeDuve C. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2043-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). In fact, whereas the presence of a mitochondrial β-oxidation system is restricted to mammalian cells and a few protists (7Kunau W.-H. Bühne S. de la Garza M. Kionka C. Mateblowski M. de la Garza M. Schulz-Borchard U. Thieringer R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the fatty acid oxidation in peroxisomes is nearly ubiquitous among eukaryotic cells (7Kunau W.-H. Bühne S. de la Garza M.

Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal and the mitochondrial degradation of fatty acids is performed by functionally comparable but genetically distinct proteins (8Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Hashimoto T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In fungi and plants, the degradation of fatty acids exclusively takes place in peroxisomes, and growth on fatty acids results in proliferation of peroxisomes accompanied by a massive induction of peroxisomal proteins including the β-oxidation enzymes (7Kunau W.-H. Bühne S. de la Garza M. Kionka C. Mateblowski M. de la Garza M. Schulz-Borchard U. Thieringer R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.-H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition to the chain shortening β-oxidation system, the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids requires auxiliary enzymes for the elimination of the double bonds (8Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Degradation of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds requires a Δ2,Δ3-enoyl-CoA isomerase (Fig. 1 B) (11Stoffel W. Caesar H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1965; 341: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the degradation of unsaturated fatty acid with even-numbered double bonds, an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is needed in addition to the isomerase (Fig. 1 A) (12Kunau W.-H. Dommes P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel pathway for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds at odd-numbered carbon atoms has been described that also requires the NADPH-dependent reductase described above (Fig. 1 C) (13Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The successive reduction and isomerization of double bonds by these auxiliary enzymes results in the formation of intermediates that can reenter the β-oxidation spiral (8Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The presence of both the Δ2,Δ3-enoyl-CoA isomerase and the NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase has been demonstrated in all peroxisomes studied so far (8Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). As the peroxisomal membrane has been suggested to be impermeable for small solutes (15van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the requirement of the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase for NADPH raises the question of the existence of an NADPH regenerating system in peroxisomes. We applied a reverse genetic approach to identify proteins essential for peroxisome function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we report the identification, characterization, and functional analysis of a peroxisomal NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Deficiency in this enzyme resulted in an impaired growth of S. cerevisiae on unsaturated fatty acids, whereas growth on saturated fatty acids was not affected. The peroxisomal Idp3p is suggested to be involved in the regeneration of the NADPH needed for the peroxisomal degradation of unsaturated fatty acids. The yeast strains used in this study were S. cerevisiae wild-typeUTL-7A (MATa, ura3–52, trp1, leu2–3,112), pex7Δ (MATa, pex7::LEU2, ura3–52, trp1)) (16Marzioch M. Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and idp1/idp2/idp3Δ (MATa, leu2–3,112, his3–1, trp1–289, idp1::URA3, idp2::URA3, idp3::kanMX4) (this paper). Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in YPD or in minimal medium (SD) as described previously (19Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For oleic acid induction of peroxisome proliferation, cells were grown in SD medium to late log phase and then shifted into YNO (20Erdmann R. Wiebel F.F. Flessau A. Rytka J. Beyer A. Fröhlich K.U. Kunau W.-H. Cell. 1991; 64: 499-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and incubated for 14 h. Necessary auxotrophic requirements were added according to Ausubel et al. (21Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Whole yeast cell extracts were prepared by the method of Yaffe and Schatz (22Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Enzymatic modification of DNA, fragment purification, and bacterial transformation were performed essentially as described by Ausubel et al. (21Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were carried out according to Gietz and Sugino (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). High salt-extracted peroxisomal membranes were prepared from oleic acid-induced SKQ2N cells. Further separation of the peroxisomal membrane proteins was achieved by reverse-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PTS1, peroxisomal targeting signal 1. according to Erdmann and Blobel (24Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For sequencing of Idp3p, the SDS samples of HPLC fractions containing the protein (fractions 42–46; see Fig. 2) were pooled and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with 0.1% Amido Black in 10% acetic acid. Idp3p was excised, and Lys-C-derived peptides of the protein were separated by HPLC and subjected to sequence analysis on a gas phase sequenator according to Fernandez et al. (25Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 569-573Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Protein sequence analysis was provided by the Rockefeller University Protein Sequencing Facility, which is supported in part by National Institutes of Health shared instrumentation grants and by funds provided by the U.S. Army and Navy for the purchase of equipment. According to the obtained internal sequences of Idp3p, degenerated sense (5′-GCGAATTCA(C/T)CCIAT(A/C/T)GT(A/G/C/T)GA(A/G)ATG-3′) and antisense (5′-TCTAAGCTT(A/G/C/T)GCIAC(C/T)TC(A/G)TC(T/G/A)AT-3′) oligonucleotide primers, distinguishing between theIDP3 gene and the highly homologous IDP1 and IDP2 genes were designed. The corresponding genomic region of the IDP3 gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with yeast genomic DNA (100 ng; Promega, Madison, WI) as template. The amplification product was isolated and subcloned into a derivative pBluescript SK(+) using the Srf1 kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), resulting in pSRF-IDP3. The authenticity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A [32P]dATP-labeled probe of 520 base pairs was generated by PCR with oligonucleotide primers iso6 (5′-GCCACTATAACACCCGATG-3′) and iso1 (5′-CGTACGTTATTTTTAAAGCCTG-3′) and the plasmid pSRF-IDP3 as template, using a random-primed labeling kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). High stringency hybridization according to Maniatis et al. (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 9.47-9.57Google Scholar) was performed to screen a YEp13-based yeast genomic library (27Daignan-Fornier B. Nguyen C.C. Reisdorf P. Lemeignan B. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that was kindly provided by M. Bolotin-Fukuhara. Two positive clones containing the IDP3gene were isolated, and sequencing was directly performed on one of the plasmids, YEp13-IDP3, with an automatic sequencer (model 373A; Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany), the DyeDesoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), and synthetic oligonucleotides. Both strands of the IDP3 gene were sequenced. To construct aidp3 null mutant, the entire IDP3 open reading frame was replaced by the kanMX4 marker gene (28Wach A. Brachat A. Poehlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). The PCR-derived construct for disruption comprised the kanMX4gene flanked by short (40-base pair) homology regions to theIDP3 3′- and 5′-noncoding region. PCR primers were 5′-CACAAGCAACACTTTAGAGATAGTTGTCCAAGTTAAAATGCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′ (KU179) and 5′-GGCCAGACTTGTCTTTTCAAATGAATGGCGGATTGGTTTAATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′ (KU180), and plasmid pFA6a-kanMX4 served as template. The resulting amplification construct was introduced into S. cerevisiae wild-type UTL-7A, the idp1Δ mutant (17Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2339-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the idp1Δ/idp2Δ double mutant (18Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Geneticin-resistant clones were selected by growth on YPD plates containing 200 mg/liter G418 (28Wach A. Brachat A. Poehlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). For generating antibodies against Idp3p, the IDP3-fragment IDP3* (144–210 amino acids) was amplified by PCR using GenBankTM plasmid YEp13-IDP3 and oligonucleotides KU188 (5′-CCGGAATTCCGGGATCCGATCAAGATTAAAAAAGCA-3′) and KU189 (5′-TGCTCTAGACTGCAGCTACTCGAGTGTAAAGAATAACGGTAG-3′). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and inserted into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create pSKIDP3*. The BamHI/HindIII fragment of pSKIDP3* was subcloned into pET21b (Novagen), leading to plasmid pET-IDP3*. The plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21-DE3, resulting in an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of HIS6-tagged Idp3p*. The tagged Idp3p* was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HIS6-tagged Idp3p* were produced by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) according to standard methods (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-thiolase (Fox3p), anti-Kar2p, anti-Pcs60p, anti-Pex14p, and anti-Pex3p antibodies have been described previously (30Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H.

Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) were used as the second antibody, and blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham). Western blot analyses were performed according to standard protocols (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). To construct a Idp3pΔCKL, the IDP3 gene was amplified by PCR using plasmid YEp13-IDP3 (see above) and oligonucleotides KU308 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGCTGGTGAAAAGACAGT-3′ and KU311 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACATACCTTTCTTGTCTTCAT-3′. The amplification product was isolated and subcloned (BamHI/XhoI) into the vector pRSterm, a pRS316 derivative (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contained theHincII/KpnI-prepared CYC1 terminator of pTerm1 (36Erdmann R. Yeast. 1994; 10: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pRS-IDP3ΔCKL was transformed into idp3Δ, resulting in an expression of Idp3pΔCKL under the control of its own promoter. Spheroplasting of yeast cells, homogenization, and differential centrifugation at 25,000 ×g of homogenates were performed as described previously (19Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For subfractionation by isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation, cell lysates or organellar pellets were loaded onto linear 20–53% sucrose density gradients (34Höhfeld J. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1167-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Centrifugation, fractionation of gradients, and preparation of the samples for SDS-PAGE were carried out as described (24Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The suborganellar localization of proteins was determined by extraction of 25,000 × g organellar pellets with low salt (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mm PMSF), high salt (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 500 mm KCl; 1 mm PMSF), or pH 11 buffer (0.1 mNa2CO3, 1 mm PMSF) as described by Erdmann and Blobel (37Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 135: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal peak fractions from a sucrose density gradient were pooled and diluted five times in gradient buffer (34Höhfeld J. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1167-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes were sedimented at 25,000 × gfor 30 min and subsequently resuspended in homogenization buffer (19Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) without protease inhibitors but supplemented with 50 mmKCl. Equal amounts of isolated peroxisomes were incubated with increasing amounts of proteinase K for 10 min on ice. Protease was inactivated immediately after the incubation with 4 mmPMSF, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and samples were processed for SDS-PAGE. The IDP3-orf was amplified by PCR using plasmid YEp13-IDP3 as template and oligonucleotides KU235 (5′-CGGAATTCCCATATGAGTAAAATTAAAGTTGTT-3′) and KU236 (5′-CCCTCGAGTAGTTTGCACATACCTTTC-3′). The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into pET21b (Novagen), leading to plasmid pET-IDP3. The plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21-DE3, resulting in an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of HIS6-tagged Idp3p. The tagged Idp3p was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described by Loftus et al. (18Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Catalase and fumarase were assayed as described by Moreno de la Garca et al. (38Moreno de la Garca M. Schultz-Borchard U. Crabb J.W. Kunau W.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Δ3,Δ2-Enoyl-CoA isomerase was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm in a coupled assay (39Binstock J.F. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with 3-trans-decanoyl-CoA as substrate. 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm with 2-trans-4-trans-decanoyl-CoA as substrate according to Kunau and Dommes (12Kunau W.-H. Dommes P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Total protein was measured by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peroxisomes were isolated from oleic acid-induced S. cerevisiae cells and successively extracted by low and high salt treatments. The proteins of high salt extracted peroxisomes were solubilized with SDS and separated by HPLC and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Lys-C-derived internal fragments of the 45-kDa protein marked in Fig. 2were subjected to amino-terminal protein sequencing in preparation for DNA cloning and sequencing of the corresponding gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). The open reading frame of the isolated DNA fragment encoded a new protein with a calculated molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 3) that later on also appeared in the yeast genome data base as open reading frame YNL009w. A search of the GenBankTM data base with the predicted amino acid sequence of IDP3 revealed the yeast genesIDP1 (17Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2339-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IDP2 (18Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as close relatives of the newly identified gene, hereafter referred to as IDP3. The overall identity of Idp3p with Idp1p and Idp2p is 68 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 4). Idp1p and Idp2p represent the two NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases reported for S. cerevisiae to date. Idp2p is localized in the yeast cytosol, and Idp1p is a mitochondrial isoenzyme that differs from the other two proteins by an N-terminal extension, which functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal (Fig. 4) (18Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Idp3p lacks the mitochondrial targeting signal and instead is characterized by an additional nine amino acids at the extreme C terminus. These terminal amino acids of Idp3p comprise the tripeptide cysteine-lysine-leucine (CKL; Fig. 3), a putative peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) forS. cerevisiae (41Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 42Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol.

The prominent presence in the HPLC profile of peroxisomal proteins (Fig. 2), the sequence similarity to Idp1p and to Idp2p (Fig. 4), and the presence of the putative peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1; Fig. 3) suggested that Idp3p might be a peroxisomal NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Figure 4Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of S. cerevisiae Idp3p with other isocitrate dehydrogenases from S. cerevisiae. The mitochondrial Idp1p (17Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2339-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytosolic Idp2p (18Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) are both NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases. The Idh1p (47Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. Bacteriology. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Idh2p (48Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are subunits of the heteromeric mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Alignment was performed with the BESTFIT program (EMBL, Heidelberg). Amino acids conserved in Idp3p and at least one of the other proteins are blocked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Antibodies were generated against an internal fragment of Idp3p comprising amino acids 144–210, which displays the lowest similarity of the protein to Idp1p and Idp2p (Fig. 4). A polypeptide with the predicted molecular mass for Idp3p (48 kDa) was detected in wild-type but not in idp3Δ yeast extracts (Fig. 5 A). Although binding of the antibodies to other proteins was observed under low stringency conditions, none of these bands disappeared in mutants lacking either Idp1p or Idp2p, indicating that the antibodies generated do not recognize Idp1p or Idp2p but are specific for Idp3p (Fig. 5 A). In S. cerevisiae, growth on oleic acid results in a massive proliferation of peroxisomes accompanied by the induction of peroxisomal enzymes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid degradation (7Kunau W.-H. Bühne S. de la Garza M. Kionka C. Mateblowski M. de la Garza M. Schulz-Borchard U. Thieringer R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,10Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.-H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The oleic acid induction is mediated by the transcription activator Pip2p, which binds to a well defined oleic acid-responsive element at the promoter of several peroxisomal proteins (43Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A perfect consensus sequence for Pip2p binding is also present upstream of theIDP3 open reading frame (position −311 to −289; Fig. 3), and Idp3p was found to be highly inducible by oleic acid (Fig. 5 B), supporting the assumption of Idp3p being involved in peroxisomal fatty acid degradation. The subcellular localization of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases in S. cerevisiaewas first analyzed by differential centrifugation of cell homogenates from oleic acid-induced wild-type yeast cells. More than 60% of the Idp activity was found in the supernatant fraction, suggesting that the cytosolic isoform might be responsible for the majority of the endogenous enzyme activity (data not shown). Sedimented organelles were further fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was found in both the mitochondrial and the peroxisomal fractions (Fig. 6). The peroxisomal peak, however, comprised a smaller fraction of the total particular enzyme activity. To exclude the possibility that the activity found in the peroxisomal fraction was due to a mitochondrial contamination, the subcellular localization of the enzymes was also analyzed in a idp1Δmutant strain, lacking the mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. After differential centrifugation of cell homogenates of the idp1Δ mutant strain, about 15% of the total NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was still localized to the organellar fraction. Subsequent sucrose density gradient fractionation confirmed the absence of the mitochondrial enzyme and demonstrated the activity to exclusively co-segregate with peroxisomal marker enzymes (Fig. 6), consistent with the presence of a peroxisomal isoenzyme of the NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases in S. cerevisiae. As a first step to analyze whether the peroxisomal NADP-dependent isocitrate activity is due to Idp3p, we studied the subcellular localization of the protein. Immunological detection of Idp3p in fractions generated by differential centrifugation of yeast cell homogenates revealed that the protein is exclusively found in the organellar pellet (Fig. 7 A). Immunoblot analysis of fractions gained by subsequent sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the organellar pellets demonstrated the protein to be exclusively localized in the peroxisomal fractions (Fig. 7 B). In agreement with Idp3p being responsible for the peroxisomal NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, the absence of this protein in idp3Δ mutant cells correlated with the disappearance of the enzyme activity in the organellar pellet and in the peroxisomal fractions"
https://openalex.org/W2068716132,"Utilization of mRNAs containing iron-responsive elements (IREs) is modulated by iron-regulated RNA-binding proteins (iron regulatory proteins). We examine herein whether iron differentially affects translation of ferritin and mitochondrial aconitase (m-Acon) mRNAs because they contain a similar but not identical IRE in their 5′-untranslated regions. First, we demonstrate that m-Acon synthesis is iron-regulated in mammalian cells. In HL-60 cells, hemin (an iron source) stimulated m-Acon synthesis 3-fold after 4 h compared with cells treated with an iron chelator (Desferal). Furthermore, hemin stimulated m-Acon synthesis 2–4-fold in several cell lines. Second, we show that iron modulates the polysomal association of m-Acon mRNA. We observed m-Acon mRNA in both ribonucleoprotein and polyribosomal fractions of HL-60 cells. Hemin significantly increased the polyribosomal association and decreased the ribonucleoprotein abundance of m-Acon mRNA in HL-60 cells. Third, our results indicate that iron differentially regulates translation of m-Acon and ferritin mRNAs. A dose response to hemin in HL-60 cells elicited a 2–2.4-fold increase in m-Acon synthesis within 5 h compared with untreated cells, whereas ferritin synthesis was stimulated 20–100-fold. We conclude that iron modulates m-Acon synthesis at the translational level and that iron regulatory proteins appear to differentially affect translation of IRE-containing mRNAs.

Iron is an essential nutrient for nearly all organisms because iron-containing proteins function in a number of important cellular processes (1Theil E.C. Biochem.

However, organisms must simultaneously cope with two detrimental properties of iron under physiological conditions, its low solubility as the uncomplexed metal ion and its propensity to enhance production of reactive oxygen species. It is this essential but potentially toxic nature of iron that has likely served as an evolutionary driving force for the development of systems that promote efficient transport, utilization, and storage of the metal. In mammals, the interorgan transport, uptake, and storage of iron is performed by transferrin, the transferrin receptor, and ferritin, respectively. Iron regulation of the synthesis of iron uptake (transferrin receptor (TfR) 1The abbreviations used are: TfR, transferrin receptor; IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; UTR, untranslated region; m-Acon, mitochondrial aconitase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; S.

Ferritin and TfR synthesis are linked to iron status through the action of two iron-regulated RNA-binding proteins, iron regulatory protein (IRP) 1 and IRP2. IRPs bind to specific stem-loop motifs (iron-responsive elements (IREs)) present in the 5′- or 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of ferritin and TfR mRNAs, respectively (1Theil E.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W.

For IRP1, which is a bifunctional protein, iron inhibits RNA-binding activity by promoting assembly of a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster in the binding protein, thereby converting it to cytosolic aconitase (8Kennedy M.C.

In the presence of low intracellular iron levels, IRPs have high RNA-binding activity. When bound to target mRNAs containing a 5′-IRE, such as H- or L-ferritin mRNAs, IRP1 or IRP2 blocks translation of the messenger. In the case of TfR mRNA, which contains multiple IREs in its 3′-UTR, IRP binding increases stability of the mRNA. Conversely, when intracellular iron levels increase, IRP RNA-binding activity is reduced, and this results in enhanced translation of ferritin mRNAs and declining TfR mRNA levels. In addition to ferritin and TfR mRNAs, the mRNA encoding the erythroid isoform of 5-aminolevulinate synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in erythroid heme formation, also possesses a 5′-IRE. The evidence indicates that, like ferritin, iron stimulates translation of erythroid aminolevulinate synthase mRNA (10Bhasker C.R. Burgiel G. Neupert B. Emery-Goodman A. Kuhn L.C. May B.K. J. Biol.

Taken together, IRPs are components of a sensory and regulatory network that is a critical factor in maintaining cellular and organismal iron homeostasis. Recently, it has become apparent that IRPs may regulate other metabolic functions in mammals through their potential ability to modulate the abundance of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme mitochondrial aconitase (m-Acon) (12Chen O.S.

The identification of an IRE in m-Acon mRNA provided the first suggestion that IRPs might regulate m-Acon synthesis (15Dandekar T. Stripecke R. Gray N.K. Goossen B. Constable A. Hohansson H.E.

When present in a heterologous mRNA, the m-Acon IRE confers responsiveness to IRPs in an in vitrotranslation system, suggesting that m-Acon synthesis may be mediated by IRPs in vivo (13Gray N.K.

The potential for IRP-mediated changes in m-Acon abundance suggests that a link exists between cellular iron status and mitochondrial utilization and/or export of citrate. Compared with ferritin mRNAs, IRPs are less effective in repressing m-Acon mRNA translation in a cell-free translation system (14Kim H.-Y. LaVaute T. Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol.

Recent demonstrations of a differential dose- and time-dependent effect of dietary iron intake on ferritin and m-Acon abundance in liver support the concept of a selectedin vivo action of IRPs upon IRE-containing mRNAs (12Chen O.S.

There are sequence and apparently structural differences between the m-Acon IRE and the ferritin IRE (Fig. 1). Although the IRE regions in m-Acon and ferritin mRNAs both have the canonical 6-nucleotide IRE loop (CAGUGX), they differ with respect to the sequence and structure of the stem region within and flanking the IRE. First, the IRE in ferritin mRNAs is the central part of a larger and more stable stem-loop region than observed in m-Acon mRNA (Fig. 1). Second, the ferritin IRE has flanking sequences that are phylogenetically conserved and contribute to its structure and stability (1Theil E.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Dix D.J. Lin P.-N. McKenzie A.R. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Mol.

These differences in the IRE region in ferritin and m-Acon mRNAs may confer functional differences on the ability of IRPs to modulate the utilization of these and other IRE-containing mRNAs (1Theil E.C.

Therefore, it is of interest to determine if the differential effect of iron on m-Acon and ferritin abundance in vivo is due to differences in the range of regulation of their synthesis by iron. To further our work on the relationship between cellular iron status and m-Acon gene expression, we have examined the effect of iron excess and iron deficiency on the biosynthesis of m-Acon in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that m-Acon synthesis is regulated translationally in response to perturbations of cellular iron status. Our results indicate that IRPs differentially modulate m-Acon and ferritin synthesis and that these regulatory RNA-binding proteins may influence mitochondrial utilization of citrate through a directed modulation of m-Acon synthesis.

The human monocytic cell line U937 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Penicillin and streptomycin were included in all cell culture media. Cells were lysed in buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors, and a 13,000 ×g supernatant was obtained as described (22Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled with 50–200 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (ICN) for 30 min in RPMI 1640 medium minus Met. After centrifugation, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (20Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T. Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Between 5 and 20 × 106 cpm of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was immunoprecipitated with IgG against rat liver ferritin, bovine heart m-Acon, and rat liver IRP1 as described (22Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured in reducing sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Aconitases were resolved on 7.5–15% linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (22Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ferritin subunits were analyzed using 10% Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Schagger H. Von Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar). Fluorography was as described (20Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T. Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state level of m-Acon was determined by immunoblotting as described (12Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). IRE RNA-binding activity, in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (20Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T. Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1 nm32P-labeled IRE-containing RNA. The RNA used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis was the first 73 nucleotides of the rat L-ferritin 5′-UTR synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (20Eisenstein R.S.

Bound and free RNAs were separated and quantitated as described (20Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T. Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TfR mRNA level was determined by ribonuclease protection assay (Ambion Inc.) (22Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). m-Acon mRNA abundance in sucrose gradient fractions was also determined by ribonuclease protection assay. A cDNA encoding human muscle m-Acon was generously provided by Dr. H.-H. Juang (Chang Gung College of Medicine and Technology, Kwei-Shan, Taiwan). The cDNA (in pBSII(SK)) was digested with SmaI and SphI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and religated. This removed the encoded poly(A) tail and 3′-UTR of the cDNA. This plasmid was digested withDdeI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase, allowing production of a coding region antisense RNA from nucleotides 2036 to 1930 of human m-Acon mRNA. All RNA probes were purified in 8m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gels. HL-60 cells (2 × 108 cells, 106 cells/ml) were treated with hemin (50 μm) or Desferal (100 μm) for 5 h before harvest. The cell pellet was lysed in 600 μl of buffer B (26Rogers J. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 8 min. The resulting supernatant (500 μl) was applied to a 12-ml 10–50% linear sucrose gradient in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 250 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 0.5 μg/ml heparin (26Rogers J. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The gradients were centrifuged at 180,000 × g in a Sorvall TH641 rotor for 135 min at 4 °C and then fractionated using an Isco Model UA-6 gradient fractionator. The absorbance at 254 nm was continuously monitored. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and RNA was isolated as follows. Buffer-saturated phenol (1 ml) was mixed with the sample by vortexing. Chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, 1 ml) was added, and the sample was vortexed and then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 ×g. The aqueous phase was collected, and RNA was precipitated with ethanol and NaCl. To begin to determine if alterations if m-Acon abundance could be programmed through an IRP-mediated pathway, we examined the extent to which perturbations in cellular iron status influenced the synthesis of m-Acon. HL-60 cells were treated with an iron chelator (Desferal) or an iron source (hemin) for 4 or 24 h and then pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys. A rapid (4 h) and sustained (24 h) effect of cellular iron status was observed on the synthesis rate of m-Acon. After 4 h, the rate of m-Acon synthesis in hemin-treated HL-60 cells exceeded that observed in Desferal-treated cells by 3-fold (average stimulation, 3.3 ± 0.6-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 7)) (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Synthesis of cytosolic aconitase (IRP1) was not affected by hemin under these conditions (data not shown) (22Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This iron-dependent difference in the synthesis rate of m-Acon was further enhanced after 24 h such that m-Acon synthesis in hemin-treated cells was 30-fold greater than in Desferal-treated cells (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). The greater difference in the synthesis rate of m-Acon between hemin- and Desferal-treated cells at 24 h, compared with the 4-h time point, was mainly due to a further decline in m-Acon synthesis in Desferal-treated cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 4). To determine if the action of iron required de novo synthesis of RNA, we asked if the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D could block the ability of hemin to stimulate m-Acon synthesis. HL-60 cells were pretreated with Desferal (100 μm) for 3 h. Then, actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. After centrifugation and washing of the cell pellet, the cells were resuspended in medium containing hemin (20 μm) and actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or in medium containing Desferal (100 μm) and actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). After 2.5 h, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 30 min. Under these conditions, hemin treatment resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in m-Acon synthesis (Fig. 3, A, lane 2; and C, bar 2) compared with cells treated with Desferal (A, lane 1; and C, bar 1). Preimmune serum failed to immunoprecipitate any protein (Fig. 3 A, lane C). In the presence of actinomycin D, the 3-h treatment with hemin resulted in ferritin synthesis being stimulated by 3-fold (Fig. 3, B, lanes 3 and 4; and C, bars 3 and 4). We examined the distribution of m-Acon mRNA between the translationally inactive ribonucleoprotein (RNP) pool and the translationally active polysomal pool to determine if iron regulated m-Acon synthesis translationally. HL-60 cells were treated with hemin (50 μm) or Desferal (100 μm) for 5 h. The RNP and polysome fractions of cellular mRNAs were then separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4 A), and the distribution of m-Acon mRNA was determined by RNase protection assay. In Desferal-treated cells, 40% of the m-Acon mRNA was in the same region of the gradient as the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and 15% was found in the 80 S region (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 5). Compared with cells treated with Desferal, hemin-treated cells exhibited an ∼70% decline in the amount of m-Acon mRNA in the 40 S region (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 in B and C). In Desferal-treated cells, m-Acon mRNA was present at a low level throughout the polysome region of the gradient (Fig. 4 B, lanes 7–12). However, compared with Desferal-treated cells, cells exposed to hemin had more m-Acon mRNA in the disome through tetrasome region of polysomes (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7–9) and particularly in the heavy (greater than a tetrasome) polysome region (lanes 10–12). Thus, m-Acon mRNA translation is linked to cellular iron levels. We examined the effect of hemin and Desferal on the synthesis of m-Acon, cytosolic aconitase, and ferritin in three other cell lines. U937, RF2, and FTO2B cells were pretreated with Desferal (100 μm) for 3 h. They were then washed and resuspended in medium containing Desferal (100 μm) (Fig. 5, lanes a, c, and e) or hemin (50 μm) (lanes b, d, and f) for an additional 2.5 h, after which they were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys. Synthesis of m-Acon was stimulated 2.3 ± 0.6-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 7), 3.6 ± 1.2-fold (n = 3), and 2.9 ± 0.4-fold (n = 8) in U937, RF2, and FTO2B cells, respectively (Fig. 5 A). In contrast to what was observed for m-Acon, biosynthesis of cytosolic aconitase was essentially unchanged in U937 and FTO2B cells (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes a and e with lanes b and f, respectively), or it decreased somewhat with hemin treatment in RF2 cells (lanes c and d). In hemin-treated U937, RF2, and FTO2B cells, the incorporation of [35S]Met/Cys into cytosolic aconitase was 85 ± 5% (mean ± S.E., n = 2), 42 ± 11% (n = 2), and 110 ± 12% (n = 3), respectively, of that observed in Desferal-treated cells. Similar to what was observed for m-Acon, we also found a higher rate of ferritin synthesis in hemin-treated cells compared with Desferal-treated cells (Fig. 5 C). The rate of ferritin synthesis in hemin-treated cells ex-ceeded that measured in Desferal-treated cells by 3–7-fold. 3We used the Tricine/SDS system (25Schagger H. Von Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar) to separate ferritin subunits and found differences in the migration of the subunits in human compared with rat cell lines. In the more commonly used Tris/SDS system, the L- and H-ferritin subunits from some species have been shown to migrate aberrantly (46Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Massover W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7923-7926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, hemin stimulated m-Acon and ferritin synthesis in HL-60 cells and in the other cell types tested, whereas cytosolic aconitase synthesis was largely unaffected. We determined the steady-state concentration of m-Acon in FTO2B cells treated with hemin (50 μm) and Desferal (100 μm) for 4 or 16 h. Compared with hemin-treated cells, the amount of m-Acon protein in Desferal-treated cells was 85 ± 3.1% (mean ± S.E., n = 3) and 77 ± 1.7% (n = 3) after 4 and 16 h, respectively. These changes in m-Acon abundance are similar to the 50% decrease in m-Acon level in liver mitochondria of rats fed an iron-deficient diet for 3 weeks (12Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the effect of iron status on m-Acon synthesis in relation to other targets of IRP action, we examined the dose-dependent effect of hemin on m-Acon and ferritin synthesis as well as on the abundance of TfR mRNA. HL-60 cells were cultured for 5 h in the absence of hemin or in the presence of increasing levels of the iron source ranging from 1 to 50 μm. Compared with control cells (Fig. 6, A, lane a; and B, first bar), m-Acon synthesis was stimulated between 2- and 2.4-fold by addition of 10, 20, or 50 μm hemin (A, lanes d–f; and B, fourth through sixth bars), but not when the iron source was added at 1 or 5 μm(A, lanes b and c; and B, second and third bars). Ferritin synthesis was also increased by hemin, but the pattern and extent of stimulation differed from those observed for m-Acon. Synthesis of the more rapidly migrating ferritin subunit, presumably the L-subunit,3 was slightly stimulated by 1 and 5 μm hemin (Fig. 6, C, lanes b and c; and D, second and third bars) and was strongly stimulated by addition of 10, 20, and 50 μm hemin (Fig. 6, C, lanes d–f; and D, fourth through sixth bars). Compared with untreated cells, the relative rate of L-ferritin synthesis was stimulated 20- and 100-fold in cells treated with 20 and 50 μm hemin for 5 h, respectively. Thus, in HL-60 cells, hemin stimulated the synthesis of both ferritin and m-Acon, but the range of regulation of ferritin synthesis greatly exceeded that of m-Acon. To further evaluate the potential for differential effects of iron status on the targets of IRP action, we determined the effect of a 5-h hemin treatment on TfR mRNA abundance in HL-60 cells. Compared with control cells, hemin treatment reduced the level of TfR mRNA, but the effect of hemin was not apparent until its concentration reached 20 or 50 μm (Fig. 6, E and F). The extent of the decrease was 19% in cells incubated with 20 μm hemin and 56% in cells incubated with 50 μm hemin. Our observations provide the first direct evidence of a link between cellular iron status and translational regulation of m-Acon gene expression. We observed that perturbations in cellular iron status affected m-Acon biosynthesis in a number of cell lines and that, in HL-60 cells, this was associated with changes in the distribution of m-Acon mRNA between RNP and polyribosomal pools. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D failed to block induction of m-Acon synthesis by hemin in HL-60 cells. These results provide a molecular basis from which to understand previous observations in our laboratory and others that physiological decreases in iron intake lead to a reduction in m-Aconitase activity (12Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Ohira Y. Cartier L.-J. Chen M. Holloszy J.O. Am. J.

Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Kim H.-Y. LaVaute T. Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24226-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Considered from a broader perspective, these observations provide a strong indication that the physiological actions of IRPs in mammalian systems extend beyond their classical roles as regulators solely of iron uptake and storage. When considered together, the recent demonstrations that the IRE in the 5′-UTR of m-Acon mRNA is functional in an in vitrotranslation system (13Gray N.K. Pantopoulos K. Dandekar T. Ackrell B. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Kim H.-Y. LaVaute T. Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24226-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and our observation of iron-dependent changes in translation of m-Acon mRNA in a cellular system provide strong support for the proposal that IRPs regulate m-Acon synthesis in vivo. In Desferal-treated cells, we observed that a significant fraction of m-Acon mRNA sedimented in the 40 S region. We believe that most of the 40 S species of m-Acon mRNA represents a translationally inactive or RNP species for the following reasons. First, in extracts of mammalian cells, the RNP form of ferritin mRNAs sediments more slowly than the 40 S ribosomal subunit (29Aziz N. Munro H.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Rogers J.T. Bridges K.B. Durmowicz G. Glass J. Auron P.E. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14572-14578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, m-Acon mRNA is nearly three times larger than ferritin mRNAs, so it is not surprising that the RNP form of m-Acon mRNA sediments more rapidly than the ferritin RNP. Second, we observed that the abundance of m-Acon mRNA in the 40 S region decreased by ∼70% in hemin-treated HL-60 cells. This is consistent with the 40 S species of m-Acon mRNA being a translationally inactive species that is recruited to polyribosomes in response to an increase in intracellular iron concentration. In this report, we provide clear evidence for differential effects of iron on the synthesis rates of ferritin and m-Acon. The physiological reasons for a more limited regulation of m-Acon synthesis, compared with ferritin, likely reflect the differing biological roles of these proteins. Under normal physiological conditions, inappropriately low expression of m-Acon could unduly impair cellular ATP production and would not be beneficial to cells. In contrast, excessive production of ferritin could create an undesirable deficiency of intracellular iron under normal physiological conditions. Thus, the differential regulation of the expression of m-Acon and ferritin at the translational level appears to provide cells with the means to selectively regulate expression of these targets of IRP action. Evidence presented here and elsewhere provides a molecular basis through which IRPs can differentially affect the synthesis of proteins encoded by mRNAs containing an IRE in their 5′-untranslated regions. IRPs appear to bind more weakly to the m-Acon IRE compared with the ferritin IRE (13Gray N.K. Pantopoulos K. Dandekar T. Ackrell B. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Zheng L. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Zalkin H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, compared with m-Acon mRNA, IRPs more effectively repress ferritin mRNA translationin vitro (14Kim H.-Y. LaVaute T. Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24226-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we (12Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and others (14Kim H.-Y. LaVaute T. Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24226-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) demonstrated a differential effect of dietary iron intake on the abundance of ferritin and m-Acon in rat liver, with ferritin expression being more extensively affected. Our current work extends these results by showing that iron can modulate ferritin synthesis over a broader range compared with m-Acon synthesis in three of the four cell lines we examined. Given our demonstration that, like ferritin mRNAs, m-Acon mRNA is translationally regulated, then it appears that IRPs can act selectively to regulate the utilization of IRE-containing mRNAs in intact cells. These differences in translational regulation of IRE-containing mRNAs may reflect differences in structure of the ferritin IRE compared with IREs in m-Acon and other mRNAs (1Theil E.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Dix D.J. Lin P.-N. McKenzie A.R. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Mol.

In this context, it is of interest that the m-Acon IRE and flanking regions appear to form a stem region that contains a shorter stem and/or altered bulged nucleotide region 5 base pairs 5′ of the CAGUGX loop compared with the ferritin IRE (Fig. 1). Both stem length as well as the size and base composition of the bulged nucleotide region affect the interaction of IRPs with RNA (1Theil E.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Bettany A.J.E. Eisenstein R.S. Munro H.N. J. Biol.

Thus, the apparent differences in the ferritin and m-Acon IREs appear to provide a structural basis for enhanced versatility of the IRE/IRP regulatory system. What additional factors contribute to the difference in translational response of ferritin and m-Acon mRNAs to variations in iron level? First, translation of ferritin mRNAs is efficiently repressed until iron is in excess (26Rogers J. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Shull G.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14187-14191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Walden W.E. Thach R.E.

A. 1991; 88: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Second, in the absence of IRP action, ferritin mRNAs are efficient competitors for the translation apparatus. In fact, the ferritin IRE as well as other sequences within ferritin mRNA appear to act as positive translational control element(s) (34Shull G.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14187-14191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Dix D.J. Lin P.-N. Kimata Y. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2818-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, when considered from both perspectives, repressibility and translatability, ferritin mRNAs are efficiently regulated. These aspects of ferritin mRNA function promote the wide range of ferritin expression seen in a number of cell (26Rogers J. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and whole animal (12Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Shull G.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14187-14191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) systems. In contrast, iron regulation of m-Acon expression occurs over a narrower range. On the basis of this and previous reports (12Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Gray N.K. Pantopoulos K. Dandekar T. Ackrell B. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24226-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the more restricted regulation of m-Acon by iron appears to be due to less effective repression of m-Acon synthesis in iron deficiency and not to reduced translatability of the mRNA in the presence of iron excess. What is the physiological basis of an IRP-mediated link between cellular iron status and m-Acon abundance? A number of proposals have been advanced concerning why m-Acon is an apparent target of IRP action. These include regulation of energy metabolism, mitochondrial oxygen radical production, and modulation of the synthesis of iron-sulfur proteins (12Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Gray N.K. Pantopoulos K. Dandekar T. Ackrell B. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it seems likely that changes in these physiological processes would occur in response to chronic changes in iron availability. We have recently shown that dietary iron deficiency can rapidly influence m-Acon abundance in rat liver (51Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): A444Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and as shown here, iron affects m-Acon mRNA translation. Thus, it seems unlikely that acute changes in cellular iron status would influence the physiological processes noted above. Instead, we hypothesize that IRP-mediated changes in m-Acon abundance may represent a means to modulate the use of citrate in cellular iron metabolism. There is abundant, albeit circumstantial, evidence for a role of citrate in mammalian iron metabolism. Citrate can bind iron (38Harris D.C. Aisen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 329: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 39Martin R.B. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1986; 28: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) as well as promote iron uptake and release from mammalian cells (40Baker E. Vicary F.R. Huehns E.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1981; 47: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Baker E. Page M. Morgan E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G93-G97PubMed Google Scholar, 42Page M.A. Baker E. Morgan E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G26-G33PubMed Google Scholar). Iron citrate is a major component of the non-transferrin-bound iron pool present in plasma in some forms of iron overload, suggesting the possibility that it may be released by some tissues such as liver (43Grootveld M. Bell J.D. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. Bomford A. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4417-4422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, citrate influences the binding and/or release of iron to and from ferritin and transferrin (44Aisen P. Leibman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Treffry A. Harrison P.M. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given the known function of IRPs in modulating iron uptake and storage, we feel it reasonable to propose that IRP mediation of m-Acon expression represents a directed effort to modulate the role of citrate in cellular iron trafficking. Future directions will include examination of the extent to which the observed changes in m-Acon abundance result in perturbations in mitochondrial utilization and/or export of citrate.

The cDNAs of GD3 synthases predict several putative N-glycosylation sites. In this work we have examined the occupancy of these sites in a chicken GD3 synthase and how they affect its activity and intracellular traffic. COS-7 cells were transfected with an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged form of GD3 synthase (GD3 synthase-HA). Cells acquired GD3 synthase activity, cell surface GD3 immunoexpression, and GD3 synthase-HA immunoreactivity in the Golgi complex. In Western blots, a main GD3 synthase-HA band of 47 kDa was detected, which was radioactive upon metabolic labeling with [2-3H] mannose. Tunicamycin prevented the incorporation of [2-3H]mannose into GD3 synthase-HA, blocked the enzyme activity, and promoted a reduction of the enzyme molecular mass of 6–7 kDa. Timed deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F showed that all three potential N-glycosylation sites of GD3 synthase-HA were glycosylated. The deglycosylated forms were enzymatically more unstable than the native form. Tunicamycin treatment of cells led to retention of GD3 synthase-HA immunoreactivity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin, inhibitors of the ER-processing enzymes α-glucosidases I and II, also prevented the exit from the ER but did not essentially affect the enzyme specific activity. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine, inhibitors of mannosidases, did not affect either the enzyme activity or the Golgi localization. Results indicate that (a)N-glycosylation is necessary for GD3 synthase to attain and to maintain a catalytically active folding, and for exiting the ER; and (b) N-glycan trimming in the ER, while not required for enzyme activity, is necessary for proper trafficking of GD3 synthase to the Golgi complex.

GM3 is also substrate for aN-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase (GM2 synthase, EC2.4.1.92) which converts it to GM2, the first intermediate of a-pathway gangliosides (1van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5341-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative efficiency of these conversions, and hence the contribution of a- and b-pathway gangliosides, is regulated in a cell type-specific manner during differentiation, development, or malignant transformation (2Panzetta P.

A. 1995; 92: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The metabolic basis of this regulation are poorly understood. In vitro labeling of endogenous gangliosides of Golgi membranes have shown that GD3 synthase and GM2 synthase compete for a common pool of acceptor GM3 in the synthesis of GD3 and GM2 (6Maxzúd M.K.

Res. 1997; 22: 455-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this competence, the relative activities of the transferases, as well as their relative saturation with the respective donor sugar nucleotide influence the conversion of GM3 to one or the other product (8Martina J.A. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J.F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1274-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Martina J.A. Maccioni H.J.F. J. Neurosci.

Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1639-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) controls affect their relative activities. However, in considering the highly compartmentalized organization of the synthesis along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex, factors that could affect the proper sorting of the transferases to the different subcompartments, and hence their relationships with donors and acceptors and with other transferases, are worth of consideration. Among posttranscriptional events that could influence the relevance of a given glycosyltransferase for the overall functioning of the glycolipid or glycoprotein glycosylating system, their glycosylation status appears of particular interest due to the presence of potentialN-glycosylation sites in their cDNAs (16Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In fact, site-directed removal of N-glycosylation sites of GM2 synthase showed that N-glycans were relevant for stabilizing the enzyme structure but not for sorting of the enzyme to the Golgi complex (17Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the case of a glycoprotein α-2,6-sialyltransferase, N-glycan release in vitro resulted in loss of activity, but no information was provided on whether they are relevant for sorting to the proper compartment (18Fast D.G. Jamieson J.C. McCaffrey G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was reported that transiently expressed GlcNAcT-III, a glycosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of bisecting GlcNAc structures, requiresN-glycosylation for its activity and Golgi retention (19Nagai K. Ihara Y. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human (20Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsuji S. Nishi T. J. Biol.

As for other mammalian glycosyltransferases, the deduced primary sequence of these cloned GD3 synthases predicts a transmembrane disposition of type II membrane proteins and reveals three potentialN-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in the chick (Asn-57, -105, and -200) (12Daniotti J.L.

Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Atsuta M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) enzymes. Whether these glycosylation sequons are occupied by oligosaccharides is unknown, so information on the possible influences of carbohydrates on GD3 synthase activity, stability and intracellular traffic is lacking. In this work, we examine the occupancy of N-glycosylation sites of an epitope tagged form of chick GD3 synthase expressed in (GD3−) COS-7 cells. In addition, we study the effect of inhibiting en bloc glycosylation and oligosaccharide trimming, on the activity and intracellular localization of the enzyme, and also the effect of the in vitro deglycosylation on the enzyme activity. The chick GD3 synthase cDNA was subcloned into pCEFL vector (pCEFL-GD3 synthase) as described (12Daniotti J.L. Rosales Fritz V.M. Kunda P. Nishi T. Maccioni H.J.F. Int. J. Devl. Neurosc. 1997; 15: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To express an epitope-tagged form of GD3 synthase, a viral hemagglutinin (HA) nonapeptide was added at the carboxyl terminus. For this, a 1.1-kilobase pair DNA fragment including the chick GD3 synthase coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primer oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCCGCCACCATGGCGGGGCTGGCGTGGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-TCTGTCGACGAATTCGGCAGAAGACTGGGTTAA-3′) and pCEFL-GD3 synthase as template. The sense primer contains a BamHI restriction site and a Kozak initiation sequence (23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4143) Google Scholar) upstream of the initiation codon. At the antisense primer, the stop codon TAA was deleted and aSalI site was incorporated in-frame with a SalI site upstream the HA epitope sequence. The fragment was purified from 1% agarose gels (Genclean II, Bio 101), digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme and ligated using T4 ligase into pCEFL-HA, a modified pCEFL vector encoding the HA nonapeptide epitope YPYDVPDYA (24Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), to generate pCEFL-GD3 synthase-HA. The identity of each construct was confirmed by restriction mapping and that of the final construct by DNA sequencing. African green monkey COS-7 cells were plated on 35-mm tissue culture dishes (2–3 × 105 cells/plate) and grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's minimal medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with either 0.8 μg of pCEFL or pCEFL-GD3 synthase or pCEFL-GD3 synthase-HA using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the manufacturer's instructions. Fifteen hours after transfection the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and either fixed for immunostaining or harvested and homogenized for enzyme activity determinations or lysed for immunoprecipitation experiments. For detection of GD3 synthase-HA, 2 × 105 COS-7 cells plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected as described above. Fifteen hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol (−20 °C) for 8 min. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide in PBS) and then for 90 min at 37 °C in blocking buffer containing a 1:170 dilution of the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, BAbCO) or a 1:150 dilution of the polyclonal rabbit anti-M6PR (mannose 6-phosphate receptor, a gift of Dr. A. Cáceres, INIMEC, Córdoba, Argentina) antibody. After washing, cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with a 1:220 dilution of rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) to visualize GD3 synthase-HA, or a 1:150 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) to visualize the M6PR protein. Cells were thoroughly washed, and the coverslips were mounted in FluorSave (Calbiochem) and observed in a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. For detection of GD3 ganglioside, COS-7-transfected cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Expression of cell surface GD3 was examined using a monoclonal anti-GD3 antibody (R24, kindly provided by Dr. K. Lloyd, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) diluted 1:150 in blocking buffer. Fifteen hours after transfection with pCEFL-GD3 synthase-HA, cells were lysed by incubation for 60 min in ice with buffer A (50 mm HCl-Tris, pH 7.2, 0.6% Triton X-100, 140 mm NaCl, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmEDTA, 0.05% sodium azide). Lysates were preabsorbed with protein G-agarose beads (75% suspension washed with buffer A prior to use) for 60 min at room temperature and then were incubated overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C with mAb anti-HA (1:50) and with 50 μl of protein G-agarose (25De Angelis D.A. Braun P.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 × gfor 10 s and then washed five times at 4 °C with buffer A and three times with buffer B (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA). Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B. For digestion with PNGase F, immunoprecipitates were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 8 units/ml PNGase F in digestion buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mmEDTA, 5% methanol) in a total volume of 100 μl (18Fast D.G. Jamieson J.C. McCaffrey G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In some experiments the above volumes were scaled up as appropriate. Incubation was for up to 10 h at 37 °C and was stopped by transferring the tubes to ice. The beads were washed four times with 100 mmHCl-cacodylate buffer pH 6.5 prior to sialyltransferase activity determinations and immunoblotting analysis SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205406) Google Scholar). Cell homogenates or immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10% mercaptoethanol and then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44630) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 300 mA. For immunoblotting, nonspecific binding sites on the nitrocellulose were blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin, 2.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 in Tris-buffered saline (400 mmNaCl, 100 mm HCl-Tris, pH 7.5, buffer; TBS). Monoclonal antibody anti-HA was used at a 1:800 dilution. Blots were developed with polyclonal anti-mouse IgG heavy chain antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:40,000, using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.) and Kodak X-Omat-SB5 film. Polypeptide molecular weights were calculated based on calibrated standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) run in every gel. Protein bands in nitrocellulose membranes were visualized by Ponceau S staining. Homogenates of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a influenza virus HA epitope-tagged GD3 synthase (GD3 synthase-HA) were assayed for GD3 synthase activityin vitro. Table I shows that parental and mock-transfected cells express only background levels of GD3 synthase activity. On the other hand, the activity was clearly expressed in homogenates from GD3 synthase-HA- and GD3 synthase-transfected cells. The specific activities were similar in both homogenates, indicating that the added tag did no affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. High performance thin layer chromatography analysis (not shown) of the radioactive product of the enzyme reaction showed more than 95% of the radioactivity migrating as authentic GD3. Transfected cells also immunoexpress cell surface GD3 at variable intensities after immunostaining with the mAb R24 (Fig. 1), indicating that the GD3 synthase-HA was also functional in vivo.Table IGD3 synthase activity of parental and transfected COS-7 cellsCOS-7 cellsEnzyme activitynmol/mg protein/hParental0.09 ± 0.01Mock transfected0.10 ± 0.03GD3 synthase-HA transfected10.60 ± 0.40GD3 synthase transfected11.00 ± 0.20 Open table in a new tab Transfected cells were double immunostained with mAb anti-HA and polyclonal anti-M6PR antibody. GD3 synthase-HA was evident from 10 h after transfection, predominantly located in the Golgi complex juxtanuclear zone (Fig. 2 B) and colocalizing with M6PR, a trans-Golgi network and late endosome resident protein (Fig. 2 C). Treatment of the transfected cells with brefeldin A, which causes Golgi membranes to redistribute into the ER (28Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), resulted in a redistribution of the expressed GD3 synthase-HA into the ER (Fig. 2 D), thus further supporting its Golgi localization. To asses if GD3 synthase-HA was N-glycosylated, transfected COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled from [2-3H]mannose added to the culture medium 12 h before harvesting. Homogenates of these cells or immunoprecipitates from Triton X-100 extracts of the homogenates were probed with the mAb anti-HA (Fig. 3). A polypeptide of 47 kDa was detected in homogenates of the transfected cells (lane 1). The polypeptide was immunoprecipitable from Triton X-100 extracts of the homogenate (lane 2) and upon fluorography, it was found radioactively labeled (lane 5), which was consistent with GD3 synthase-HA being a glycoprotein. Effect of Inhibitors of N-Glycosylation and of N-Glycan Trimming on GD3 Synthase-HA Electrophoretic Mobility—Immunoprecipitates from cells that were labeled from [2-3H]mannose in the presence of tunicamycin lacked the HA-immunoreactive band at 47 kDa and showed a band at ∼40 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 3); this band was devoid of radioactivity upon fluorography (lane 6), thus indicating that GD3 synthase-HA was N-glycosylated. The immunoprecipitated polypeptide of 47 kDa was not detected in homogenates from mock transfected cells (lanes 4 and 7). The molecular mass of the polypeptide synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin (∼40-kDa) was the expected calculated from the cDNA of GD3 synthase-HA and strongly suggest that all three potential N-glycosylation sites of GD3 synthase-HA were occupied by oligosaccharides (2–3-kDa N-glycan) (see also Fig. 6). The effect of inhibitors of the oligosaccharide trimming on the electrophoretic mobility of GD3 synthase-HA was also examined (Fig. 4). Castanospermine, which inhibits ER glucosidase I and II, showed GD3 synthase-HA as a single polypeptide of molecular mass slightly higher (∼48 kDa) than in untreated cells (compare lanes 1 and 3). In cells treated with deoxynojirimycin, which also prevents trimming of glucoses, two forms of GD3 synthase-HA were detected (lane 4); a minor one of molecular mass ∼45 kDa and a major one of molecular mass ∼47.5 kDa, slightly higher than the fully glycosylated GD3 synthase-HA. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin, inhibitor of mannosidase I, and swainsonine, inhibitor of mannosidase II, did not detectably affect the electrophoretic mobility of GD3 synthase-HA; however, careful examination of Western blots from 1-deoxymannojirimycin-treated cells showed two GD3 synthase-HA forms in almost equal amounts, one having the electrophoretic mobility of the fully glycosylated enzyme, and the other one with a molecular mass about 0.5 kDa smaller (not shown). It should be noticed that densitometric quantification of Western blots from control and inhibitor-treated cells as the one shown in Fig. 4, evidenced that in cells treated with castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin, the mass of GD3 synthase-HA immunoreactive band was about 40% lower than in control cells (taking the value of intensity of the band in control cells relative to the sum of background bands intensities as 1.0, the values in tunicamycin, castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin treated cells were 1.1, 0.62, and 0.57, respectively). Table II shows that GD3 synthase-HA expressed in the presence of tunicamycin (40-kDa) was devoid of activity toward exogenous GM3 acceptor. On the other hand, the enzyme activity of the forms expressed in the presence of inhibitors of N-glycan trimming was less affected or not affected at all. Homogenates of cells treated with castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin showed enzyme activity about 30 and 40% lower than untreated cells, respectively (Table II). However, as mentioned above, a reduction of about 40% of the mass of GD3 synthase-HA was observed in Western blots of these homogenates, which indicates that the enzyme-specific activity was not modified by treatment with these inhibitors. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine, which act late in the Golgi complex by inhibiting the addition of galactose and sialic acid, did not affect the activity. It should be mentioned that when determined in the presence of inhibitors added to the sialyltransferase assay, the GD3 synthase-HA activity was as in control homogenates (Table II). This indicates that the inhibitors added to the cells in culture affected the activity by affecting N-glycan incorporation or trimming, and not by a direct inhibitory effect on GD3 synthase-HA activity.Table IIEffect of inhibitors of N-glycosylation and N-glycan trimming on GD3 synthase-HA activityAddition toGD3 synthase-HACells in culture2-aValues are the mean ± S.D. of two separated experiments performed in duplicate.Cell homogenate2-bValues are mean of one experiment performed in duplicate.nmol/mg protein/hControl−−10.90 ± 0.202-aValues are the mean ± S.D. of two separated experiments performed in duplicate.Tunicamycin+−0.10 ± 0.05−+10.4Castanospermine+−7.74 ± 0.06−+11.3Deoxynojirimycin+−6.50 ± 0.30−+10.71-Deoxymannojirimycin+−9.30 ± 0.10−+10.7Swainsonine+−9.70 ± 0.20−+10.92-a Values are the mean ± S.D. of two separated experiments performed in duplicate.2-b Values are mean of one experiment performed in duplicate. Open table in a new tab The decrease of GD3 synthase-HA from 47 to 40 kDa (Fig. 3) strongly suggest that all three putative N-glycosylation sites of GD3 synthase-HA were occupied by carbohydrate. This was confirmed by in vitrotreatment of GD3 synthase-HA immunoprecipitates with PNGase F. PNGase F is a peptide N-glycosidase that cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides, regardless of its complexity, by hydrolyzing the asparagine oligosaccharide bond. As shown in Fig. 5 A, incubation of the immunoprecipitates with PNGase F for different periods of time generated three polypeptide bands of 45, 43, and 40 kDa. The simplest interpretation for these changes is that the new polypeptides generated by PNGase F correspond to forms with two, one, and none of theN-linked oligosaccharides. The mobility of the band of 40 kDa is identical to that of a sample of the enzyme from an homogenate of tunicamycin treated cells (not shown). Ten-hour incubation in the absence of PNGase F but in otherwise identical conditions did not modify the electrophoretic pattern of GD3 synthase-HA. Fig. 5 B is a densitometric quantification of the percentage contribution of the GD3 synthase-HA forms generated by PNGase F. A fast decrease of about 60% of the fully glycosylated form (47 kDa) was observed during the first 0.5 h of treatment, which was followed by a slower decrease in the next periods. Conversely, the fully deglycosylated form (40 kDa) increased rapidly in the first 0.5 h and more slowly thereafter. The percentage of the partially deglycosylated forms (45 and 43 kDa) remained essentially constant in the 0.5–2-h period of the treatment, and dropped below 10% between 2 and 10 h of incubation. Fig. 5 C shows the GD3 synthase-HA activity of the preparation after deglycosylation with PNGase F. In the presence of PNGase F, the activity remained essentially intact at 0.5 and 1 h of incubation, decreased slightly up to 2 h and dropped to near zero in the period between 2 and 10 h. These results indicate that the fully and partially deglycosylated forms generated during the 2-h incubation period were essentially as active as the fully glycosylated form. However, they inactivate as the incubation period at 37 °C was prolonged beyond 2 h, suggesting a loss of stability following deglycosylation. As shown in Fig. 2, GD3 synthase-HA localized to the Golgi complex of the transfected cells. Fig. 6 A, shows that when cells expressing the transfected GD3 synthase-HA were exposed to tunicamycin, most of the immunostained protein remains associated with the ER. The same cells maintain the typical Golgi localization of the M6PR (Fig. 6 B), showing that a general phenomenon of Golgi-ER mixing induced by tunicamycin did not occur. Also, treatment of cells with castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin resulted in a predominant ER localization of GD3 synthase-HA (Fig. 6, C and D). Inhibitors acting late in the oligosaccharide trimming (1-deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine) did not affect the subcellular localization of GD3 synthase-HA, which showed the typical Golgi localization (Fig. 6, E and F). These results indicate that N-glycosylation and proper trimming of glucose residues are necessary for exiting the endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosyltransferase cDNAs cloned so far contain a variable number of glycosylation sequons (16Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Only in few cases it was examined if these putative glycosylation sites were actually occupied by carbohydrate and studied if these oligosaccharides are relevant for the catalytic activity and proper subcellular sorting of the enzyme. We have previously observed 2J.A. Martina, J. L. Daniotti, and H. J. F. Maccioni, unpublished observations. that heterologous expression of GM2 synthase and of GD3 synthase inEscherichia coli resulted in insoluble forms of these enzymes having no activity toward GM3 as exogenous acceptor suggesting that glycosylation could be of importance for proper folding. Here we addressed this question for the case of chicken GD3 synthase, whose primary sequence predicts three potential N-glycosylation sites. For this, COS-7 cells lacking GD3 synthase activity were transfected with an HA-epitope tagged form of the enzyme, and the effect of drugs affecting N-glycosylation on both the enzyme activity and subcellular localization was examined. Both the molecular mass of GD3 synthase-HA (47 kDa) in Western blots, which was about 7 kDa larger than expected from the corresponding cDNA (39.9 kDa), and the shape of the immunoreactive band, with a main core and diffuse borders, were compatible with GD3 synthase-HA being a glycoprotein. Incubation of transfected cells with [2-3H]mannose resulted in radioactive labeling of the 47-kDa polypeptide and suggested the N-glycan nature of these oligosaccharides. Treatment of the immunoprecipitated GD3 synthase-HA with PNGase F lends further support to the notion that GD3 synthase-HA bearsN-linked oligosaccharides. The appearance in the immunoblots of transient intermediates of 45 and 43 kDa, that were finally converted to a 40-kDa form, which likely represent the GD3 synthase core protein plus the 9 amino acids of the HA epitope, confirmed that the three potential N-glycosylation sites were in fact glycosylated. GD3 synthase-HA activity and intracellular sorting were differently affected when cells were exposed to optimized concentrations of inhibitors of N-glycosylation and of N-glycan processing. Tunicamycin, which inhibits en blocglycosylation by inhibiting the formation of the chitobiose moiety on dolichol-phosphate, led to the synthesis of the 40-kDa form of GD3 synthase-HA. Homogenates of cells expressing the unglycosylated form showed background levels of GD3 synthase-HA activity in vitro, evidencing a role of these N-linked oligosaccharides in conferring a catalytically active folded state. An interesting observation emerged from the timed deglycosylation of the active GD3 synthase-HA with PNGase F, although a substantial fraction of totally and partially deglycosylated forms appeared in the first 2 h of incubation, the sialyltransferase activity was essentially unchanged in the same period. After 2 h, however, the activity dropped to near zero, indicating that the stability at 37 °C was seriously affected by the loss of N-glycans and suggesting that these are important to keep the GD3 synthase-HA in a more stable form. Immunoblots of homogenates from cells treated with castanospermine, which prevents the removal of the three glucose residues fromN-linked oligosaccharides and hence the oligosaccharide processing at the ER level, lead to a form of GD3 synthase-HA having a molecular mass slightly higher than in untreated cells. This form most probably still contains the glucose residues in the threeN-linked oligosaccharide chains. Deoxynojirimycin, which also inhibits glucosidases I and II, showed in addition to the major band of ∼47.5 kDa, a minor band of ∼45 kDa. The major band probably represent the form with glucose residues, while the minor band probably represent a form lacking one N-linked oligosaccharide, due to inefficient en bloc glycosylation in the presence of deoxynojirimycin, as it has been already suggested (29Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The GD3 synthase-HA activity was similar in homogenates from castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin treated cells, and 30–40% lower than in untreated cells. However, the GD3 synthase-HA mass determined in the Western blots was also decreased by about 40% with respect to control cells, suggesting that these inhibitors either inhibited the synthesis or increased the degradation of the enzyme. It has already observed that deoxynojirimycin produced partial inhibition of cruzipain synthesis (29Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that castanospermine induced rapid degradation of major histocompatibilty complex class I molecules (30Moore S.E.H. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3809-3812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical examination of cells treated with the different inhibitors showed that, in those treated with tunicamycin, castanospermine, and deoxynojirimycin, HA-immunoreactivity was mostly associated with the ER. However, whereas the unglycosylated form was enzymatically inactive in vitro, the glycosylated but untrimmed forms in castanospermine- and deoxynojirimycin-treated cells were in a folding state having full enzyme activity. The simplest interpretation of these results is that N-glycosylation is critical for both enzyme activity and exiting the ER, while removal of glucose residues from the N-glycan is necessary for efficient trafficking of the enzyme from the ER to the Golgi complex. Inhibitors of mannosidase I (1-deoxymannojirimycin) or mannosidase II (swainsonine) acting late in the Golgi complex were without effect on GD3 synthase-HA subcellular localization. Concerning GD3 expression at the surface of inhibitor-treated transfectants, those treated with tunicamycin were essentially negative, although a weak immunostaining could be detected in few of these cells; on the other hand, GD3 was expressed in most castanospermine- or deoxynojirimycin-treated transfectants at levels comparable to those in untreated cells, suggesting that in these transfectants the enzyme was active also in vivo (results not shown). We can not ascertain in the later cases if GD3 synthesis was carried out by the enzyme retained in the ER or by the fraction that reached the Golgi complex or by both. Although the effect of inhibiting N-glycosylation on activity and/or intracellular transport has been examined in diverse proteins, the high variability found in the requirements makes difficult to define a role for N-glycan chains on their biological activity. N-Glycans were found essential for proper folding and cellular transport of the α subunit of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (31Weitz G. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10039-10044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while lysosomal delivery of GM2 activator protein, a singly glycosylated protein involved in glycolipid catabolism, was not impaired by tunicamycin (32Glombitza G.J. Becker E. Kaiser H.W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5199-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of glycosylation did not affect activity, but affected intracellular transport of secretory proteins as the platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (33Kaetzel D.M. Morgan D. Reid J.D. Fenstermaker R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), or plasma membrane proteins as the norepinephrine (34Nguyen T.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) transporters. For the case of the Golgi glycosyltransferases examined up to now, the common observation is that N-glycans would be necessary for folding into a catalytically active state (17Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Fast D.G. Jamieson J.C. McCaffrey G. Biochim. Biophys.

However, whileN-glycosylation and proper trimming are critical for trafficking of GD3 synthase and GlcNAcT-III (19Nagai K. Ihara Y. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to the Golgi complex, this is not so for the case of GM2 synthase (17Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Furukawa K. Takamiya K.

Mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during development involve reciprocal inductive stimuli that are critically important in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis. The elucidation of the molecular basis for these events is a major goal relevant to advancing our understanding of basic developmental processes. Kidney organogenesis depends upon a set of molecular signaling events that form the basis for the induction of nephron formation in the metanephric mesenchyme by the ureteric bud (1Ekblom P.

Shimazu H. Ohi Y. Muramatsu T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1281-1285PubMed Google Scholar). However, definitive evidence for a direct role of MK as an autocrine mitogenic factor in tumor cells has not yet been established. Tyrosine phosphorylation of growth factor receptors upon ligand binding is an important signaling mechanism for cellular activation, proliferation, and differentiation (32Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). MK and PTN might exert their functions through interaction with specific cell-surface signaling receptors and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Previous studies have shown that PTN induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (33Li Y. Deuel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the cellular signaling receptors for MK and PTN have not yet been identified and characterized. Study of the molecular basis for signal transduction pathways of MK and PTN would further enhance the understanding of their roles in development and cancer. We report that MK, but not PTN, stimulates tumor (G401) cell proliferation in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. MK specifically binds to a high affinity cell-surface receptor, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated after MK binding and stably associates with the Janus non-receptor tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2. MK also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1α. Our studies support the hypothesis that this newly identified MK receptor is the signal transduction receptor that mediates the MK-dependent autocrine stimulation of this tumor cell line in vitro. Human pediatric rhabdoid tumor kidney-derived G401 cell line (CRL 1441), normal rat kidney cells (CRL 6509), and NIH 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts (CRL 1658) were obtained from the American Tissue and Cell Culture Association. G401 cells (passages 15–45) were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) containing heat-inactivated 1% fetal bovine serum (Lot A2934J; Gemini, CA), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Normal rat kidney cells (passages 10–17) and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (passages 6–14) were cultured in bicarbonate-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media with 5% fetal calf serum. Human adult kidneys were obtained under sterile conditions by the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA) within 24 h of harvest in Collins solution (98 mm Na+, 107 mmK+, 14 mm Cl−, 9.3 mmHCO3, 93 mm PO4, 182 mmglucose, pH 7.0) at 4 °C. Monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PT-66) was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies to focal adhesion kinase, JAK1, JAK2, STAT2, gp130, and antibodies to MK and to PTN (without cross-reactivity) and monoclonal antibodies to STAT1α were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Streptavidin-Sepharose was purchased from Pierce. Total cellular RNA was extracted from human adult kidney (34Chomszhynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-161PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (5–10 μg) in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units) in the presence of RNasin (1 unit/μl), 1 mm each dNTP, 100 pmol of random hexamer primers (Boehringer Mannheim). For first strand synthesis, the mixture was incubated 10 min at 23 °C and 60 min at 42 °C, followed by denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, and then quick-chilled on ice. One-μl aliquot of the 10-fold diluted first strand cDNA solution was used as the template in a 100-μl polymerase chain reaction with Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) performed as follows: denaturation at 92 °C for 4 min; 35 cycles of 92 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min; with a final extension 72 °C for 10 min; MK, sense: 5′-TCAGATCTGATGCAGCACCGAGGCTTCG-3′ and antisense: 5′-TACAAGCTTCTGGTGGGTCACATCTCGG-3′; and PTN, sense: 5′-TCAGATCTAATGCAGGCTCAACAGTACC-3′ and antisense: 5′-TACAAGCTTTTTAATCCAGCATCTTCTCCTG-3′ with sites for BglII and XbaI for cloning in pCB6 vector. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were first subcloned into pCR 2.1 vector (InVitrogen). The resulting constructs were digested withBglII and XbaI; fragments corresponding to MK or PTN were isolated from a gel and inserted in the pCB6 (InVitrogen). COS1 cells were transiently transfected with pCB6-MK, pCB6-PTN, and pCB6 alone (control) in the following manner. COS1 cell cultures were grown in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum; 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA was introduced into cells using DEAE-dextran (35Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols on Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Johns Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). After 60 h, 200 ml of conditioned media (8.8–9.5 μg/ml total protein) was harvested from COS1 cells transfected with pCB6-MK or pCB6-PTN or pCB6 alone, and the conditioned media were concentrated 50-fold on an ultrafiltration stirrer device (YM-5, Amicon) followed by the purification of heparin-binding proteins by heparin affinity chromatography (Poros HE-1, PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Columns were washed with 20 ml of 0.5 mNaCl in the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with 5 ml of the same buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl. The yield of MK or PTN secreted by transfected COS1 cells purified on heparin column was 0.3–0.4 μg/ml starting conditioned media. Purity of MK and PTN used in the experiments was near 90–95% based on SDS-PAGE analysis of iodinated MK and PTN. G401, normal rat kidney, and NIH 3T3 cells (2,000 cells/well) were plated onto Corning 96-well plates and were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of MK or PTN purified from conditioned media of transfected COS1 cells. (MK and PTN purified to near-homogeneity from media collected from either mouse MK or rat PTN stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were also used in pilot proliferation and binding experiments, and produced equivalent results.) NIH 3T3 and normal rat kidney cells were treated for 24 h with 0–5 nm MK or PTN or control conditioned media in McCoy's 5A medium, 5% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For dose-response experiments G401 cells were treated for 24 h with 0–5 nm MK or PTN or control conditioned media in serum-free McCoy's 5A medium, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For time course experiments G401 cells were treated with 1 nm MK or 1 nm PTN or control for 0–120 h in McCoy's media, 1% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In both cases, a CellTiter 96TM AQueous non-radioactive colorimetric proliferative assay was used (Promega). 20 μl of combined MTS/PMS (20:1) reagent was added to 96-well cell-free plates and plates containing cells in the presence of necessary supplements, and assay was performed for 4 h at 37 °C. A cell-free duplicate plate with identical protein fractions and media was assayed as a control. Both cell-free plates and cell containing plates were analyzed on plate reader Labsystems Multiscan MCC/340 atA 490–A 690. Then data obtained from cell-free plate were subtracted from experimental results obtained from plate containing cells, individually. All subtracted data were in quadruplicate, and average results with error bars were plotted as graphs using Cricket-Graph computer program. Labeling of ligands (MK and PTN purified from transfected COS1 cells) was performed by the incubation of proteins (50 μg) with Na125I (1.3–1.5 mCi, 16.8 mCi/mg, Amersham Corp.) during 1 min at 4 °C in the presence of chloramine T (1 mg/ml) and PBS, then stopping the reaction with sodium metabisulfite, followed by desalting chromatography on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in PBS (36Abramovich C. Shulman L. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Specific activity of iodinated proteins was 1.1–1.3 × 105 cpm/μg. 125I-MK and 125I-PTN were stored at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks of preparation. For detection of cell-surface receptor, 0.5 nm125I-MK or 0.5 nm125I-PTN was incubated with intact G401 cells (2–5 × 107 cells) in 1 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS, pH 7.4, for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed 2–3 times with PBS containing 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors, and ligand-receptor complexes were stabilized chemically with 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Sigma), the homo-bifunctional cross-linking agent, for 20 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl to inactivate DSS (36Abramovich C. Shulman L. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Ligand-receptor binding experiments were done in the absence or presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled MK, PTN, or control protein fraction. Cell pellets were treated with liquid nitrogen and extracted with 1 ml/107 cells of lysis buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% of Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF) for 30 min on ice. Postnuclear supernatants were incubated with 1.0% Nonidet P-40 for the next 30 min and cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatants 40–60 μl were boiled with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by denaturing 6% SDS-PAGE; dried gels were examined by autoradiography (36Abramovich C. Shulman L. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Confluent intact G401 cells (3 × 107) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 125I-MK (0.005–1.0 nm), cross-linked, and treated as above; the samples were resolved by denaturing 6% SDS-PAGE; dried gels were autoradiographed and sliced into 1-cm2 pieces in regions of radioactive bands and background. The slices were counted in a Beckman 5500 gamma counter for 1 min. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms were performed using a linear least-squares regression LIGAND program (37Munson P. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of MK ligand-receptor binding was also performed on intact G401 cells in Eppendorf tubes (without subsequent SDS-PAGE and excision of the radioactive receptor band). G401 cells (5 × 107) were incubated in 100 μl of PBS for 60 min at 4 °C with increasing amounts (0.01 to 1 nm) of125I-MK cross-linked for 20 min at 4 °C with DSS (as above), spun down, and washed 5 times with 1 ml of PBS, and the resultant pellets were dried and counted in a gamma counter for 1 min. The binding experiments were repeated 4 times, normalized for cell number, and averaged. Confluent G401 cells (2 × 107) were incubated overnight in serum-free McCoy's 5A medium, washed with the same media containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 50 mmNaF, and treated with MK or PTN or control proteins at 37 °C. Stimulation was stopped with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and 50 mm NaF. Cells were scraped off the flasks with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors mixture, as above). The postnuclear supernatants were treated with 1.0% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 30 min and spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min (38Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Supernatants containing 20–100 μg per lane were boiled with 1% SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon P membrane sheets. Sheets were blocked with 10% non-fat milk, PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, probed with antibody to phosphotyrosine (PT-66) (1: 5,000), followed by washing in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Then sheets were incubated with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000), washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and visualized with ECL (Amersham Corp.). Quantitative densitometry of phosphotyrosine signals was performed as follows; slides of films with immunoblot data were made, scanned, and plotted as diagrams using the Macros (NIH Image 1.58b 39f) computer program. PTN and MK were prepared from conditioned media of transfected COS1 cells as above. For biotinylation, 10 μg of MK or 10 μg of PTN or 10 μg of control proteins were incubated with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Immunopure Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, Pierce) for 10 min at 4 °C in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, with gentle shaking (36Abramovich C. Shulman L. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by 0.01 mglycine and diafiltrated against 10 mm PBS through 3K Centriprep concentrator (Amicon). Intact G401 cells (5–8 × 107 cells) were cross-linked with 1 nm biotinylated MK or 1 nmbiotinylated PTN or biotinylated control proteins for 30 min at 4 °C in serum-free McCoy's 5A media (1 ml/107 cells). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml/107 cells of ice-cold PBS with 0.5 mm DSS for 20 min at 4 °C, then washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were solubilized (1 ml/107 cells) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Brij-50, 1 mm PMSF, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF for 30 min on ice, and supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Then 500-μl supernatants were pre-cleared with 10 μl of normal rabbit serum for 30 min and incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) for 30 min (36Abramovich C. Shulman L. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Supernatants were recovered by centrifugation and then used for subsequent precipitation. 40 μl of a 50% suspension of streptavidin-Sepharose (Pierce) was added to 500 μl of supernatant and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation, washed three times with 1 ml of cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF (34Chomszhynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-161PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were boiled with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, resolved by denaturing 6% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon P sheets. Blocked sheets were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies directed against phosphotyrosine (PT-66) (1:5,000), MK, JAK1, JAK2, focal adhesion kinase, gp130 (each in dilution 1:1,000), washed, incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:10,000) or protein A (1:10,000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), and visualized with ECL. For immunoprecipitation experiments, G401 cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free media, incubated for 20 min with MK (0.5 nm), PTN (0.5 nm), or control (concentrated conditioned media from COS1 cells transfected with pCB6 vector alone). Cell extracts were prepared as above, including pre-clearing with protein A-agarose (Sigma) beads or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-bound agarose beads. Supernatants were precipitated with primary antibodies directed to JAK1, JAK2, STAT2, and STAT1α for 16–18 h at 4 °C and then with secondary antibodies (protein A or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin) coupled to Sepharose/agarose beads. Antigen-antibody complexes were washed three times with 0.05% PBS, Tween 20, boiled in sample buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto Immobilon P membrane, and probed with antibody to phosphotyrosine (PT-66) and antibody to JAK1, JAK2, STAT2, or STAT1α. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL as above. To analyze the mitogenic effect of MK and PTN on G401 cells, we cloned human MK and PTN using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions with human kidney RNA as a template. The MK (522 base pairs) and PTN (542 base pairs) cDNA fragments were inserted into the pCB6 vector, and COS1 cells were transfected with the pCB6-MK or pCB6-PTN expression constructs. COS1 cells transfected with pCB6-MK secrete MK, and COS1 cells transfected with pCB6-PTN secrete PTN, in contrast to COS1 cells transfected with pCB6 vector alone (Fig. 1 A). MK, PTN, and control proteins were prepared from concentrated conditioned media of COS1 cells transfected with pCB6-MK, pCB6-PTN, or pCB6 alone, respectively, and purified by heparin affinity column chromatography (Fig. 1 B). We then studied the mitogenic properties of MK and PTN in the pediatric tumor kidney-derived G401 cell line, using the non-radioactive colorimetric MTS/PMS proliferation assay. Since NIH 3T3 fibroblasts proliferate in response to both MK and PTN, and normal rat kidney cells proliferate in response to PTN only (6Li Y. Milner P. Chauhan A. Watson M. Hoffman R. Konder C.

MK stimulates G401 cell proliferation in a time-dependent and dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, A and B); PTN and control protein have no effect. These data (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, A and B) demonstrate that MK might regulate G401 cell proliferation in an autocrine manner. Titration of MK from 0.05 to 5 nm indicates that half-maximal stimulation of G401 cell proliferation occurs at approximately 0.3–0.5 nm.Figure 3Mitogenic activity of MK and PTN on G401 cells. A, dose dependence of MK and PTN on G401 cells (0.05–5 nm MK or PTN for 24 h. B, time dependence of MK and PTN on G401 cells (1 nm MK or PTN, 0–120 h).

Chapdelaine Y. Hohn T. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In infected plants, two major RNAs are transcribed from the following two viral promoters: the monocistronic 19 S RNA encoding a multifunctional protein that acts as a translational transactivator, and the pre-genomic 35 S RNA (Fig. 1). The 35 S RNA has several functions; it can act as an mRNA for several viral proteins (2Dixon L.K. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2731-2736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or as a template for reverse transcription (3Bonneville J.-M. Hohn T. Skalka N. Goff S. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 357-390Google Scholar) and can be alternatively spliced (4Kiss-László Z. Blanc S. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); it also appears to be packaged into viral particles (5Mesnard J.-L. Carriere C. Virology. 1996; 213: 1-6Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the 35 S RNA is terminally redundant, i.e. polyadenylation signals exist at both ends of the RNA and must be bypassed in the first instance (6Sanfaçon H. Hohn T. Nature. 1990; 346: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Rothnie H.M. Reid J. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2200-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hence, regulation of CaMV gene expression may take place at the level of splicing (4Kiss-László Z. Blanc S. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), polyadenylation (6Sanfaçon H. Hohn T. Nature. 1990; 346: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Rothnie H.M.

Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and translation (1Rothnie H.M. Chapdelaine Y. Hohn T. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two unusual mechanisms are employed by CaMV to translate its RNAs. First, some viral proteins are expressed from polycistronic mRNAs, although mRNAs encoding more than one open reading frame (ORF) are unusual in eukaryotic cells. The expression of a downstream ORF on polycistronic CaMV mRNAs requires a virus-encoded translational transactivator (9Bonneville J.-M. Sanfaçon H. Fütterer J. Hohn T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1135-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Scholthof H.B. Gowda S. Wu F.C. Shepherd R.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the 35 S RNA contains a leader with certain features that, according to the scanning model for translation initiation (11Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar), would hinder expression of an ORF fused to it. The leader is unusually long (600 nt), contains 7–9 short open reading frames (sORFs) depending on the strain, and folds into a complex stem-loop structure (12Fütterer J. Gordon K. Bonneville J.-M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2854-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A mechanism referred to as ribosome shunting has been proposed to explain how the translational machinery can overcome the barrier imposed by the CaMV 35 S RNA leader. According to this model, ribosomes together with initiation factors enter at the cap site and begin scanning in the 3′ direction. However, scanning is not linear, and at some point near the 5′-end ribosomes are transferred to a position further downstream, skipping the central region. This mechanism is not unique to CaMV; ribosome shunting has also been observed with RNAs of rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV; see Ref. 19Fütterer J. Potrykus I. Bao Y. Li L. Burns T.M. Hull R.

Nevertheless, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of shunting. Shunting in CaMV requires the simultaneous presence of regions from both ends of the leader either in cis or in trans(16Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J.-M. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The leader forms a large hairpin structure bringing the ends into close spatial proximity (14Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Steger G. Hohn T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1075-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J.-M. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We assume that this structure allows the bypass of the central inhibitory region of the leader, with the essential regions at the ends referred to as shunt donor and shunt acceptor. The alternative possibility that these regions would form an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is unlikely, since reporter gene expression in protoplasts is inhibited by the insertion of an energy-rich stem close to the cap, indicating that entry of the scanning complex at the 5′-end of the mRNA is required (17Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Until now, translation of CaMV and RTBV pre-genomic RNAs has been mainly studied in vivo by transfection of protoplasts with reporter DNA constructs. However, this experimental system has limitations, since the enzymatic activity that is finally measured is the product of transcription, RNA processing, RNA transport and translation, and modifications of the reporter plasmid can affect any or all of these processes. Also, protoplasting of plant cells and transformation of protoplasts might invoke stress reactions that alter translation mechanisms and the preference for certain mRNAs (24Gingras A. Svitkin Y.

Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar). Thus, an additional method, e.g. in vitrotranslation, is necessary to consolidate and confirm the translational models proposed for CaMV on the basis of the in vivo data. In the in vitro translation system, mRNA is the starting material, and the assay solely measures the translation process. Recently a wheat germ cell-free system has been described that allowed translation directed by the CaMV 35 S RNA leader (18Schmidt-Puchta W. Dominguez D.I. Lewetag D. Hohn T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2854-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and we have used this system to study the shunt mechanism in more detail. By testing a dicistronic construct in which the CaMV 35 S RNA leader is placed between two ORFs, we confirmed that the leader does not promote internal initiation. Translation of a reporter gene fused to the leader was performed mostly by ribosomes that followed the bypass route (shunted) but also, albeit with lower efficiency, by ribosomes that scanned through the whole region. In wheat germ the same shunt acceptor is used as in cruciferae protoplasts. Our results define a shunt donor for the first time. Furthermore, the stem section at the base of the large CaMV 35 S RNA leader stem structure (stem section 1) was defined as the important element in shunting. Together with its flanking regions, this “micro-leader” supports shunting. A short open reading frame preceding stem section 1 acts as a shunt enhancer. The cloned U1A gene has been described previously (26Simpson G.G. Clark G.P. Rothnie H.M. Boelens W. van Venrooij W. Brown J.W.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4540-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). U1A-L-CAT was prepared by subcloning theEcoRV-SphI fragment of plasmid LC20 (12Fütterer J. Gordon K. Bonneville J.-M. Sanfaçon H. Pisan B. Penswick J.R. Hohn T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8377-8390Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), containing the whole leader and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene into the SmaI-SphI sites of plasmid pU1A. Plasmids mono-CAT and L-CAT were previously described as pSPC7 and pSPLC20, respectively (18Schmidt-Puchta W. Dominguez D.I. Lewetag D. Hohn T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2854-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, L-CAT contains the SP6 promoter, the whole CaMV leader (strain S), and the CAT gene fused to the AUG of ORF VII. In mono-CAT, most of the leader was deleted except for the last 50 nucleotides starting at the ClaI site (this part does not contain any AUG codon). Lm-CAT is a plasmid with a modified version of the wild-type leader that contains restriction sites to facilitate the introduction of mutations. AnXhoI site was created by introducing two point mutations,50CTCCAT55 to50CTCGAG55 (numbering according to Ref. 16Fütterer J. Gordon K. Sanfaçon H. Bonneville J.-M. Hohn T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and an NheI site by insertion of two bases, 110GCTC113 to110GCTAGC115. An SpeI site was created at position 165 with two point mutations,164ACTTCT169 to166ACTAGT171. 20 nucleotides between the two BglII sites (position 220 to 240 of the wild-type leader) were deleted. The rest of the leader starting at this 3′-most BglII site and the CAT ORF derive from theBglII-Acc65I fragment of pSPLC20. This Lm-CAT modified leader gives about 50–60% of the expression level obtained with L-CAT in in vitrotranslation. LmF-CAT was made by replacing theClaI-NcoI fragment of Lm-CAT with an oligonucleotide carrying a deletion of A592 to create an F::CAT fusion protein. Plasmids (LAUG-free, LonlyA, LonlyF, and LonlyA-F)-CAT contain mutations in the sORF AUG codons (see Fig. 8), introduced into the leader of strain CM4–184 by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis. To create CAT and F-CAT, theXhoI-ClaI fragment of Lm-CAT and LmF-CAT, respectively, was replaced by the following oligonucleotide: 5′-TCGAGATGCTTGTATTTACCCTATATACCCTAGTAACCCCTTAT-3′ sense strand. Clones (LaTTG, LaTAG, LAs, LAB, LABs, Lnear a, Lmid a, Lfar a, Lst1, Lstrst1, Lst1-resto)-CAT were made by replacing theXhoI-NheI fragment of Lm-CAT with oligonucleotides containing the respective mutations (see Figs. 4, 5, and 7). Construct Lstrst2-CAT, in addition to the mutation in the XhoI-NheI region, contains mutations in the Eco0109-ClaI fragment (see Fig. 4). Constructs Lstrst2-CAT and Lnobif-CAT were made by replacing the NheI-BglII and theXhoI-SpeI fragments of Lm-CAT, respectively, with oligonucleotides containing the mutations (see Fig. 5). LFhp-CAT contains a stable stem-loop structure between sORFs A and B. This construct was made by replacing theXhoI-NheI fragment of LmF-CAT with the oligonucleotide 5′-TCGAGATGTGTGAGTAGTTCCCAGATAAGGGGCGCGTTCGCCTGCTTCAACAGTGCTTGGACGGGCAACGCGCAATTAGGGTTCTTATAGGGTTTCG-3′. The sequence in bold forms the stem-loop structure. The mini-leader was constructed by first replacing theBglII-ClaI fragment of Lm-CAT with the oligonucleotide 5′-GATCTAGAGGTAAAGCTTGTATTTACCCTATTTACCCTATTTACCCTAGTAACCCCTTAT-3′ (bold nucleotides indicate introduced XbaI and HindIII sites) and then by inserting the oligonucleotide 5′-CTAGAGGTAAGACGATGGAAATTTGATAGAGGTACGTTACTATACTTATACTATACGCTAAGGGAATGCTTGTAA-3′ between the XbaI and HindIII sites. In micro-leader 1, the SpeI-ClaI fragment of LmF-CAT was replaced with the oligonucleotide 5′-CTAGTGAATGGTTGTATTTACCCTATATACCCTAGTAACCCCTTAT-3′. The G in bold represents the C to G mutation introduced to create a more favorable initiation codon context for sORF F. In micro-leader 2, the NheI-SpeI fragment of micro-leader 1 was replaced with the oligonucleotide 5′-CTAGTGGGTTTCCGTCCAAGCACTGTTGAAGCAGGAAAACCCG-3′.Figure 4Importance of the 35 S RNA leader stem section 1 for ribosome shunting.

For preparation of capped transcripts, the cap analogue 7mGpppG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm (10 times higher than the GTP concentration). The RNA was purified by precipitation once with 3m lithium chloride and twice with ethanol. The integrity of the synthesized transcripts was evaluated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. RNA was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Equimolar amounts of transcripts (0.5 pmol) were translatedin vitro in a wheat germ extract prepared according to Roberts and Paterson (27Roberts B.E. Paterson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2330-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) provided with [35S]Met. In standard reactions, KAc was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. The Mg2+ concentration was 1.5 mm. The translation reaction was carried out in a final volume of 25 μl at 27 °C. After 1 h incubation, 3.5 μl of the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed for 30 min in 50% methanol, 12% acetic acid, and then dried and exposed to x-ray films. Quantification was carried out using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In previous in vivo studies of the ribosome shunt mechanism, it was difficult to demonstrate conclusively that the 35 S RNA leader does not contain an IRES. The ultimate test of whether a particular sequence can direct internal initiation of translation is to introduce it between two cistrons and demonstrate that expression of the second cistron is independent of the first (28Jackson R.J. Hunt S.L. Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 1-29PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar). However, the poly(A) site in the leader becomes fully active if it is moved further away from the transcription start site (6Sanfaçon H. Hohn T. Nature. 1990; 346: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Insertion of a coding region between the transcription initiation site and the leader would therefore lead to termination of the RNA after the first cistron in vivo. The development of a cell-free translation system in which the 35 S RNA functions to direct translation (18Schmidt-Puchta W. Dominguez D.I. Lewetag D. Hohn T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2854-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) allows the question of whether there is any internal initiation to be directly addressed. Translation of a reporter construct (U1A-L-CAT), in which the leader was placed between two ORFs (encoding the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1A and CAT, respectively), was compared with control transcripts in the wheat germ translation system. No detectable levels of CAT were produced, although U1A expression was not affected (Fig. 2). In the control construct without the upstream U1A cistron (L-CAT) but still with the leader, however, CAT was expressed with 25% efficiency compared with a short-leader construct, confirming earlier data (18Schmidt-Puchta W. Dominguez D.I. Lewetag D. Hohn T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2854-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If internal initiation would have occurred, then similar levels of CAT expression would have been expected from both constructs, U1A-L-CAT and L-CAT. This result is therefore incompatible with translation by internal initiation of the type described for picornaviruses (30Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 31Jang S.K. Kräusslich H-G. Nicklin M.J.H. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is compatible with shunting. To compare shunting quantitatively with linear scanning, we introduced a frameshift mutation into sORF F of plasmid Lm-CAT to create an F::CAT ORF fusion (construct LmF-CAT, Fig. 3 A). In the virus context, sORF F overlaps ORF VII (Fig. 1 B), and in strain S, sORF F contains an internal AUG (F′). If translation-competent ribosomes can reach the 3′-end of the leader by a scanning related process (leaky scanning, re-initiation), they encounter the two AUGs of sORF F, 91 and 64 nucleotides upstream of the AUG of ORF VII, now the AUG of CAT, producing F::CAT and F′::CAT proteins. Alternatively, translation-competent ribosomes could reach the 3′-end of the leader by shunting. Since the major shunt acceptor site is located downstream of the internal AUG codon within sORF F (17Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), translation initiation would occur at the start codon of CAT. At least 80% of total translation products derived from Lm-CAT and LmF-CAT were CAT protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). Initiation of translation in LmF-CAT occurred also at the 5′ proximal and the internal AUG codons of sORF F with a combined efficiency of ∼20%, resulting in the synthesis of F::CAT and F′::CAT proteins (lane 2). The sORF F AUG is much more efficiently recognized in the short-leader constructs, CAT and FCAT (Fig. 3 A). Translation of the CAT mRNA, which contains sORF F in wild-type configuration, resulted in the expression of F (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), whereas translation of F-CAT mRNA, with sORF F in frameshifted configuration, resulted in the expression of F::CAT protein (lane 4). The presence of the F AUG in the short-leader RNAs still allowed initiation at the CAT AUG at a level of ∼20%, probably because the suboptimal context of the F AUG (32Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33Lutcke H.A. Chow K.C. Mickel F.S. Moss K.A. Kern H.F. Scheele G.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) allows some leaky scanning. Hence, the CAT/F::CAT ratio is switched from 1:4 in the short-leader RNA (lane 4) to 4:1 in the leader-containing RNA (lane 2). These results confirm that the complete leader contains elements that support shunting and that the major shunt acceptor site is located downstream of the F′ start codon (17Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). On the other hand, they also show that despite the complexity of the leader and the presence of six other sORFs, a considerable fraction of the ribosomes reaches the sORF F and F′ start codons, probably by scanning and reinitiation or by shunting employing minor shunt donor and acceptor sites. A band migrating slower than the F::CAT fusion protein was detected upon translation of the CAT mRNA (Fig. 3, lane 3, band X). This protein was recognized by anti-CAT antibodies (not shown). Appearance of this band was only observed when significant amounts of F were produced, suggesting that it may be linked to ORF F translation, possibly via frameshifting. To exclude the possibility that initiation at the CAT AUG in the LmF-CAT RNA was accomplished by a distance-dependent reinitiation mechanism as suggested for the yeast GCN4 RNA (34Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), a strong hairpin was introduced at position 86, between sORFs A and B (LhpF-CAT; Fig. 3 A). Such hairpins have been shown to significantly inhibit the scanning process without interfering with shunting (17Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Translation of LFhp-CAT mRNA resulted in a single protein band corresponding to initiation at the CAT AUG; no initiation event was detected at the sORF F AUGs (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). This result demonstrates that the hairpin indeed inhibited linear scanning, that ribosomes that will translate F have to scan at least past position 86, and that most of those that translate CAT will have to shunt from a shunt donor located upstream of nucleotide 86. The 35 S RNA leader folds into a complex structure that can be divided into three main stem sections separated by bifurcations (Fig. 1 C, see Refs. 14Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Steger G. Hohn T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1075-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholarand 17Fütterer J. Kiss-László Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Stem section 1 constitutes the most stable portion of this structure. It consists of three base paired regions each including a stretch of three G-C pairs, which are separated by bulges and followed by a bifurcation. It is striking that the shunt donor site maps to the base of stem section 1 (or just upstream of it) and the acceptor site to a region just downstream of stem section 1. Thus, stem section 1 might function in bringing the shunt donor and acceptor sites into close spatial proximity to promote shunting (Fig. 1 C). To test this hypothesis, the base paired regions in stem section 1 were destroyed by introduction of 13 point mutations into the left arm (Lst1-CAT; Fig. 4). This resulted in a 90% reduction of translation. When the structure was restored with complementary mutations on the right arm (Lst1-resto-CAT), the original level of CAT protein was obtained. Thus, stem section 1 appears to be a key element for shunting. Since the wild-type construct and Lst1-resto-CAT behave similarly despite differences in their primary sequence, the structure of stem section 1 rather than its sequence is important. Introduction of the mutated stem section 1 into LmF-CAT to yield LFst1-CAT resulted in the synthesis of the F::CAT and F′::CAT fusion proteins at comparable or slightly higher levels than with the LmF leader, indicating that the scanning (or minor shunting) process was not much affected by this mutation (compare lanes 4 and 5 in Fig. 4 C). However, CAT expression by shunting ribosomes was again drastically reduced. Stem section 1 could be functional due to the base paired regions, the bulges, or both. Bulges might for instance be targets for interaction with proteins. To test this, the bulges were replaced by base paired regions (Lstrst1-CAT). This actually led to a slightly increased shunting efficiency (Fig. 5), showing that the bulges are not important for shunting and that the increase in base pairing in stem section 1 affects shunting positively. Furthermore, the removal of the bifurcation at the top of stem section 1 in Lnobif1-CAT also had a slight positive effect on translation efficiency (Fig. 5). Taken together these results show that shunting relates to stem section 1 stability, rather than to the primary sequence or the presence of bulges or the bifurcation. To test whether the other stem sections are also required, a “mini-leader” lacking stem section 3 was produced by deletion of nucleotides 226 (224) 2The numbering refers to our modified leader; in brackets the corresponding position in CaMV 35 S RNA leader as used by Fütterer et al.

Over the past five years, a number of small GTPases have been implicated in the signal transduction events governing cell growth and proliferation. Among the most thoroughly characterized is a small GTPase, Ras; Ras proteins function as relay switches transducing biological information from extracellular signals to the nucleus (1Willumsen B.M.

Recently, a number of other small G-proteins, in particular members of the Rho family of GTPases, were also shown to be essential for cell cycle progression (4Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N.

The activity of Ras and Rho proteins requires their attachment to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (1Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R.

This process is initiated by the covalent attachment of a hydrophobic farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups to a cysteine at the fourth position from the COOH terminus of the proteins (8Casey P.J.

Recent experiments using specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferase I and farnesyltransferase indicate that protein geranylgeranylation, not farnesylation, is required for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle in mouse fibroblasts (15Vogt A.Y.Q. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) enzymes are activated for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (16Koff A.

These data indicate a pivotal role of protein geranylgeranylation, not farnesylation, in G1/S transition, although the detailed mechanism is still unclear. This investigation was performed to gain further insights into the requirement of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate for G1/S transition in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells. We studied the following questions: When does the isoprenylation and membrane association of Ras and Rho small GTPases occur during G1/S phase progression in FRTL-5 cells? What correlation exists between growth-stimulated activation of HMG-CoA reductase and membrane association of Ras and Rho small GTPases?

Growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells that had been treated with pravastatin and incubated with GGPP liposomes (10 μm) were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for a 6-h period, starting 18 h after the addition of 6H medium and pravastatin and 2 h after adding the GGPP-containing liposomes after the 6-h labeling period. Cells were washed and the incubation continued in unlabeled 6H medium plus pravastatin and GGPP liposomes. The membrane fraction was recovered at 30 h and solubilized. Rho A was prepared by immunoprecipitation as described previously (18Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J.

In a separate experiment, growth-stimulated cells treated with pravastatin after the addition of 6H medium were incubated with liposomes containing [3H]GGPP (18.5 MBq/μmol) starting at 16 h, and membranes were recovered and processed in the same way to detect labeled geranylgeranyl in the Rho A. Prenyl group identification of Rho A was performed by the method of Farrel et al. (21Farrel F.X. Yamamoto K. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Full-length human Rho A cDNA encoding nucleotides 1–613, the entire coding region as reported by Fagan et al., 2K. P. Fagan, L. Oliveira, and S. J.

Northern analysis of Rho A was performed as described previously (24Hirai A. Kino T. Tokinaga K. Tahara K. Tamura Y. Yoshida S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Challenging quiescent FRTL-5 cells with thyrotropin, insulin, and 5% calf serum resulted in the increased of HMG-CoA reductase activity and mevalonate synthesis after about 10 h (Fig. 1 A). Activity reached a maximum at or near the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle (22 h) and returned to prestimulation levels when these cells entered the S phase (after 30 h) (Fig. 1 A). Thymidine incorporation into DNA increased after 20 h and was maximal at 36 h. Thus, growth stimulation-induced activation of HMG-CoA reductase preceded the onset of DNA synthesis. Significant elimination of p27 begins 24 h after exposure to growth stimulation, proceeds at a relatively slow rate for the next 6 h, and exponentially decreases thereafter until disappearance after 36 h (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting reveals a coincident increase of the rapidly migrating, phosphorylated form of Cdk2 as a single major 33-kDa band (Fig. 1 B), when p27 decreases toward nonmeasurable levels. The kinase activity associated with Cdk2 was increased at 24 h and maximal at 36 h (Fig. 1 B). Thus, growth stimulation-induced activation of HMG-CoA reductase coincides with the onset of p27 elimination and Cdk2 activation. Immunoblot analysis of membrane fractions for Ras and Rho A reveals that Rho A begins to disappear from the membrane 12 h after exposure to the growth stimulus (Fig. 1 C). Rho A in membranes is maximally diminished near the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle (18 h) but returns to the membranes in late G1 18–24 h after the growth stimulus started and is at near prestimulation levels by 36 h after stimulation (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the level of Ras in membrane fraction does not change throughout cell cycle progression (Fig. 1 C). Thus, growth stimulation-induced elimination of Rho A from membranes is coincident with and precedes the onset of HMG-CoA reductase activation; reappearance of Rho A in membrane fractions is coincident with the elimination of p27 and Cdk2 activation Pravastatin (1200 μm) inhibited growth-stimulated DNA synthesis and induced G1arrest in FRTL-5 cells (Table I). All of the effects of pravastatin on DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression were wholly reversed by the addition of liposomes containing 10 μm GGPP, not FPP, 16 h after growth stimulation (Table I). The presence of GGPP during the first 16 h of culture does not reverse the inhibitory effect of pravastatin (Table I). GGPP is biosynthetically derived from the single condensation of FPP and isopentenylpyrophosphate. Because isopentenylpyrophosphate could not be synthesized in pravastatin-treated cells, FPP could not be converted to GGPP. These data indicate that GGPP can rescue the pravastatin-induced G1 arrest in the absence of upstream intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis and that GGPP, not FPP, is required for G1/S transition in FRTL-5 cells.Table IRequirement of GGPP, not FPP, for thymidine incorporation into DNA and G1/S transition in FRTL-5 cellsThymidine incorporation into DNAG1/S transitiondpm% of S phase4H805 ± 1483.5 ± 0.46H37556 ± 184429.5 ± 1.36H + Pra1369 ± 2094.8 ± 0.66H + Pra + GGPP (0–16 h)1838 ± 3055.2 ± 0.96H + Pra + GGPP (16–36 h)35823 ± 206530.5 ± 1.26H + Pra + FPP (16–36 h)2251 ± 3785.1 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab Pravastatin had no effect on the growth stimulation-induced elimination of Rho A from membranes; in contrast, the reappearance of Rho A in membranes was completely blocked by the presence of pravastatin (Fig. 2 B, row 6HP versus row 6H); Rho A was detected only in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2 C, second row). The inhibitory effect of pravastatin on the reappearance of Rho A in membranes was wholly reversed by the addition of 10 μm GGPP, not FPP, when GGPP was added 16 h after stimulation (Fig. 2 B, rows 6HPG and 6HPF, respectively). As was the case for growth (Table I), the presence of GGPP during the first 16 h of culture did not reverse the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on Rho A reappearance in the membrane (data not shown). The presence of Ras in membrane fraction did not change through cell cycle progression in the presence of pravastatin, nor did GGPP and FPP affect the level of Ras in membrane fraction (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that GGPP is required for the translocation of Rho A from the cytoplasm to membranes during the progression from G1 to S phase in FRTL-5 cells but has no effect on Ras.Figure 3Analysis of Rho A mRNA levels and metabolism in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells. In A, quiescent FRTL-5 cells were incubated with 6H medium for the indicated times. Northern analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In B, the growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells treated with pravastatin and incubated with GGPP liposomes were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. In a separate experiment, cells treated with pravastatin were incubated with liposomes containing [3H]GGPP. Rho A was recovered from solubilized membrane fraction by immunoprecipitation. Fluorography of radiolabeled Rho A was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” InC, labeled Rho A, which was recovered from membrane fraction by immunoprecipitation, was delipidated. The prenyl groups were removed by methyl iodide cleavage, and the labeled lipids were separated by C18 reverse-phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The arrows indicate elution times of geraniol (GO), farnesol (FO), and geranylgeraniol (GGO), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern analysis showed that Rho A mRNA was present as a doublet as reported previously (25Olofsson B. Chardin P. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 234-321Google Scholar) and that Rho A mRNA levels did not change during G1progression (Fig. 3 A). This indicates that the growth stimulation of FRTL-5 cells had no effect on Rho A gene expression. Immunoprecipitation and fluorography of Rho A in the membrane fraction of cells pulsed with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine between 18 and 24 h after growth stimulation in the presence of pravastatin and 10 μm GGPP revealed that the Rho A present in the membrane fraction at 30 h was radiolabeled, i.e. was newly synthesized Rho A (Fig. 3 B). In a separate experiment wherein the protein was labeled by supplementation with [3H]GGPP, Rho A was radiolabeled when recovered from the membrane at 30 h (Fig. 3 B). Rho A was not radiolabeled when 10 μm cold GGPP was added to [3H]GGPP (data not shown). HPLC analysis of the lipids associated with the protein showed that the protein on the membrane in this experiment was geranylgeranylated (Fig. 3 C). This indicates that newly synthesized Rho A was geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes in the presence of GGPP. Ras and Rho small GTPases have each been shown to play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell cycle progression (1Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R.

Growth stimulation induces expression of the HMG-CoA reductase activity in various cells (13Chakrabarti R. Engleman E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12216-12222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby allowing Ras and Rho A to be activated after isoprenylation with FPP or GGPP, which are derived from mevalonate (1Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 8Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To see which of these small GTPases were playing a critical role in cell cycle progression during the growth of rat FRTL-5 cells, we compared time-dependent changes of Ras and Rho A in the membrane fraction with time dependent changes in HMG-CoA reductase activity, DNA synthesis, and the cell cycle regulating molecules, p27 and Cdk2, which control G1/S transition in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells. In this study, both Ras and Rho A were detected in membrane fraction at G0. Growth stimulation of FRTL-5 cells induced the elimination of Rho A from membranes at mid-G1, but the level of Rho A in membranes returned to prestimulation levels at late G1. In contrast, Ras remained in membrane fraction throughout the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The elimination of Rho A from membranes precedes the activation of HMG-CoA reductase and is already significant at 12 h when the reductase activation is just starting. Thus, we demonstrate that growth stimulation of FRTL-5 cells causes an elimination of Rho A from membranes, not Ras, in early G1 and that Rho A re-associates with the membrane in association with the activation of HMG-CoA reductase at mid-G1. Ras does not show such changes. Pravastatin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells blocks DNA synthesis and induces G1 arrest. The mevalonate metabolite, FPP, does not reverse this inhibitory effect of pravastatin, despite the fact that FPP is incorporated into cells as well as GGPP, as measured in cells exposed to liposomes containing either [3H]FPP or [3H]GGPP (18Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that FPP is not required for G1/S transition of FRTL-5 cells. Vogt et al.also reported that protein farnesylation is not required for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle in mouse fibroblasts (15Vogt A.Y.Q. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, Ras was detected in the membrane fraction at G0, and the level of Ras in the membrane fraction did not change during G1/S progression. Furthermore, Ras in membranes was not affected by the treatment with pravastatin and supplementation with FPP. These results suggest that the farnesylation of Ras and its translocation into membranes does not occur during G1/S progression in FRTL-5 cells. These experiments may therefore explain why FPP is not required for G1/S transition in FRTL-5 cells; however, it remains unclear when Ras is farnesylated and translocated to the membrane during cell cycle progression. In contrast to Ras, Rho A diminishes in the membrane fraction at the near mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle (18 h). It is not clear whether Rho A lost from membranes during this period is further processed or not; the degradation pathway of Rho A has not yet been determined in detail. We have, however, examined the effects of several protease inhibitors on Rho A elimination in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells. MG-115, an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, had no effect on growth-stimulated elimination of Rho A from membranes (data not shown). It therefore seems unlikely that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in growth-stimulated elimination of Rho A from membranes in FRTL-5 cells. After its elimination from membranes at the near mid-G1phase of the cell cycle, the level of Rho A in the membranes returns to prestimulation levels at late G1. Pravastatin completely blocked the reappearance of Rho A in the membrane fraction at late G1, and Rho A was detected only in the cytosolic fraction. This inhibitory effect of pravastatin on the reappearance of Rho A in the membrane was completely reversed by GGPP, when GGPP was added 16 h after stimulation (at the onset of HMG-CoA reductase activation). On the other hand, the presence of GGPP during the first 16 h of culture did not reverse the inhibitory effect of pravastatin; the requirement of GGPP for G1/S transition and DNA synthesis had the same time course dependence. Thus, the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on G1/S transition and DNA synthesis was not reversed by GGPP during the first 16 h of culture but rather by its addition and continued presence beyond 16 h. These data indicate that growth-stimulated activation of HMG-CoA reductase is closely linked to the translocation of Rho A to membranes, not Ras, and to G1/S transition in FRTL-5 cells. The membrane association of prenylated proteins has been reported to be cyclical (26Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Such cycling of prenylated proteins could be caused by proteins such as the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) that appears to extract prenylated small GTPases out of the membrane and into the cytoplasm (27Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar). Rho GDI makes a complex with the GDP-binding form of the Rho proteins and thereby inhibits the dissociation of GDP from and the subsequent binding of GTP to the Rho gene products (28Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this regulatory function of Rho GDI, Rho GDI regulates the binding of Rho A in the membranes (29Isomura M. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether GDI might be involved in growth-stimulated elimination of Rho A from membranes in FRTL-5 cells. In this report, we performed pulse label studies using [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in the presence of pravastatin and in cells supplemented with 10 μm GGPP. Pulse label experiments revealed that newly synthesized Rho A was translocated to membranes in the presence of GGPP. A separate labeling experiment using [3H]GGPP-containing liposomes showed that the protein was also labeled with [3H]GGPP; and HPLC analysis of the lipids associated with the protein showed that the protein was geranylgeranylated (data not shown). These results indicate that GGPP is required for geranylgeranylation of newly synthesized Rho A and its translocation to membranes. When pulse labeling experiments were performed, wherein the labeling preceded the initiation of the growth cycle, we could not detect significant mature Rho A (i.e.old geranylgeranylated Rho A) recycling to the membrane. Nevertheless, it cannot be concluded that some mature Rho A does recycle and that membrane association of such recycled mature Rho A is regulated by a process that requires GGPP through another mechanism. We can conclude that newly synthesized Rho A appears on the membrane but not that only newly synthesized Rho A appears on the membrane. The possibility of re-geranylgeranylation of Rho A extracted from membranes seems to be unlikely. Because geranylgeranylation by geranylgeranyltransferase I has been demonstrated to require the carboxyl-terminal CAAX box of Rho proteins, (C, cysteine, A, aliphatic amino acid; X, leucine) (6Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). After prenylation by geranylgeranyltransferase I, the three COOH-terminal amino acids (the AAX residues) are removed from Rho A (30Fujiyama A. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3362-3368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ashby M.N. King D.S. Rine J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4613-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequent to proteolysis, the prenylated cysteine residue is carboxymethylated (23Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This study shows that growth stimulation eliminates Rho A from membranes just before the activation of HMG-CoA reductase in mid-G1 phase and that the reappearance of the protein in membranes in late G1 phase is associated with p27 elimination and Cdk2 activation. GGPP promotes the geranylgeranylation and the translocation of newly synthesized Rho A to membranes. In contrast, Ras in membrane fraction dose not change through cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The difference in processing of these proteins during G1/S progression might explain the reason why GGPP, not FPP, is required for G1/S transition in FRTL-5 cells. The mechanisms underlying Rho A processing during G1/S progression, particularly the elimination of Rho A from membranes, require further investigation. We thank S. Kurakata for pravastatin, S.

https://openalex.org/W2059408123,"α1-Antichymotrypsin is an acute phase protein that protects the tissues from damage by proteolytic enzymes, but previous studies have shown that α1-antichymotrypsin within the lungs of patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema is intact but inactive as an inhibitor. Ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by blue Sepharose and DNA-Sepharose chromatography was used to isolate small amounts of intact, monomeric but inactive α1-antichymotrypsin from the plasma of 30 healthy blood donors. This species had a higher DNA binding affinity with more anodal electrophoretic mobility than native α1-antichymotrypsin and was conformationally stable against thermal denaturation, 8 m urea, and 7 mguanidinium chloride. The protein was unable to accept synthetic reactive loop peptides, and the reactive loop was resistant to proteolytic cleavage at the P5–P4 bond but could be cleaved between P1′ and P3′. These data suggest that this new α1-antichymotrypsin species was in a conformation similar to those of the crystallographically determined latent serpins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and antithrombin. α1-Antichymotrypsin from lung lavage migrated with the same electrophoretic mobility as the putative latent α1-antichymotrypsin, suggesting that this is the inactive conformation described previously in the lungs of patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This conformational transition of α1-antichymotrypsin, from an active to an inactive state, within the lung may play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease. α1-Antichymotrypsin is an acute phase protein that protects the tissues from damage by proteolytic enzymes, but previous studies have shown that α1-antichymotrypsin within the lungs of patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema is intact but inactive as an inhibitor. Ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by blue Sepharose and DNA-Sepharose chromatography was used to isolate small amounts of intact, monomeric but inactive α1-antichymotrypsin from the plasma of 30 healthy blood donors. This species had a higher DNA binding affinity with more anodal electrophoretic mobility than native α1-antichymotrypsin and was conformationally stable against thermal denaturation, 8 m urea, and 7 mguanidinium chloride. The protein was unable to accept synthetic reactive loop peptides, and the reactive loop was resistant to proteolytic cleavage at the P5–P4 bond but could be cleaved between P1′ and P3′. These data suggest that this new α1-antichymotrypsin species was in a conformation similar to those of the crystallographically determined latent serpins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and antithrombin. α1-Antichymotrypsin from lung lavage migrated with the same electrophoretic mobility as the putative latent α1-antichymotrypsin, suggesting that this is the inactive conformation described previously in the lungs of patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This conformational transition of α1-antichymotrypsin, from an active to an inactive state, within the lung may play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease. Neutrophils migrate into the lungs by chemotaxis in response to an inflammatory stimulus. They then degranulate and release destructive proteolytic enzymes, which, if uncontrolled, cause tissue destruction and lung damage (1Calverley P. Pride N. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Chapman & Hall, London1995Crossref Google Scholar). In healthy individuals, the lung is protected by proteinase inhibitors of which the most important are members of the serpin 1The abbreviations used are: serpin(s), serine proteinase inhibitor(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: serpin(s), serine proteinase inhibitor(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. superfamily typified by α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin (2Laurell C.B.

It functions by forming stable equimolar complexes with several proteinases including cathepsin G, chymotrypsin and mast cell chymases (6Travis J. Bowen J. Baugh R.

Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) revealed a dominant A β-sheet together with B and C β-sheets, eight well defined α-helices, and a mobile solvent-exposed reactive loop 2Residue numbers used for α1-antichymotrypsin in this report are counted from asparagine. Thus, the normal amino-terminal sequence for α1-antichymotrypsin is either His−2-Pro−1-Asn1-Ser2-Pro3or Asn1-Ser2-Pro3.

The mobility of the reactive loop of α1-antichymotrypsin and other inhibitory serpins is illustrated by proteolytically modified structures in which cleavage at the reactive site results in a marked and irreversible conformational change, with the N-terminal portion of the loop being completely inserted into the middle of the A-sheet as strand 4A. The once connected P1 and P1′ residues in this conformation are widely separated by approximately 70 Å (11Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 12Baumann U. Huber R. Bode W. Grosse D. Lesjak M. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In some other serpins, the intact reactive loop can also be stably incorporated into the A-sheet in the absence of proteolytic cleavage to form a latent conformation that shares high thermostability and immunological epitopes with the cleaved species (13Munch M. Heegaard C. Jensen P.H. Andreasen P.A. FEBS Letts. 1991; 295: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This conformation is the structural basis for the latency of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (14Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), and we have recently demonstrated the existence of a similar conformation in antithrombin and α1-antitrypsin (15Carrell R.W.

Initially, the term “latency” was used, since the inhibitory activity of these intact inactive serpins could be regained through a cycle of denaturation and renaturation (17Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R.

However, it is now broadly used to represent intact serpin species that are structurally similar to those of latent plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (14Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and antithrombin (15Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the latent species is unclear, but the loss of activity due to the deformation of their reactive loop would obviously damage the physiological balance between the inhibitors and their target proteinases. Over a decade ago, studies on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema suggested that the majority of α1-antichymotrypsin in the human lung is intact but inactive as an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like enzymes (22Berman G. Afford S.C. Burnett D. Stockley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14095-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cause for this has remained unclear. We report here the isolation of this unusual, inactive α1-antichymotrypsin species as a minor component of healthy human plasma. The novel α1-antichymotrypsin has high DNA binding affinity and physical properties similar to the latent form of other inhibitory serpins. This species had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of a conformation of α1-antichymotrypsin in bronchoalveolar lavage, and it provides a molecular explanation for the inactivation of α1-antichymotrypsin in chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Rabbit anti-human α1-antichymotrypsin antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). Sepharose CL-4B, blue Sepharose CL-6B, chromatography columns, and fraction collectors were from Pharmacia Biotech (St. Albans, UK). Amicon ultrafiltration YM-30 membranes, stirred cells, and Centricon-30 were from Millipore Ltd. (Watford, UK). The synthetic Ac-Ser-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Ile-Ala-OH peptide was prepared by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge on an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer (Warrington, UK). The modular mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis system was from Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd. (Hemel Hempstead, UK), the luminescence spectrometer was from Perkin-Elmer (Beaconsfield, UK), and all other reagents were from either Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, UK) or BDH Chemicals Ltd. (Bristol, UK). DNA-Sepharose resin was prepared by dissolving 0.3 g of highly polymerized DNA from calf thymus in 150 ml of distilled H2O and incubating overnight on a rotating wheel with 200 ml of packed volume of ice-cold CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 500 mm KCl, pH 8, at 4 °C. Fifteen ml of ethanolamine hydrochloride was then added to DNA-Sepharose resin, and the mixture was incubated on a rotating wheel for at least 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was then transferred to a Hartley funnel and washed with 1 liter of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, followed by 1 liter of 1 m potassium phosphate, pH 8, 1 liter of 1 m KCl, 1 liter of distilled H2O, and finally 1 liter of 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, pH 6.8, before packing into a Pharmacia XK16/40 chromatography column. The DNA-Sepharose column (70 ml of resin) was equilibrated with 300 ml of 10 mmpotassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The preparation of human α1-antichymotrypsin described here is a modification of the original method described by Travis et al. (23Travis J. Garner D. Bowen J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Travis J. Morii M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 765-771Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with all purification steps being performed at 4 °C. Two hundred-ml samples of plasma from 30 healthy blood donors were each mixed with 200 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate for 30 min and then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was pooled, and 160 g of solid ammonium sulfate per liter of supernatant was added, adjusted to pH 6.0 with concentrated H2SO4, and left to stir for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 50 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in a minimum volume of 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and dialyzed against 5 mm EDTA, pH 6.8 (3 × 5 liters) followed by 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8 (3 × 5 liters). The dialyzed solution was then applied to a blue Sepharose chromatography column (Pharmacia XK50/30 column, 900 ml of resin) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The column was washed with 30 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and α1-antichymotrypsin was eluted with 30 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.8, and confirmed by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (25Weeke B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1973; 2: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The fractions containing α1-antichymotrypsin were dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, pH 6.8, and concentrated to approximately 10 ml before loading onto the DNA-Sepharose column at 1 ml/min. α1-Antichymotrypsin was then eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient from 50–500 mmKCl. The fractions containing α1-antichymotrypsin were again identified by rocket immunoelectrophoresis and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm of EDTA, pH 6.8. α1-Antichymotrypsin concentration was determined using the Lowry protein assay, and samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. SDS-PAGE was performed using either 10% (w/v) or 7.5–15% (w/v) linear gradient acrylamide gels in 190 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.8, buffer with 0.1% (w/v) SDS (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206971) Google Scholar). All samples were heated in boiling water for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Nondenaturing PAGE was a modification of the method of Goldenberg (27Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 225-250Google Scholar) and was carried out on 7.5–15% (w/v) linear gradient gels using 53 mm Tris, 68 mm glycine, pH 8.9, as the cathode buffer and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, as the anode buffer. The 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, 7m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), pH 7.4, solutions were filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane prior to fluorescence assays. Each protein sample was incubated at 23 °C for 2 h at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with a range of denaturant concentrations between 0 and 7m GdmCl. Denaturation curves were then determined by luminescence spectrometry at a wave length of 300–360 nm with slit widths of 10 nm. The unfolded fractions were analyzed as described by Pace et al. (28Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). Transverse urea gradient gels with a 0–8m urea gradient were prepared according to the method of Goldenberg (27Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 225-250Google Scholar) and Mast et al. (29Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Forty μg of each protein sample was loaded in a single well, and electrophoresis was performed at 15 mA until the dye front reached the base of the gel. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The thermostability of both active and inactive α1-antichymotrypsin were determined by incubating the protein at 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mmpotassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, pH 6.8, at constant temperatures between 37 and 100 °C for 2 h followed by brief centrifugation and careful deceleration without braking (17Lomas D.A.

The solutions were then rapidly cooled on ice, and aliquots were removed for analysis by nondenaturing PAGE. Purified plasma α1-antichymotrypsin species or lung lavage fluid were separated by SDS-PAGE or nondenaturing PAGE and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. α1-Antichymotrypsin was detected using a rabbit anti-human α1-antichymotrypsin antibody and a second alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The immunoblots were developed using the bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate according to the method of Harlow and Lane (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 471-510Google Scholar). The activity of α1-antichymotrypsin was determined against bovine α-chymotrypsin of known active site, and kinetic parameters for the interaction with bovine α-chymotrypsin and cathepsin G were determined at 37 °C as detailed previously (31Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32Lomas D.A. Stone S.R. Llewellyn-Jones C. Keogan M.-T. Wang Z. Rubin H.

All buffers for the cathepsin G kinetics contained 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and the substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide was present at a concentration of 400 μm and 6 mmfor bovine α-chymotrypsin and cathepsin G, respectively. TheKm values for bovine α-chymotrypsin and cathepsin G with succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide were 0.087 ± 0.007 (31Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and 1.9 ± 0.23 mm, respectively (32Lomas D.A. Stone S.R. Llewellyn-Jones C. Keogan M.-T. Wang Z. Rubin H. Carrell R.W. Stockley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of active or inactive α1-antichymotrypsin was incubated at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, 50 mmNaCl, pH 7.4, with a 100-fold molar excess of the synthetic 12-mer antithrombin reactive loop peptide (Ac-SEAAASTAVVIA) at 37 °C for up to 48 h. Five μg of protein was removed at each time point, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until required. The formation of protein-peptide binary complexes was then assessed by separating the proteins on nondenaturing PAGE as described above. Cleavage of α1-antichymotrypsin by porcine pancreatic trypsin (33Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21482-21487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed at a 100:1 (w/w) ratio of serpin to enzyme in 20 mm Tris, 20 mmCaCl2, pH 8.3, for 0, 30, 60, and 90 min at 37 °C. α1-Antichymotrypsin was cleaved by Bitis arietans snake venom (33Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21482-21487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kress L.F. Hufnagel M.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 77B: 431-436Google Scholar) by incubation at a 20:1 (w/w) ratio of serpin to enzyme in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 0, 30, 60, and 90 min at 37 °C. The final concentration of α1-antichymotrypsin in each reaction was 0.2 mg/ml. At each time point, 4 μg of α1-antichymotrypsin was taken, and the cleavage reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 10 min before separating the proteins on SDS-PAGE. At the end of the cleavage reaction, an aliquot of the cleaved α1-antichymotrypsin was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Lavage samples were obtained from 10 consecutive patients undergoing bronchoscopy for investigation of bronchogenic carcinoma. One hundred ml of normal saline was instilled in 20-ml aliquots into the lung opposite of that under investigation. The fluid was aspirated and stored on ice before being filtered through cotton gauze to remove mucus and centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 10 min to remove the cell pellet. The supernatant was concentrated and then assayed by SDS-PAGE, nondenaturing PAGE, and immunoblotting to detect α1-antichymotrypsin. This study was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee, and all patients gave informed consent. α1-Antichymotrypsin was isolated from the plasma of healthy blood donors by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by blue Sepharose and DNA-Sepharose chromatography. Purification using the DNA-Sepharose column yielded less than 2 mg of protein but reproducibly (in 30 separate experiments) fractionated α1-antichymotrypsin into two peaks, denoted peak 1 and peak 2, which eluted at KCl concentrations of approximately 185 and 255 mm, respectively (Fig. 1 a). The protein yield from peak 2 was typically only 50–100 μg of protein, and multiple preparations were therefore required to fully characterize this conformation. Peak 1 eluted at a salt concentration similar to that of native α1-antichymotrypsin, and peak 2 eluted at the same point as reactive loop-cleaved α1-antichymotrypsin. The cleaved α1-antichymotrypsin control was prepared by incubating native protein with B. arietans snake venom. HPLC purification and amino-terminal sequencing of the cleavage fragments confirmed that the venom cleaved at P1′–P2′ (Ser-Ala) and P2′–P3′ (Ala-Leu) of the reactive loop and the Asn8–Leu9 bond of the amino terminus. α1-Antichymotrypsin polymers formed by heating native protein at 0.2 mg/ml at 60 °C for 2 h (Fig. 1 b) did not bind to the column, suggesting that polymerization resulted in the obfuscation of some or all of the lysine residues at positions 210–212, 391, and 396 that constitute the DNA binding domain (35Naidoo N. Cooperman B.S. Wang Z. Liu X. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14548-14555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE showed that both peak 1 and peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin species were monomeric and that peak 2 migrated more anodally than peak 1 with the same electrophoretic mobility as reactive loop-cleaved α1-antichymotrypsin (Fig. 1 b). Such a difference in electrophoretic mobility between peak 1 and peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin on nondenaturing PAGE did not result from amino-terminal heterogeneity, since both species had mixed N-terminal sequences of His−2-Pro−1-Asn1-Ser2-Pro3or Asn1-Ser2-Pro3, in keeping with the findings of others (36Morii M. Travis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 37Lindmark B. Lilja H. Alm R. Eriksson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The integrity of both peak 1 and peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin was confirmed for all preparations by SDS-PAGE in comparison with a reactive loop-cleaved control (Fig. 1 c). In no case did peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin migrate with similar electrophoretic mobility to the cleaved protein. Finally, this conformation was not an artifact of plasma storage, since similar results were also obtained with fresh, nonfrozen plasma. Active site titration showed that peak 1 α1-antichymotrypsin had a specific activity of 57–77% against bovine α-chymotrypsin, whereas the peak 2 species consistently showed <1% inhibition. Ultraviolet scans of peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin were similar to those of peak 1 protein, indicating that the loss of activity did not result from residual DNA binding from the purification protocol. Kinetic analysis of native α1-antichymotrypsin, identical to that of peak 1 but purified on a higher capacity DNA-cellulose (32Lomas D.A. Stone S.R. Llewellyn-Jones C. Keogan M.-T. Wang Z. Rubin H.

These results are similar to the values reported previously for recombinant α1-antichymotrypsin (32Lomas D.A. Stone S.R. Llewellyn-Jones C. Keogan M.-T. Wang Z. Rubin H. Carrell R.W. Stockley R.A. J.

(7Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assessment of the thermal stability of the two α1-antichymotrypsin conformations from the DNA-Sepharose column showed that peak 1 α1-antichymotrypsin formed high molecular mass polymers between 50 and 60 °C, but peak 2 and venom-cleaved α1-antichymotrypsin remained stable and monomeric at temperatures up to 100 °C (Fig. 2). Similarly, peak 1 α1-antichymotrypsin displayed the characteristic unfolding transition of the serpins (29Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with increasing concentration of urea (Fig. 3 a), whereas peak 2 and venom-cleaved α1-antichymotrypsin were resistant to unfolding in up to 8 m urea (Fig. 3, b and c). The significant difference in stability between the active peak 1 and inactive peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin was clearly evident when an equal mixture of the two conformations was assessed on the same transverse urea gradient gel (Fig. 3 d). This resistance to unfolding in high concentrations of urea, in the absence of reactive-loop cleavage, is characteristic of latent serpins (16Wardell M.R. Chang W.S.W. Bruce D. Skinner R. Lesk A.M.

One of the determinants of latency is the restoration of activity following denaturation with and refolding from GdmCl (17Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Refolding of peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin with 6 m GdmCl did not restore inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin, and fluorescence analysis was used to determine if this concentration of GdmCl unfolded the peak 2 protein. Peak 1 α1-antichymotrypsin unfolded at approximately 3m GdmCl, but peak 2 α1-antichymotrypsin was resistant to unfolding in 7 m GdmCl (Fig. 4), which explains the finding that higher concentrations of denaturant could not be used to refold and reactivate this thermostable conformation.Figure 37.5% (w/v) transverse urea gradient PAGE analysis of the unfolding of peak 1, peak 2, and reactive loop-cleaved α1-antichymotrypsin.

This membrane association has an absolute requirement for post-translational modification with isoprenoids. The mechanism by which isoprenoids participate in the specific association of p21ras with plasma membranes is the subject of this report. We present in vitro evidence for a plasma membrane binding protein for p21ras that can recognize the isoprenoid substituent and, therefore, may facilitate the localization of p21ras. Oncogenic p21ras proteins can only exert their stimulation of cellular proliferation when plasma membrane-associated. This membrane association has an absolute requirement for post-translational modification with isoprenoids. The mechanism by which isoprenoids participate in the specific association of p21ras with plasma membranes is the subject of this report. We present in vitro evidence for a plasma membrane binding protein for p21ras that can recognize the isoprenoid substituent and, therefore, may facilitate the localization of p21ras. Post-translational modification with isoprenoids results in considerable structural diversity at the carboxyl terminus of many proteins. Four such carboxyl-terminal structural motifs have been identified (for review see Ref. 1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 251-269Crossref Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). These are farnesylated-methylated cysteine, geranylgeranylated-methylated cysteine, digeranylgeranylated vicinal cysteines of the -CC rab proteins, and digeranylgeranylated residue-interrupted cysteines of the -CXC rab proteins. The carboxyl-terminal cysteine of the -CXC rabs is methylated, whereas the carboxyl-terminal cysteine of the -CC rabs is not. Since these modifications always increase the hydrophobic character of the substituted proteins, it is generally assumed that they are involved in the association of proteins so modified with lipid bilayer membranes. This assumption is supported by the observation that most prenylated proteins are bound to cellular membranes, at least under some physiological conditions. A more recent hypothesis for the function of protein prenylation that is more in keeping with the observed structural diversity and membrane specificity is that these lipid modifications also serve to mediate protein-protein interactions (2Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A well studied example of this function for protein prenylation is the heterodimeric association of rab proteins with GDP dissociation inhibitor molecules to form soluble complexes that appear to be dependent on the digeranylgeranylation of the rab proteins (3Regazzi R. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17512-17519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another recent example from our laboratory is the mechanism of endoproteolytic cleavage of the farnesylated prelamin A molecule, which is mediated by an enzyme that possesses a specific farnesyl binding site (4Kilic F. Dalton M.B. Burrell S.K. Mayer J.P. Patterson S.D. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been noted that it is possible that even membrane-associated prenylated proteins may utilize a polyisoprenoid-dependent protein-protein interaction for membrane binding (2Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recognition of the polyisoprenoid and other structural elements of the protein by membrane receptors could confer the necessary localization of particular prenylated proteins to particular subcellular compartments. Sequestration of the polyisoprenoid would be important in preventing nonspecific association of the protein with inappropriate membranes. Farnesylated proteins are found in a number of cellular compartments (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 251-269Crossref Scopus (1743) Google Scholar) including plasma membrane (p21ras, γ-transducin), peroxisomes (PxF) and nuclei (lamin B, prelamin A). For the naturally occurring forms of N, H, and K p21ras, it is clear that plasma membrane localization shows an absolute requirement for farnesylation (5Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar), yet the occurrence of farnesylated proteins in other compartments suggests the existence of some high affinity plasma membrane receptor that can recognize not only the isoprenoid but other structural features of the protein as well. Studies on site-directed mutagenic alterations of p21ras proteins are consistent with this concept and have clearly identified the hypervariable region of p21ras as a second domain that specifies its plasma membrane localization (6Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In this report we present quantitative in vitro binding studies that confirm the existence of a high affinity plasma membrane receptor for p21ras. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) (Nova-Tech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml amphotericin B. Twenty-four h before harvesting the cells for plasma membrane isolation, culture media was supplemented with 8 μg/ml lovastatin to deplete the association of endogenous p21ras with the plasma membrane. A highly enriched plasma membrane fraction from NIH3T3 cells was isolated as described (7Whittenberger B. Glaser L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 75: 2251-2255Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A protease inhibitor mix (1 mmeach of antipain, aprotinin, bestatin, chymostatin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the plasma membrane fractions that were stored at −70 °C until used. The purity of plasma membrane fraction was assessed via marker enzyme activities of 5′-nucleotidase (8Siddiqui A.A. Nizami W.A. J. Helminthol. 1985; 59: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and glucose 6-phosphatase (9Fleischer S. Kervina M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 3: 299-311Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus-expressing p21Ha-ras with a histidine tag affixed to its N terminus was a gift from Dr. Sandra L. Hoffmann (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). A BamHI/SalI fragment containing full-length coding sequence of p21Ki-ras4B and a BamHI/HindIII fragment containing full-length sequence of p21N-ras were cloned into compatible cloning sites of pBlueBacHis2 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The constructs were cotransfected with Bac-N-Blue baculovirus DNA into sf-9 cells (Invitrogen) with the aid of a cationic liposome-mediated transfection kit (Invitrogen) employed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant baculoviruses were screened for and isolated in sf-9 cells as described (10Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). A single virus clone for each of the proteins was chosen for all further experimentation. Approximately, 5 × 106 sf-9 cells (Invitrogen)/75-cm2 flask were infected (∼1 plaque-forming unit/cell) with recombinant baculoviruses derived from p21Ha-ras, p21Ki-ras, and p21N-ras constructs, respectively. The infected cells were grown in complete TNM-FH media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 μg/ml gentamicin at 27 °C for 48 h. The infected sf-9 cells were collected by centrifugation and after several washings with PBS, 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). were processed for membrane and cytoplasmic fractions isolation (11Page M.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both cytoplasmic- and membrane-associated forms of recombinant p21Ha-ras and membrane-associated forms of p21Ki-ras and p21N-ras were purified via metal affinity chromatography Xpress System (Invitrogen) and imidazole elution (50–75 mm). Recombinant baculovirus-expressing CVLL-p21Ha-ras was a gift from (Dr. Paul Kirschmeier, Schering-Plow Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ). sf-9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus-expressing CVLL-p21Ha-ras as above, and the resultant protein was purified as described (10Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). A highly purified preparation of lamin B was obtained from rat liver using published procedures (13Georgatos S.D. Blobel G. J. Cell. Biol. 1987; 105: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recombinant p21Ha-ras derived from the membrane fraction of infected sf-9 cells was tagged with 125I (NEN Life Science Products/Dupont) in the presence of Iodo-Beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unbound 125I was removed via dialysis. Aliquots of plasma membranes (100 μg of protein) were incubated with varying concentrations of 125I-p21Ha-ras (5–150 nm) with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled p21Ha-ras in a total volume of 100 μl. The incubation medium consisted of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mmMgCl2, 30 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.8% Triton X-100. The binding of the radioactive ligand was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 25 °C. Incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS containing 0.8% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The unbound radioactivity was removed via filtration of the reaction mixture through Whatman glass microfiber filters. The filters were washed >6 times with PBS containing 0.8% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and air-dried, and radioactivity was counted in a gamma counter. A time course experiment for binding was performed for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min, utilizing the optimal conditions outlined above. Saturation of the binding was observed after 45 min, and therefore all experiments were conducted for 1 h. To determine reversibility of binding, matched samples of plasma membranes (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 125I-p21Ha-ras (125 nm), and the binding of the radioactive ligand was allowed to proceed at 25 °C. After a 1-h incubation, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled p21Ha-ras was added to one set of samples, and incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Incubations were then terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS containing 0.8% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the difference between the membrane-bound counts in the presence and absence of excess unlabeled p21Ha-ras was determined. To study the effect of different competitors (non-farnesylated p21Ha-ras, bovine serum albumin, p21N-ras p21Ki-ras, CVLL-p21Ha-ras, rat liver lamin B, LLGNSSPRTQSPQNCfarnesyl, and N-acetyl farnesyl methyl cysteine) on binding of iodinated p21Ha-ras to plasma membranes, varying concentrations (5 nm to 5 μm) of competitors were added with125I-p21Ha-ras (50 nm) under binding conditions outlined above. Nonlinear regression analysis of saturation binding and competitive inhibition data were performed with SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Scatchard plot analysis and calculations of IC50 values were performed as described (14Bylund D.B. Yamamura H.I. Yamamura H.I. Enna S.J. Kuhar M.J. Methods in Neurotransmitter Receptor Analysis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 1-35Google Scholar) with the linear regression performed with Sigma Plot. To evaluate whether the binding of p21Ha-ras to plasma membrane is dependent on p21Ha-ras being bound to GTP or GDP, the binding studies were carried out in the presence of 30 μmGDP or 25 μm GTPγS (Biomol) under the conditions outlined for binding of 125I-labeled p21Ha-ras to NIH3T3 plasma membranes above. These concentrations of unbound ligand are approximately 1,000-fold excess to the concentration of GDP-loaded p21Ha-ras, which gives half-maximal binding to plasma membranes. Binding reaction mixes were preincubated at 37 °C for 100 min in the absence of membranes to allow nucleotide exchange to occur (15Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and transferred to a 25 °C water bath, and the binding reaction was initiated by the addition of membranes. Ligand blots were performed by a previously described method (16Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 138-153Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Approximately 25 μg of NIH3T3 plasma membrane proteins were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated in PBS containing 0.3% Tween, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 125I-p21Ha-ras (50 nm) with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled p21Ha-ras with constant shaking at 25 °C. After an 18-h incubation, blots were washed (>5 times) with PBS containing 0.3% Tween and 0.5% Triton X-100, air-dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. To determine if the binding of iodinated p21Ha-ras is to the protein component(s) of the plasma membrane, NIH3T3 plasma membranes were pretreated with trypsin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of protease inhibitor mix. For control experiments, trypsin was inactivated with protease inhibitor mix and then added to the binding reaction mixture. For other series of experiments, plasma membrane proteins were also inactivated by incubation at 100 °C for 5 min. The binding studies were carried out exactly as above. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA method (Pierce). N-Acetyl farnesyl methyl cysteine was prepared by acid-catalyzed methylation of commercialN-acetyl farnesyl cysteine (Calbiochem) as described previously (17Tan E.W. Perez-Sala D. Canada F. Rando R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10719-10722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of the radiolabeled isoprenoid group of baculovirus-generated p21Ha-ras was done after Raney nickel cleavage of immunoprecipitated [3H]mevalonate-labeled protein, as described previously (18Khosravi-Far R. Clark G.J. Abe K. Cox A.D. McLain T. Lutz R.J. Sinensky M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24363-24368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Farnesylated, geranylgeranylated, and nonprenylated p21Ha-ras proteins were synthesized in the baculovirus insect cell expression system, and the proteins were purified to homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 1). All of the baculovirus-generated p21Ha-ras proteins showed immunoreactivity with Y13–259 antibody in Western blots (data not shown). Synthesis of protein in the presence of [3H]mevalonate followed by immunoprecipitation gave rise to labeled material from membranes. This material was analyzed for farnesylation by Raney nickel cleavage followed by radiolabeled gas-liquid chromatography and radiodetection (Fig. 2) as described previously (18Khosravi-Far R.

These results further demonstrate that we have prepared bona-fide p21Ha-ras in sf-9 insect cells, as has also been reported elsewhere (11Page M.J. Hall A. Rhodes S. Skinner R.H. Murphy V. Sydenham M.

Infected cells were incubated at room temperature overnight with [3H]mevalonolactone (200 μCi/ml) in the presence of 25 μm lovastatin. Labeled p21Ha-ras derived from the membrane fraction of infected sf-9 cells was treated with Raney nickel to release the isoprenoid moiety, which was then analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography and radiodetection (B). The peaks for p21Ha-ras were identified by comparison of retention time values with the ones generated from Raney nickel-treated synthetic farnesyl (peak 1) and geranylgeranyl cysteine methyl esters (peak 2) (A). Recombinant p21Ha-ras released only the farnesyl group (A, peak 1).

An enriched plasma membrane fraction from lovastatin-treated NIH3T3 cells was prepared by means of discontinuous Ficoll and sucrose density gradients. Marker enzyme analysis of the plasma membrane fraction showed that the specific activity of 5′-nucleotidase was 12.5-fold enriched in this fraction compared with the initial homogenate. Based on glucose-6-phosphatase activity, the cross-contamination of the plasma membrane fraction with microsomes was approximately 11%. We examined the kinetics of binding of the purified,125I-p21Ha-ras to the NIH3T3 plasma membranes, subtracting out nonspecific binding estimated from the binding in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand. The results (Fig. 3) are consistent with a saturable binding site for p21Ha-ras, presumably a receptor protein. At saturation, approximately 53% of the total binding was specific binding of 125I-p21Ha-ras to the NIH3T3 plasma membranes. Scatchard analysis of the specific ligand binding data (Fig. 3, inset) using a one-site model yielded an estimatedKd and B max values of 24.4 ± 5.3 nm (mean ± S.D.) and 137.3 ± 27.1 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. To determine if the binding is reversible under these conditions, 125I-p21Ha-ras was allowed to bind with plasma membranes to saturation, and then a 100-fold excess of unlabeled p21Ha-ras was added to the assay mixture. After 1 h, nearly half of the counts had been displaced from the membranes, consistent with reversible association of the ligand with the binding site. We also examined the effect of the GTP loading on the membrane binding. To do this, binding was assayed with p21Ha-ras loaded with GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue. The GTPγS-loaded p21Ha-ras binding exhibited negative cooperativity, with ann value of 0.0342 (Fig. 4). To verify the protein nature of this putative receptor, we examined the effect of treatment of the plasma membranes with heat or trypsin on the binding activity. Treatment of plasma membranes with either heat or trypsin significantly decreased 125I-p21Ha-ras binding (Fig. 5). These results clearly demonstrate that the preferential association of p21Ha-ras with plasma membranes is due to a nonlipid component, i.e. a protein. Comparison of binding activities of the different membrane fractions from the gradient also confirmed that the putative receptor for p21Ha-ras co-purified with the plasma membrane-enriched fraction (Fig. 5). The saturation binding assay described above provides a method for quantitatively determining the effect of the farnesyl group on binding of p21Ha-ras to its receptor in plasma membranes. We performed competitive inhibition studies with baculovirus-generated nonfarnesylated cytosolic p21Ha-ras. The cytosolic protein has been shown to be concentrated in the aqueous layer after Triton X-114 partitioning and, hence, to be nonlipidated. We confirmed this for our preparations of the cytosolic protein by demonstrating that this material could be farnesylated by reticulocyte lysates in vitro (data not shown). We could not obtain any inhibition of farnesylated p21Ha-ras by the nonfarnesylated protein at concentrations as much as 1,000-fold higher than the farnesylated ligand (Fig. 6). On the other hand, unlabeled, fully processed N, H, or K p21ras prepared from sf-9 cells were all efficient competitive inhibitors. The farnesylation requirement for receptor binding is indicative of recognition of the polyisoprenoid group. To examine this point further, we synthesized N-acetyl-S-farnesyl methyl cysteine, an analogue of the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residue of the p21ras proteins. This compound is a weak competitive inhibitor of p21Ha-ras binding to the receptor (Table I). Competitive inhibition was also observed with another farnesylated protein, lamin B, and with anS-farnesyl cysteine methyl ester peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acid residues of prelamin A (Table I). These results indicate that although the receptor recognizes the polyisoprenoid moiety, binding is also mediated by another domain on the p21ras protein.Table ICompetitive inhibition of p21Ha-ras binding to plasma membranesCompetitorIC50Kd orKi (mean ± S.E.)nmUnlabeled farnesylated p21Ha-ras61.627.7 ± 3.4p21Ki-ras106.447.9 ± 7.3p21N-ras135.561.1 ± 8.2CVLL-p21Ha-ras162.673.2 ± 8.9Lamin B183.682.8 ± 13.3N-acetyl farnesyl methyl cysteine379.4171.0 ± 23.2LLGNSSPRTQSPQNCfarnesyl545.7246.0 ± 38.7Nonfarnesylated p21Ha-rasNo competitionBovine serum albuminNo competition Open table in a new tab It has been reported that transfection of 3T3 cells with geranylgeranylated p21Ha-ras (CAAX = CVLL) results in a membrane-associated protein that is transforming when oncogenic but inhibits cellular growth p21Ha-ras when wild type (22Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2605-2615Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that this observation might reflect some difference in the interaction of this reported (22Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2605-2615Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar) geranylgeranylated protein and the wild-type farnesylated protein with the receptor. Competitive inhibition studies with this CVLL mutant of p21Ha-ras, previously shown to be geranylgeranylated and to produce growth inhibition, were performed. The results (Fig. 6) indicate that the, presumably, geranylgeranylated p21Ha-ras has an affinity for the receptor that is comparable to that of the wild-type p21ras proteins. These results suggest that the p21ras receptor does not exhibit a strong discrimination between farnesyl and geranylgeranyl substituents. Another technique that can visualize a membrane-associated receptor is ligand blotting (16Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 138-153Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In this technique, association of a radioiodinated ligand with its receptor can be demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of the membrane proteins, their transfer to nitrocellulose filters, and incubation of the filters with ligand. We applied this method to the p21Ha-ras receptor. The results (Fig. 7) indicate two bands that appear to be specifically labeled by 125I-p21Ha-ras at 45 and 35 kDa (lane 1); this binding was almost completely eliminated in the presence of a 100-fold excess of noniodinated farnesylated p21Ha-ras (lane 2). The binding of125I-p21Ha-ras with 45 and 35 kDa polypeptides in ligand blots was not affected in the presence of a 100-fold excess of nonfarnesylated cytosolic p21Ha-ras (Fig. 7, lane 3). Binding also was seen to be reduced by doing the blots in the presence of 5 μm N-acetyl farnesyl methyl cysteine (Fig. 7, lane 4). These results for the proteins visualized by ligand blot are consistent with the quantitative competitive inhibition of binding seen in Table I. The binding proteins (45 and 35 kDa) almost exclusively partitioned into the detergent phase with Triton X-114 (data not shown), which is consistent with their being intrinsic membrane proteins. Plasma membrane localization of p21ras has been shown to be critical for both normal and oncogenic signaling activities of these proteins (23Lowy D.R. Williamson B.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Elegant mutant expression studies on recombinant p21ras have demonstrated the structural requirements for N, H, and K p21ras protein localization to cell plasma membranes (5Hancock J.F. Magee A.I.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane association of p21Ha-ras or p21N-ras requires post-translational modification of the protein by two alkyl groups (24Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. Macdonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The expression studies indicate that post-translational modification by acylation (palmitoylation at Cys-181 or Cys-185 or N-terminal myristoylation) and/or prenylation (farnesylation or geranylgeranylation) produces at least some association of the dialkylated protein with plasma membranes. Mutants of p21Ha-ras that only undergo farnesylation do not exhibit plasma membrane association of p21ras as detected by immunofluorescence. The carboxyl terminus of p21Ha-ras thus possesses a dialkyl structure that appears to be required for its plasma membrane binding. It has been noted (24Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. Macdonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that the close proximity of the N terminus and C terminus of p21ras would cause myristoylated and carboxyl-terminal-monolipidated p21ras to present a structure comparable to that of the wild-type protein. The recognition site for this structure in the plasma membrane has been hypothesized to be a receptor or docking protein that mediates assembly of p21ras into the membrane where it is stabilized by nonspecific lipid-lipid interactions. The studies reported here, confirm and extend these ideas. Based on the amount of protein per cell (∼1 mg/107 cells) and the fraction of total cellular protein found in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction (∼5%) used in our binding studies, we estimate that there are approximately 5 × 105p21ras receptors/cell. This can be compared with the ∼5 × 105 sites/cell reported for transmembrane-bridging mitogenic peptide receptors such as those for platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (25Pfenning M.A. Richelson E. Yamamura H.I. Enna S.J. Kuhar M.J. Methods in Neurotransmitter Receptor Analysis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 156Google Scholar), which are believed to transduce growth signals through p21ras. If nothing else, this number suggests that the total number of such receptors is relatively small and, therefore, inconsistent with being a lipid or a ubiquitous membrane protein. The Kd (25 nm) we observe for p21Ha-ras binding can be compared with that seen for another farnesylation-dependent protein-protein interaction of p21ras. In vitro binding of p21Ki-ras(4B) to human SOS1 has been shown to be absolutely dependent on farnesylation and exhibits 50% saturation at 200 nm (26Porfiri E. Evans T. Chardin P. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 22672-22677Google Scholar). In this comparison, the farnesylation-dependent binding we have observed appears to be at relatively high affinity. The ligand blot data we report are also consistent with a farnesyl group-dependent binding site for p21ras in plasma membranes. Other p21ras binding activities, with the exception of the cytosolic hSOS1 protein noted above, do not exhibit such a requirement for farnesylation. For example, it has been reported (27Song K.S. Li S. Okamato T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) that the 21–24-kDa protein caveolin has p21Ha-ras binding activity. Caveolin was shown not to have an absolute requirement for farnesylation of p21Ha-ras to bind it, whereas our binding activity does. We also tested our ligand blots with parallel immunoblots with anti-caveolin and did not find co-migration of caveolin with p21Ha-ras binding activity (data not shown). We have recently reported a kinetic analysis (4Kilic F. Dalton M.B. Burrell S.K. Mayer J.P. Patterson S.D. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) of the prelamin A endoprotease that demonstrates that this enzyme functions through specific binding of the farnesyl group of prelamin A as well as another domain on that protein. The studies reported here are consistent with an analogous p21ras receptor that recognizes the lipid moiety but, based on the weak competition for binding of N-acetyl farnesyl cysteine methyl ester (which is also detectable in the ligand blots) and the prelamin A peptide, recognizes other structural features of p21ras as well. A plasma membrane receptor for p21ras that recognizes the protein at least in part through its isoprenoid substituent is, as noted above, consistent with a large body of literature regarding the effect of site-directed mutations on p21ras localization to the plasma membrane. There are, however, at least two functional interpretations of such a binding protein. Hancock and co-workers (24Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. Macdonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), have suggested that H and N p21ras assemble into plasma membranes through initial recognition of two alkyl groups by a docking protein. The bound protein is then unloaded into the membrane bilayer where it is stabilized by hydrophobic interaction of the alkyl groups with the lipid bilayer. The binding activity we have identified is certainly consistent with this hypothesis. A second possibility is that the p21ras receptor represents a terminal destination for p21ras. It should be noted in this regard that theKd for the p21ras receptor is much lower than that reported (28Ghomaschi F. Zhang X. Liu L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 11910-11918Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) for binding of the alkylated carboxymethylated model p21Ki-ras4B peptide (Kd = 480 nm) to lipid vesicles, and therefore p21ras receptors could be occupied even though surrounded by lipid bilayer. It is also possible that both the p21ras receptor and the lipid bilayer are terminal destinations for p21ras but mediate different functions. The reversibility of binding of the farnesylated p21Ha-ras as well as the negatively cooperative binding kinetics observed with GDP and GTPγS-loaded p21Ha-ras is consistent with the possibility that the association of p21Ha-ras with the plasma membrane may be regulated. The sigmoidal kinetics observed when the p21Ha-ras is GTP-loaded suggests that the receptor may exist as a homodimer in the membrane. In this regard, it is of interest to note that a pool of farnesylated cytosolic p21ras has been reported to exist in 3T3-L1 cells (29Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27585-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We thank Drs. Paul Kirschmeier and Adrienne Cox for helpful advice and constructive criticism.

Translational recovery was associated with the induction of ER chaperones and resistance to translational inhibition by Ca2+-mobilizing agents.

This control involves coupling of the rates of mRNA translation to those of protein translocation into the organelle for subsequent processing or folding. Depletion of ER sequestered Ca2+ to slow glycoprotein processing and transport competence, or introduction of a reducing environment to suppress ER processing of proteins with disulfide cross-links, results in the activation of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, the phosphorylation of eIF2α, the inhibition of eIF2B, and the slowing of translational initiation (2Prostko C.R.

An adaptive response, characterized by translational accommodation to continued depletion of ER Ca2+ stores by drugs such as ionomycin or thapsigargin or to the continued presence of a thiol-reducing agent, occurs over several hours. This adaptive response is dependent on increased expression of the ER resident chaperone, GRP78/BiP (1Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 4Brostrom C.O. Prostko C.R. Kaufman R.J. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol.

Inductions of this chaperone and of recovery from translational inhibition depend on activation of grp78 transcription and, in some cell types, a growth-promoting factor. The acute suppression of translational initiation by agents that inhibit ER protein processing, the induction of the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94, and the recovery of translational activity are characteristic of the “ER stress response” (1Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9Lee A.S. Curr. Opin.

Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1994; 4: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Translational suppression, however, is not required for expression of the later events. Both GRP78 and translational tolerance can be induced by Ca2+-mobilizing or thiol-reducing agents at concentrations that do not suppress protein synthesis (7Brostrom M.A. Prostko C.R. Gmitter D. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4127-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of translational suppression by conditions provoking the ER stress response is unclear. However, Ca2+-mobilizing hormones, including epinephrine, angiotensin, and vasopressin, have been found to slow protein synthesis over several minutes in isolated hepatocytes (11Brostrom C.O. Bocckino S.B. Brostrom M.A. Galuska E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 104-111PubMed Google Scholar, 12Menaya J. Parrilla R. Ayuso M.S. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16794-16798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitions were reduced during incubations in Ca2+-depleted media and overturned at supraphysiologic Ca2+ concentrations (11Brostrom C.O. Bocckino S.B. Brostrom M.A. Galuska E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 104-111PubMed Google Scholar). Corresponding reductions were observed in the polysomal contents of excised portions of perfused rat liver in response to hormones and manipulations of the Ca2+ content of the perfusing medium (14Chin K.-V. Cade C. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was proposed that hormonally induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis provide a mechanism for regulating the rate of protein synthesis in normal hepatocytes. Given the transient viability and low synthetic rates of dispersed hepatocytes and the technical limitations associated with perfused rat liver, it has not been possible to correlate translational rates with changes in cell-associated Ca2+ or eIF2α phosphorylation, to examine the reversibility of hormonally imposed inhibitions, or to ascertain whether an adaptive response occurs during continuous hormonal treatments. Although cultured cells are better suited to such studies, cell lines exhibiting translational suppression in response to hormones that mobilize Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol have not been identified. We now report that H9c2 ventricular myocytes respond to drugs that deplete the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (S(E)R) of Ca2+ and to physiologic concentrations of arginine vasopressin with a rapid inhibition of mRNA translation at initiation. Inhibitions are coupled to the mobilization of cell-associated Ca2+ and to the phosphorylation of eIF2α. Ionomycin and thapsigargin produced relatively stringent degrees of Ca2+ mobilization in which translational recovery was associated with the induction of ER chaperones. Translational recovery from inhibition by vasopressin did not involve an ER stress response but derived instead from the partial repletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Inhibition of protein synthesis by vasopressin became refractory to hormonal washout within 10 min of treatment. These findings support the validity of hormonally mediated regulation of mRNA translation involving mobilization of Ca2+ sequestered within the S(E)R in ventricular myocytes. H9c2(2–1) rat embryonic ventricular myocytes were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection at passage number 12. Arginine vasopressin, lysine vasopressin, desmopressin, endothelin-1, angiotensin II, phenylephrine, caffeine, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. Ionomycin and thapsigargin were from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibody to eIF2α was the gift of Dr. Lynn O'Brien, University of Rochester. Ampholines were purchased from Galliard-Schlesinger (pH 4–8) and from Oxford Glycosystems (pH 3.5–10).l-[4,5-3H]Leucine was purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc., and [45Ca+2]CaCl2 was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Stock H9c2 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and subcultured before confluence. For experiments, monolayers were allowed to reach confluence after which cultures were maintained for 1 day in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum to promote differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes (15Schopf G.

Before treatments, cells were equilibrated for 5–15 min with serum-free Ham's F-10 medium modified to contain 25 mm leucine and 0.2 mmCa2+. Leucine pulse incorporation was measured as described previously (16Brostrom C.O. Bocckino S.B. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol.

[35S]Methionine labeling, one-dimensional 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of detergent-solubilized extracts of methionine-labeled cells, and autoradiography were conducted as described previously (17Wong W.L.

Cells in 12-well (4.8 cm2/well) plates were pre-equilibrated for 2 h in 1 ml of modified F-10 medium containing 0.2 mm Ca2+and 45CaCl2 (0.02 Ci/mmol) before treatments. After treatments, monolayers were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold buffered saline containing 2.5 mm LaCl3, dissolved in 500 μl of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and analyzed for radioactivity. 45Ca2+ in combination with 5 mm EGTA was added to non-equilibrated samples and the preparations washed and solubilized immediately to assess the contribution of extracellular 45Ca2+. These values (3% of experimental values) were subtracted from experimental values. Results, presented in nanomoles of cell-associated Ca2+/mg of protein, are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of values obtained for triplicate incubation samples. Findings were reproduced on at least two separate occasions. Duplicate monolayers (2.4 cm2) of multiwell trays were lysed at 40 °C in 200 μl of sample buffer containing 3% ampholines (4 parts pH 4–8 and 1 part pH 3–10), 0.4% Tween 20, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 9.5 m urea. Lysates were then subjected to slab gel isoelectric focusing in the presence of 9.5m urea as described (19Scorsone K.A. Panniers R. Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol.

Gels were treated with 1 m Tris, pH 8.8, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes under basic conditions. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated eIF2α were immunodetected with monoclonal antibody to eIF2 and chemiluminescence as described previously (5Prostko C.R. Brostrom M.A. Malara E.M. Brostrom C.O.

Similar inhibitions were observed in H9c2 myocytes exposed for 30 min to agents that release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or ER (Table I). The divalent cation ionophore, ionomycin, inhibited leucine incorporation and mobilized cell-associated Ca2+, with larger effects observed at 25 as compared with 5 nm drug. Thapsigargin (1 μm), an irreversible inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake by the S(E)R, mobilized 75% of cell-associated Ca2+ while inhibiting protein synthesis by 93%. Caffeine (5 mm), which releases Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac muscle (20Rakovic S. Galione A. Ashamu G. Potter B.V.L. Terrar D.A. Curr.

Phenylephrine (10 μm) and epinephrine (data not shown) elicited marginal responses, whereas angiotensin II and endothelin-1 were ineffective. Arginine vasopressin (1 μm), however, mobilized approximately two thirds of the total cell-associated Ca2+ and suppressed protein synthesis by 45%. Inhibitions of protein synthesis in the range of 35–40% occurred at quite low arginine vasopressin concentrations (10 nm), maximized to slightly higher values (≃50%) at 0.1–1 μm hormone, and were attributable to an interaction at the V1 vascular receptor (Fig. 1). Lysine vasopressin, a slightly less potent agonist selective for the V1 vascular receptor, elicited similar degrees of inhibition at 0.01–10 μm, whereas desmopressin, a long acting synthetic agonist selective for the V2 renal receptor, at identical concentrations did not affect leucine incorporation.Table IEffects of various Ca2+-mobilizing agents on leucine incorporation and cellular Ca2+ contentsAgentLeucine incorporationCell-associated Ca2+nmol/mg proteinnmol/mg proteinControl3.56 ± 0.185.77 ± 0.39Ionomycin (5 nm)2.86 ± 0.193.55 ± 0.22Ionomycin (25 nm)1.85 ± 0.101.89 ± 0.08Thapsigargin (1 μm)0.26 ± 0.041.42 ± 0.07Caffeine (5 mm)2.18 ± 0.023.11 ± 0.06Arginine vasopressin (1 μm)2.00 ± 0.162.06 ± 0.05Angiotensin II (1 μm)3.40 ± 0.065.34 ± 0.00Endothelin-1 (10 nm)3.49 ± 0.155.73 ± 0.06Phenylephrine (10 μm)3.27 ± 0.024.75 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab The inhibition of leucine incorporation in H9c2 cells that developed in response to the mobilization of sequestered Ca2+ was readily reversed by restoration of the cation to the extracellular medium (Fig. 2).

Chem. 1992; 267: 3932-3939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and equilibrated in medium containing 1 mm EGTA and graded increases in Ca2+. At Ca2+ concentrations in the physiological range (1 mm in excess of EGTA), leucine incorporation was stimulated approximately 8–10-fold. Activation of the V1 vascular receptor has been established to signal an increase in [Ca2+]i, which is dependent, in part, on the release of ER sequestered cation to the cytosol by inositol trisphosphate (27Thibonnier M. Regul. Pept. 1992; 38: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence of the vasopressin inhibition of protein synthesis was examined as a function of increasing extracellular concentrations of the cation (Fig. 2). Vasopressin had no effect on leucine incorporation at low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations but reduced incorporation at 1 mm free cation by half. Supraphysiologic (2–3 mm) extracellular Ca2+ concentrations did not reverse the inhibition attributable to vasopressin. The time dependence of the inhibition of protein synthesis by vasopressin was determined for cells incubated for 2 h with 0.2 mm Ca2+, which is sufficient to maintain rates of leucine incorporation in untreated cells (Fig. 3). Within 20–30 min of hormone addition, maximal inhibition of leucine incorporation was observed. Thereafter, pulse incorporation rates were found to rise, with full recovery of activity observed at 2 h. The addition of EGTA in excess of Ca2+ produced declining pulse incorporation rates that plateaued at 50% of control values from 1–2 h. Vasopressin added in combination with the chelator provoked larger inhibitions of leucine incorporation (67% at 30 min), which were sustained through 2 h of incubation. Activation of phospholipase C in response to occupation of V1 vascular receptors is associated with the intracellular generation of both inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (27Thibonnier M. Regul. Pept. 1992; 38: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The potential involvement of protein kinase C in translational regulation by vasopressin was therefore explored utilizing PMA as an activator of the enzyme. In control experiments, exposure of H9c2 cells to PMA for up to 30 min did not affect either leucine incorporation or cell-associated Ca2+ (data not shown). By 45 min, however, leucine incorporation tended to rise modestly. The effects of vasopressin on leucine incorporation were examined in cells that had been either pretreated for 15 min with 1 μm PMA or carried as untreated controls (Table II). PMA pretreatment was found to abolish the inhibition of leucine incorporation that occurred in untreated cells in response to the subsequent addition of vasopressin. PMA also fully reversed (within 5 min) pre-existing inhibitions of leucine incorporation attributable to vasopressin (data not shown). In contrast, suppression of leucine incorporation occurring in H9c2 cells treated with ionomycin, thapsigargin, sodium arsenite, or dithiothreitol or with heat shock (43 °C for 20 min), was neither prevented nor reversed by PMA (data not shown). Ca2+ mobilization in response to vasopressin was reduced, but not abolished, by PMA (Table II). Vasopressin mobilized approximately 37% of cell-associated Ca2+ in PMA-pretreated cells as compared with 50% release in non-treated cells; this degree of mobilization was completed within 10 min.Table IILeucine incorporation and cell-associated Ca2+ at various times of treatment with arginine vasopressin in the absence and presence of phorbol myristate acetateTime with AVPLeucine incorporationCell-associated Ca2+−PMA+PMA−PMA+PMAminnmol/mg proteinnmol/mg protein03.78 ± 0.114.68 ± 0.07102.93 ± 0.013.77 ± 0.182.29 ± 0.042.96 ± 0.05202.87 ± 0.093.66 ± 0.042.28 ± 0.042.95 ± 0.09302.69 ± 0.064.61 ± 0.052.27 ± 0.072.96 ± 0.00 Open table in a new tab Chronic exposure to phorbol ester was also employed to investigate the effects of protein kinase C down-regulation on vasopressin signaling. Conditions were chosen that are reported to produce down-regulation of the kinase in neonatal cardiomyocytes (28Johnson J.A. Adak S. Mochly-Rosen D. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). H9c2 cells were pretreated for 16 h in complete growth medium with or without the addition of PMA. The time dependence of vasopressin inhibition of protein synthesis was then examined (Fig. 4). Non-pretreated preparations responded to hormone with a rapid suppression of protein synthesis that maximized at 20 min. Thereafter, pulse incorporation rates increased such that the 2-h values exceeded those of untreated controls. In preparations exposed chronically to PMA, vasopressin evoked larger (80%) inhibitions of leucine incorporation that were sustained for 40 min. Protein synthesis in these preparations recovered from inhibition by the hormone slowly, with only partial restoration of incorporation rates observed at 2 h. The protein kinase C inhibitors, calphostin C and chelerythrine, were tested in H9c2 cells at concentrations reported to inhibit the enzyme in vivo (29Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 30Jarvis W.D. Turner A.J. Povirk L.F. Traylor R.S. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1707-1714PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these agents produced inhibition of leucine incorporation and the release of cell-associated Ca2+ within 30 min by indeterminant mechanisms (data not shown). The polyribosomal contents of H9c2 cells were examined after treatments with thapsigargin, vasopressin, PMA, and PMA in combination with vasopressin (Fig. 5). As anticipated, polysomes almost completely disappeared in response to thapsigargin, which slows initiation relative to peptide chain elongation in non-muscle cells (17Wong W.L. Brostrom M.A. Kuznetsov G. Gmitter-Yellen D. Brostrom C.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Vasopressin also reduced polysomal content, but not as dramatically as thapsigargin. Polyribosomes were preserved in incubations with PMA alone, and polysome disaggregation in response to vasopressin was reduced after brief pretreatment with the phorbol ester. To correct for potential differences in loading of gradients, the amounts of 80 S monosomes, small polysomes, and large polysomes were quantitated by absorbance at 254 nm and related to each other. For each treatment condition, the ratio of 80 S monosome:small polysome:large polysome was determined to be: control preparation, 30:10:10; thapsigargin, 67:3:0; vasopressin, 45:11:9; PMA, 24:10:10; PMA + vasopressin, 35:12:12. By this analysis, vasopressin caused 80 S monosomes to increase and polysomes to decrease, typical of a slowing of initiation. Large polysomes were reduced preferentially. By contrast, PMA, which stimulates amino acid incorporation, caused polysomes to accumulate at the expense of 80 S monosomes, consistent with increased rates of initiation. Effects of vasopressin were largely overturned by PMA, such that ribosomal profiles under this condition were similar to those of controls. Thapsigargin produced almost complete initiation blockade. Suppression of translational initiation in non-muscle cells in response to drugs that deplete ER Ca2+ stores is attributable to the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 by double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (1Brostrom C.O.

The phosphorylated form of eIF2α is known to inhibit the GTP/GDP exchange factor, eIF2B, thereby preventing eIF2 recycling (19Scorsone K.A. Panniers R. Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because eIF2B is usually present at much lower concentrations than eIF2, phosphorylations of 20–30% of the eIF-2α pool cause substantial inhibitions of eIF2B activity in most cell types (5Prostko C.R.

Addition of Ca2+-mobilizing drugs or vasopressin to H9c2 cells resulted in phosphorylation of eIF2α corresponding closely with the degree of inhibition of leucine incorporation (Fig. 6). In untreated preparations, 94–100% of eIF2α was present in the non-phosphorylated form (A, lanes 1 and 5; B, lanes 1 and 8; C, lanes 1 and 6)"
https://openalex.org/W1549118234,"Phospholipase C (PLC)-β4 has been considered to be a mammalian homolog of the NorpA PLC, which is responsible for visual signal transduction in Drosophila.We reported previously the cloning of a cDNA encoding rat phospholipase C-β4 (PLC-β4) (Kim, M. J., Bahk, Y. Y., Min, D. S., Lee, S. J., Ryu, S. H., and Suh, P.-G. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 194, 706–712). We report now the isolation and characterization of a splice variant (PLC-β4b). PLC-β4b is identical to the 130-kDa PLC-β4 (PLC-β4a) except that the carboxyl-terminal 162 amino acids of PLC-β4a are replaced by 10 distinct amino acids. The existence of PLC-β4b transcripts in the rat brain was demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Immunological analysis using polyclonal antibody specific for PLC-β4b revealed that this splice variant exists in rat brain cytosol. To investigate functional differences between the two forms of PLC-β4, transient expression studies in COS-7 cells were conducted. We found that PLC-β4a was localized mainly in the particulate fraction of the cell, and it could be activated by Gαq, whereas PLC-β4b was localized exclusively in the soluble fraction, and it could not be activated by Gαq. In addition, both PLC-β4a and PLC-β4b were not activated by G-protein βγ-subunits purified from rat brain. These results suggest that PLC-β4b may be regulated by a mechanism different from that of PLC-β4a, and therefore it may play a distinct role in PLC-mediated signal transduction.

Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; IP, inositol phosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; G-protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Ins, free inositol fraction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s). plays a pivotal role in transmembrane signaling. In response to various extracellular stimuli such as numerous hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters, this enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and thereby generates two second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (1Berridge M.J. Helslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol is a direct activator of protein kinase C, whereas IP3 induces transient release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). Multiple PLC isozymes have been purified from a variety of mammalian tissues, and several PLC genes have been cloned (4Rhee S.G. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 5Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 35-61PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted from the cDNAs, the PLC isozymes vary in size, with molecular masses ranging from 85 to 150 kDa. Despite low overall homology among the predicted amino acid sequences, significant sequence similarity exists in two domains that are designated as the X- and the Y-domains. These domains appear to constitute regions important for catalytic activities such as the specific recognition of the substrate and the hydrolysis of its phosphodiester bond. On the basis of the relative locations of the X- and Y-domains in the primary structure, PLC isozymes are classified into three types: β, γ, and δ. All PLC-β types have a carboxyl-terminal 400-amino acid domain that contains an unusually high number of charged residues. On the other hand, the γ type has a long stretch of sequence between the X- and Y-domains, and the δ type contains neither of the two additional sequences (4Rhee S.G. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 5Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 35-61PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J.

As expected from their distinct structural features and their different cellular expression patterns, the PLC isozymes are distinct in their modes of activation in response to extracellular stimuli. The two γ type PLCs, PLC-γ1 and -γ2, but not the β and δ type isozymes, are activated through tyrosyl phosphorylation by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (6Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PLC-β types (β1, β2, β3) have been shown in cotransfection assays and in in vitro reconstitution experiments to be activated by the αq-subunit of heterotrimeric G-protein (7Smrcka A.V.

Based on these studies, it has been suggested that PLC-β4 might be a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila NorpA PLC, which is responsible for photosignal transduction. Furthermore, recent results obtained from cotransfection assays and in vitro reconstitution experiments showed that PLC-β4 could be activated by Gαq but not by βγ-subunits of G-proteins (21Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7593-7596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25335-25338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a rat PLC-β4 variant with a different carboxyl-terminal region. We show by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analysis that this new splice variant of PLC-β4 exists in vivo. Furthermore, we further demonstrate that this splice variant is neither associated with the particulate fraction of the cell, nor is it activated by Gαq. In the course of isolating PLC-β4 cDNA from a rat brain λZapII cDNA library (20Kim M.J. Bahk Y.Y. Min D.S. Lee S.J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we identified cDNA clones (clone β4–53 and β4–52) which exhibited patterns of restriction enzyme digestion differing from the previously described 130-kDa PLC-β4 cDNA (Fig. 1 A). Further sequence analysis of these cDNAs revealed that they were splice variants of the PLC-β4 gene. Two clones, β4–53 and β4–52, were plaque purified and subcloned into Bluescript vectors by in vivo excision with R408 helper phage. The sequences were assembled from nested deletion clones generated by the Erase-a-base system (Promega, Madison, WI) and dideoxy chain termination sequencing (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from adult Sprague-Dawley rat brain tissue using the guanidium thiocyanate phenol-based single-step method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 75 mmKCl, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg of oligo(dT)12–18/ml, 10 μg of total RNA, and 100 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. After a 2-h incubation at 42 °C, the reaction was terminated by heating at 94 °C for 5 min. One μl of the reaction mixture was used for PCR amplification. PCR was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg of gelatin/ml, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 ng of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The reaction proceeded for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The two primers used were: primer P1 (5′-AAGCAAAGAGATGCGAGC-3′), encompassing amino acids 1016–1021 of the PLC-β4b transcript, and primer P2 (5′-TGTGTTTGGGACACTGCATG-3′), which is the 3′-untranslated region specific for the PLC-β4b mRNA (Fig. 2 A). The amplified PCR products were analyzed in a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Whole rat brain poly(A) mRNA from CLONTECH was reverse transcribed with PLC-β4b-specific antisense primer (5′-CTTGTGTTTGGGACACTGCA-3′). The resulting single-stranded cDNA was used as template for PCR amplification using the sense primer (5′-ATCATGGCCAAACCTTACCGA-3′) located at the initiation codon of PLC-β4a and another antisense primer (5′-CACTGCATGACAGGATTTCA-3′), which is also specific for PLC-β4b cDNA. The amplified PCR product was subcloned into T-vector (Novagen) and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy method. A pBluescript KS plasmid containing the whole open reading frame of PLC-β4a was constructed by splicing an ApaI-SalI fragment of clone β4–19 and a SalI-XhoI fragment of clone β4–54 (the XhoI site used was originated from 3′-end linker of λZapII). The resulting cDNA was then subcloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and named pKS/β4a. The construction of a pBluescript KS vector containing the whole cDNA for PLC-β4b (pKS/β4b) was accomplished by replacing the SalI-ApaI fragment of pKS/β4a with the SalI-ApaI fragment of pKS/β4–53, which had been constructed by inserting anSalI-XhoI (XhoI in 3′-end linker of λZapII) fragment of clone β4–53 between theSalI-XhoI sites of pBluescript KS. The mammalian expression vectors for PLC-β4a and PLC-β4b were constructed by inserting the blunt ended SmaI-ApaI fragments of pKS/β4a and pKS/β4b into the EcoRV site of pcDNAI. The resulting plasmids were named pcDNAI/PLC-β4a and pcDNAI/PLC-β4b, respectively. A mammalian expression vector for mouse Gαq was made utilizing the PCR technology with the GeneAMP kit from Perkin-Elmer using mouse Gαq cDNA as template together with the sense primer 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACTCTGGAGTCCATCAT-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GCCGGATCCTTAGACCAGATTGTACTCCT-3′ (BamHI sites are underlined). PCR primers were designed to amplify region corresponding to the open reading frame of mouse Gαq cDNA. So, amplified PCR product contain no untranslated regions of 5′-end and 3′-end. The amplified product was digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of pcDNAI, and the construct was named pcDNAI/Gαq. All DNA sequences were verified by sequencing. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was by the DEAE-dextran method (25Cullen B.R. Lomedico P.T. Ju G. Nature. 1984; 307: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected 24 h later by incubation with 2 ml of transfection mixture (4 μg of plasmid DNA and 500 μg of DEAE-dextran in PBS) for 1 h. Then, 7 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μmchloroquine was added. After 2.5 h the medium was aspirated, and the cells were treated with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2.5 min, washed with PBS, and incubated in a CO2 incubator. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Peptide β4-N (MAKPYEFNWQKE, corresponding to residues 1–12 of PLC-β4a or PLC-β4b) and peptide 116-specific (GKQRDASPSG, corresponding to residues 1013–1022 of PLC-β4b) were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde, and injected into rabbits as described before (26Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera were affinity purified on protein A-agarose (Pierce Chemical Co.). The anti-Gαq rabbit polyclonal antibody used in immunoblotting was a generous gift from Dr. Y. S. Kim (Seoul National University, South Korea). Twenty frozen rat brains were homogenized in a homogenizer (Brinkmann) with 200 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 m Tris solution and applied to a DE52-cellulose column (5 cm × 10 cm2) preequilibrated with buffer A. The proteins were eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. All fractions collected were tested by immunoblots probed with the antibody generated against the 116-kDa PLC-β4b-specific sequence GKQRDASPSG. Fractions that contained protein recognized by the antibody were eluted with 70–120 mm NaCl. The peak fraction showing the strongest immunoreactivity eluted with 90 mm NaCl and was used for analysis. COS-7 cells, transfected with expression plasmids carrying the cDNA of PLC-β4a or -β4b, were lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by pestle strokes. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100s ultracentrifuge. The cytosolic fraction (supernatant) was separated from the particulate fraction. Samples were resolved by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electroblotted. The blots were incubated initially with rabbit antibody (1:5,000 dilution) raised against the NH2-terminal 12 amino acids of PLC-β4, and then the blot was incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and processed using the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) system (Amersham). The expression of recombinant PLC-β4b protein in HeLa cell by using recombinant vaccinia virus expression system was done as described previously (40Mackett M. Smith G.L. Moss B. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 857-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–250 g were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and perfused with fixative solution that contained 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 m lysine, 0.01 m sodium m-periodate in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature. The brain was dissected, postfixed overnight in the perfusion fixative without sodium m-periodate at 4 °C, and then cut on a vibratome (TPI, vibratome series 1000) into frontal sections (30 μm). Sections of the cerebellum were incubated for 30 min with 2% normal goat serum in TBS to block the nonspecific binding sites of protein. The sections were incubated with preimmune sera and antibodies against PLC-β4a and -β4b (diluted 1:2,000 in TBS and 2% BSA) for 16 h at 4 °C. For avidine-biotin-peroxidase immunostaining, the sections were washed three times for 10 min each with TBS, incubated for 2 h with biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Vector), diluted 1:400 in TBS and 2% BSA, washed three times for 10 min each with TBS, and then incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Vector), diluted 1:400 in TBS. After washing three times with same buffer, the preparations were reacted with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) in 50 mm TBS, pH 7.6, containing 0.006% H2O2. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with pcDNAI/Gαq and pcDNAI/β4a or pcDNAI/β4b. After 24 h, the cells were labeled overnight with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The monolayered cells were washed twice with PBS and preincubated in serum free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. During the last 10 min of the preincubation period, 20 mmLiCl was added. The cells were then treated with 30 μmAlF4− (10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by removal of the medium and washing the cell with ice-cold PBS. Total inositol formation was measured as described previously (27Yeo E.-J. Kazlauskas A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27823-27826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 3 ml of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid for 30 min on ice. The cells were scraped off the dishes, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. One ml of supernatant was neutralized with 0.5 ml of 50 mmammonium hydroxide and loaded onto a 1-ml Bio-Rad Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchange column (formate form, 200–400 mesh). Free inositol was washed three times with 3 ml of distilled water (free inositol fraction, Ins), and then the column was washed three times with 3 ml of 60 mm ammonium formate and 5 mm sodium tetraborate removing the glycerophosphoinositol fraction. Finally, total inositol phosphate was eluted with 6 ml of 1 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid (total inositol phosphate fraction, IPs). 0.5 ml of each of the Ins and IP fractions was mixed with 10 ml of scintillation mixture and counted (27Yeo E.-J. Kazlauskas A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27823-27826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data are presented as the quotient of IP divided by Ins plus IP. In addition, by measuring total radio activities of cell lysates extracted with formic acid, the incorporation of precursor in the transfected cell was normalized. Mammalian expression vectors for PLC-β4a, PLC-β4b, or PLC-β2 were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. After 48 h, transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed twice with PBS and extracted with extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 37 mm sodium cholate, 43 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the extracted proteins (∼5 mg/ml) were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the in vitro PLC assay, detergent extracts of transfected COS-7 cells were diluted 200-fold with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 43 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. PIP2 lipid substrates were made as follows. Phosphatidylethanolamine and [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were mixed in a molar ratio of 10:1. The lipids were evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2 and then sonicated in a bath type sonicator for 10 min in buffer containing 87.5 mm Tris-maleate, 17.5 mm LiCl, 17.5 mm EDTA, and 1.6 mmsodium deoxycholate. The final concentration of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the 70-μl assay mixture was 28 μm, with 38,000–40,000 cpm/single assay. The PLC activity was assayed at 25 °C in a mixture (70 μl) containing 40 μl of lipid substrate, 5 μl (125 ng) of the transfected COS-7 cells lysates, 5 μl (final 2 μm) of the βγ-subunits (provided by Dongeun Park (Kwang-Joo Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea), and 5–10 μl of 0.1m CaCl2, adjusting the concentration of free Ca2+ to 0.1 μm. The reaction was started with the addition of the transfected cell lysate and stopped by adding 350 μl of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (500:500:3, v/v/v) followed by vortex mixing. Samples were then supplemented with 100 μl of 1 m HCl containing 5 mm EGTA. After centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, the amount of [3H]IP3 in the supernatant was assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. We isolated two clones (clone β4–52 and β4–53) that had restriction enzyme digestion patterns differing from the 130-kDa PLC-β4 reported previously. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed that these clones could be a splice variant of the 130-kDa PLC-β4 mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Clone β4–53 was selected for further analysis because it contained the longer cDNA insert. The overall cDNA structure of clone β4–53 was almost identical to the 130-kDa PLC-β4 mRNA except that this clone had a 176-nucleotide deletion from the region encoding the carboxyl-terminal part of the 130-kDa PLC-β4 (Figs. 1 A and2 A). This deletion caused a frameshift compared with the reading frame of the 130-kDa PLC-β4 cDNA. As a result the carboxyl-terminal 162 amino acids are replaced with 10 distinct amino acids in β4–53 (Fig. 1 B). As seen in Fig. 2, the variant mRNA shares most of its sequence with the 130-kDa PLC-β4 mRNA, but it also has its own 37 nucleotides that are not present in the 130-kDa PLC-β4 mRNA and are inserted 247 nucleotides downstream from where the 176-nucleotide deletion occurred. Because the difference between the two mRNAs is restricted to the presence or absence of only those two specific regions, it is possible that the variant mRNA originated from an alternative mRNA processing event, although it cannot be ruled out that each mRNA is the product of a different gene. The longest clone (clone β4–53) encoding the novel splice variant of PLC-β4 encompassed the whole region downstream of the X-domain (Fig. 1 A). In an effort to isolate a clone encoding the whole open reading frame of this splice variant, we screened extensively two other rat brain cDNA libraries, but we failed to obtain any clone that was longer than clone β4–53. However, based on the results obtained from studies using sequence-specific antipeptide antibodies, we could predict that the protein encoded by the variant transcript shared the amino-terminal region with the 130-kDa PLC-β4 protein. Therefore, we used the long distance PCR cloning method to test whether PLC-β4b shared an identical amino-terminal primary structure with PLC-β4a. Whole rat brain mRNA was reverse transcribed with PLC-β4b-specific antisense primer. The resulting single-stranded cDNA was then used as template for long distance PCR amplification using the sequence located near the initiation codon of PLC-β4a as sense primer and an antisense primer corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of PLC-β4b. PCR amplification generated approximately a 3.3-kilobase pair DNA fragment (RACE-PCR product) (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 3, lane 2). The PstI digestion pattern of this RACE-PCR product was the same as the PCR product amplified with pKS/β4b as a template (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). By sequencing this RACE-PCR product, we can conclude that PLC-β4b has an amino-terminal structure identical to the corresponding PLC-β4a structure. The open reading frame predicted by the cumulative sequences of the clones β4–53 and the long distance PCR product codes for a polypeptide of 1022 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 115,965 Da (GenBank accession number AF031370). The protein predicted by this sequence was designated PLC-β4b, whereas the previously reported PLC-β4 was now renamed PLC-β4a. To verify whether a transcript of the spliced variant of PLC-β4 exists in vivo, we performed reverse transcription- PCR. We used total RNA from rat brain for reverse transcription with oligo(dT)12–18. The primers used in the PCR were designed to amplify specifically the region corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the PLC-β4b transcript (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 4, the PCR product obtained from reverse-transcribed rat brain RNA, and clone β4–53 was the expected 279 bp. This suggests that a PLC-β4b transcript does exist in vivo and that our clone was not just an entity generated by recombination during λ phage amplification. Although we successfully isolated a full-length cDNA encoding PLC-β4b by long distance PCR, we were not successful in isolating a λ phage clone containing the whole coding region of the splice variant, and thus we could not exclude the possibility that the PLC-β4b transcript was aberrant or a nonproductive mRNA. Therefore, we chose a different strategy to confirm the conclusion that PLC-β4b exists in vivo and shares the amino-terminal region with PLC-β4a. If we could detect the 116-kDa PLC in rat brain and if this protein would immunoreact with an antipeptide antibody generated against the 116-kDa PLC-β4b-specific sequence, and an antipeptide antibody generated against the amino-terminal sequence of PLC-β4a, then this would prove that PLC-β4b is an authentic entityin vivo. Thus, we made two antipeptide antibodies, one to the carboxyl-terminal region of PLC-β4b (anti-116-specific antibody) and the other to the amino-terminal region of PLC-β4a (anti-β4-N antibody). First, we used these antibodies in an experiment where we expressed PLC-β4b in HeLa cells after infection with vaccinia virus containing the corresponding cDNA to test whether the molecular mass of recombinant PLC-β4b would be the expected 116 kDa when expressed in a eukaryotic cell. As shown in Fig. 5, the molecular mass of the recombinant PLC-β4b expressed in HeLa cells was the predicted 116 kDa, and it was recognized by both the anti-β4-N antibody and the anti-116-specific antibody (Fig. 5, center lane in bothpanels). Second, to identify PLC-β4b in vivo, we fractionated rat brain cytosol on a DE52-cellulose column. All column fractions were immunoblotted and probed with anti-116-specific antibody. The fractions containing protein recognized by the anti-116-specific antibody eluted with 70–120 mm NaCl. The peak fraction exhibiting the strongest immunoreactivity eluted with 90 mm NaCl (data not shown) and was used for the immunoblot analysis. This fraction was also recognized specifically by the anti-β4-N antibody (Fig. 5, right lane in both panels). Taken together with result from sequencing data of RACE-PCR product, we can, therefore, confirm that PLC-β4b shares a common amino-terminal region with PLC-β4a. To assess functional differences of the two forms of PLC-β4, we compared their intracellular localization, since previous studies had suggested that the carboxyl-terminal region of the PLC-β type is required for their association with the particulate fraction of the cell (17Wu D.

https://openalex.org/W2093624336,"Abstract Previous reports have indicated that topoisomerase II (topo II) co-purifies with and is a substrate for casein kinase II. We have carried out a detailed study of the effect that purified casein kinase II has on the activity of purified recombinant human topo IIα. Co-incubation of topo IIα and casein kinase II led to an apparent activation of the topo IIα; however, in experiments in which topo IIα was preincubated at 37 °C with or without native casein kinase II prior to assaying for decatenation activity, it emerged that the kinase was exerting its “activating” function via a decrease in the rate of topo IIα enzyme inactivation during the incubation period. This stabilization of topo IIα by casein kinase II was ATP-independent and was observed in both mutated and truncated derivatives of topo IIα lacking the major casein kinase II phospho-acceptor sites, indicating the lack of a requirement for phosphorylation. Consistent with a nonenzymatic role for casein kinase II, stoichiometric quantities of kinase were required for topo IIα stabilization. These data indicate that casein kinase II plays a significant role in regulating human topo IIα protein action via stabilization against thermal inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2044568866,"Stimulation of cell proliferation by mitogens involves tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at the cell membrane by receptor tyrosine kinases. This promotes formation of multi-protein complexes that can activate the small G-protein, Ras. Activation of Ras, in turn, leads to sequential activation of the following three serine-threonine kinases: Raf, extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), and members of the family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Prior studies have shown that intraperitoneal injection of epidermal growth factor (EGF) leads to rapid activation of hepatic MAP kinases in adult rats but not in late gestation (E19) fetal rats (Boylan, J. M., and Gruppuso, P. A. (1996) Cell Growth & Differ. 7, 1261–1269). The present studies were undertaken to determine the mechanism for this “uncoupling” of the MAP kinase pathway. E19 fetal rats and adult male rats were injected with EGF (0.5 μg/g body weight, intraperitoneally) or with saline. After 15 min, livers were removed and prepared for kinase analyses. EGF injection led to a rapid and marked activation of hepatic Raf and MEK in both fetal and adult rats, whereas MAP kinase activation was minimal in fetal as opposed to adult rats. Examination of the ontogeny of this dissociation of MAP kinase activation from MEK activation showed gradual acquisition of intact signaling as an adult hepatocyte phenotype was attained during the first 4 postnatal weeks. Over this period, MAP kinase content as determined by Western immunoblotting was constant. Recombination experiments using partially purified fetal and adult rat liver MEK and MAP kinase showed intact MAP kinase activation in vitro, indicating that neither enzyme was irreversibly altered in the fetus. In studies using primary cultures of E19 fetal rat hepatocytes, uncoupling of MAP kinase activation from MEK activation could be induced by incubation of fetal hepatocytes for 24 h with a potent fetal hepatocyte mitogen, transforming growth factor-α. These findings indicate that a novel negative feedback mechanism for MAP kinase regulation may be active in developing rat hepatocytes. Stimulation of cell proliferation by mitogens involves tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at the cell membrane by receptor tyrosine kinases. This promotes formation of multi-protein complexes that can activate the small G-protein, Ras.

A major signaling pathway through which virtually all known mitogens exert intracellular responses is the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAP kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; MBP, myelin basic protein; E, embryonal day; P, postnatal day; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinases; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAP kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; MBP, myelin basic protein; E, embryonal day; P, postnatal day; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinases; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor. kinase cascade (1Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 2Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). A primary mechanism by which growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases activate MAP kinases involves tyrosine phosphorylation of an adaptor protein, Shc. Shc binds to a second adaptor protein, Grb2, by SH2/3 interactions. This complex incorporates a guanyl nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, which interacts with and activates Ras. The GTP-bound Ras recruits Raf kinase to the cell membrane and initiates a protein kinase cascade that phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase termed MEK (MAP kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase). MEK in turn phosphorylates MAP kinases on both tyrosyl and threonyl sites. Active MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate other serine-threonine kinases and transcription factors which can mediate immediate early gene induction. The growth and development of the fetus during late gestation is an intricate process dependent upon multiple regulatory mechanisms. Changes in hepatic growth tend to parallel effects on fetal somatic growth (3Gruppuso P.A. Brautigan D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E49-E54PubMed Google Scholar, 4Naeye R.L. Pediatrics. 1965; 35: 980-988PubMed Google Scholar), making liver an appropriate organ for studying fetal growth control. When we embarked on the present studies we expected that the proliferation of fetal rat hepatocytes, both in vivo and in vitro, would require the action of fetal growth factors. However, late gestation (19 day; E19) rat fetal hepatocytes cultured without serum, growth factors, or insulin were found to be highly proliferative (5Gruppuso P.A. Curran T.R. Bahner R.I. Herrera E. Knopp R.H. Perinatal Biochemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 194-212Google Scholar, 6Curran T.R. Bahner R.I. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By using a variety of approaches, we were able to find no direct evidence for the production of autocrine growth factors. Thus, we went on to employ MAP kinase activity as an indirect indicator of mitogenic signaling. Studies showed that the MAP kinases present in cultured fetal hepatocytes and in fetal liver were minimally active, although MAP kinase could be activated in cultures of primary fetal hepatocytes by at least two mitogens, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and hepatocyte growth factor (7Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G1078-G1086PubMed Google Scholar). Given the abundance of these growth factors in the late gestation fetal rat, we hypothesized that the relatively low activity of hepatic MAP kinases in vivo might be the result of negative feedback inhibition. In our initial studies (8Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 2EGF was used for in vivo experiments rather than TGF-α because of its availability in larger quantities. Comparative signal transduction experiments using primary cultures of fetal rat hepatocytes have shown that there are no differences in the ability of these two growth factors to stimulate phosphorylation of Shc or activation of MAP kinase (28Lipeski L.E. Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 975-983PubMed Google Scholar). 2EGF was used for in vivo experiments rather than TGF-α because of its availability in larger quantities. Comparative signal transduction experiments using primary cultures of fetal rat hepatocytes have shown that there are no differences in the ability of these two growth factors to stimulate phosphorylation of Shc or activation of MAP kinase (28Lipeski L.E. Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 975-983PubMed Google Scholar). into E19 fetuses or adult rats resulted in the activation of the proximal portion of the EGF signaling pathway in the liver. This was based on the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and Shc-Grb2 complex formation. When the downstream activation of MAP kinases was examined, EGF was shown to result in the marked (∼50-fold) activation of MAP kinase in the adult liver. However, minimal MAP kinase activation occurred in the fetus (8Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were performed following our initial observation of uncoupling of the MAP kinase signaling cascade in E19 fetal liver. We have determined when in development uncoupling of the hepatic MAP kinase cascade occurs as well as the site in this cascade where the actual uncoupling of MAP kinase activation takes place. We proceeded to characterize the constituents of the MAP kinase pathway to better understand this physiologic mechanism for down-regulation of mitogenic signaling. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratory, Wilmington, MA), of known gestation (term specified as 21 days), were delivered by cesarean section under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) were used for adult liver preparation. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with EGF (0.5 μg/g body weight) or phosphate-buffered saline and sacrificed 15 min later. Fetal hepatocytes were isolated on day 19 of gestation by collagenase digestion as described previously (6Curran T.R. Bahner R.I. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were diluted to 3 × 106 cells per 100-mm Primaria tissue culture plate with supplemented minimum essential medium (6Curran T.R. Bahner R.I. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After a 2-h attachment period, the medium was removed and replaced with supplemented minimum essential medium without fetal bovine serum. Media contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to avoid nonspecific binding of growth factors. Rat liver homogenates were prepared as described previously for MAP kinase activity (7Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G1078-G1086PubMed Google Scholar). Homogenates corrected for protein (4 mg) were precleared with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). MAP kinase immunoprecipitation was accomplished with a peptide antibody against the rat ERK-1 sequence (anti-MAP kinase R2, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) that had been covalently coupled to Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B using dimethyl pimelimidate (20 mm in 0.1m sodium borate, pH 9.0). The immunoprecipitates were washed 4 × in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then 1 × with 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.2% Triton X-100, plus the above protease inhibitors. The immunoprecipitated kinase was resuspended in 25 μl of this buffer. MAP kinase was assayed by adding an equal volume of 2 × reaction mixture containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 100 μmNa3VO4, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.05 μCi/nmol), and 0.667 mg/ml MBP and incubating for 20 min at 30 °C. The assays were terminated by adding 10 μl of 250 mm EDTA. MBP was separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C in the presence of intensifying screens, and phosphate incorporation into MBP was quantified with a Hoefer model 300S scanning densitometer connected to a Hewlett-Packard model 3390A integrator. Rat liver homogenates and hepatocyte lysates were prepared for MAP kinase activity determinations as described previously (7Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G1078-G1086PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, samples were fractionated using Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography. MAP kinase activity was determined using myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate (7Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G1078-G1086PubMed Google Scholar). Adult and fetal rat liver samples were prepared for determination of Raf or MEK activity by homogenizing liver in Raf/MEK homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and frozen at −70 °C until use. Thawed samples were diluted 10-fold in Raf/MEK Mono Q buffer A (10 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and then loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a Mono Q column. Raf was eluted with a 40-ml gradient from 0 to 100% buffer B (buffer A + 1 m NaCl). Column fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. MEK was eluted with a 40-ml gradient from 0 to 45% buffer B. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. The Raf activity assay used recombinant, histidine-tagged, kinase inactive human MEK-1 as substrate. Expression and purification were performed as described by Gardner et al. (9Gardner A.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Raf was assayed by mixing 20 μl of each fraction with 20 μl of assay buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.25 μCi/nmol)), with or without 1.5 μg of recombinant kinase-inactive MEK-1. The assay mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and stopped with 10 μl of 250 mm EDTA. Proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. The dried gel was exposed to film and quantitated as above. The MEK activity assay used histidine-tagged human ERK-1 as substrate. MEK was assayed by mixing 20 μl of each fraction with 20 μl of the above assay buffer containing 50 nm staurosporine, with or without 2 μg of recombinant human ERK-1. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and then MBP was added to a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml, followed by incubation for an additional 15 min. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 250 mm EDTA, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and protein phosphorylation was quantified as above. MEK activity was assessed as both MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation. Livers from fetal and adult rats injected with EGF were homogenized in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, 250 μl was loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Pharmacia), run at 0.5 ml/min with the above buffer. Fifty 0.5-ml fractions were collected to separate active MEK. The reaction was started by mixing 10 μl of each fraction with 5 μl of either control fetal rat liver MAP kinase partially purified by Mono Q chromatography (7Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G1078-G1086PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant human ERK-1 (0.4 μg), or MAP kinase Mono Q buffer A as control (7Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G1078-G1086PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 3 min at 30 °C, 5 μl of 20 mm magnesium acetate plus 800 μmATP was added. This mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, after which was added 80 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.125 mmNa3VO4, 12.5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.05 μCi/nmol), and 0.4 mg/ml MBP. After an additional 10 min incubation, the reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 250 mm EDTA. Proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed as above. Liver from an adult rat injected with EGF was fractionated on a Mono Q column. For these experiments, Triton X-100 was not added to Mono Q buffers. Fractions containing MEK activity were pooled and then precipitated by adding a volume of 3.6 m ammonium sulfate (2 m final concentration). The pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.02% Brij 35 (w/v), 25 mm NaF, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine. The solution was dialyzed overnight using the same buffer plus 50% glycerol. For detection of immunoreactive kinases, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting with the MAP kinase R2 antibody or antibodies to either MEK-1 or MEK-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Western immunoblots were also performed using an antibody to the active dually phosphorylated (Thr/Tyr) MAP kinase (Promega, Madison, WI), as well as an antibody to active dually phosphorylated (Ser-217/221) MEK-1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). In all cases, detection employed chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). To examine the subcellular localization of immunoreactive MAP kinases, nuclei were separated from cytosol using sucrose density centrifugation (10Gruppuso P.A. Boylan J.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MAP kinase immunoprecipitation was carried out on rat liver cytosol and nuclear extracts. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western immunoblotting as described above. To confirm our previous observations that MAP kinase activation in fetal liver is uncoupled (8Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar), we immunoprecipitated MAP kinase in fetal liver homogenates from E19 fetal and adult rats given an intraperitoneal injection of phosphate-buffered saline (control) or EGF. MAP kinase activity was then measured directly on immunoprecipitated MAP kinase. Results showed that control fetal and adult rats showed minimal MAP kinase activity (Fig. 1). Upon EGF administration, there was a slight increase in fetal MAP kinase activity, whereas adult MAP kinase was seen to increase approximately 15-fold (Fig. 1). Western immunoblotting of parallel immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, bottom) showed similar MAP kinase content in fetal and adult samples, indicating that the diminished ability of EGF to stimulate MAP kinase activity in the fetal rat was not due to a decrease in MAP kinase content. The next series of studies were performed to determine the point in development at which hepatic MAP kinases could be stimulated byin vivo EGF injection. MAP kinase activity was measured in liver homogenates from rats before or after intraperitoneal EGF administration to term fetal rats, newborn rats aged 1, 4, and 7 days, and 28-day-old animals (E21, P1, P4, P7, P28; Fig. 2). Minimal EGF-mediated activation of MAP kinases was seen in E21 fetuses. A low level of activation occurred on P1 and P4. The degree of activation increased on P7. By P28, MAP kinase activation was indistinguishable from that seen in adult rats. To ensure that hepatic MAP kinase content was not changing during this period, Mono Q fractions 32–46 from each column in Fig. 2 were pooled and analyzed by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 3). Results showed that 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinases were present at constant levels from late gestation to the 28th postnatal day. The immunoblot analysis was repeated on the same samples using an antibody that recognizes active, dually phosphorylated (Thr/Tyr) MAP kinase. Results indicated that MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 3) correlated with MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2). To determine if the absence of hepatic MAP kinase activation in EGF-injected fetal rats coincided with an effect on MAP kinase translocation to the nucleus, nuclei and cytosol were isolated from livers of fetal and adult animals that had been injected with saline (control) or EGF. Western immunoblotting (Fig. 4) revealed that EGF injection of adult animals induced an increase in nuclear MAP kinase content. No such increase in MAP kinase content was detected in fetal nuclear extracts after EGF administration. No decrease in the amount of MAP kinase in the cytosol of the adult rats was observed. This is presumably due to the large pool of MAP kinase found in the cytosolic versusthe nuclear fraction masking any detectable decrease. We hypothesized that the attenuation of growth factor-mediated phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase were due to the failure to activate the kinases upstream of this enzyme. The activity of Raf (MEK kinase), the proximal kinase in the signaling pathway, was examined to determine indirectly if Ras activation was intact. Liver homogenates were fractionated by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography. Individual fractions were assayed for MEK kinase activity using recombinant, kinase-deficient MEK-1 as substrate. Fetuses injected with EGF showed marked activation of MEK kinase activity, present in multiple peaks (Fig. 5). EGF-inducible MEK kinase activity was also present in the adult, albeit at a lower level than in the fetus and as a single chromatographic peak (Fig. 5). Although we have not yet characterized the multiple MEK kinase activity peaks present in liver from EGF-injected fetuses, the response to EGF was taken as evidence for intact signaling at this step. Given these results, similar experiments were performed to study thein vivo activation of MEK. Recombinant human ERK-1 was used as the kinase substrate. Fetal and adult rat liver homogenates fractionated by Mono Q chromatography (Fig. 5) showed similar patterns of EGF-induced MEK activation. In both cases, MEK activity was minimal in the basal (control-injected) samples. The results to this point were interpreted as indicating that the ability of EGF to only minimally activate hepatic MAP kinase in vivo resided at the level of MAP kinase phosphorylation by MEK. The first hypothetical mechanism that was investigated was that MAP kinase and/or MEK were altered in fetal liver such that they did not interact normally. This possibility had not been addressed in the experiments utilizing recombinant kinases as substrates. Active fetal or adult liver MEKs obtained from EGF-injected animals and fractionated by high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography were examined for their ability to activate rat hepatic MAP kinases. Inactive fetal rat liver MAP kinase from an uninjected animal, partially purified by Mono Q chromatography, and recombinant human ERK-1 were used as substrates. Results (Fig. 6) showed that both MAP kinases were potently activated by both fetal and adult rat liver MEK that had been activated in vivo by EGF injection. This was interpreted as indicating that there was no significant alteration in fetal MAP kinases that could account for their resistance to in vivoactivation by MEK. Western immunoblotting of the gel filtration fractions that contained MEK activity (fractions 30–37) using antibodies to either MEK-1 or MEK-2 revealed that both proteins were present in approximately equal amounts in the fetus and adult. Immunoblotting with an antibody against the active (Ser-217/221 phosphorylated) MEK-1 and -2 proteins demonstrated immunoreactive proteins with M r ∼47,000 in fractions coinciding with MAP kinase kinase activity (Fig. 7). The presence of these immunoreactive proteins was interpreted as supporting activation of MEK-1 and/or MEK-2, although we were not able to discern which of the MEKs was activated due to the similarity of their molecular weights. Nonetheless, these data were interpreted as supporting the conclusion that MEK activation was intact in fetal liver, whereas MAP kinase activation was markedly attenuated.Figure 7MEK and phospho-MEK content in fetal and adult rat liver after EGF stimulation. Fractions 30–37 from the fetal and adult gel filtration columns shown in Fig. 6 were separated on a 10% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and sequentially immunoblotted with the antibody to dually phosphorylated MEK-1/2, to MEK-1, and to MEK-2. Numbers to the right of the immunoblots represent the position of the 45-kDa marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In a confirmatory experiment, liver from an adult rat injected with EGF was homogenized and fractionated by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography. Fractions showing MEK activity were pooled, ammonium sulfate-precipitated, and dialyzed (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting protein solution showed MEK activity measured as the ability to activate bacterially expressed human ERK-1. This MEK preparation was used in a recombination experiment. It was added to individual Mono Q chromatography fractions obtained by preparing liver homogenates from normal (uninjected) fetal and adult rats. The predicted elution of inactive MAP kinase was based on previous chromatograms that had been analyzed by Western immunoblotting. The partially purified, active hepatic MEK derived from an EGF-injected adult rat was found to be potent in activating both adult and fetal rat liver MAP kinase (Fig. 8). These results were interpreted as confirming that fetal hepatic MAP kinases are intact as in vitro substrates for MEK following their partial purification. We had shown previously that 24 h exposure of fetal hepatocytes in primary culture to TGF-α or hepatocyte growth factor resulted in desensitization of MAP kinase to activation by either growth factor (11Gruppuso P.A. Boylan J.M. Bienieki T.C. Curran T.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this desensitization might be analogous to the uncoupling seen in vivo. To examine this, E19 fetal hepatocytes were cultured in the absence or presence of TGF-α for 24 h and then stimulated with additional TGF-α for 10 min. Shc immunoprecipitation showed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation as well as Shc-Grb2 complex formation upon acute TGF-α stimulation. This was not affected by 24 h preincubation with TGF-α (Fig. 9). This was interpreted as indicating that tonic growth factor exposure for 24 h had not resulted in sufficient down-regulation of EGF receptor number or tyrosine kinase activity to cause an attenuation of proximal signaling. Given that this result was consistent with the in vivo findings, we went on to examine downstream signaling. By using the same experimental design, MAP kinase reactivation after incubation with TGF-α for 24 h was examined. It was found to be only one-third of that seen with no TGF-α preincubation (Fig. 10). In contrast, MEK was activated to the same degree under both conditions. (The final peak of MBP kinase activity that eluted in fraction 23 of Fig. 9 and was higher in the untreated hepatocytes could be accounted for by the endogenous, previously activated MAP kinase.) Similar uncoupling of MAP kinase from active MEK was seen in an experiment where E19 fetal hepatocytes were pretreated for 48 h with TGF-α (data not shown). Western immunoblotting (not shown) indicated that this effect of growth factor preincubation was not due to a decrease in MAP kinase content. These results were interpreted as demonstrating that in vivouncoupling of the MAP kinase signaling pathway could be reproduced in cultured fetal hepatocytes by tonic growth factor stimulation. Recently cloned dual specificity phosphatases like MKP-1 (MAP kinase phosphatase 1, encoded by the murine gene 3CH134 (12Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar)) or CL100, the human homologue of MKP-1 (13Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), exhibit dual catalytic activity toward phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine, thus providing a mechanism for the inactivation of MAP kinase. Based on the above studies, we treated cultured (E19) fetal hepatocytes incubated with or without TGF-α for 24 h with either the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, or the serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. Phosphatase inhibitors were added for 30 min prior to restimulation with TGF-α. In both cases, suppression of MAP kinase activation remained intact, that is MEK activation was unaffected by growth factor preincubation while MAP kinase activation was attenuated in a manner indistinguishable from that shown in Fig. 10. Parallel in vivo studies were performed as well. We administered the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor mpV(pic), a peroxovanadium compound that is over 100-fold more potent than orthovanadate, to fetal rats by intraperitoneal injection. Subsequent injection of EGF (15 min later) produced no discernible MAP kinase activation (results not shown). An additional experiment was carried out to obtain indirect evidence that a MAP kinase phosphatase is present in fetal hepatocytes under basal conditions (i.e. without tonic growth factor stimulation). E19 fetal hepatocytes were exposed to TGF-α for 10 min. The TGF-α-containing medium was then replaced with fresh media that did not contain the growth factor. Within 15 min, MAP kinase activity returned to basal levels, consistent with the presence of an active MAP kinase phosphatase. Upon restimulating these cells for 10 min with TGF-α, MAP kinase was reactivated, indicating that inactivation was not due to MAP kinase turnover. An alternative hypothesis to explain the dissociation of MAP kinase and MEK activation in fetal liver could involve a protein which binds to MAP kinase, thereby preventing its activation in vivo. To obtain an indicator of the relative size of fetal and adult liver MAP kinases, fetal and adult rat liver homogenates, prepared using conditions aimed at minimizing disruption of protein-protein interactions, were analyzed using a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Pharmacia). Results (not shown) were consistent with the elution of MAP kinases from both fetal and adult rat liver as soluble monomers. Gel filtration chromatographic analysis was performed on lysates derived from fetal hepatocytes preincubated for 24 h with or without TGF-α to detect the induction of a MAP kinase binding protein. Again, no shift in the apparent size of the 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinases was seen (not shown). An additional approach to detect a MAP kinase binding protein was employed. Cultured E19 hepatocytes were labeled with [35S]methionine for 24 h in the absence or presence of TGF-α. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies toward MAP kinase was performed to detect co-immunoprecipitated, labeled proteins. Autoradiography of a polyacrylamide gel used to separate immunoprecipitated proteins did not provide evidence for a specific interaction between a TGF-α-inducible protein and MAP kinase (results not shown). Our prior observation that intraperitoneal injection of late gestation fetal rats in situ with EGF showed only minimal activation of hepatic MAP kinases (8Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar) was initially interpreted as indicating a probable block at the level of Ras activation. This was based on observations from several laboratories indicating that growth factor activation of the MAP kinase pathway can lead to phosphorylation of the Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange protein SOS, thereby down-regulating the MAP kinase pathway (14Rozakis-Adcock M. van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1994; 11: 1417-1426Google Scholar, 15Cherniac A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Such a mechanism might pertain to negative feedback inhibition of hepatic MAP kinase activation in the growth factor-rich fetal environment. The ability of EGF to activate hepatic MAP kinases in vivo was recovered during the early phase of postnatal development, a period when hepatocyte proliferation is slowing and fetal hepatocytes are making the transformation to an adult hepatocyte phenotype. However, the observation that Raf and MEK activation were intact in the absence of MAP kinase activation indicated an alternative regulatory mechanism. The conclusion that in situ EGF injection of a late gestation fetal rat could produce MEK activation with minimal MAP kinase activation is consistent with the entirety of the experiments we performed. In addition to activity measurements, Western immunoblotting confirmed the presence of MAP kinase but the absence of its phosphorylation in fetal liver. Furthermore, the lack of activation was accompanied by the lack of nuclear translocation. Gonzalez et al. (20Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have reported that the majority of the MAP kinase in quiescent cells is in the cytoplasm. Upon activation of the cells with serum, cytoplasmic MAP kinase translocates into the nucleus. Similar translocation could be detected in subcellular fractions from adult, but not fetal, liver. The evidence for intact MEK activation included not only activity measurements but also Western immunoblotting for the active forms of MEK-1 and -2. The physiologic in vivo uncoupling of MAP kinase activation at the level of MAP kinase phosphorylation by MEK has not been reported previously. However, several reports have suggested similar uncoupling of MAP kinase activation in vitro. By using a mouse myoblast cell line, Campbell et al. (21Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed that following withdrawal from serum and bFGF for 3 h bFGF stimulated MAP kinase kinase activity but that MAP kinase and S6 peptide kinase activities were not detected. When serum and bFGF were withdrawn for 10 h, the activities of MAP kinase kinase, MAP kinase, and S6 peptide kinase were coordinately stimulated by bFGF. Similar results were seen using EGF. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that incubation with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, restored MAP kinase activation. Microcystin, a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, had little effect. Samuels et al. (22Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), using retroviruses encoding a fusion protein consisting of an oncogenic form of human p74raf-1 and the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (hrafER), have studied MAP kinase regulation in rat1a cells conditionally transformed by hrafER. In these cells, estradiol caused the activation of MAP kinase kinase but not activation of p42/p44 MAP kinases or phosphorylation of p74raf-1. Estradiol-dependent activation of MAP kinase and phosphorylation of p74raf-1 was observed when cells were pretreated with the serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Sodium vanadate alone had little effect. It has also been reported that in v-raf-infected macrophages, MEK activation occurs normally after growth factor treatment, whereas MAP kinase shows no activation correlating with lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of this enzyme (23Krautwald S. Buscher D. Dent P. Ruthenberg K. Baccarini M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1187-1192PubMed Google Scholar). Suppression of MAP kinase activation was reversed in these cells by treating with sodium orthovanadate. We did not observe an effect of phosphatase inhibitors on either thein vivo or in vitro uncoupling of MAP kinase activation from MEK activation. Although these findings do not rule out a fetal hepatic MAP kinase phosphatase as the factor required for uncoupling of MAP kinase activation from MEK activation, they also do not support this hypothesis. A responsible dual function phosphatase would have to be insensitive to vanadate and okadaic acid. In addition, there appears to be a MAP kinase phosphatase expressed in fetal hepatocytes maintained under non-growth factor-stimulated conditions. Thus, induction of a phosphatase would have to modify the effects of one already present. Nonetheless, given that the transcription of the dual specificity phosphatases has been shown to be stimulated by serum and growth factors (12Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 24Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this remains a viable hypothesis. Our hypothesis that MAP kinase activation by MEK could be blocked by a MAP kinase binding protein is not without precedent. It has recently been reported that the protein p21WAF1/cip1/Sdi1, a DNA damage-inducible cell cycle inhibitor, acts as an inhibitor of the stress-activated protein kinases, also called the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs). Dickens et al. (26Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) have described an additional mechanism for attenuating effects mediated by the JNK pathway. These investigators have cloned a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK pathway, JIP-1, that binds specifically to JNK. JIP-1 causes cytoplasmic retention of JNK and inhibition of JNK-related gene expression. Given that the JNK enzymes represent a subfamily of the MAP kinases (27Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.-J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we considered an analogous mechanism. However, we were unable to obtain evidence for fetal hepatic MAP kinases being present in a form other than soluble monomers. In addition, our data indicated a lack of MAP kinase phosphorylation, an effect not attributed to JIP-1. In summary, our results demonstrate that hepatic, EGF-induced MAP kinase activation is suppressed in late gestation through the early postnatal period in the developing rat. Western immunoblotting indicated that the absence of MAP kinase activity correlates with the absence of MAP kinase phosphorylation. However, activation of MEK, the kinase which phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase, remains intact upon acute stimulation with EGF. Furthermore, the uncoupling of MAP kinase from the signaling cascade can be induced in vitro by the incubation of fetal hepatocytes for 24 h with growth factors. These findings may define a mechanism for attenuating MAP kinase activation under conditions in which cells are subject to tonic growth factor stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2069718831,"Scinderin is a Ca2+-dependent actin filament severing protein present in a variety of secretory cells. Previous work suggests that scinderin-evoked cortical F-actin disassembly is required for secretion because local disassembly of cortical cytoskeleton allows secretory vesicle exocytosis (Vitale, M. L., Rodrı́guez Del Castillo, A., Tchakarov, L., and Trifaró, J.-M. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 113, 1057–1067). Scinderin has six domains each containing three internal sequence motifs, two actin, and two phosphatidylinositol disphosphate-binding sites in domains 1 and 2. In this paper we report the presence of another actin-binding site at the NH2-terminal of domain 5 (Sc511–518). This site binds actin in a Ca2+-independent manner and a recombinant fragment (Sc5–6 or Sc502–715) containing this site binds to actin-DNase-I-Sepharose 4B beads, co-sediments with actin and is able to nucleate actin assembly. Recombinant ScL5–6, a fusion protein devoid of the actin-binding site (Sc519–715), did not exhibit these properties. Moreover, Sc-ABP3, a peptide constructed with sequence (RLFQVRRNLASIT) identical to Sc511–523 blocked the binding of Sc5–6 to actin. Sc5–6 and Sc-ABP3 also prevented the actin severing activity of recombinant full-length scinderin (r-Sc) and inhibited the potentiation by r-Sc of Ca2+-evoked release of serotonin from permeabilized platelets. On the other hand, ScL5–6 failed to block the effect of r-Sc on platelet serotonin release. Sc1–4,6, a construct devoid of domain 5, was able to sever but unable to nucleate actin, indicating that an actin nucleation site of scinderin was in domain 5. The results suggest that scinderin, in addition to binding actin on sites present in domains 1 and 2, must bind actin on a third site in domain 5 to sever and nucleate actin effectively. Scinderin is a Ca2+-dependent actin filament severing protein present in a variety of secretory cells. Previous work suggests that scinderin-evoked cortical F-actin disassembly is required for secretion because local disassembly of cortical cytoskeleton allows secretory vesicle exocytosis (Vitale, M.

The results suggest that scinderin, in addition to binding actin on sites present in domains 1 and 2, must bind actin on a third site in domain 5 to sever and nucleate actin effectively.

These publications showed that chromaffin cells contain a Ca2+-dependent actin-severing protein that was distinct from gelsolin, although gelsolin was also present in these cells (2Bader M.-F.

Kurokawa H. Nonomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15979-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), precisely domains 1 and 2 (7Marcu M.G. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L.

The F-actin severing activity of scinderin seems to play a role in secretion (17Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Scinderin is present only in secretory cells (5Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Lemaire S. Tchakarov L. Jeyapragasan M.

Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cortical F-actin acts as a barrier to the free movement of secretory vesicles to release sites, and only during cell stimulation induced Ca2+ entry, cortical F-actin is disassembled, most probably through the activation of scinderin (17Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This will allow the movement of secretory vesicles to release sites on the plasma membrane (17Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaró J.-M. J.

Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this regard, recent experiments have shown that recombinant scinderin potentiates Ca2+-evoked F-actin disassembly and exocytosis in platelets as well as in chromaffin cells (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M.

(9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two PIP2-binding sites have been described for scinderin, and as with gelsolin, they are present in segments 1 and 2 (7Marcu M.G. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Trifaró J.-M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 141: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PIP2 inhibits the actin-severing activity of scinderin, but unexpectedly phosphatidylserine also binds to scinderin and inhibits its actin-severing activity (21Maekawa S. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10940-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Trifaró J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is a distinct feature of scinderin when compared with gelsolin. Although the actin-severing activity of scinderin is localized in its NH2-terminal half (16Sakurai T. Kurokawa H. Nonomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15979-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this binds a molecule of G-actin (20Trifaró J.-M. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the COOH-terminal half also binds a molecule of G-actin (16Sakurai T. Kurokawa H. Nonomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15979-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Trifaró J.-M. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with formation of a 2:1 scinderin-actin complex (20Trifaró J.-M. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The present experiments were directed to identify and characterize a third actin-binding site that was found to be present in the COOH-terminal half of scinderin. Fusion proteins corresponding to either the full-length or truncations of scinderin were prepared and tested for their interaction with actin. Here we demonstrate that a third binding site for actin is localized in the NH2-terminal half of domain 5 of scinderin. Moreover, experiments with a recombinant truncated scinderin containing this site or a peptide constructed on the basis of this site sequence demonstrated that when this third site is occupied or blocked, the severing activity of intact scinderin is reduced. Similarly, either this peptide or a truncated scinderin fragment containing domain 5 was able to block the increases in Ca2+-evoked release of serotonin from platelets induced by recombinant full-length scinderin, suggesting again that the third actin-binding site is necessary for full interaction of scinderin with actin. Furthermore, experiments with a scinderin construct with deletion of domain 5 indicated that the actin-binding site present in this domain contributes to the actin nucleation activity of scinderin. The Thioredoxin (TRX) Thio-Fusion System (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was used for the expression of fusion proteins. Full-length recombinant scinderin (r-Sc) was prepared as described previously (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the different truncations (deletions) of scinderin were obtained by PCR. Primers were designed to include a BamHI restriction site for 5′ end and a SalI for 3′ end. The obtained PCR products were digested and subcloned in expression vector pTrxFus using the same restriction sites. Recombinant plasmids were then transfected into the hostEscherichia coli GI698. Correct subcloning and reading frames of all clones were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (ABI 373 Automated Sequencer). PCR primers used to construct the fusion proteins were as follows: 5′-ACT GCA GGA TCC ATT GGT TTC AGA TGC CAG TGG-3′ forward for Sc3–6, Sc3–4, and Sc3-½4; 5′-GTC GTG TCG ACA GTC AGC ATC CAG CAG AGC TA-3′ reverse for Sc, Sc5–6, ScL5–6, Sc½5–6, and Sc6; 5′-GTC GTG TCG ACT TGC TCC TTG CCA GGT GTA G-3′ reverse for Sc3−½4; 5′-ACT GCA GGA TCC AGA AGG TCA GGC ACC AGC C-3′ forward for Sc5–6; 5′-CTC GTG TCG ACC TGG TGC CTG ACC TTC TTT C-3′ reverse for Sc3–4; 5′-ACT GCA GGA TCC AGA GAA AGG AGC AGA GTA CG-3′ forward for Sc½5–6; 5′-ACT GCA GGA TCC AGG CCT GGC TTC GAT CAC CAG-3′ forward for Sc½5–6; 5′-ACT GCA GGA TCC AGC ATC CCA GGC TGA AGA CCA TC-3′ forward for Sc6; 5′-ACT TGG TAC CAA TGG CCC AGG GGC TGT AC-3′ forward for Sc1–4,6; and 5′-TAG CAG GAT CCA CTG GTG CCT GAC CTT CTT TC-3′ reverse for Sc1–4,6. Sc1–4,6 was obtained starting from Sc6 cloned into vector pTrxFus. A PCR product of Sc1–4 was amplified and then subcloned into the vector carrying Sc6 that was cut at the 5′ end with KpnI and BamHI. One new amino acid was introduced just in front of the amino end of segment 6 of scinderin. Transformed E. coliwere grown in Rich Medium containing 100 μg ampicillin/ml and induced with 100 μg tryptophan/ml. Proteins were obtained by osmotic shockate to a purity of at least 80%, as described previously (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the release studies, r-Sc was further purified by actin-DNase-I-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as described by Marcu et al. (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were dialyzed against deionized water and lyophilized as described previously (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the position of the different recombinant fragments in the scinderin molecule is shown in Fig. 1. Actin-DNaseI-Sepharose 4B affinity beads were prepared as described previously (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used in binding experiments performed “in bulk.” Rabbit skeletal muscle actin (G-150) was purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). The buffer used for binding assays was either 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer A) or Ca2+-free 10 mm EGTA in the same buffer as above (buffer B). Washings were with either buffer A or B, this time including 600 mm KCl. For the Ca2+-free experiments, actin binding was performed in buffer B. 300 μl of actin-DNaseI-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotary shaker with 50 μg of each fusion protein. Preparations were then centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 1 min and washed several times with the respective buffer and centrifuged again to recover the beads. For all conditions, the actin-DNaseI-Sepharose 4B bead sediments and supernatants (buffer B eluates) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. The ability of fusion proteins to bind actin was also investigated by an actin-cosedimentation assay (23Fechheimer M. Lansing-Taylor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4514-4520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomeric actin (0.5 mg/ml) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) was induced to polymerize in 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NaATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or the same buffer devoid of Ca2+ but containing 10 mm EGTA (Ca2+-free buffer). Aliquots of fusion proteins were mixed with actin and incubated for 90 min at 20 °C. Different ratios between recombinant truncated proteins and actin were used: 0.15:1; 0.35:1; 0.5:1; 0.75:1; 0.95:1; 1:1; and 1.2:1. Filamentous actin was sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min; sediments and supernatants were tested for the presence of proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. To determine affinities to actin and Kd values of scinderin constructs, 4 μm actin samples were polymerized in the presence of different molar ratios of constructs to actin. After 90 min of incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged as above. The amounts of constructs and actin in supernatants and pellets were determined by densitometric scanning (Ultrascan XL Bromma Laser densitometer) of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Scatchard's plots were prepared with the data, and Kd values were calculated from the plots. Apparent viscosity was measured at low shear rates by the falling ball technique as described by MacLean-Fletcher and Pollard (24MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). G-actin was induced to polymerize (4 mg/ml) for 1 h at 22 °C, and then it was diluted to 1 mg/ml (0.22 μm) in the following buffer: 100 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.005% NaN3, 10 μm free Ca2+ (4.6 mm CaCl2) 1 mm NaATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg leupeptin/ml, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.8. Actin alone or mixed (at 0 °C) with fusion proteins in different ratios was drawn into 100-μl glass capillaries, sealed with plasticine at one end, and held horizontally at room temperature for 2 h before determination of the apparent viscosity. One stainless steel ball was used per capillary; one measurement per tube and three measurements per condition were done. Capillary tubes were placed at an angle of 45 °, and the time for the ball to fall between two points was recorded. Apparent viscosity was calculated from a calibration curve obtained by measuring ball falling times through glycerol solutions (from 0–100%) of known viscosity, and the results were expressed in centipoises. 6 μm G-actin containing 5% pyrene-iodoacetamide-labeled actin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) were dissolved in low salt buffer (0.2 mmNaATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and left on ice for 30 min to allow complete depolymerization of small oligomers that might form during defrosting. The solution was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the actin present in the supernatant was polymerized alone or in the presence of r-Sc or recombinants Sc1–4,6, Sc5–6, or ScL5–6 (the molar ratio of actin to any of the recombinants was 400:1) by addition of 150th volume of polymerization inducer buffer (2.5m KCl, 100 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm NaATP). Actin polymerization was monitored for 120 min at 22 °C by measuring the change in fluorescence, using a 10-nm bandwidth and excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 407 nm, respectively (Perkin-Elmer LS5 Fluorometer). Monodimensional electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to Doucet and Trifaró (25Doucet J.-P. Trifaró J-M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunolabeling was performed with a monoclonal antibody against thioredoxin (Invitrogen, CA) in 1:5000 dilution. A scinderin polyclonal antibody previously raised in our laboratory against full-length scinderin (5Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Lemaire S. Tchakarov L. Jeyapragasan M. Doucet J.-P. Vitale M.L. Trifaró J.-M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) did not recognize most of the fusion proteins corresponding to small truncations of scinderin except Sc3–6, Sc3–4, and Sc1–4,6. The second antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), and it was used in a dilution of 1:3000. Color was developed by treatment of membranes with a mixture of p-nitro-blue-tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloride-3-indolylphosphate toluidine salt. Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were densitometrically scanned with an Ultrascan XL Bromma Laser Densitometer. Peptides with a sequence corresponding to the 5′ end of scinderin 5-th domain (RLFQVRRNLASIT) and with scramble sequence (AVNIRLRFSTLQR) were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis (26Merryfield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6699) Google Scholar). Sequences were checked by Edman chemistry and peptide purity determined by mass spectroscopy (27Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 412-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). No homology for scramble sequence was found in the GenBank™ data. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained from the Ottawa Red Cross and centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min to eliminate red blood cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min to obtain a platelet sediment. This sediment was resuspended in Ca2+-free Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 2.14 mmK2HP04, 0.85 mmKH2P04, 1.2 mm MgC12, 10 mm glucose, and 2.0 mm EGTA, pH 7.2), and the platelet concentration was adjusted to 7.5 × 108/ml. Platelets were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with 0.6 nmol [3H]5-hydroxytriptamine (serotonin, [3H]5-HT)/ml (specific activity = 25.4 Ci/mmol, DuPont) (28Lapetina E.G. Silio J. Ruggiero M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7078-7083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and [3H]5-HT-labeled platelets were washed by incubation with six changes of 10 ml of Ca2+-free Locke's solution over a 60-min period. [3H]5-HT-labeled platelets were permeabilized by 5 min of treatment with 15 μm digitonin in K+-glutamate buffer (160 mm K+-glutamate, 12.5 mmMgC12, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) (29Haslam R.J. Davidson M.M.L. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Platelets were then centrifuged at 900 × g for 2 min (4 °C) and resuspended in K+-glutamate buffer. Ca2+concentrations (pCa values) were calculated as described previously (30Fabiato M. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. Paris. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (100 μl) containing 7.5 × 107permeabilized platelets in K+-glutamate buffer were stimulated with 10 μm Ca2+ for 45 s in the absence or the presence of different recombinant scinderins, a scinderin-derived actin-binding peptide, or both. Release experiments were carried out as described previously (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]5-HT output was expressed as a percentage of total content after subtraction of values for spontaneous (absence of Ca2+) release. A minimum of eight samples/condition were measured, and the means ± S.E. were plotted. Different truncations of scinderin cDNA obtained by PCR were subcloned into expression vector pTrxFus using the restriction sites as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Recombinant vectors were introduced into E. coli GI698 to express the corresponding fusion proteins. Lysates obtained from tryptophan-induced cultures showed in SDS-PAGE a new band that corresponded to each truncated scinderin (see Fig. 2). The molecular masses of these TRX fusion proteins were as follows: Sc1–4,6, 79 kDa; Sc3–6, 64 kDa; Sc3–4, 43 kDa; Sc3-½4, 34 kDa; Sc5–6, 41 kDa; ScL5–6, 40.6 kDa; Sc½5–6, 35 kDa; and Sc6, 27 kDa. A schematic representation of the position of these scinderin fragments in the scinderin molecule is shown in Fig. 1. Some fusion proteins (Sc1–4,6 and Sc3–4 to ScL5–6) were extremely well expressed amounting to more than 50% among totalE. coli proteins (Fig. 2, A and C). Because the scinderin polyclonal antibody did not recognize several scinderin fragments (only Sc1–4,6, Sc3–6, and Sc3–4 were recognized by the antibody), most Western blots (Fig. 2 B) were stained with a mouse TRX monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, CA). However, when dealing with r-Sc (Sc1–6) and Sc1–4,6 blots were stained with a scinderin polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2 D). Enterokinase does not efficiently cut TRX-Sc fusion proteins, and because scinderin is very sensitive and undergoes fast proteolysis at room temperature, all experiments were carried on with TRX-Sc fusion proteins as previously shown (9Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M. Blood. 1996; 87: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaró J.-M.

The ability of scinderin fragments to bind actin was tested using two different assays. (a) The first assay was binding to actin-DNaseI-Sepharose 4B beads. In Ca2+ containing buffer (buffer A), only two Sc-derived proteins, Sc3–6 and Sc5–6, were found to bind actin (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, once bound in the presence of 1 mmCa2+, Sc3–6 and Sc5–6 could not be eluted by a EGTA buffer (buffer B). As a matter of fact, both Sc3–6 and Sc5–6 were found to bind to actin equally well in the presence or absence (10 mm EGTA) of 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3 C). Due to the fact that the Sc3–6 and Sc5–6 could not be eluted with EGTA containing buffer, all gel wells were loaded with supernatants obtained after the Sepharose 4B beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Therefore, the presence of actin and DNase I was evident in all Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig. 3, A and B). A deletion of 16 amino acids (502–518) from the beginning of domain 5 produced ScL5–6, a fragment corresponding to amino acids 519–715 of scinderin, which did not bind actin. This suggests the presence of an actin-binding site at NH2-terminal of domain 5. Because it has been shown that domain 4 of gelsolin contains an actin-binding site (36Pope B. Maciver S. Weeds A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a set of experiments tested Sc3–4 and Sc5–6 for binding under different conditions (Fig. 3 B). These two constructs did not bind to either Sepharose 4B or Sepharose 4B-DNase I beads (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). When tested for binding to Sepharose 4B-DNase I-actin beads, only Sc5–6 was found to bind to the beads (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). (b) The second assay was co-sedimentation of recombinant truncated scinderins with actin. Here again, with the exception of Sc3–6 (data not shown) and Sc5–6, all recombinant scinderin fragments failed t"

Chem. 272, 31902–31907). We examined the nucleic acid requirement and found that only double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) effectively activated the ATPase. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) not only failed to activate the ATPase, but suppressed the dsDNA-dependent ATPase. Gel mobility shift assays showed that factor 2 formed stable complexes with dsDNA or ssDNA in the absence of ATP. However, in the presence of ATP, the interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA was destabilized, while the ssDNA-factor 2 complexes were not affected. The interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA was sensitive to increasing salt concentrations and was competed by ssDNA. In both cases, loss of binding of factor 2 to dsDNA was mirrored by a decrease in ATPase and transcript release activity, suggesting that the interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA is important in coupling the ATPase with the transcript release activity. Although the properties of factor 2 suggested that it might have helicase activity, we were unable to detect any DNA unwinding activity associated with factor 2. Drosophila factor 2, an RNA polymerase II transcript release factor, exhibits a DNA-dependent ATPase activity (Xie, Z., and Price D. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 31902–31907).

Although the properties of factor 2 suggested that it might have helicase activity, we were unable to detect any DNA unwinding activity associated with factor 2. A common mechanism employed to control the potential of RNA polymerase II to synthesize full-length transcripts is through an early elongation block. This process, referred to as abortive elongation or premature termination has been observed in various transcription systems (1Spencer C.A. Groudine M.

We observed that two distinct classes of complexes were formed after initiation. The predominant class undergoes abortive elongation which only gives rise to short transcripts, whereas the second class overcomes early blocks and carries out productive elongation. Based on our results, a model has been proposed for the control of elongation by RNA polymerase II which highlights the function of both negative and positive factors (6Kephart D.D. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2067-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). According to the model, the action of negative transcription elongation factors (N-TEF) 1The abbreviations used are: N-TEF, negative transcription elongation factors; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-strand DNA; P-TEF, positive transcription elongation factors; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TRCF, transcription repair coupling factor; bp, base pairs(s); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: N-TEF, negative transcription elongation factors; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-strand DNA; P-TEF, positive transcription elongation factors; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TRCF, transcription repair coupling factor; bp, base pairs(s); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). was responsible for the abortive elongation. The transition from abortive elongation to productive elongation was mediated by the action of positive transcription elongation factors (P-TEF). P-TEFb, one of the components of P-TEF, has recently been purified and identified as a 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole-sensitive kinase that can phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (8Marshall N.F.

One of the components of N-TEF, factor 2, was originally identified due to its ability to suppress the appearance of shorter than full-length transcripts during transcription in vitro (12Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor 2 is a 154-kDa protein that associates stably with early elongation complexes under low salt conditions, but dissociates in 1 mKCl (13Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Factor 2 causes the release of transcripts by RNA polymerase II in an ATP-dependent manner and results in premature termination (13Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the transcript release activity of factor 2 revealed that the process requires ATP hydrolysis. Non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP did not support factor 2 mediated transcript release (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The intrinsic ATPase activity of factor 2 was activated by dsDNA and did not require other protein cofactors (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All information gathered on factor 2 function suggests that ATP hydrolysis is a key reaction for the transcript release activity of factor 2, but how it associates with elongation complexes and how the ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the transcript release event is not clear. Escherichia coli termination factor rho has an RNA-dependent ATPase activity that allows the translocation of rho along nascent transcripts to track elongation complexes and unwind RNA-DNA hybrids in transcription bubbles (15Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase III termination factor La also has an ATPase activity that is dependent on RNA binding (18Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schroder H.C. Muller W.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Like rho, La causes the release of nascent transcripts by unwinding DNA-RNA hybrid using energy from ATP hydrolysis (18Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schroder H.C. Muller W.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Fan H. Sakulich A.L. Goodier J.L. Zhang X.L. Qin J. Maraia R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 707-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, E. colitranscription repair coupling factor (TRCF) that is able to release nascent transcripts from stalled RNA polymerase lacks a helicase activity (20Selby C.P. Sancar A. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Instead, TRCF interacts with DNA and may associate with elongation complexes through its interaction with DNA and RNA polymerase and cause the release of RNA polymerase and nascent transcripts by hydrolyzing ATP (20Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Though it is not clear how factor 2 associates with elongation complexes, the finding that dsDNA is able to activate the ATPase activity of factor 2 (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the observation that factor 2 is able to bind DNA affinity column 2Xie, Z., and Price, D.H., unpublished data. 2Xie, Z., and Price, D.H., unpublished data. suggest that factor 2 may bind DNA and associate with elongation complexes through the interaction with DNA template. To understand the molecular mechanism of factor 2 function, in this study we further characterized the effects of various nucleic acids on the ATPase activity of factor 2. In addition, we examined the interaction of factor 2 with DNA and its significance for the ATPase and transcript release activity of factor 2. Furthermore, we explored the potential helicase activity of factor 2. The ATPase activity of Drosophilafactor 2 was assayed by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from [γ32P]ATP as described (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immobilized dsDNA was used in the ATPase assay to examine the effect of ionic strength on the interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA. The immobilized dsDNA was generated by coupling biotinylated DNA with streptavidin-conjugated paramagnetic Dynabeads as described earlier (7Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Factor 2 was first incubated with immobilized dsDNA in the presence of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 55 mm KCl for 5 min at 25 °C. The mixture was then aliquoted, concentrated magnetically, and washed three times with HMBK buffer that contained 20 mm HEPES, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml of BSA, and KCl of indicated concentration. The resulting complexes were washed another two times with 55 mm HMBK buffer, resuspended in 55 mmHMBK buffer, aliquoted to individual reaction tubes (6 μl/each tube), and then examined for their ability to hydrolyze ATP. The ATPase assay was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of 4 × label mixture (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The ATPase reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The supernatant fractions containing the released γ32Pi and the unhydrolyzed [γ32P]ATP were isolated by magnetic concentration and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The dsDNA substrate for gel mobility shift assay was a 238-bp polymerase chain reaction product amplified from PET-21a plasmid (Novagen, Inc.). The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate was a synthetic oligo (dT)60 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Wold, University of Iowa). Both the 238-bp duplex DNA and oligo (dT)60 were 5′ end-labeled and electrophoretically purified. The binding of factor 2 with the labeled DNA was carried out in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm KCl in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm ATP at 25 °C for 20 min. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TAE buffer (40 mmTris-acetate, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA) at 100–200 V. Two kinds of helicase substrates were generated to examine the helicase activity of factor 2. One was a partial duplex DNA as described (22Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5.2 ng of 17-mer universal primer was annealed to 2 μg of ssM13 mp18 DNA by incubation in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 50 mm NaCl2at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 20 min at 65 °C and 20 min at 23 °C. The primer was extended by DNA polymerase I-Klenow fragment (10 units) in the presence of 10 μCi of [α32P]dCTP, 50 μm dATP and dGTP, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl2 at 23 °C for 20 min, then the reaction mixture was supplemented with dCTP with a final concentration of 50 μm and incubated for another 20 min. The reaction was stopped by EDTA and the free nucleotides were removed by gel filtration on a NICKTM column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The second type of substrate was a 40-bp duplex DNA made by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides, one of which was labeled by [γ32P]ATP at the 5′ end. The DNA helicase assay (10 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, DNA substrate, and factor 2. Reactions were incubated at 25 or 37 °C as indicated for 1 h, and stopped by addition of 2 μl of 0.1 m EDTA, 3% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 50% (v/v) glycerol. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% or 12% polyacrylamide gels as indicated in 45 mm Tris-borate, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, at 100–200 V. Factor 2 exhibited an ATPase activity that was dramatically stimulated by DNA (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To gain further understanding of the nucleic acid requirement, a variety of DNA and RNA molecules were examined for their effect on the ATPase activity of factor 2. A standard ATPase assay that measures the release of free phosphate from [γ32P]ATP was performed in the presence of a constant amount of different nucleic acids. The percent hydrolysis for each reaction was normalized to the low level of activity exhibited by factor 2 in the absence of any nucleic acid and is presented in Table I. Up to 100-fold stimulation was seen for dsDNA molecules of natural sequences. Supercoiled DNAs stimulated slightly more than linear molecules. When the ability of supercoiled and linear forms of either Bluescript or A2 DNA to stimulate the ATPase activity were compared, we found that supercoiled DNA increased the ATPase from 20 to 30% compared with the linear form (data not shown). Synthetic homopolymeric dsDNA, such as poly(dA)·(dT), poly(dG)·(dC), and poly(dA-dG)·(dT-dC), also stimulated the ATPase activity of factor 2, although with somewhat lower efficiency than dsDNA with natural sequences. ssDNA or dsRNA did not activate the ATPase. Partial duplex DNA poly(dC), poly(dG)12–18, or a DNA-RNA hybrid poly(I)·poly(rC) both failed to activate the ATPase. Thus, the ATPase activity of factor 2 was efficiently stimulated only by dsDNA.Table IThe ATPase activity of factor 2 can only be activated by dsDNARelative ATPase activityNo DNA1Supercoiled ds-DNA Bluescript100 pSP73100Linear ds-DNA Act5C template85 poly(dA) · poly(dT)48 poly(dG) · poly(dC)27DNA-RNA hybrid poly(dT) · poly(rA)7dsRNA poly(I) · poly(C)1Partial duplex DNA poly(dG) · poly(dC)12–181ssDNA poly(dT)10003 poly(dT)302 M13mp180 poly(dC)0ssRNA poly(A)1 Open table in a new tab We were surprised that partial duplex DNA failed to support the ATPase activity and wondered if ssDNA might be inhibitory to the ATPase activity of factor 2. When an equal amount of ssDNA was added with dsDNA we found that the ATPase activity was suppressed. Both linear ssDNA (oligo(dT)1000, poly(C)) and circular ssM13 DNA effectively suppressed the ATPase activity of factor 2 in the presence of linear dsDNA (Fig. 1 A) or supercoiled DNA (data not shown). ssRNA (poly(A)) on the other hand, did not have any effect on the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity even when added in 4-fold excess (Fig. 1 B). Since the ATPase activity of factor 2 exhibited no specific sequence requirement for the dsDNA, the conformation and structure of the DNA may be important. Supporting this idea, ethidium bromide that extends the double helices by untwisting DNA (23Pulleyblank D.E. Morgan A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 783-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) inhibited the ATPase activity of factor 2 in the presence of either linear or supercoiled dsDNA (Fig. 1 A). Since dsDNA was required for the ATPase activity of factor 2, we examined the interaction between factor 2 and dsDNA with a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 2). A 5′-end labeled 238-base pair dsDNA was used as the DNA substrate. Factor 2 formed stable complexes with the dsDNA in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2). Two complexes were observed, a major complex and a lower mobility minor complex. Results with DNAs of different length suggest that the two complexes may be different because of the number of factor 2 molecules bound (data not shown). The binding of factor 2 to the labeled DNA was competed by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled DNA (Fig. 2, last three lanes). Binding reactions were also carried out with the addition of a nucleoside triphosphate. The interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA was destabilized in the presence of ATP, but was not affected by CTP, GTP, or ATPγS. These results argued that the ATP hydrolysis by factor 2 destabilized the dsDNA-factor 2 complexes. The inhibitory effect of ssDNA on the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2 suggested that there might be an interaction between factor 2 and ssDNA. Oligo (dT)60 was as effective as oligo(dT)1000 in suppressing the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2 (data not shown) and was used as a probe to examine the interaction of factor 2 with ssDNA by gel mobility shift assay. Factor 2 bound to the oligo (dT)60 in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 3 A). Unlike the interaction between factor 2 and dsDNA, the binding of factor 2 to ssDNA was not destabilized by ATP (Fig. 3 A). Thus, ssDNA was able to bind factor 2 although the interaction failed to activate the ATPase activity of factor 2. It is possible that the ability of ssDNA to inhibit the dsDNA-activated ATPase activity of factor 2 was due to its ability to block the interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA. To test this, increasing amounts of unlabeled oligo (dT)60 were added to dsDNA binding reactions. As the ssDNA increased, the interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA was suppressed (Fig. 3 B). New complexes of lower mobility were not seen, indicating that factor 2 was not bound to both double and ssDNA at the same time. Although significant inhibition of binding was seen at a 10-fold excess of ssDNA, a 100-fold excess was required to compete most of the dsDNA binding. This is different from the earlier finding that the ATPase activity of factor 2 was dramatically inhibited when the amount of ssDNA in the reaction was the same as that of dsDNA (Fig. 1 B). This apparent inconsistency was likely caused by the effect of ATP, which destabilizes the interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA (Fig. 2) but not with ssDNA (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, in the presence of ATP, factor 2 may become trapped by ssDNA more easily than in the absence of ATP. Since the preceding results showed that ssDNA was able to compete for dsDNA binding by factor 2 and suppress the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2, we tested the effect of ssDNA on the transcript release activity of factor 2. If transcript release mediated by factor 2 is coupled to the dsDNA-activated ATPase, ssDNA should effectively inhibit the transcript release activity of factor 2. High salt-washed early elongation complexes were generated on an immobilized DNA template, and the transcript release reaction was carried out as diagrammed above Fig. 4. Released transcripts were separated from transcripts in early elongation complexes by magnetic concentration of the template. The high salt-washed early elongation complexes lack factor 2 (13Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), thus almost all of the transcripts remained associated with early elongation complexes when only ATP was added to the reaction. As was found before, transcripts were released in the presence of both factor 2 and ATP (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). However, when factor 2 was first preincubated with 15 μg/ml of ssDNA for 5 min and then incubated with the early elongation complexes in the presence of ATP, more than 70% of the transcripts remained bound to the early elongation complexes (Fig. 4 A). Almost no transcript release by factor 2 was observed when factor 2 was preincubated with 45 μg/ml of ssDNA (Fig. 4 A). These results demonstrate that ssDNA was able to suppress the transcript release activity and suggest that the ATPase activity of factor 2 is essential for the transcript release activity of factor 2. A somewhat different result was obtained when the factor 2 was preincubated with the early elongation complexes before the addition of ssDNA. Under these conditions, ssDNA was less efficient in suppressing the transcript release (Fig. 4 B). High salt-washed early elongation complexes were first incubated with factor 2 and then washed to remove unbound factor. When these complexes were treated with ATP, 85% of the associated transcripts were released, and further supplementation of factor 2 had little effect (Fig. 4 B). No suppression of transcript release was observed when 15 μg/ml of ssDNA or dsDNA was added, evidenced by the lack of increase in the number of transcripts associated with the early elongation complexes. Transcript release was partially suppressed by high levels of ssDNA but not by high levels of dsDNA (Fig. 4 B). Although the transcript release activity was partially suppressed by ssDNA, the extent of suppression was less than that seen when the ssDNA was preincubated with factor 2. These results demonstrate that prebinding factor 2 to the elongation complex lessens the inhibitory effect of ssDNA. Possible explanations are discussed later. Previous studies showed that 250 mm KCl or 0.3% Sarkosyl was able to relieve early elongation blocks and prevent premature termination of early elongation complexes (6Kephart D.D. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2067-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The effect of high salt or detergent on elongation could be due in part to a suppression of the negative activity of factor 2. To confirm this, we compared the effect of ionic strength on the ATPase and transcript release activity of factor 2. Both the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity (Fig. 5 A) and the transcript release activity (Fig. 5 B) decreased as the salt concentration increased. A quantitative comparison of these results indicates that the inhibition of both activities is similar though not identical (Fig. 5 C). Both the ATPase and transcript release activity of factor 2 were almost completely suppressed by 200 mm KCl, but the ATPase activity was more sensitive to at lower concentrations of KCl than the transcript release activity. This could be explained if the full ATPase activity is not required to release all the associated transcripts. A possible explanation for the effect of elevated levels of salt on both the ATPase and transcript release activity of factor 2 was that the salt disrupted the interaction of factor 2 with DNA. To examine this possibility, factor 2 was first incubated with immobilized DNA, and the resulting DNA-factor 2 complexes were washed with increasing concentrations of KCl. After washing back to 50 mm KCl, the ATPase activity remaining was measured. Previous studies showed that the ATPase activity was proportional to the amount of factor 2 at a fixed amount of dsDNA (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with the result from gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 2), a substantial amount of factor 2 remained bound to the immobilized template at 50 mm KCl. In contrast to the effects on the ATPase and transcript release activities, 60% of the factor 2 remained bound even when washed with 200 mm KCl. Elimination of the electrostatic interaction of factor 2 with dsDNA was accomplished only after washing with 1m KCl. These results indicate that 200 mm KCl can suppress the ATPase and transcript release activities of factor 2 without significantly disrupting the interaction of the factor with the DNA. Since factor 2 was able to bind dsDNA and hydrolyze ATP, we investigated whether the factor was able to utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind duplex DNA. We first used a conventional helicase assay that utilized a labeled 24-nucleotide oligonucleotide annealed to M13 DNA. In the presence of ATP, the 24-mer was readily released by a bona fide DNA helicase, SV40 large T antigen, but not by factor 2 (Fig. 6 A). To eliminate the possibility that the potential helicase activity was inhibited by ssDNA, we also examined the ability of factor 2 to first bind and then unwind a 40-bp DNA duplex. A gel mobility shift assay indicated that factor 2 was able to bind the 40-bp duplex (Fig. 6 B). As was found previously, the binding was destabilized by ATP, suggesting that the short DNA was able to activate the ATPase activity of factor 2 (Fig. 6 B). Indeed, the ATPase assay demonstrated this directly (data not shown). Even though factor 2 bound to the DNA fragment and exhibited ATPase activity, it failed to unwind the dsDNA either at 25 °C (Fig. 6 C) or 37 °C (data not shown). These results suggest that factor 2 does not have a DNA helicase activity. Factor 2 was identified as a component of N-TEF that was able to block transcription elongation by promoting the release of nascent transcripts in an ATP-dependent manner (13Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further study revealed that factor 2 had a DNA-dependent ATPase activity (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the ATPase activity with respect to nucleic acid requirement and explored the possibility of associated helicase activities. In addition, a correlation was made between the ATPase and the transcript release activity of the factor. The results indicate that factor 2 possesses a unique collection of properties. Characterization of the effect of nucleic acids on the ATPase activity of factor 2 distinguished it from almost all other proteins. Only dsDNA effectively supported the ATPase activity, with supercoiled DNA having a slightly higher efficiency compared with linearized DNA. ssDNA not only failed to activate but actually suppressed the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2. The strict requirement of dsDNA for ATPase activity has only been observed for RuvB protein from eubacteria Thermus thermophilus and Thermotoga martima (25Tong J. Wetmur J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Studies of T. thermophilus RuvB suggests that is involved in recombinational DNA repair and the homologous genetic recombination process (25Tong J. Wetmur J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The involvement of factor 2 in these processes has not been determined. The inhibitory effect of ssDNA on the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2 has not been observed for other proteins; however, uncovering the significance of this property to factor 2 function will require further investigation. The strict requirement of dsDNA for the ATPase activity of factor 2 suggested that double helical structure of DNA is an essential element in activating the ATPase. ssDNA was able to bind factor 2 but failed to activate the ATPase. dsRNA or DNA-RNA hybrid that adopts the A-form helical structure also failed to activate the ATPase. Since dsDNA is usually in the B-form helical structure, it is tempting to speculate that only the typical B-form helical structure of dsDNA is competent to activate the ATPase. Indeed, this may provide a possible explanation for why a double-stranded homopolymer had a lower efficiency in activating the ATPase activity of factor 2 compared with dsDNA with natural sequence (Table I). Poly(dA)·(dT) and poly(dG)·(dC) has been shown to adopt a helical conformation that is quite different from the typical B-form DNA (26Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1981; 292: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27Peck L.J. Wang J.C. Nature. 1981; 292: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Ethidium bromide, which intercalates within dsDNA and untwists the DNA helix, was also found to suppress the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2 (Fig. 1 A). All of these findings support the hypothesis that B-form helical structure of DNA is important for activating the ATPase activity of factor 2. DNA structure, especially that altered by protein factors, may play an important role in controlling the action of factor 2. The binding of factor 2 to dsDNA seems to be a primary requirement for the transcript release activity of factor 2, and we propose that factor 2 initially associates with the elongation complex through interaction with the template. When the interaction between factor 2 and dsDNA was blocked by ssDNA, the transcript release was also inhibited (Fig. 4). ssRNA, however, did not stimulate or suppress the ATPase activity (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that factor 2 does not bind to RNA and may not associate with the elongation complex through nascent RNA. This assumption was also reached from our previous finding that factor 2 was able to release very short transcripts which are sequestered within the ternary complexes and not accessible to factor 2. Recent characterization of factor 2 function using a dC-tailed template suggested that the dsDNA upstream of the elongation complexes was required for the transcript release activity of factor 2 (14Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is possible that not only the binding of factor 2 with dsDNA but also its appropriate orientation to elongation complexes is necessary to effectively couple the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of factor 2 with its transcript release activity. The effect of ssDNA on the properties of factor 2 can be used in understanding some aspects of factor 2 function. Direct binding of factor 2 to dsDNA in the absence of ATP as measured with a gel mobility shift assay was efficiently competed only with a 100-fold excess of ssDNA. However the ATPase activity of factor 2 was about 100 times more sensitive to ssDNA. Since ATP weakens the association of factor 2 with dsDNA but not with ssDNA, it is likely that ssDNA traps factor 2 when both dsDNA and ATP are present. The effect of ssDNA on transcript release also supported this notion. ssDNA had a greater inhibitory effect on transcript release when it was preincubated with factor 2, presumably because the factor 2 complexed with ssDNA was unable to bind to the template. Although ssDNA was able to inhibit transcript release when the factor 2 was prebound to the template, it was required in about a 10-fold excess over the dsDNA. This is a significantly higher single strand/double strand ratio than was required in the ATPase assay even though both assays contained ATP. There are several explanations for the relative resistance to inhibition by ssDNA of transcript release compared with the ATPase activity. One possibility for the lower efficiency of ssDNA inhibition in transcript release is that factor 2 may interact not only with dsDNA but also with other protein factors in the elongation complexes. Therefore, even in the presence of ATP, more ssDNA may be required to dissociate factor 2 from elongation complexes and suppress its transcript release activity. Another interesting possibility is that factor 2 may exhibit an ATP-dependent translocation along dsDNA. In this way, ATP could cause factor 2 to release dsDNA by causing it to run off the end of the fragment. Translocation along the template would be impeded by proteins including RNA polymerase II ternary complexes. Perhaps the mechanism of termination involves the translocation of factor 2 into the trailing edge of the polymerase. If the translocation model is correct, ssDNA would be less effective at inhibiting transcript release because factor 2 is not released from the template until after it has caused transcript release. An alternative model for the effect of ATP is that it may cause direct release of factor 2 from the template. Since factor 2 associated tightly with dsDNA in the absence of ATP, destabilization of the dsDNA-factor 2 complexes by ATP may be necessary to reduce the nonspecific retention of factor 2 on dsDNA and facilitate its search for stalled RNA polymerase. However, this model does not explain the relative resistance of transcript release to ssDNA. In addition, factor 2 would be quite inefficient in localizing non-processive elongating polymerase and mediating transcript release. Perhaps more likely is an intermediate model in which factor 2 scans the template for a period of time and then dissociates from the template. Reassociation and resuming of scanning would be the normal pathway for transcript release and this process would be inhibited by ssDNA. The intermediate inhibition by ssDNA of transcript release could mirror the balance between processive scanning and transient interaction. More detailed kinetic experiments will be required to verify or differentiate between the models. The effect of elevated salt on the transcript release activity of factor 2 correlated with the effect on the ATPase activity but did not correlate with release of factor 2 from dsDNA. At 200 mmKCl, factor 2 remained associated with the template but was not active in transcript release, presumably because the ATPase activity was inhibited. Factor 2 may be responsible for our previous unpublished results which indicated that early elongation complexes would lengthen transcripts in the presence of 250 mm KCl but would stop if the salt was lowered. Evidently, at intermediate salt concentrations, factor 2 remains bound to the template but does not function. This easily accessible state, in which factor 2 is bound but not active, suggests that a mechanism for regulation of factor 2 transcript release activity may exist. Perhaps other protein factors can interact with factor 2 and cause it to adopt the inactive bound state. Such interactions may be important in regulating the selectivity of factor 2 so that the action of factor 2 is restricted to non-productive elongation complexes. Biochemical characterization of factor 2 shows that it shares multiple properties with the TRCF. Like E. coli TRCF protein Mfd, (20Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), factor 2 has an associated ATPase and ATP-dependent transcript release activity, binds to dsDNA, and lacks an apparent helicase activity. However, ERCC 6 lacks one of the major features of E. coli TRCF, the ability to dissociate the stalled RNA polymerase II complexes. It has been argued that RNA polymerase II stalled by DNA lesion may not necessarily be dissociated by eucaryotic TRCF but may be removed from damaged sites through the action of SII or other unknown factors (28Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 30Hanawalt P.C. Donahue B.A. Sweder K.S. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 518-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Though the multiple biochemical properties shared between factor 2 and E. coli TRCF suggests that factor 2 may be a homologue of eucaryotic TRCF, more in vitro and in vivo functional study of factor 2 will be required to justify its cellular function. In summary, characterization of the enzymatic activity of factor 2 and its interaction with DNA provided further insights into the mechanism of factor 2 action. Compared with other known transcription termination factors, factor 2 may utilize a novel mechanism for transcript release. Unlike E. coli termination factor rho (15Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H.

Instead, our results indicate that factor 2 is likely recruited to the elongation complex through interactions with the template DNA. Although a strong correlation between the ATPase activity and transcript release activity of factor has been made, the mechanism of transcript release remains to be determined.

A characteristic neuropathological feature of AD is the senile plaque, which contains β-amyloid (Aβ), a 39–43 amino acid peptide derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type I integral transmembrane protein whose cellular function is unknown (1Hardy J. Allsop D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 383-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Located on chromosome 21, the gene encoding APP is alternatively-spliced, and several isoforms of differing amino acid lengths are expressed. Genetic studies have revealed mutations in the coding region of APP genes isolated from a small minority of affected individuals with early onset familial AD, and it has been shown that one of these mutations, the Swedish double mutation, leads to secretion of elevated levels of Aβ (3Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 4Cai X.-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that increased or abnormal Aβ production plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. While it is clear that generation of Aβ necessarily involves two proteolytic cleavages of APP: one in the extracellular domain and another in the transmembrane region, how APP is converted to Aβ in terms of proteolytic enzymes involved, cellular location of these cleavage events, and factors regulating its production remain to be determined (2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). An alternative proteolytic cleavage by another unidentified enzyme (referred to as α-secretase) thought to reside on or near the plasma membrane leads to production of a large soluble fragment (APPs) comprised of most of the APP extracellular domain (5Esch F. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 6Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Significantly, this proteolysis occurs within the Aβ peptide, thus precluding its formation.More recently, genetic studies have shown that mutations in two other related integral membrane proteins, presenilin 1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), are associated with a much larger fraction of familial AD cases (7Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Hardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2095-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These multitransmembrane-spanning proteins have a broad tissue distribution but little is known about their normal biological roles. A significant fraction of presenilin molecules are found in the endoplasmic reticulum; and at steady-state, the most abundant forms of the molecules appear to be ∼30-kDa (NH2-terminal) and ∼20-kDa (COOH-terminal) proteolytic fragments. A clue to the role of PS-1 and PS-2 in the pathogenesis of AD is that expression of presenilins containing naturally-occurring familial AD mutations seems to increase the amount of larger 42–43-amino acid forms of Aβ generated (8Hardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2095-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These data support the idea that presenilins influence the metabolism of APP. However, whether PS-1 or PS-2 directly regulate the proteolytic processing of APP analogous to the regulation of the proteolytic processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins by a cleavage activating protein, SCAP (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar), or by indirect effects on APP trafficking or proteolysis is unclear.Analysis of APP trafficking in nonpolarized cells indicates that APP is transported to the cell surface via the constitutive biosynthetic pathway where it can be either cleaved by α-secretase to generate APPs or internalized and eventually degraded in lysosomes to yield amyloidogenic peptide fragments (10Haass C.

Studies of APP-TR chimeras suggest that the APP cytoplasmic tail contains two active internalization signals, GYENPTY and YTSI, and that both are involved in lysosomal targeting (13Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Several independent studies of the trafficking of APP in MDCK cells, a well characterized polarized epithelial cell line, have shown that APPs and Aβ are preferentially released into the basolateral medium (14Haass C.

One group also demonstrated that at steady-state >80% of plasma membrane-associated APP resides on the basolateral surface (14Haass C. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and subsequently showed that Tyr-653, the tyrosine residue of the YTSI internalization signal was important for basolateral expression (17Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, based on the observation that APPs derived from a tail-less mutant of APP was still secreted into the basolateral medium, De Strooper et al. (15De Strooper B. Craessaerts K. Dewachter I. Moechars D. Greenberg B. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) concluded that the most important basolateral sorting signal was located in the extracellular domain. Later, however, the same group reported that the cytoplasmic tail of APP was sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the basolateral surface (18De Strooper B. Craessaerts K. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30310-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). None of these studies addressed the question of whether basolateral sorting of APP occurred in the biosynthetic or endocytic pathways or both.In this study, we have employed quantitative assays to analyze polarized trafficking of APP-TR chimeric molecules in MDCK cells in the absence of competing processing events such as APPsrelease. We show that polarized sorting of APP-TR in both the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways is important for its steady-state surface distribution. The basolateral sorting signal in the APP cytoplasmic tail is dependent on the tyrosine residue of the YTSI internalization signal but is not identical to this signal.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized the trafficking of APP-TR chimeras in MDCK cells with the objective of defining the role of the APP cytoplasmic tail in signal-dependent polarized trafficking. This approach only gives information about sorting signals in the cytoplasmic domain of APP, but has the major advantage that quantitative biochemical assays can be employed to study trafficking in both the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways of MDCK cells. Earlier studies showed that APP is selectively expressed on the basolateral surface of MDCK cells (14Haass C. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, whether newly synthesized APP were directly targeted to the basolateral surface was not determined. Although several groups showed that APPs generated from newly synthesized APP was selectively secreted into the basolateral medium (14Haass C. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15De Strooper B. Craessaerts K. Dewachter I. Moechars D. Greenberg B. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30966-30973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subsequent work has shown that the polarized secretion of APPs occurs independently of the selective basolateral targeting of intact membrane-bound APP (17Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consequently, the basolateral secretion of APPs cannot be used as evidence that newly synthesized APP is directly targeted from the biosynthetic pathway to the basolateral surface. Thus, the results we report here showing that the polarized phenotype of APP-TR chimeras is generated by selective sorting of newly synthesized molecules from the biosynthetic pathway to the basolateral surface provide the first direct evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of APP contains a basolateral sorting signal that is recognized in the biosynthetic pathway of MDCK cells.Our results also provide strong evidence that polarized trafficking of APP along the endocytic pathway is important for maintenance of the steady-state basolateral expression of APP observed in earlier studies (14Haass C. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and represents a potentially significant issue not previously addressed in earlier reports. After delivery to the basolateral surface, APP-TR chimeras are rapidly internalized with ∼50% of surface receptors residing in the endocytic pathway at steady state. The small fraction of APP-TR chimeras displayed on the apical surface are also internalized and enter the endocytic pathway. Regardless of whether they originated from the basolateral or apical surface, internalized APP-TR chimeras share a common fate. Although a significant fraction of the internalized APP-TR chimeras (20–30%) is degraded as was previously shown for APP-TR chimeras expressed in CEF (13Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the majority are selectively sorted to the basolateral surface. The efficiency with which undegraded APP-TR chimeras internalized from the basolateral surface were recycled back to the same surface was ∼90%, a value similar to that reported for recycling of wild-type TR back to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells (19Odorizzi C.G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transcytosis of APP-TR from the apical to basolateral surface was somewhat lower (∼70%) and may reflect signal-independent recycling of apically internalized chimeras from endosomal elements proximal to the apical surface. Evidence for such a recycling pathway was obtained from studies of the apical to basolateral transcytosis of human TR in MDCK cells that occurs with approximately the same efficiency (19Odorizzi C.G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Morphological studies employing Tf-horseradish peroxidase and B3/25-gold as tracers confirmed that APP-TR chimeras are internalized from the basolateral surface as these tracers were found in a variety of intracellular membrane structures including tubulo-vesicular endosomal elements extending into the apical cytoplasm, internal membranes of multivesicular bodies, lysosomes, as well as 60-nm diameter vesicles. These observations can be interpreted in light of recent electron microscopic studies of wild-type TR trafficking in polarized MDCK cells using Tf-horseradish peroxidase and B3/25-gold as tracers. In these studies, which additionally took advantage of the strong signal of a TR-horseradish peroxidase chimera in which the extracellular domain of the receptor was replaced with horseradish peroxidase, it was shown that the apical and basolateral endosomes of MDCK cells are extensively interconnected and that these endosomal elements are readily accessible to receptors internalized from either the basolateral or apical surface (19Odorizzi C.G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It was also established that recycling TRs are delivered from endosomes to the basolateral border by a distinctive subset of 60-nm diameter exocytotic vesicles.In this study, APP-TR chimeras were found in similar tubulo-vesicular endosomal elements and 60-nm diameter vesicles suggesting that the chimeras internalized from either the apical or basolateral surface enter the same interconnected endosomal system as TR and are selectively delivered to the basolateral surface by 60-nm diameter transport vesicles. However, experiments to directly establish this point were not feasible because of the relatively weak labeling obtained with the Tf-horseradish peroxidase and B3/25-gold tracers bound to internalized APP-TR chimeras compared with wild-type TR. In contrast to TR, APP-TR chimeras were also found on the internal membranes of multivesicular bodies and in mature lysosomes consistent with the biochemical evidence derived from MDCK cells and CEF (13Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) demonstrating that a significant fraction of internalized chimeras is degraded. Previous work has shown that internalized epidermal growth factor receptors destined for degradation in lysosomes are sorted from recycling receptors through spatial segregation in multivesicular bodies (39Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and it appears that APP-TR chimeras are targeted to lysosomes by a similar process. Similarly, earlier studies by Yamazakiet al. (40Yamazaki T. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a significant fraction of internalized APP was found in multivesicular bodies and lysosomes in nonpolarized cells. Although our morphological studies together with the finding that 20–30% of Tf bound to internalized APP-TR chimeras is degraded establish that APP-TR chimeras traffic from the plasma membrane to lysosomes, it is also possible that a fraction of newly synthesized chimeras are targeted to lysosomes by a direct intracellular route as described for some lysosomal membrane glycoproteins and the major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain (41Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 42Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C. Collawn J.F. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 44Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).We have also analyzed the APP cytoplasmic sorting signals that determine the trafficking of APP-TR chimeras in MDCK cells. Previous studies of the steady state distribution of wild-type and mutant APP molecules on MDCK cells had established that the basolateral expression of APP was dependent on Tyr-653 (17Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the tyrosine residue that is important for the activity of the YTSI internalization signal located in the APP cytoplasmic domain (13Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, whereas Haass et al. (17Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) found that mutant APP molecules lacking most the cytoplasmic domain were randomly distributed on the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized MDCK cells, De Strooper et al. (15De Strooper B. Craessaerts K. Dewachter I. Moechars D. Greenberg B. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) concluded that the major basolateral sorting signal of APP was located in the external domain of the molecule based on the polarized secretion of APPs. Although De Strooper et al. (18De Strooper B. Craessaerts K. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30310-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) subsequently reported that the cytoplasmic domain of APP was sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells, the sorting signals present in the cytoplasmic domain of APP that determine trafficking of the molecule in MDCK cells remain poorly defined. We have shown here that the cytoplasmic domain of APP contains a basolateral sorting signal that is dependent on Tyr-653, confirming the work of Haass et al. (17Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the APP basolateral sorting signal is distinct from the YTSI internalization signal because its activity is not dependent on the isoleucine residue. Finally we have shown that efficient targeting of APP-TR chimeras to lysosomes requires that both tyrosine-based internalization signals, YTSI and GYENPTY, in the APP cytoplasmic domain be active in accordance with results of degradation of APP-TR chimeras in CEF (13Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).In summary, we have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of APP contains a tyrosine-dependent basolateral sorting signal that is active in the basolateral and endocytic pathways of MDCK cells. APP-TR chimeras are targeted directly from the biosynthetic pathway to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells but basolateral sorting of chimeras in the endocytic pathway is important for maintenance of the polarized phenotype. The discovery that mutations in presenilins are associated with a majority of familial Alzheimer's cases and that these molecules are expressed predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum has currently led to efforts to determine whether Aβ production can be generated in the endoplasmic reticulum under direct regulation by presenilins. However, the relationship between presenilins and Aβ production is still unclear as is the role of APP trafficking. Studies of the basic cell biology of both molecules may lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the two molecules and their physiological roles.

A characteristic neuropathological feature of AD is the senile plaque, which contains β-amyloid (Aβ), a 39–43 amino acid peptide derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type I integral transmembrane protein whose cellular function is unknown (1Hardy J. Allsop D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 383-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Located on chromosome 21, the gene encoding APP is alternatively-spliced, and several isoforms of differing amino acid lengths are expressed. Genetic studies have revealed mutations in the coding region of APP genes isolated from a small minority of affected individuals with early onset familial AD, and it has been shown that one of these mutations, the Swedish double mutation, leads to secretion of elevated levels of Aβ (3Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 4Cai X.-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that increased or abnormal Aβ production plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. While it is clear that generation of Aβ necessarily involves two proteolytic cleavages of APP: one in the extracellular domain and another in the transmembrane region, how APP is converted to Aβ in terms of proteolytic enzymes involved, cellular location of these cleavage events, and factors regulating its production remain to be determined (2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). An alternative proteolytic cleavage by another unidentified enzyme (referred to as α-secretase) thought to reside on or near the plasma membrane leads to production of a large soluble fragment (APPs) comprised of most of the APP extracellular domain (5Esch F. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 6Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Significantly, this proteolysis occurs within the Aβ peptide, thus precluding its formation. More recently, genetic studies have shown that mutations in two other related integral membrane proteins, presenilin 1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), are associated with a much larger fraction of familial AD cases (7Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Hardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2095-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These multitransmembrane-spanning proteins have a broad tissue distribution but little is known about their normal biological roles. A significant fraction of presenilin molecules are found in the endoplasmic reticulum; and at steady-state, the most abundant forms of the molecules appear to be ∼30-kDa (NH2-terminal) and ∼20-kDa (COOH-terminal) proteolytic fragments. A clue to the role of PS-1 and PS-2 in the pathogenesis of AD is that expression of presenilins containing naturally-occurring familial AD mutations seems to increase the amount of larger 42–43-amino acid forms of Aβ generated (8Hardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2095-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These data support the idea that presenilins influence the metabolism of APP. However, whether PS-1 or PS-2 directly regulate the proteolytic processing of APP analogous to the regulation of the proteolytic processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins by a cleavage activating protein, SCAP (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar), or by indirect effects on APP trafficking or proteolysis is unclear. Analysis of APP trafficking in nonpolarized cells indicates that APP is transported to the cell surface via the constitutive biosynthetic pathway where it can be either cleaved by α-secretase to generate APPs or internalized and eventually degraded in lysosomes to yield amyloidogenic peptide fragments (10Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 11Norstedt C. Caporaso G.L. Thyberg J. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Studies of APP-TR chimeras suggest that the APP cytoplasmic tail contains two active internalization signals, GYENPTY and YTSI, and that both are involved in lysosomal targeting (13Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 19"

The abundance and variety of proteases—enzymes designed for cleaving proteins—underscore their importance. Proteases are classified according to their mechanism of action and their structure. Those that require zinc for their activity belong to a large family of metalloproteases that are grouped into subfamilies on the basis of their zinc binding site and overall protein structures (1). Reprolysins and astacins are two of these subfamilies. Recent, exciting reports have identified members of these subfamilies from Drosophila and demonstrated that their proteolytic activity is crucial for early patterning of the embryo (2–4)."
