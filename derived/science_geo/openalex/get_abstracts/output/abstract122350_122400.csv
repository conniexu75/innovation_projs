The product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), structurally homologous to the anticoagulant protein S, was recently identified as the ligand for Axl and Sky, but the ligand for Mer remained unknown. We have now obtained evidence that Gas6 can also function as a ligand for Mer. Co-precipitation analysis, using soluble receptors of Axl, Sky, and Mer (Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc) composed of the extracellular domain of receptors fused to the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1, clearly showed that Gas6, but not protein S, specifically bound to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc fusion proteins. Quantitative kinetic analyses using a BIAcore biosensor instrument revealed dissociation constants (Kd) of the binding of rat Gas6 to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc are 0.4, 2.7, and 29 nM, respectively. We also found that Gas6 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Axl, Sky, and Mer receptors ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gas6 is a common ligand for Axl, Sky, and Mer, all known members of an Axl/Sky receptor subfamily.

Receptor tyrosine kinases play important roles in transducing signals from the extracellular environment, and this leads to a variety of cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar, 2Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev.

Although a number of receptor tyrosine kinases have been identified, some are “orphan” receptors, the ligands of which remain unknown. In view of the pivotal role of receptor tyrosine kinases in cell to cell signaling, further searches are warranted for novel members of receptor tyrosine kinases and the ligands for these receptors need to be identified. On the basis of sequence similarities, known receptor tyrosine kinases are classified into >10 distinct subfamilies (2Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The Axl/Sky receptor subfamily is one of these subfamilies, including Axl (also called Ark and Ufo) (3O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A.

The members of this subfamily are typified by characteristic extracellular domains. They are composed of two Ig-like motifs and two fibronectin type III motifs, which have similarity to those found in cell adhesion molecules such as neural cell adhesion molecules and receptor tyrosine phosphatases (14Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J.

Gas6 was previously isolated as a gene product inducibly expressed in fibroblasts in response to serum starvation and has a structure similar to that of protein S, a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein with anticoagulant activity with 43% amino acid identity (21Manfioletti G.

We and others subsequently demonstrated that Gas6 can also bind to Sky and stimulate the tyrosine autophosphorylation of Sky (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J. Nakano T. Arita H. Tsuda H. Suzuki K.

Hence, it is “probable” that Gas6, but not protein S, is a ligand for Sky, and Gas6 “may” also be a common ligand for Axl and Sky, two related receptors. However, to provide compelling evidence for this notion, it is important to quantitatively test the binding affinity of Gas6 to these receptors by side by side experiments. More importantly, whether or not Gas6 or protein S can bind to Mer, another member of an Axl/Sky receptor family, needs to be determined since the ligand for Mer has not been identified. the protein product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 Chinese hamster ovary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resonance unit. In the present study, we examined the binding ability of Gas6 and protein S to Axl, Sky, and Mer, three members of the Axl/Sky receptor subfamily. We also examined whether Gas6 would stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors. The cDNA encoding rat Gas6 was cloned as described elsewhere (25Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human Gas6 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using a cDNA library from human smooth muscle cells as a template. The cDNAs were subcloned into the PUC-SRα expression vector, and the constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells using liposome methods as described previously (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J.

Cells were cultured for 3 days in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 μM vitamin K2 (Menatetrenone, Eisai, Tokyo). Recombinant rat and human Gas6 were purified using methods described elsewhere (25Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol.

Suzuki (26Suzuki K. Nishioka J. Hashimoto S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the purified Gas6 and protein S were determined by amino acid analyses. The purity and quantity of these proteins were also estimated by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for Sky, Gas6, and protein S were prepared and purified as described previously (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J. Nakano T. Arita H. Tsuda H. Suzuki K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22681-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody (9E10) and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa), respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated goat affinity-purified antibody to human IgG-Fc was purchased from Organon Teknika (Durham). Sky- and Met-Fc fusion proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and purified as described previously (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J. Nakano T. Arita H. Tsuda H. Suzuki K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22681-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding human Axl was obtained from Dr. A. Sugimura (Pharmaceutical Research Center, Toyobo Co. Ltd.). The cDNA for mouse c-Mer was cloned by low stringency hybridization using as a probe chicken c-Eyk cDNA. The cDNA fragment coding for the extracellular domain of human Axl (amino acid residues 1-438) or mouse Mer (residues 1-498) was ligated in-frame with the polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragment of the Fc region (residues 216-443) of human IgG1, resulting in the production of the cDNA coding for the Axl- or Mer-Fc fusion protein with a spacer sequence Ser-Ser-Val-Pro-Gly. The fused cDNAs were subcloned into PUC-SRα expression vector and transfected into COS-7 cells using the liposome method. The serum-free conditioned media of COS cells were collected for 3 days, and the Fc fusion proteins were purified by protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography. Gas6 or protein S was incubated at 4°C overnight with 5 nM each receptor-Fc fusion protein and protein A-Sepharose (30 μl of 50% slurry) in 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.02% NaN3, and 1% bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation, the precipitates were washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in SDS-sampling buffer, and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J.

Immunoblot analysis with anti-Gas6 or anti-protein S antibody was performed as described previously (27Toshima J. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Purified receptor-Fc fusion protein (0.7 μg) was immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip on a BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia) using procedures described in the manual supplied by the manufacturer. Gas6 or protein S was dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.02% NaN3, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and passed over the immobilized Fc fusion protein at a flow rate of 2 μl/min for 25 min. Binding of the ligand with Fc fusion protein was monitored in real time by the increase in the relative resonance unit (RU) in the sensorgram. The surface of the sensor chip was regenerated by elution of 15 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 2.3), containing 0.15 M NaCl. The rate constants of association (ka) and dissociation (kd) and dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated using the software supplied by the manufacturer and the procedure of Karlsson et al. (29Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), which is based on the expression dR/dt = kaCRmax− (kaC + kd)Rt, where Rmax is the maximum RU response at saturation of receptor-Fc with bound analyte, Rt is the response at time t, and C is the concentration of injected analyte. A plot of dR/dt versus Rt gives a line with slope −(kaC + kd), which is equal to −ks. If ks is plotted against C, the resulting slope is equal to ka. The dissociation rate constant kd is given by the first-order rate equation dR/dt = kdRt when the analyte flowing across the flow cell has been replaced with buffer. Integration of the rate equation gives ln(Rt1/Rtn) = kd(tn− t1), and a plot of ln(Rt1/Rtn) versus t for the initial dissociation rate yields a line with slope of −kd. The dissociation constant (Kd) was subsequently determined by kd/ka. The CHO cell line expressing human Sky (B31) was constructed as described previously (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J. Nakano T.

The cDNA encoding Myc-tagged Axl or Mer receptor (Axl-Myc or Mer-Myc) was constructed to generate the full-length sequence of human Axl or mouse Mer with the Myc epitope peptide (EQKLISEEDL) at the C terminus, using procedures similar to those described elsewhere (30Okano I.

The cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI or NotI site of the pUcD2SRα expression vector containing the neomycin-resistant gene (31Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Nakai T. Yokota S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Orii T. Fujiki Y. Sakai F. Bogaki A. Yasumo H. Osumi T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was transfected into CHO cells using liposome methods, and the G418-resistant colonies were selected. Cell lines with high expression of Axl-Myc (AM3) or Mer-Myc (MM14), as measured by immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc epitope antibody (9E10), were selected. B31, AM3, or MM14 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were serum-starved and treated with rat or human Gas6 for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were rinsed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM orthovanadate and lysed with cold lysis buffer (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J. Nakano T. Arita H. Tsuda H. Suzuki K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22681-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sky (Sky-C) or anti-Myc antibodies (9E10), run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20), as described previously (23Ohashi K.

To characterize and compare in parallel experiments the binding potential of Gas6 and protein S to three distinct members (Axl, Sky, and Mer) of an Axl/Sky receptor subfamily, we prepared chimeric soluble receptors (Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc) composed of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of these receptors fused to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 heavy chain. As a control, we also prepared Met-Fc, a chimeric protein composed of the extracellular domain of c-Met (receptor for hepatocyte growth factor) and the Fc region of IgG1. Receptor-Fc fusion proteins were expressed in COS cells and purified from the conditioned media by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Western blot analyses with anti-Fc antibody indicated that the receptor-Fc fusion proteins were expressed as a disulfide-linked homodimer molecule (data not shown), as previously noted for other IgG fusion proteins (32Bennett B.D.

Luis E.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26166-26171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity adsorption and co-precipitation analysis using receptor-Fc fusion proteins in the presence of protein A-Sepharose clearly showed that both Axl- and Sky-Fc co-precipitated rat Gas6 protein (Fig. 1A). Binding of Gas6 to Mer-Fc was faintly detected after a longer exposure, but binding to Met-Fc was not detected. To demonstrate more clearly the specific binding of Gas6 to Mer-Fc, higher concentrations of Gas6 were incubated with Mer-Fc, and the binding to Mer-Fc was examined in comparison with the binding to control Met-Fc. As shown in Fig. 1B, Mer-Fc, but not Met-Fc, specifically co-precipitated Gas6 at 40 nM. Thus, it appeared that Gas6 could specifically bind to Axl-, Sky-, and Mer-Fc fusion proteins, but not to Met-Fc. Based on the intensity of the immunoreactive Gas6 co-precipitated with Fc fusion proteins, the Gas6 binding affinities of these receptors were suspected to be in the order of Axl>Sky>Mer. Under similar conditions, protein S did not co-precipitate with any of the receptor-Fc fusion proteins examined (Fig. 1C). To further define the specific binding of Gas6 to Axl, Sky, and Mer receptors, we analyzed binding interactions between them using a BIAcore Biosensor instrument. Receptor-Fc fusion proteins were immobilized on the surface of a BIAcore sensor chip, and then Gas6 or protein S was passed over the sensor chip. Binding was measured as the increase in RUs. As shown in Fig. 2A, lane 1, rat Gas6 (20 nM) bound to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc at 4448, 1815, 100 RUs, respectively, but not to control Met-Fc. When a higher concentration (100 nM) of rat Gas6 was used, specific binding to Mer-Fc, but not to Met-Fc, was evident (Fig. 2B, lane 1). We next examined the binding potential of human Gas6 to these receptor-Fc fusion proteins. Human Gas6 bound to human Axl-Fc and human Sky-Fc at 1813 and 473 RUs, respectively, but specific binding to either mouse Mer-Fc or control Met-Fc was not observed (Fig. 2, lane 2). Thus, in spite of species coincidence, human Gas6 rather than rat Gas6 bound less tightly to human Axl-Fc and human Sky-Fc. No specific binding of human protein S was detected for Axl-, Sky-, or Mer-Fc fusion protein (Fig. 2, lane 3). When the concentrated conditioned media of COS cells transfected with rat protein S cDNA (containing about 120 nM rat protein S) were passed over the surface immobilized with mouse Mer-Fc, an increase in RUs was never evident (data not shown). To quantitate binding affinities of Gas6 to these receptors, various concentrations of rat or human Gas6 were passed over the sensor chip immobilized with each receptor-Fc fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 3, the amounts of Gas6 bound to the Fc fusion protein were monitored in real time, as an increase in RUs in the sensorgram. Table I summarizes ka and kd values as well as calculated dissociation constants (Kd) for the binding interactions between Gas6 and receptor-Fc fusion proteins. Correlating with the results given above, Axl-Fc bound rat Gas6 with the highest binding affinity, the Kd value being 0.4 nM. The affinity of Sky-Fc was intermediate with a Kd value of 2.7 nM, and Mer-Fc bound with the lowest affinity with a Kd of 29.0 nM. The binding affinity of human Gas6 to human Axl-Fc or human Sky-Fc was lower than that of the rat counterpart, and specific binding of human Gas6 to mouse Mer-Fc was not observed (Table I).Table I.Kinetic constants and dissociation constants of binding interactions between Gas6 and receptor-Fc fusion proteins, as measured using a BIAcore instrumentReceptor-FcLigandkakdKdM−1·s−1s−1nMHuman Ax1-FcRat Gas67.5 × 1043.4 × 10−50.4Human Gas61.5 × 1051.6 × 10−41.0Human Sky-FcRat Gas62.0 × 1055.6 × 10−42.7Human Gas62.3 × 1062.5 × 10−310.8Mouse Mer-FcRat Gas63.2 × 1049.3 × 10−429.0Human Gas6NDaSpecific binding was not detected when 100 nM of human Gas6 was passed over the surface immobilized with mouse Mer-Fc.NDaSpecific binding was not detected when 100 nM of human Gas6 was passed over the surface immobilized with mouse Mer-Fc.NDaSpecific binding was not detected when 100 nM of human Gas6 was passed over the surface immobilized with mouse Mer-Fc.a Specific binding was not detected when 100 nM of human Gas6 was passed over the surface immobilized with mouse Mer-Fc. Open table in a new tab We recently reported that rat Gas6 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky stably expressed in CHO cells (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J. Nakano T. Arita H. Tsuda H. Suzuki K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22681-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we constructed CHO cell lines ectopically expressing the C-terminal direction Myc epitope-tagged Axl (Axl-Myc) and Mer (Mer-Myc) and examined whether Gas6 would stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors. The tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody after immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with anti-Sky or anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, tyrosine phosphorylation of human Sky and Axl-Myc was induced when the cells were treated with rat or human Gas6, and tyrosine phosphorylation of mouse Mer-Myc was induced by the treatment with rat Gas6. No phosphorylation of mouse Mer-Myc was detected by human Gas6 even at 100 nM (data not shown). Correlating with the binding affinities determined by BIAcore analyses, higher concentrations of rat Gas6 were needed for activation of Mer, and rat Gas6 has more potent stimulating activity to human Sky and human Axl than does human Gas6. To determine whether or not extracellular domains of Axl, Sky, and Mer have homophilic binding ability, as in the case of neural cell adhesion molecules and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (14Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J.

There was, however, no increase seen for any of the combinations of receptor-Fc fusion proteins, indicating that they had no homophilic or heterophilic binding activity, at least under the conditions of our experimental setup (data not shown). Various groups of researchers reported ligands for the two related receptor tyrosine kinases, Axl and Sky, but conclusions as to the ligand-receptor relationships in these reports were inconsistent. Gas6 was first identified as the ligand for Axl, based on intraspecies (human-human) ligand-receptor interactions (19Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliott G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.-W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J. Yanagihara D. Bennett L. Sylber M. Merewether L.A. Tseng A. Escobar E. Liu E.T. Yamane H.K. Nature. 1995; 373: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Stitt et al. (20Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L.

In contrast to this report, we and others subsequently reported that human protein S was unable to bind to human Sky, and alternatively, Gas6 bound to Sky (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Toshima J. Nakano T. Arita H. Tsuda H. Suzuki K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22681-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Godowski P.J. Mark M.R. Chen J. Sadick M.D. Raab H. Hammonds R.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The inability of intraspecies (human-human) ligand-receptor interactions between protein S and Sky suggested that protein S could not function as a natural ligand for Sky. Thus, Gas6, but not protein S, seems to be the ligand for the two related receptors, Axl and Sky. In the present work, we characterized in side by side experiments, the binding potential of rat and human Gas6 and protein S to three members of an Axl/Sky receptor family, human Axl, human Sky, and mouse Mer. Human Gas6 bound to human Axl and human Sky, and rat Gas6 (which is closely related to mouse Gas6, with 94% amino acid identity) bound to mouse Mer. Based on observations of binding of Gas6 to Axl, Sky, and Mer within the same or closely related species, together with the activity of Gas6 to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors, we concluded that Gas6 is a ligand for these three receptors. On the other hand, human protein S had no detectable binding ability to either human Axl-Fc or human Sky-Fc, and rat protein S had no binding ability to mouse Mer-Fc. Therefore, it is unlikely that protein S is a ligand for any of these receptors. Rat Gas6 appears to be a better ligand than human Gas6 for human Axl and Sky receptors, the reason of which remains unknown. Since the concentrations of rat and human Gas6 were accurately determined by amino acid analyses, this observation is not due to the mis-estimation of their concentrations. It is probable that some of the residues characteristic to “rat” Gas6 contribute to its high-affinity binding to these receptors. Quantitative analysis using the BIAcore instrument revealed differences in binding affinities of Gas6 to Axl, Sky, and Mer. Gas6 binds to Axl with a higher affinity and preferentially stimulates Axl. Together with the finding that the axl gene, similar to the gas6 gene, is expressed widely in various tissues, Axl appears to be the primarily relevant receptor for Gas6. On the other hand, since Sky is predominantly expressed in neurons in the brain and Gas6 is to some extent expressed in the brain, Gas6 in the brain may play a specific role on neurons through the stimulation of Sky. Gas6-induced activation of Mer, although its binding affinity to Gas6 is relatively low, may have an important role in particular cells or tissues or under certain physiological conditions. Thus, Gas6 may exhibit diverse functions through three distinct receptors, Axl, Sky, and Mer, in cell- and tissue-dependent manners. Further studies will reveal the roles of Axl, Sky, and Mer as the receptors for Gas6, and the physiological significance of receptor redundancy will be better understood. The receptor redundancy for a single ligand is also seen for ligands of other receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), a member of a neurotrophin family, preferentially binds to the TrkC receptor but also binds to two related receptors, TrkA and TrkB, albeit with a lesser affinity (35Barbacid M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 442-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In this case, there exist ligands that preferentially bind to these receptors, nerve growth factor for TrkA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) for TrkB. Similarly, LERK2 (ligand for Eph-related kinase-2) binds to three distinct members of an Eph-related receptor family, Cek5, Cek10, and Elk, and there is another ligand, Elf-2, for these receptors (36Friedman G.C. O'Leary D.D.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In many cases, there usually are multiple ligands for related receptors, even when they share one ligand. Thus one can assume the existence of the Gas6-related proteins. It will be of interest to search for Gas6-related proteins that may function as the preferable ligand for Mer or Sky. Gas6 was previously identified in NIH3T3 cells as being one of the genes induced by serum starvation, but little is known of its biological functions. Gas6 was recently isolated from conditioned media of rat vascular smooth muscle cells and was found to be a growth-potentiating factor for thrombin-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (25Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Gas6 in itself has no mitogenic activity to these cells but does enhance the mitogenic activity of calcium ion-mobilizing growth factors such as thrombin or lysophosphatidic acid. Goruppi et al. (37Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 471-480PubMed Google Scholar) have just reported that Gas6 has mitogenic activity to NIH3T3 cells, when these cells are cultured in the presence of 0.5% fetal calf serum, and survival activity was apparent under completely serum-starved conditions (37Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 471-480PubMed Google Scholar). Such being the case, Gas6 may support or potentiate the mitogenic activity of other growth factors and/or protect the cells from apoptotic death, under conditions of absence of growth factors. In light of the findings that receptor tyrosine kinases can transduce various types of signals such as differentiation, survival, and neuronal axon guidance as well as proliferation, Gas6 may function not only as a growth regulator but also as a regulator for cell differentiation or cell type-specific functions. In summary, we report here clear evidence for ligand-receptor relationships between two members of a protein S/Gas6 family and three members of an Axl/Sky receptor family. Identification of Axl, Sky, and Mer, as receptors for Gas6, provides a framework for future studies to elucidate the physiological functions of Gas6. We thank Dr. Y. Fujiki and M. Ohara for helpful comments, Dr. A. Sugimura for the human Axl cDNA, and Drs. H. Tsuda and K. Suzuki for human protein S."

Hemostasis is the blood clotting process that, when functioning properly, occurs when an injury to the vasculature leads to a series of vasculomotor and cellular reactions and the activation of the blood coagulation cascade. The latter process is initiated via the extrinsic pathway, leading first to thrombin activation and then massively amplified thrombin activation due to the positive feedback of the intrinsic pathway (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways merge at the factor X activation step. An imbalance between these clotting processes, clotting inactivation processes (protein C inactivation of hemostasis cofactors), and thrombolytic processes (tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen) can lead to thrombotic or bleeding disorders. Antithrombotics include inhibitors of thrombin, factor Xa and factor IXa, factors involved in both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (2Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W.

We present here the crystal structure of the factor Xa·DX-9065a complex. The inhibitor binds in the active site in an extended conformation, which was expected from earlier studies (14Lin Z. Johnson M.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Stubbs M. Huber R. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions characterize the complex formation, which is also accompanied by local rearrangements in the active site of fXa. Considering these subtle interactions and the unpredictable ligand-induced motions involved in binding, there is clearly a need for a series of fXa-ligand complex structures to provide adequate information for structure-based drug design and an understanding of how fXa recognizes physiological substrates. fX was isolated from human plasma; des-Gla-fX was produced via chymotryptic cleavage (removing amino acids L1-L44; chymotrypsinogen numbering is used for the catalytic domain; the sequential fX numbering, which is used for the light chain, will be indicated by the prefix “L”). Subsequently, fX was activated with the purified factor X activator from Russell's viper venom, resulting in des-Gla-fXa. The inhibitor DX-9065a (Fig. 1) was prepared as described previously (12Hara T. Yokoyama A. Ishihara H. Yokoyama Y. Nagahara T. Iwamoto M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Initial crystals were obtained by a fine pH screen (0.1 M MES/OH, pH 5.8, 10 mM CaCl, 18% polyethylene glycol 6000) after 2 weeks. These first rod-like crystals were orthorhombic, with cell constants a = 56.93 Å, b = 73.17 Å, and c = 79.08 Å and α = β = γ = 90.0, but diffracted weakly. Seeding techniques improved both size (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.4 mm3) and intrinsic order. Data to 2.8 Å were collected on a Siemens multiwire area detector and processed with SAINT data reduction software (16Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 383-387Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The final data set used in refinement included reflections to 3.0-Å resolution with completeness of 85% and Rmerge of 31% in the outer shell. The crystals belong to the space group P212121 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Patterson search techniques (17Hoppe W. Acta Crystallogr. 1957; 10: 750-751Google Scholar, 18Rossmann M.

The model (without addition of water molecules) has been refined to a crystallographic R-value of 19.7% (Rfree = 26.1%) with good stereochemistry (root mean square deviation of bonds = 0.009 Å and angles = 2.2° from ideality (22Engh R. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar)). We describe here the structure of the complex of Daiichi inhibitor DX-9065a in des-Gla-fXa, i.e. the catalytic serine protease domain and both the EGF2 (proximate to the catalytic domain) and the EGF1 domains. The protein is thus identical to that of the tetragonal fXa crystal structure previously described (23Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Park C. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D. Cardin A. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 24Brandstetter H. Röntgenkristallographische Untersuchungen an Enzymen des Blutgerinnungssystems..Ph.D. thesis. Technische Universität Munchen, 1994Google Scholar). Differences between the structures thus arise from the different crystal packing interactions or different ligand interactions (calcium and inhibitor) and can usually be attributed to the most local cause; the extent to which apparent ligand-induced structural changes determine crystal packing interactions and vice versa remains ambiguous. In the case of the tetragonal fXa crystal structure, the crystal packing interaction between the S1 specificity pocket and the EGF2 C-terminal Arg residue of a symmetry-related fXa molecule is simultaneously an enzyme-ligand interaction. This arginine binding interaction is eliminated in the fXa·DX-9065a structure. Similarly, the presence of calcium in the orthorhombic fXa·DX-9065a structure is associated simultaneously with differences in structure and with different crystal packing interactions. The EGF1 domain, disordered in the tetragonal, arginine-bound crystal form, was suggested to become ordered in the presence of calcium (24Brandstetter H. Röntgenkristallographische Untersuchungen an Enzymen des Blutgerinnungssystems..Ph.D. thesis. Technische Universität Munchen, 1994Google Scholar). However, the orthorhombic crystals of fXa·DX-9065a grown at 10 mM calcium also show apparent disorder of the EGF1 domain. Furthermore, the crystal packing of the two crystal forms is not compatible with a unique EGF1 orientation (relative to EGF2). The tetragonal crystal packing of arginine-bound fXa suggested an extended EGF2-EGF1 arrangement similar to the one observed in fIXa (25Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In contrast, the orthorhombic crystal structure of fXa·DX-9065a allows only two alternate orientations, both of which result in a compact, globular quarternary fold with EGF1 in contact with the catalytic domain. This arrangement can be excluded for the tetragonal crystal. This is evidence against a rigid factor X module arrangement in solution or physiologically at the membrane surface. Rather, several conformations seem possible that may be physiologically important (possibly distinguishing, for example, fX as substrate and fXa as an enzyme). This is consistent with fluorescence energy transfer measurements that indicate that the distance of the active site to the membrane changes significantly upon cofactor (fVa) binding (26Husten E. Esmon C. Johnson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a change is not observed in the analogous experiment with fIXa and cofactor VIIIa (27Mutucumarana V. Duffy E. Lollar P. Johnson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium-binding site in the catalytic domain is conserved in factor X, and studies based on synthetic factor X peptides suggest that the calcium-binding site participates in the prothrombinase complex (28Chattopadhyay A. James H.L. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12323-12329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This site is well characterized in trypsin and other serine proteinases (29Bode W. Schwager P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 693-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar): calcium binding induces an ordering transition in the ligating residues, i.e. the side chains of Asp-70 and Glu-80 as well as the carbonyl groups of Asn-72 and Ala-75. In the fXa·DX-9065a structure, all these residues are ordered, and there is density at the expected calcium position, indicating at least partial occupation of the calcium-binding site. The tetragonal, arginine-bound fXa crystal structure differs somewhat in the calcium loop, but the differences are confined largely to side chains at the binding site and a 1-2-Å rigid shift of the loop (residues 72-79). A hydrogen bond (Thr-73NH-Thr-153CO) links the calcium-binding loop with the autolysis loop, and local differences in the structures might be correlated with calcium binding. There is no obvious correlation extending to the inhibitor-binding site or elsewhere, however; further crystallographic studies may clarify this. In the tetragonal crystal form, the C-terminal Arg-138 of EGF2 binds into the active site of a neighboring, symmetry-equivalent molecule. Although this seems likely to affect the conformation of this segment, we observe only minor differences in the last three residues, Leu-L136, Glu-L137, and Arg-L138. Also in the orthorhombic crystal structure, the latter has symmetry contacts with Arg-222 of the catalytic domain. The binding of DX-9065a to fXa is characterized by two general interaction sites (Fig. 2, Fig. 3): the naphthamidine group occupies the S1 pocket, while the pyrrolidine binds in the fXa-specific aryl-binding site. Notably, Gly-216 (S3) does not contribute to binding by hydrogen bond formation; this is in contrast to natural substrate/inhibitor binding geometries as well as the vast majority of synthetic inhibitor complexes with serine proteinases. The lack of binding in the S2 site is consistent with the selectivity of fXa for glycine in position P2 since S2 is almost entirely blocked by Tyr-99.Fig. 3Binding interactions of DX-9065a with fXa. The Cα plot and side chains involved in inhibitor binding of DX-9065a-bound fXa (yellow) are superimposed with the corresponding atoms of arginine-bound fXa (turquoise). The ligand-induced structural changes at the S1-binding site may be seen at the side chain of Asp-189 and along the main chain at Gln-192. The hydrophobic sleeve at the aryl-binding site (S4) is also apparent, with the cation hole formed by Glu-97 and the carbonyl oxygens of Glu-97 and Lys-96 at the back.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding in the S1 site, as expected, involves formation of a salt bridge between the naphthamidine amidino group and Asp-189. The orientation of the amidino group would allow a twin-twin arrangement (30Singh J. Thornton J. Snarey M. Campbell S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) if Asp-189 were fixed as in the arginine-bound fXa structure (23Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Park C. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D. Cardin A. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar); twin-twin geometry has been observed for naphthamidine binding in thrombin (31Engh R. Brandstetter H. Sucher G. Baumann U. Kühne A. Eichinger A. Bode W. Huber R. Poll T. Rudolph R. von der Saal W. Structure. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and trypsin (15Stubbs M. Huber R. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the aspartic acid side chain apparently moves, mainly by a χ2 rotation of almost 90°, away from its original position, resulting in a single Asp Oδ1-twin (naphthamidine) arrangement (Fig. 3). Oδ2 of Asp-189 is directed toward the amides of Gly-184 (3.8 Å) and Gly-226 (3.5 Å). This new binding geometry involving a ligand-induced structural change of Asp-189 has only recently been observed in thrombin (24Brandstetter H. Röntgenkristallographische Untersuchungen an Enzymen des Blutgerinnungssystems..Ph.D. thesis. Technische Universität Munchen, 1994Google Scholar). The carbonyl oxygen of Gly-219 forms a hydrogen bond with the amidino group (2.6 Å). No water molecules were apparent in the electron density map to function as a hydrogen-bonding ligand to the other oxygen of Asp-189. This may be a consequence of the medium resolution of the diffraction data. A second and perhaps more surprising ligand-induced structural change is the movement of the main chain of Gln-192-Gly-193 of almost 2 Å toward the naphthamidine group (Fig. 3). This change results from the accumulation of several small dihedral changes of Ala-190-Ser-195. This constricts the S1 pocket, perhaps counter-intuitively due to the larger size of naphthamidine compared, for example, with benzamidine. However, the larger and more rigid ring system would leave a cavity at the entrance to the S1 pocket (Gln-192), unsuitable for a water molecule without such a movement. Since this conformational rearrangement involves a part of the oxyanion hole that has been observed in a single rigid conformation, a significant quantity of energy must be supplied by naphthamidine binding. This may be derived from the hydrophobic interaction of Gln-192 with the naphthamidine itself. Additionally, the binding energy of the aryl-binding site interactions may contribute due to overall stiffness of DX-9065a. In any case, the movement is apparently characteristic of naphthamidine binding in trypsin-like serine proteinases since a corresponding structure was also observed in naphthamidine binding in thrombin (31Engh R. Brandstetter H. Sucher G. Baumann U. Kühne A. Eichinger A. Bode W. Huber R. Poll T. Rudolph R. von der Saal W. Structure. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and trypsin (15Stubbs M. Huber R. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This supports the hypothesis that the energy required derives from the naphthamidine interaction itself. The second major anchoring interaction of DX-9065a involves the substituted pyrrolidine ring, which ideally fills the deep “aryl-binding site.” The pyrrolidine ring is almost completely buried by a perpendicular “two-sandwich” arrangement: the aromatic ring systems of Phe-174 and Tyr-99 are both parallel to the pyrrolidine, while the aliphatic part of the Glu-97 side chain and Trp-215 additionally cover the pyrrolidine group from perpendicular orientations. The side chains of Phe-174, Tyr-99, and Glu-97 differ from those in the tetragonal, arginine-bound crystal structure (Fig. 3); however, the side chain of Glu-97 is not perfectly defined in the electron density map and probably occupies more than one conformation. The χ2 rotation of Tyr-99 and Phe-174 apparently optimizes the hydrophobic stacking arrangement with the pyrrolidine. Similar to naphthamidine binding in the S1 pocket, the interaction in the aryl-binding site is not solely hydrophobic in character. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of Lys-96 and Glu-97 together with the Glu-97 side chain form a “nitrogen-cation hole” or simply “cation hole,” analogous to the oxyanion hole of the catalytic site. The cation hole interacts with the delocalized positive charge of the pyrrolidine ring and the charged acetimidoyl group pointing toward Glu-97. The electron density map indicates that the chiral center of the pyrrolidine is in the S-configuration (Fig. 2), as expected from the synthesis of the enantiomerically pure compound (Fig. 1). It is clear from the electron density map that the enantiomer with an S-configuration of the propionic acid binds the enzyme. The charge of the propionic acid is not involved in a direct ionic interaction, but is exposed to solvent, reminiscent of the sulfonyl group of the NAPAP/TAPAP inhibitor series (34Brandstetter H. Turk D. Hoeffken H. Grosse D. Sturzebecher J. Martin P. Edwards B. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nϵ2 of Gln-192 forms a weak hydrogen bond with propionic acid (4.1 Å), while Oϵ1 interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg-143, i.e. the side chain of Gln-192 forms an ionic bridge between the propionic acid and Arg-143. The center of the phenyl ring almost coincides with Cα of the D-Phe residue of a superimposed D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone-thrombin complex structure. An aromatic ring system is advantageous entropically as a spacer between S1 and the aryl-binding site (S4) since it restricts the conformational degrees of freedom of the compound. This structure demonstrates the feasibility of ignoring hydrogen bonding at Gly-216. Thus, the geometric restraints of binding in the S1 and aryl-binding pockets should allow considerable variation of this spacer in inhibitor design. The physiological role of fXa within the blood coagulation cascade consists of activation of prothrombin to thrombin and, as a form of positive feedback within the extrinsic pathway, activation of factor VII. There is, however, an ongoing debate about the physiologically relevant fVII activator since fVIIa, fIXa, and thrombin can also activate fVII to fVIIa in vitro (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Prothrombin activation occurs by two cleavages. The more rapid cleavage takes place at Arg-323-Ile-324 (designated as prothrombin species 2 in Table I), so meizothrombin accumulates as the principal intermediate of the activation reaction under physiological conditions (35Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the resulting two chains remain disulfide-linked, the proteolytically fully active meizothrombin remains membrane-bound (analogous to fVIIa, fIXa, fXa, or activated protein C) and is released only with the second cleavage (Arg-274-Thr-275).Table I.Prothrombin and factor VII cleavage sites of factor Xa as well as factor Xa autocleavage sites in the 148-loopP6P5P4P3P2P1P1′P2′P3′P4′P5′P6′pt human 1apt, prothrombin.RAIEGRTATSEYpt bovine 1AAIEGRTSEDHFpt mouse 1DCLEGRCAMDLGpt rat 1DCLEGRCAMDLGpt chicken 1EEIAGRTIFQEFpt hagfish 1VQLSGRSEGAAEpt human 2SYIDGRIVEGSDpt bovine 2SYIEGRIVEGQDpt mouse 2SYIDGRIVEGWDpt rat 2SYIDGRIVEGWDpt chicken 2SYMGGRVVHGNDp hagfish 2RSYDGRVVHGDNfVII humanSKPQGRIVGGKVfVII bovineSKPQGRIVGGHVfVII rabbitSNPQGRIVGGKVfX human autoTHEKGRQSTRLKfX blovine autoTHEKGRLSSTLKfX chicken autoEFEAGRLSKRLKa pt, prothrombin. Open table in a new tab The two ligand-induced motions of the S1 site, namely the aspartic acid 189 rotamer transition and a rigid body motion of residues of the oxyanion hole, have also been observed in recent thrombin-inhibitor complexes (24Brandstetter H. Röntgenkristallographische Untersuchungen an Enzymen des Blutgerinnungssystems..Ph.D. thesis. Technische Universität Munchen, 1994Google Scholar, 31Engh R. Brandstetter H. Sucher G. Baumann U. Kühne A. Eichinger A. Bode W. Huber R. Poll T. Rudolph R. von der Saal W. Structure. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The oxyanion hole remains intact, so motions of the main chain including residues 190-195 might also be induced by attractive polar interactions with the carbonyl group of natural substrates. Alternatively, ligand or cofactor binding might induce motions of this segment and alter substrate recognition. Thus, this motion may have physiological relevance as well. The S2 site is hardly accessible to bulky substrate residues. The 60-loop is in direct contact with the 99-loop, partly via the polar interaction of the system of Tyr-60 with Lys-96 (3 Å) and partly via a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Tyr-60 and the amine of Lys-90. In its low energy conformation, Tyr-99 then blocks access to the S2 site for any side chain, which is consistent with the natural substrate specificity of fXa (Table I). The S2 site of fXa, and in particular Tyr-99, should not, however, be considered absolutely rigid; a strong binding ligand may provide the energy necessary to move Tyr-99 and allow access in an expanded S2 site. This is reflected by the fact that fXa can cleave fVIII at thrombin-specific activation sites (36Lollar P. Knutson G. Fass D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The S2 site of fXa is in stark contrast to that of fIXa, where the 60-loop (with identical length) opens a large channel for P2 and possibly also other substrate residues. The structural basis for the observed difference of the 60-loop in both enzymes is probably related to the missing Tyr-60 (and its stabilizing interactions) in fIXa. The clear preference for glycine at P2 for fXa substrates, the clear preferences for other residues at P2 for thrombin and fIXa substrates, and the conservation of Gly at this position in the limited number of fVII sequences available are evidence for a physiological role of fXa as activator of fVII. While the identities of the primed site residues at the activation site of serine proteases are restricted by structural requirements, the conservation of unprimed site residues, if real, most likely reflects requirements for substrate recognition. Alternatively, conservation of a sequence less optimal for thrombin or fIXa cleavage might arise from a need to limit cleavage rates for these enzymes if required by the dynamics of the coagulation reactions. The P3 residue typically forms a two-rung antiparallel β-ladder with Gly-216 and by this constraint leaves the side chain of an L-amino acid exposed to solvent. Therefore, we expect a preference for hydrophilic residues at P3. The propionic acid in DX-9065a mimics P3 in this respect. It should be emphasized that conservation observed in cleavage sites may not necessarily imply a special binding interaction, but may reflect other requirements of the substrate; this is certainly the case with the P1′, P2′, and P4′ residues of prothrombin species 2 and fVII cleavage sites as they are critical for the activation mechanism (37Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 38Bode W. Schwager P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The deep aryl-binding site (S4) is also distinctive with its surrounding carbonyl groups (from Lys-96 and Glu-97) together with the side chain of Glu-97. The importance of the cation hole for the recognition of physiological substrates has not been established. This structure suggests that besides hydrophobic residues (such as Ile), histidine in particular should be an ideal candidate for binding at the S4 site, although the sequential position on a substrate might not correspond to P4, considering the structure of thrombin-fibrinopeptide A (39Stubbs M. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar): this site can also be occupied by substrate residue Pn, where n may be different from 4 (n ≥ 4). The entire main chain of the autolysis loop (Arg-143-Arg-154) can be traced clearly in the electron density map; Arg-150 is the only side chain in this region with weak density. This segment contains two Gly-Arg motifs (positions 142-143 and 149-150) and was obviously autodigested in the inhibitor-free crystals, possibly accounting for the 3 months required for crystal growth. The main chain conformation of the loop is similar to the one in fIXa, which is identical in length. However, Lys-148 is not oriented toward the active site, but is exposed to the solvent. The guanidinium group of Arg-143 bridges Oϵ1 of Gln-192 (2.7 Å) and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-149 (2.9 Å). The autolysis loop is further strengthened by a hydrogen bond of Gln-151 Nϵ2 with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-40. This leaves only Arg-150-Ser-151 accessible as a scissile bond for initial autoproteolysis. From a comparison of the sequences in Table I, one should expect that Glu-147, which is found at position P4, will bind in the S4 site. This is in conflict with our analysis of the S4 recognition site and a preference for hydrophobic or basic residues. The apparent contradiction may be resolved by a docking experiment of the autolysis loop in the active site (Fig. 4). Interestingly, considering the discussion of residue specificity above, we find His-145 (P5) in a rotamer conformation nearly perfectly adapted for binding to the aryl-binding site in an autocatalytic cleavage event. But since several examples are known where the substrate undergoes a significant rearrangement upon binding to the active site (“induced fit”), interpretation of this observation requires caution. The structure of the complex of fXa with the specific and tightly binding DX-9065a inhibitor shows several illuminating and rather surprising details. The major interaction sites are, as expected, S1 with the naphthamidine and S4 with the pyrrolidine (15Stubbs M. Huber R. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The first interaction was expected to be dominated by the salt bridge of the amidine with Asp-189; however, the structural rearrangements show (consistent with the lack of any detectable water in the S1 pocket) the important hydrophobic contribution to binding. In addition, the reorientation of the Asp-189 side chain apparently does not optimize the electrostatic interaction. Conversely, the binding at the aryl-binding site shows significant electrostatic interaction in addition to the hydrophobic binding. In this way, a kind of symmetry between the two binding sites emerges. This is consistent with the success of fXa inhibitors such as the bisbenzamidine derivatives (40Gabriel B. Bisbenzamidine als Inhibitoren von Faktor Xa und verwandten Serinproteasen.Diploma thesis. Universität Regensburg, 1996Google Scholar). Furthermore, this structure serves as a general paradigm in that it demonstrates simultaneously the potential and the limitations of studying inhibitor binding in model enzymes. We thank Dr. Milton T. Stubbs for stimulating scientific discussions."

The release of AA for prostaglandin synthesis in response to various stimuli has been reported to be due to the activation of cPLA2 or sPLA2 species. sPLA2 can hydrolyze phospholipids containing different fatty acids at the sn-2-position, requires millimolar Ca2+ concentrations for activation, and is sensitive to disulfide reducing agents (3Schalkwijk C.G. Marki F. Van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cPLA2 selectively hydrolyzes phospholipids containing AA at the sn-2-position, is activated by micromolar Ca2+ concentrations, and is not sensitive to disulfide reducing agents (4Channon J.Y.

However, recent studies have provided evidence for cPLA2 activation independent of MAP kinase in human platelets in response to the thrombin agonist SFLLRN (11Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F.

Our previous findings in the VSMC of rabbit aorta that PGI2 synthesis elicited by activation of α1 and α2 AR was attenuated by the calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor W-7 (2Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1113-1124PubMed Google Scholar) raises the possibility that Ca2+/CaM might stimulate cPLA2 directly or indirectly via activation of CaM kinase II or MAP kinase. CaM kinase II is abundant in the brain and has been implicated in neurotransmitter release (13Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that CaM kinase IIα is also expressed in VSMC and report for the first time that CaM kinase II promotes MAP kinase-induced activation of cPLA2. We further show that, upon NE treatment, cPLA2 translocates to the nucleus along with CaM kinase II and MAP kinase. [3H]AA (100 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN.

Male New Zealand rabbits (1-2 kg) were anesthetized with 30 mg/kg pentobarbital (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and the thorax and abdomen were opened by a midline incision. The aorta was rapidly removed, and VSMC were isolated as described previously (15Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 254: 633-640PubMed Google Scholar). Cells between four and eight passages were plated in 12 or 24 wells or 100-mm plates. Cells were maintained under 5% CO2 in M-199 medium (Sigma) with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% FBS. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against the translation initiation sites of cPLA2, sPLA2, CaM kinase IIα, and MAP kinase were designed (Table I). VSMC were transfected with sense and/or antisense oligonucleotides complexed with 4 μg/ml of lipofectamine and incubated in serum-free M-199 for 6 h.

Open table in a new tab After transient transfection, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and exposed to NE in balanced salt solution containing BSA for 15 min at 37°C. 3H released into extracellular medium and that remaining in the VSMC was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Total radioactivity in the cells was determined after treating the cells with 1 M NaOH overnight. 3H released into the medium was expressed as percentage of the total cellular radioactivity and referred to as fractional release. Cells grown in 100-mm plates were arrested for 24 h and stimulated with or without NE and lysed in HEPES buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (350 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The concentration of protein was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). PLA2 activity in lysates of VSMC fractions (20-30 μg of protein/assay) was measured using [14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine as substrate as described previously (16Leslie C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 11 μl of radiolabeled phospholipid stock was dried under N2 and added to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture (9 μM dioleoylglycerol, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA) and sonicated for 15 min on ice. The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 25 μg of protein from cell lysate was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 ml of Dole's reagent (2-propanol, heptane, 0.5 M H2SO4, 20:5:1), and then 1.5 ml of heptane and 1 ml of water containing 20 μg of unlabeled AA were added and mixed. The heptane phase containing radiolabeled fatty acid was passed through a silicic acid chromatography column (Sep-Pak silica cartridges; Waters chromatography, Milford, MA). The eluates were collected in a scintillation vial and air-dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry using a high flash point LSC mixture (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). CaM kinase II activity was assayed in cell lysates using CaM kinase II assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) utilizing a peptide substrate (KKALRRQETVDAL) with relative selectivity for CaM kinase II. The reaction mixture containing 10 μl of substrate mixture, 10 μl of a mixture containing inhibitors of other Ser/Thr kinases such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C, and 10 μl of Mg2+/ATP mixture containing γ-32P was incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The phosphorylated substrate was separated from the residual [γ-32P]ATP using p81 phosphocellulose paper. The papers were washed twice in 0.75% H3PO4 and then in acetone for 2 min, and the bound radioactivity was quantified with a scintillation counter. Blanks to correct for nonspecific binding of [γ-32P]ATP and its breakdown products to the phosphocellulose paper and controls for phosphorylation of endogenous proteins in the sample were performed, and CaM kinase II activity was expressed as pmol/min/mg protein. The activity of MAP kinase was determined in cell lysates of the VSMC with a BIOTRAK kit (Amersham), using a peptide substrate relatively selective for CaM kinase II (KRELVEPLTPAGEAPNQALLR). Transfer of γ-32P of ATP to the Thr on the substrate was measured. Cells were homogenized in buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris. For each assay, 5 μl of Mg[32P]ATP buffer, 15 μl of sample (10 μg of protein), 10 μl of substrate buffer were added and incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by adding a stop reagent, and 30 μl of this mixture was spotted onto phosphocellulose discs. The papers were gently washed with 75 mM orthophosphoric acid or 1% acetic acid for 2 min and with distilled water, and radioactively was determined. Enzyme activity was expressed as pmol/min/mg protein. VSMC were washed three times with phosphate-free DMEM and then prelabeled for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate (300 μCi/ml) along with inhibitors and treated with NE (10 μM) for 10 min. The cells were quickly washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immersed in a slurry of ice and ethanol. The cells were scraped and sonicated in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and phosphatase inhibitors (5 μM phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, β-glycerophosphate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and sodium vanadate). The amount of protein was adjusted to 1 mg/ml and split into two halves. One half was incubated with rat monoclonal CaM kinase IIα antibody, and the other half was incubated with mouse IgG for 4 h at 4°C and then with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. The immunoprecipitate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min, and the pellets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phosphatase inhibitor. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and autoradiography. Phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody (New England Biolabs) that detects phosphorylated Tyr residues of p44 and p42 MAP kinases but does not appreciably cross-react with the unphosphorylated forms was used. Lysates from cells that were stimulated by NE in the presence or absence of inhibitors were resolved on an SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were processed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins (500 μg) from control and NE-treated samples in the presence and absence of inhibitors were incubated with 5 μl of ERK-1 and CaM kinase II antibody or anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 4°C. The immune complexes were captured by protein A-agarose beads and washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM EGTA, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% aprotinin). The pellets were suspended in 50 μl of protein kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and assayed for MAP kinase and CaM kinase II as described above. Lysates from transfectants and parental cells were prepared in buffer. Samples containing 30 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before transfer to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked with 3% BSA in TBS at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated for 2 h with primary monoclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution). The blots were developed using biotinylated secondary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase, and signals were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham). Western blotting experiments were carried out at least three times on the transfectants. Cells were grown to approximately 70% confluency on chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) and arrested for 24 h. Then the cells were washed with 1 ml of balanced salt solution containing CaCl2 and treated with NE (10 μM) for 10 min in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ or okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor. Cells were fixed in cold methanol:acetone solution (1:1) for 3 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed in TBS and blocked in TBS containing 3% BSA for 30 min. Monoclonal antibodies (cPLA2 or CaM kinase II or MAP kinase, diluted 200-fold with 3% BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST)) were applied to each well. After 1 h, the cells were washed three times (10 min each) and exposed to tetramethyl rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution). After a 45-min incubation in the dark, the cells were washed three times (10 min each) with TBST and rinsed quickly with water. 10 μl of Galvetol (Sigma) was applied to the cell surface, and coverslips were mounted. Controls were carried out, replacing the primary antibody with IgG. Nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Slides were viewed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC-1000 Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging system using an argon/krypton lamp) with a × 100 objective lens. Rabbit aortic VSMC contain α1 and α2 AR, and both are coupled to prostacyclin synthesis (2Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1113-1124PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of AR agonist NE on release of AA from tissue lipids, the [3H]AA-labeled VSMC were incubated for different time periods with NE, which acts on both α1 and α2 AR. The release of [3H]AA and its metabolites into the medium and the cell content of tritium were measured. NE enhanced release of [3H]AA in a time-dependent manner, with the maximal release at 15 min (Fig. 1). NE was more efficacious than methoxamine, an α1 AR agonist, and UK-14304, an α2 AR agonist (data not shown). To delineate the type of PLA2 involved in the release of AA in response to NE, antisense oligonucleotides directed against the translation initiation sites of cPLA2 and sPLA2 were used. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides have been successfully targeted to inhibit c-Myb, c-Fos, c-Myc, and many other signal transduction and effector molecules including PLA2 (17Stein C.A. Cheng Y.C. Science. 1993; 261: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides penetrate the cell membrane easily and allow sequence-specific inhibition of the processes of translation of mRNA into protein. Moreover, they are more stable to endo- and exonucleases that degrade naked DNA. However, antisense oligonucleotides may also act by a nonantisense mechanism, particularly when continuous four-G-nucleotide sequences occur (18Burgess T.L. Fisher E.F. Ross S.L. Bready J.V. Qian Y. Bayewitch L.A. Cohen A.M. Herrera C.J. Hu S.F. Kramer T.B. Lott F.D. Martin F.H. Pierce G.F. Simonet L. Farrell C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). After careful consideration of the above criteria, antisense oligonucleotides directed against translation initiation sites of cPLA2, sPLA2, CaM kinase II, and MAP kinase were designed (Table I). The PLA2 antisense oligonucleotide has been used to block lipopolysaccharide- and platelet-activating factor induced prostaglandin production in macrophage-like P388D1 cells (19Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21875-21882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin production in monocytes (20Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VSMC were transfected with either cPLA2 or sPLA2 sense and antisense oligonucleotides complexed with lipofectamine (4 μg/ml) and incubated with medium (Opti-MEM from Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h. Thereafter, fresh M-199 medium containing 10% FBS was added, and the cells were incubated for another 18 h. Treatment of VSMC with cPLA2, but not with sPLA2, antisense oligonucleotides decreased the release of [3H]AA elicited by NE. The inhibitory effect of cPLA2 antisense on [3H]AA release elicited by NE did not occur when VSMC cotransfected with cPLA2 sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 2A). The effect of cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides on PLA2 activity was also examined. VSMC transfected with sense or antisense oligonucleotides were exposed to NE for 15 min, and cell lysates were prepared to study AA release from [14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 2B). The results show that in cells exposed to NE there was an increase in the hydrolysis of [14C] arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine by the cell lysate over the unstimulated control cells. Transfection of VSMC with cPLA2 antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides reduced PLA2 activity in the lysate of VSMC exposed to NE. These data suggest that NE stimulates AA release for prostanoid synthesis in the VSMC via activation of cPLA2. Fig. 3 shows an immunoblot of VSMC total lysate proteins probed with monoclonal anti-cPLA2. The cPLA2 migrates at ∼100 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Western analysis of cells transfected with cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides for a longer duration (24 h) showed a significant reduction in the immunoreactive protein. These data positively correlate with the observed PLA2 activity (Fig. 2B) and also indicate that the action of cPLA2 antisense was specific for the cPLA2. The sense oligonucleotide had little or no effect on the 85-kDa PLA2 immunoreactive protein. It has been shown that MAP kinase can activate cPLA2 in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-505 in response to platelet-derived growth factor (7Lin L.-L. Wartman M. Lin A. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). MAP kinase activation can occur through both protein kinase C-dependent and protein kinase C-independent mechanisms (21Qiu Z.-H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Xing M. Insel P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MAP kinase-independent regulation of cPLA2 has also been reported (23Winitz S. Gupta S.K. Qian N.-X. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1889-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the type of kinases involved in NE-induced AA release, VSMC were transfected for 6 h with CaM kinase II or MAP kinase sense and/or antisense oligonucleotides, and the cells were incubated in media containing 10% FBS for another 18 h at 37°C. The specificity of CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotides to reduce CaM kinase II protein is shown in Fig. 3. Treatment of VSMC with CaM kinase II antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides completely abolished the ability of NE to increase [3H]AA release (Fig. 4A). The inhibitory effect of CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotides on NE-induced AA release was abolished in VSMC that were co-transfected with sense oligonucleotides. The CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 abolished the NE-induced AA release. KN-93 blocks activation of the kinase by binding to an unidentified site on CaM kinase II and interferes with CaM binding (24Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). On the other hand, treatment of VSMC with MAP kinase antisense reduced the NE effect by only 30% (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the MEK inhibitor, PD-098059, also partially reduced NE-induced AA release. These results indicate that both CaM kinase II and MAP kinase are involved in NE-stimulated AA release and that CaM kinase II plays a predominant role.Fig. 5Effect of MAP kinase antisense (AS) and sense (S) oligonucleotides, MEK inhibitor PD-098059, or their vehicle (VEH) on NE-stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid release (A) and MAP kinase activity (B). Cells were transiently transfected with MAP kinase antisense oligonucleotides (1 μM) or preincubated with PD-098059 (50 μM) for 3 h and exposed to NE (10 μM) for 15 min. MAP kinase activity was determined in 10 μg of lysates, using a synthetic substrate. Data represent the means ± S.E. of four experiments from two batches of cells. *, value significantly different from vehicle (VEH) of NE; †, value significantly different from that obtained with NE alone; ††, value significantly different from that obtained with antisense treatments (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NE stimulated CaM kinase and MAP kinase activities in a time-dependent manner (data not shown). Treatment of VSMC with CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotides and the CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93, significantly reduced NE-stimulated CaM kinase II activity (Fig. 4B). Treatment of VSMC with MAP kinase antisense or the MEK inhibitor PD-098059 significantly reduced the NE-stimulated MAP kinase activity (Fig. 5B). These results support a role for CaM kinase II and MAP kinase in NE-stimulated AA release in VSMC of rabbit aorta. To establish the role of CaM kinase and MAP kinase in mediating NE-induced PLA2 activity, experiments were designed to study PLA2 activity in the presence of CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotide, its inhibitor KN-93, and a MEK inhibitor, PD-098059. Treatment of VSMC with CaM kinase II antisense and KN-93 significantly reduced NE-stimulated PLA2 activity (Fig. 6A). Treatment of VSMC with MAP kinase antisense and MEK inhibitor also significantly decreased NE-stimulated PLA2 activity (Fig. 6B). These results further support our finding that cPLA2 is activated by both CaM kinase II and MAP kinase. The activity of purified cPLA2 is insensitive to reduction by DTT (7Lin L.-L. Wartman M. Lin A. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar); likewise, NE-stimulated PLA2 activity in VSMC was found to be insensitive to DTT included in the buffer. This provides further confirmation that cPLA2 and not sPLA2 mediates the ability of NE to release AA in VSMC (d"

While the maintenance of embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal is an activity unique to this family of cytokines, the intracellular signaling events mediated by gp130 remain largely unknown. Here we show a rapid and transient increase in the specific activity of the Src-related kinase Hck as well as of the Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 following treatment of ES cells with LIF or a combination of IL6 plus a soluble form of the IL6 receptor. Within 2 min of stimulation, we also observed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, activation of the guanidine nucleotide exchange activity on p21ras, and an electrophoretic mobility shift of MAP kinase. Functional involvement of Hck and p21ras activation in gp130-mediated signaling is supported by the finding that the introduction of constitutively activated Hck or v-Ha-ras partially alleviates the requirement of ES cells for LIF to remain undifferentiated. In contrast, suppression of Jak1 in ES cells by antisense technology increased the amount of LIF required to retain their pluripotentiality. These results are consistent with the notion that gp130-mediated suppression of ES cell differentiation depends on signaling through at least two cascades, namely a p21ras-dependent pathway that possibly involves Hck, as well as a Jak kinase-dependent pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2071834868,"Type II secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) has been shown to be induced by a variety of proinflammatory stimuli and, therefore, has been implicated in the inflammatory process. In order to determine whether association of sPLA2 with cell surfaces via heparan sulfate proteoglycan is important for its effects on cellular functions, we have identified the critical domain in sPLA2 for heparin and cell surface binding and examined its role in cellular prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. Replacement of several conserved Lys residues in the C-terminal region of mouse and rat sPLA2s by Glu resulted in a marked reduction of their capacities to bind to heparin and mammalian cell surfaces without affecting their enzymatic activities toward dispersed phospholipid as a substrate. CHO cells stably transfected with wild-type sPLA2 released about twice as much arachidonic acid (AA) during culture for 10 h with fetal calf serum and interleukin-1β than cells transfected with vector alone, whereas the ability to enhance AA release was impaired in sPLA2 mutants incapable of binding to cell surfaces. AA released by wild-type sPLA2-transfected CHO cells was metabolized to prostaglandin E2 via prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS)-2 after IL-1β stimulation, revealing a particular functional linkage of sPLA2 to PGHS-2. In contrast, A23187-initiated immediate AA release over 30 min was not affected by sPLA2 overexpression. Taken together, these results suggest that sPLA2 expressed endogenously and anchored on cell surfaces via its C-terminal heparin-binding domain is involved in the PGHS-2-dependent delayed PG biosynthesis initiated by growth factors and cytokines during long term culture. Type II secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) has been shown to be induced by a variety of proinflammatory stimuli and, therefore, has been implicated in the inflammatory process. In order to determine whether association of sPLA2 with cell surfaces via heparan sulfate proteoglycan is important for its effects on cellular functions, we have identified the critical domain in sPLA2 for heparin and cell surface binding and examined its role in cellular prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. Replacement of several conserved Lys residues in the C-terminal region of mouse and rat sPLA2s by Glu resulted in a marked reduction of their capacities to bind to heparin and mammalian cell surfaces without affecting their enzymatic activities toward dispersed phospholipid as a substrate. CHO cells stably transfected with wild-type sPLA2 released about twice as much arachidonic acid (AA) during culture for 10 h with fetal calf serum and interleukin-1β than cells transfected with vector alone, whereas the ability to enhance AA release was impaired in sPLA2 mutants incapable of binding to cell surfaces. AA released by wild-type sPLA2-transfected CHO cells was metabolized to prostaglandin E2 via prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS)-2 after IL-1β stimulation, revealing a particular functional linkage of sPLA2 to PGHS-2. In contrast, A23187-initiated immediate AA release over 30 min was not affected by sPLA2 overexpression. Taken together, these results suggest that sPLA2 expressed endogenously and anchored on cell surfaces via its C-terminal heparin-binding domain is involved in the PGHS-2-dependent delayed PG biosynthesis initiated by growth factors and cytokines during long term culture."

In addition to its C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain, MT-MMP1 has an insertion of 11 amino acids between its propeptide and catalytic domain encrypted with a RRKR recognition motif for the paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme, furin. In this report, we investigated whether the cleavage of the RRKR motif of MT-MMP1 by Golgi-associated furin is analogous to a similar enzyme activation mechanism observed with stromelysin-3. Mutant forms of MT-MMP1 were cotransfected into COS-1 cells with cDNAs for pro-gelatinase A and/or furin. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using specific antibodies were employed to characterize cell proteins. Whereas furin readily cleaved soluble MT-MMP1 lacking the transmembrane domain (ΔMT-MMP1), a soluble stromelysin-1/ΔMT-MMP1 chimera without the RRKR basic motif was resistant to furin-induced cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W1968493087,"We reported previously that cell-free transcription in the Archaea Methanococcus and Pyrococcus depends upon two archaeal transcription factors, archaeal transcription factor A (aTFA) and archaeal transcription factor B (aTFB). In the genome of Pyrococcus genes encoding putative homologues of eucaryal transcription factors TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB have been detected. Here, we report that Escherichia coli synthesized Pyrococcus homologues of TBP and TFIIB are able to replace endogenous aTFB and aTFA in cell-free transcription reactions. Antibodies raised against archaeal TBP and TFIIB bind to polypeptides of identical molecular mass in the aTFB and aTFA fraction. These data identify aTFB as archaeal TBP and aTFA as the archaeal homologue of TFIIB. At the Pyrococcus glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) promoter these two bacterially produced transcription factors and endogenous RNA polymerase are sufficient to direct accurate and active initiation of transcription. DNase I protection experiments revealed Pyrococcus-TBP producing a characteristic footprint between position −20 and −34 centered around the TATA box of gdh promoter. Pyrococcus-TFIIB did not bind to the TATA box but bound cooperatively with Pyrococcus-TBP generating an extended DNase I footprinting pattern ranging from position −19 to −42. These data suggest that the Pyrococcus homologue of TFIIB associates with the TBP-promoter binary complex as its eucaryal counterpart, but in contrast to eucaryal TFIIB, it causes an extension of the protection to the region upstream of the TATA box.

Owing to its low stability purification of the aTFA activity thus far was not possible, but the incubation of aTFB or eucaryal TBPs in combination with aTFA results in template commitment (7Gohl H.P.

We have recently described a cell-free transcription system for the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this system, specific transcription was as well dependent upon the presence of aTFB and aTFA activities. The discovery of two genes encoding putative homologues of eucaryal TBP and RNA polymerase II transcription factor B (TFIIB) in the genome of Pyrococcus (13Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Ouzounis C. Sander C. Cell. 1992; 71: 189-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Creti R. Londei P. Cammarano P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the function of these archaeal homologues of eucaryal transcription factors in promoter recognition and transcription and to determine their relationship to transcription factors purified from Pyrococcus cells. Our results indicate that aTFB and aTFA are identical with the Pyrococcus homologues of TBP and TFIIB. We report the DNase I protection patterns of the Pyrococcus TBP-DNA binary and TBP-TFIIB-DNA ternary complex. The plasmid pLUW479 containing the promoter and a part of the coding region of the gdh gene of Pyrococcus furiosus was used in standard transcription reactions (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). DNA was purified by repeated centrifugation in CsCl density gradients as described previously (16Thomm M. Wich G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The components required for cell-free transcription were purified as described previously (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For further purification of RNA polymerase, the Superdex 200 fractions containing RNA polymerase activity were dialyzed against PS buffer (40 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1.5 M NaCl and were applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (0.5 × 10 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with PS buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and PS buffer without salt, bound RNA polymerase was eluted with PS buffer containing 10% ethylene glycol. A DNA fragment encoding the open reading frame of Pyrococcus woesei TFIIB gene was amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAATAAGCAAAAGGTTTGTC-3′ and 5′-GTCATTCGAATTCATGCTATAGGAACTTTAATC-3′. The amplified product was hydrolyzed with NdeI and EcoRI (restriction sites are underlined in the oligonucleotides). The hydrolyzed fragment was then ligated to pET17b (Novagen), which had been cleaved with NdeI and EcoRI. The resulting clone pTFIIBPW.17 was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The expression of the gene was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (final concentration: 1 mM) to a growing culture (A600 = 0.7) at 30°C. After induction for 4 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation. For purification a cell extract was prepared, heated for 15 min at 75°C, and subsequently centrifuged (100,000 × g for 20 min). The recombinant Pc-TFIIB remained in the supernatant and was further purified by Mono Q and Superdex 200 chromatography as described previously (11Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified fraction was about 80% pure. The expression of the TBP was performed as for TFIIB with the following modifications. For amplification of the coding region the following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGTGGATATGAGCAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTCAAAGCTCCTCCTCTTC-3′. The resulting clone pTBPPW.17 was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3), induction of gene expression was performed for 3 h, and the cell extract was heated for 15 min at 80°C. The recombinant TBP was purified from the supernatant by chromatography on Mono Q and Superdex 200 as described previously (11Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The final preparation was about 90% pure. The in vitro transcription reactions were performed as described previously (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 1 μg of linearized template DNA (pLUW479), 5 μl of the phenyl-Sepharose fraction of the RNA polymerase, 5 μl (0.43 unit) of the Superdex 200 fraction of aTFB, and 5 μl (0.66 unit) of the heparin-Sepharose fraction of aTFA (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 500 μg of recombinant TFIIB were electrophoresed in a preparative 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained Pc-TFIIB was eluted from the gel and used for immunization of a rabbit. Immunization was performed by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) following the standard immunization protocol. The polyclonal IgG fraction of the anti-TFIIB serum was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography (Pharmacia). For detection of Pyrococcus TBP in the aTFB fraction antibodies raised against Thermococcus TBP (11Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were used. Western blot analyses with antibodies directed against recombinant Thermococcus TBP and Pyrococcus TFIIB were performed as described previously (11Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment of 131 base pairs was amplified from plasmid pLUW479 via polymerase chain reaction with end-labeled primer GDH-95 (position −95 to −75 relative to transcription start site of the Pyrococcus gdh gene (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar): 5′-GAATTTTAGATTCTTTGAGCC-3′) and primer GDH+36 (position +16 to +36): 5′-TCAACCATGTTCATCCCTCC-3′). Primer GDH-95 was end-labeled as described previously (1Frey G. Thomm M. Brüdigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transcription factors (Pc-TBP [0.7 μg/μl] and/or Pc-TFIIB [0.114 μg/μl]; see Fig. 3) were allowed to interact with the footprinting probe containing the gdh promoter (2.5 ng) for 30 min at 37°C in a buffer containing 40 mM Hepes, 200 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA. Hydrolysis of DNA was performed by addition of different amounts (see legends to the figures) of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim (10 units/μl)) in a volume of 1 μl (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0), reaction was terminated after 1 min by addition of 17.5 μl of stop solution (1.5 M NH4Ac, 70 mM EDTA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The DNA fragments were purified by phenol treatment, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel (45 watts for 2.5 h). To investigate the relationship of the factors encoded in the genome of Pyrococcus that are related to eucaryal TBP and TFIIB with Pyrococcus transcription factors aTFA and aTFB, the cloned Pyrococcus genes were overexpressed in E. coli, the polypeptides purified to near homogeneity, and their function analyzed in the Pyrococcus cell-free system. When a recombinant plasmid that is harboring the glutamate dehydrogenase gene of Pc. furiosus linearized with BamHI was used as template, a run-off transcript of 173 nucleotides was synthesized by the reconstituted Pyrococcus cell-free transcription system (Ref. 12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A, lane 7). This system consists of highly purified RNA polymerase (see “Experimental Procedures”), the Superdex fraction of aTFB and aTFA purified from the crude extract by a two-step procedure (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Besides RNA polymerase both aTFA and aTFB activities are required for specific transcription (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-7). When a TFA was replaced by recombinant Pc-TBP, synthesis of a distinct RNA product was not observed (Fig. 1A, lane 8). However, the addition of Pc-TBP activated the archaeal system reconstituted without aTFB (Fig. 1A, lane 9). An increasing amount of Pc-TBP led to increased synthesis of the run-off transcript (Fig. 1A, lanes 9 and 10). This finding demonstrated that the TBP encoding gene detected in the genome of Pyrococcus encodes a transcription factor directing transcription from an archaeal promoter by Pyrococcus RNA polymerase. To investigate the function of the Pc-TFIIB homologue, both aTFA and aTFB were replaced with Pc-TFIIB. Pc-TFIIB was unable to substitute for aTFB (Fig. 1B, lane 1). However, a cell-free system reconstituted with Pc-TFIIB, aTFB, and RNA polymerase was able to direct specific transcription, and this Pc-TFIIB-dependent transcriptional activation was increased by adding increasing amounts of this recombinant polypeptide to cell-free transcription reactions (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). To address the question whether the aTFA and aTFB fractions harbor additional activities necessary for cell-free transcription, both archaeal factor fractions were replaced by the corresponding recombinant proteins. Pyrococcus RNA polymerase was able to synthesize an RNA product of correct size from the gdh promoter with high activity both in the presence of Pc-TBP and Pc-TFIIB (Fig. 1C, lane 4; compare with control lane 5). This finding demonstrates that Pc-TBP and Pc-TFIIB are able to replace the endogenous aTFA and aTFB fractions. Therefore, no additional activities contained in the aTFA and aTFB fraction are required for cell-free transcription of gdh promoter. To investigate the relationship of aTFA and aTFB with Pc-TPB and Pc-TFIIB at the structural level, polyclonal antibodies raised against Thermococcus TBP (11Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and Pc-TFIIB were probed with protein immunoblots of the three components of the Pyrococcus cell-free system. Recombinant Pc-TBP shows a molecular mass of 21.3 kDa. The antibody against Tc-TBP binds to a polypeptide of the same size in the aTFB fraction (Fig. 2A, lane 1), but not in the aTFA or RNA polymerase fraction (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). Recombinant Pc-TFIIB showed an apparent molecular mass of 34.1 kDa. Vice versa, a cross-reacting polypeptide that comigrates during denaturing gel electrophoresis with Pc-TFIIB was found in the aTFA (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3) but not in the aTFB and RNA polymerase fraction (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). The aTFA fraction, however, contained additional cross-reacting polypeptides of lower molecular mass (Fig. 2B, lane 3), which are present as well in crude and more purified aTFA fractions (data not shown). The observation that both the aTFB and aTFA fractions contained polypeptides serologically related with Pc-TBP and Pc-TFIIB suggests that the factors activating the gdh promoter in the aTFA and aTFB fraction are identical with Pc-TFIIB and Pc-TBP. To investigate the interaction of Pc-TBP and Pc-TFIIB with an archaeal promoter at the molecular level, binding of these factors to a 131-nucleotide end-labeled DNA fragment harboring the Pyrococcus gdh promoter was studied in DNase I protection assays. When 2.1 μg of Pc-TBP were incubated with gdh promoter in DNA binding reactions, a clear DNase I footprint was detected. The footprint extended from position −20 to −34 and included the TATA box of this promoter located between position −22 and −30 (Fig. 3, compare control reactions in lanes 1-3 with lanes 4-6). When Pc-TFIIB was incubated with this DNA fragment, specific binding to the TATA box was not observed, but a weak protection in the region located between position −4 and −6 was detected (Fig. 3, lanes 7-9). However, when Pc-TFIIB was added to binding reactions containing Pc-TBP, protection from DNase I digestion was significantly increased in the region of the TATA box and the 5′ boundary of the footprint was extended from position −34 to −42 and the 3′ boundary from position −20 to −19 (Fig. 3, lanes 10-12). In addition, a hypersensitivity site located between position −5 and −8 was generated. In the presence of Pc-TFIIB, a smaller amount (0.7 μg) of Pc-TBP was needed to protect the TATA box, and the protection in this DNA region was significantly increased (Fig. 3, lanes 10-12) when compared with the protection pattern generated by Pc-TBP (Fig. 3, lanes 4-6). These findings demonstrate that the archaeal TBP is the polypeptide interacting directly with the archaeal TATA box. The archaeal TFIIB homologue associates with the Pc-TBP-DNA complex and causes an extension of the protection seen with Pc-TBP. Analysis of hybrid archaeal/archaeal and archaeal/eucaryal transcription systems provided evidence that aTFB is a highly conserved polypeptide analogous in function to eucaryal TBPs. aTFB is functionally interchangeable in the Methanococcus and Pyrococcus cell-free systems (12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 2C. Hethke and M. Thomm, unpublished data. In the Methanoccoccus system aTFB can be replaced by the translation product of the putative Thermococcus TBP gene (11Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and by yeast and human TBP (6Wettach J. Gohl H.P. Tschochner H. Thomm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and recombinant Pc-TBP (Fig. 1A). The sequence identity of the genes encoding archaeal TBPs with genes coding for eucaryal TBPs ranges between 30 and 35% (18Qureshi S.A. Baumann P. Rowlands T. Khoo B. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar as eucaryal TBPs all archaeal TBPs consist of a tandem repeat of two conserved domains, which are most likely the product of an ancient direct repeat (10Marsh T.L. Reich C.I. Whitelock R.B.

All this evidence supports the conclusion that aTFB is an archaeal TBP analogous in function and homologous to eucaryal TBPs. The nature of the second archaeal transcription factor, aTFA, was less clear. Archaea consist of two major phylogenetic lineages, the Euryarchaeota comprising methanogens and Pyrococcus and the Crenarchaeota (4Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4535) Google Scholar). In the Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus a second transcription factor activity has not yet been identified, although a gene with significant sequence similarity to eucaryal TFIIB exists in the genome of this organism (20Qureshi S.A. Khoo B. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6077-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both Methanococcus and Pyrococcus aTFA separate at early steps of purification from RNA polymerase (1Frey G. Thomm M. Brüdigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 2369-2376Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and are rapidly inactivated when purified by more than one or two chromatographic purification steps. 3G. Frey, H. P. Gohl, B. Gröndahl, W. Hausner, J. Wettach, B. Wolf, and M. Thomm, unpublished results. Pyrococcus and Methanococcus aTFA are species specific.2 In this study, we show that Pyrococcus aTFA activity can be replaced by a single polypeptide displaying significant amino acid similarity with RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIB (Fig. 1, B and C). The gene encoding this Pc-TFIIB factor shows an identity of 32-36% with TFIIB from various eucaryal sources. In addition, this sequence displays unique structural motifs characteristic of eucaryal TFIIB such as an imperfect amino acid repeat in the N and C terminus of the molecule and a zinc II finger motif located close to the N terminus (14Ouzounis C. Sander C. Cell. 1992; 71: 189-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Creti R. Londei P. Cammarano P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This Pyrococcus homologue of TFIIB produced in E. coli showed serological cross-reaction with a polypeptide of identical molecular mass in the aTFA fraction (Fig. 2B). The origin of the additional cross-reacting polypeptides of lower molecular mass in this fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 3) is unclear, but we have demonstrated that a single polypeptide is able to replace the aTFA activity in cell-free transcription reactions (Fig. 1B). Taken together these data provide strong evidence that the second archaeal transcription factor, aTFA, can be defined as archaeal homologue of eucaryal TFIIB. At the gdh promoter, these two factors and purified RNA polymerase are sufficient to direct specific transcription. It seems unlikely that the enzyme contained additional transcription factors, as only polypeptides identified as general components of archaeal RNA polymerases (21Gropp F. Reiter W.D. Sentenac A. Zillig W. Thomm M. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1986; 7: 95-101Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were found in silver-stained denaturing polyacrylamide gels of purified Pyrococcus RNA polymerase fractions (data not shown). Pc-TBP and Pc-TFIIB show also strong similarity to eucaryal TBP and TFIIB in their mode of interaction with a TATA box containing promoter. Human TBP protects a 20-nucleotide region centered at the TATA box from DNase I digestion (22Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), archaeal TBP 15 nucleotides as well centered at the TATA box (Fig. 3). Similar to eucaryal TFIIB, the archaeal homologue of this factor shows no intrinsic ability to bind to the TATA box, although a weak protection in the region downstream of the TATA box was detected (Fig. 3, lanes 7-9). But, similar to TFIIB, it can associate with a binary complex of TBP and TATA box, resulting in the formation of a DNA-TBP-TFIIB ternary complex as has been shown by gel shift analyses (13Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and footprinting studies (Fig. 3). Formation of this ternary complex at the archaeal promoter is characterized by an increase in the nucleotide region protected from DNase cleavage. Association of eucaryal TFIIB with the TBP-DNA complex leads also to an increase of DNA protected from DNase I or chemical cleavage (23Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Lee S. Hahn S. Nature. 1995; 376: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Inclusion of archaeal TFIIB into the archaeal TBP-promoter complex clearly induces an additional protection of 8 nucleotides at the 5′ end and of only one nucleotide at the 3′ end of the footprint (see Fig. 3, to the right). Although it is unclear whether this additional region protected in the ternary complex is bound by Pc-TFIIB, Pc-TBP, or both, a clear difference to the eucaryal system becomes apparent. DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that eucaryal TFIIB in the ternary complex causes an extension of the footprint to the DNA region downstream of the TATA element, but similar to Pc-TFIIB, eucaryal TFIIB stabilizes the TBP-DNA binary complex (Ref. 25Malik S. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6253-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 26Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In spite of this difference the first steps of promoter activation and the central core of transcriptional machinery seem to be very similar in Archaea and Eucarya. In vitro studies with negatively supercoiled templates demonstrated that TBP and TFIIB represent the minimal set of factors directing RNA polymerase to the promoter (27Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These components are conserved among Archaea and Eucarya, and the assembly of these components at the promoter occurs in Archaea in the same sequence as in Eucarya. An archaeal TBP recognizes the TATA motif, an archaeal TFIIB homologue binds to this complex, and this association of TFIIB with the binary complex results in stabilization of the TBP-DNA interaction. Both the increased resistance of the Pc-TBP-Pc-TFIIB ternary complex to DNase I cleavage (compare Fig. 3, lanes 4-6 with 10-12) and the finding that less Pc-TBP than in the binary complex is required to protect the TATA box in the ternary complex demonstrate that Pc-TFIIB stabilizes binding of TBP to the TATA box. These similarities in the DNA interaction of homologous components of basal transcriptional machinery suggest that the archaeal and eucaryal transcriptional machineries are of the same evolutionary origin. The archaeal transcription apparatus seems to represent the conserved version of the primordial eucaryal transcription apparatus, and analysis of transcription in Archaea therefore is likely to shed new light on the molecular evolution of transcriptional machineries in eucaryal cells. To indicate the homology of archaeal and eucaryal transcription factors, we suggest to designate aTFB as archaeal TBP (aTBP) and aTFA as transcription factor B (TFB).

Simultaneous mutation of both κB sites abolished the promoter activity.

Transient expression of each mutant showed that only the Arg540→ His mutant was non-functional based upon its inability to reconstitute apoB secretion in a cell culture system. The other amino acid changes are silent polymorphisms. High level coexpression in a baculovirus system of the wild type 97-kDa subunit or the Arg540→ His mutant along with human protein disulfide isomerase showed that the wild type was capable of forming an active MTP complex while the mutant was not.

Non-heme, non-globin structural chains, “linkers,” are also present. Light-scattering techniques have been used to show that the ferrous CO-saturated abc trimer and chain d form an (abcd)4 complex of 285 kDa at neutral pH. Formation of the full-sized 4-MDa molecule requires the addition of linker chains in the proportion of two linkers per (abcd)4 and occurs much more rapidly in the presence of 10 mM calcium. This stoichiometry is supported not only by direct quantitative analysis of the intact hemoglobin but also by the fact that the addition of 50% of the proposed stoichiometric quantity of linkers results in the conversion of 50% of the (abcd)4 to full-sized molecules. Isolated CO-saturated abc trimers self-associate to (abc)2 and higher aggregates up to an apparent limit of (abc)10∼550 kDa. The CO-saturated chain d forms dimers, (d)2, and tetramers, (d)4. Oxidation of the (abcd)4 complex with ferricyanide causes complete dissociation of chain d from the abc trimer, but addition of CN− maintains the (abcd)4 complex. Valence hybrids have also been studied. The ferrous CO-saturated abc trimer and met (ferric) chain d also associate to form (abcd)4, but the met abc trimer and ferrous CO-saturated chain d do not. Oxidation of the abc trimer and chain d to the ferric form causes the formation of a characteristic hemichrome spectrum with a maximum at 565 nm and a shoulder near 530 nm. These results show that interactions between the abc trimer and chain d are strongly dependent on the ligand and valence state of the heme iron. Light-scattering measurements reveal that oxidation of the intact Hb produces a significant drop in molecular mass from 4.1 to 3.6 MDa. Inclusion of CN− prevents this drop.

Vinogradov et al. (12Vinogradov S.N. Lugo S.D. Mainwaring M.G. Kapp O.H. Crewe A.V. Proc. Natl., Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8034-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were the first to conclude that these chains are required for assembly. This conclusion was based on the finding that preparations of the abc trimer and chain d subunits that were deficient in linkers failed to form full-sized molecules. This by itself does not exclude the possibility that the preparative procedure might have rendered the trimer and chain d incompetent to assemble. A final goal of these studies is, then, to reassemble the full-sized hemoglobin by titrating an equimolar mixture of abc trimer and chain d with linkers. The titration itself should provide a further determination of the stoichiometry. The CO-derivative of L. terrestris Hb was prepared as described previously (15Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HbCO was either (i) used directly, (ii) used for subunit preparation, (iii) frozen at −80°C, or (iv) kept in 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4 for a year at 0°C under a CO atmosphere. We emphasize that saturation with CO is crucial because CO is itself a reducing agent (17Bickar D. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that helps to maintain the hemes in the ferrous state. All preparative steps were carried out at 0-4°C. The first subunits (preparation 1) were obtained by chromatography on an ACA44 Ultrogel column (LKB), 5 × 85 cm, with CO-saturated 0.1 M borate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.3, exactly as described previously (18Fushitani K. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10275-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The trimer, linker, and chain d fractions were pooled and rechromatographed on the same column. The fractions were concentrated by an Amicon concentrator (YM-10 membrane) filled with CO prior to applying N2 pressure. HPLC analysis performed as described elsewhere (15Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the weight fractions of linkers in the trimer and chain d preparations were 0.045 and 0.005, respectively. These preparations were used to measure the pH and concentration dependence of self-association of abc (Fig. 7, a and b). Preparation 2 of subunits was similar to the first except that Sephacryl S-200 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was substituted for ACA44. This preparation yielded trimer and chain d fractions with weight proportions of linkers of 0.0115 and 0.0015, respectively, by HPLC analysis (15Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). This preparation was used in some of the titrations of abc + d with linkers (Fig. 12, a and b). The linkers used in these titrations were isolated on a column of DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman), 2.5 × 8.0 cm, with a linear gradient between buffer A, CO-saturated 20 mM borate, pH 9.3, and buffer B, the same buffer with 350 mM NaCl and a flow rate of ∼1 ml/min. Fresh HbCO (271 mg in 4.5 ml) was dialyzed against buffer A overnight, and then was applied to the column equilibrated with buffer A. Approximately 25 ml of buffer A was passed through the column before starting the gradient. The linker chain fraction, eluting between 115 and 130 ml, was identified with a 280 nm/576 nm absorbance ratio of 6.37 ± 0.21 for the 16 fractions. HPLC analyses (data not shown) gave the following polypeptide composition for the linker fraction: 62.6% linkers, 29.4% abc trimer and 8.0% chain d. In the titration of (abcd)4 with 100% of the stoichiometric quantity of linkers, the abcd in the linkers increases by 7.4%, and the linkers in the abc + d preparations increases the linkers by 4.8%. Application of these values to the data of Fig. 12b does not alter the total percent linkers. Residual linkers in abc and d were allowed for in the calculations for Fig. 12b. Preparation 3 was similar to preparation 2 in use of Sephacryl S200 but did not use DEAE cellulose for linker isolation. The trimer and chain d fractions contained weight fractions of linkers of ≤0.01 and 0.054, respectively. The linker chain fraction contained 17.6% trimer and 24.4% chain d. Preparation 3 was used in the experiments of Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8-10. The components in each fraction were considered in the reassembly experiments.Fig. 8The molecular weight distributions of oxidized (met) abc trimers in the presence and absence of CN−.

Part of the (NH4)2SO4 preparation was processed further as follows. The HbCO, kept for 1 year at 0°C under a CO atmosphere in 50 mM bis-tris propane, pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM CaCl2, 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4, was dialyzed at 0°C against 400 volumes of CO-saturated deionized water with one change for 48 h, then was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against CO-saturated 0.1 M NaBO3, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.3. The dialyzed HbCO (210 mg in 8 ml) was applied to a Sephacryl HR S-200 column (5 × 88 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before pooling and concentrating on an Amicon concentrater with a YM-10 membrane. The heme content of the pooled trimer, linker, and chain d fractions was determined with the alkaline hematin method (19Wolf H.U. Lang W. Zander R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 136: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The purity was determined by reverse-phase HPLC (15Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar ratios of trimer to linker and chain d to linker were found to be >52 and ∼30, respectively, in terms of 220 nm absorbance for the trimer and chain d preparations. The linker chain fraction contained 0.16 trimers and 0.72 chains d per linker. The maximal amount of full-sized molecules that could be generated from these constituents of the linker chain fraction is 0.08 moles of (abcd)2L/mole of linker. These quantities were allowed for in the reassembly experiments (Fig. 13, a and b). The absorption spectrum of the CO-saturated abc trimer in this preparation was indistinguishable from that of freshly prepared HbCO, indicating that no measurable oxidation had occurred during storage in (NH4)2SO4. The HbCO (preparation from (NH4)2SO4) was first converted to HbO2 by exposure to a strong light (“SunGun,” Sylvania) at 0°C under an atmosphere of O2 for 30 s, repeated 10 times. This procedure was also used to convert the abc trimer and chain d to the oxy derivatives. Oxidized Hb (or subunits) was made by adding various amounts of K3Fe(CN)6 according to the experiment. Two sets of experiments were done: (i) 100% oxidized Hb was produced by adding K3Fe(CN)6 (25- or 125-fold molar excess over the heme) in the dark 3Ferricyanide is light-sensitive (20Keilin D. Nature. 1961; 190: 717-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). on ice overnight against N2-saturated 25 mM bis-tris propane, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 or 5 mM EGTA, pH 7.0. The K3Fe(CN)6 was added in the same buffer. Light-scattering experiments were performed on these solutions with the size-exclusion column equilibrated with the same buffer. (ii) In the second set of experiments, HbO2 (freshly prepared, unfrozen) with and without calcium was prepared with Ca2+, 25 mM bis-tris propane, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0, or without Ca2+, in 5 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0. The latter preparation without calcium is the same solution used for the dry weight determinations (16Zhu H. Hargrove M. Xie Q. Nozaki Y. Linse K. Smith S.S. Olson J.S. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29999-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each of these solutions were oxidized in the dark by adding K3Fe(CN)6 as 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, or 100% of the molar quantity of heme-iron. The actual percent oxidation was estimated from the change in absorbance. The end point of the absorbance change was calculated approximately from the ratio between the extinction coefficients for human HbO2 and metHb at 576 nm because slow transformation of the L. terrestris metHb to the hemichrome precluded direct determination of the end point. Free ferro- and ferricyanide were removed by dialysis against the same buffer with the NaCl increased to 300 mM. Although this procedure should also remove bound ferrocyanide if the binding is similar to that in human Hb (21Benesch R. Benesch R.E. MacDuff G. Science. 1964; 144: 68-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this was not tested. A DAWN model F multiangle light-scattering photometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) with a 5-milliwatt He-Ne vertically polarized laser of wavelength 632.8 nm was used in all experiments. The construction and principles of operation of this instrument together with the associated interferometric refractometer have been described in detail (22Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). The photometer is equipped with a K5 flow cell (Wyatt) that has a 67-μl total fluid volume in which the scattering volume is ≈ 0.5 μl. All measurements were made in the in-line flow mode. The laser light beam is collimated through the center of the flow path, and the fluid flow is in the same direction as the laser. The windows of each end of the flow cell are recessed, and the edges of the flow cell are away from the ≈ 0.5-μl scattering volume so that stray light from the air/glass/solvent interfaces is not seen by the detectors. High gain photodiodes are placed at 18 refracted angles. A Beckman Altex model 110A HPLC pump with a Beckman model 210 injection valve was used to deliver samples through a switching valve (catalog no. V240, Upchurch) either directly to the photometer or first through a Bio-Gel SEC 40XL column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad catalog no. 125-0604). Experiments shown in Fig. 13, a and b, used a Waters “Protein-Pak” 300 SW column (300 × 7.8 mm, catalog no. 800B). Injection loops of 20 μl, 180 μl, and 1 ml were used, depending on the experiment. Connections were made with Upchurch “PEEK” 0.01-inch internal diameter tubing. The flow rate for all experiments was 0.3 ml/min. A model LP-21 “Low-Pulse” pulse damper (Scientific Systems, Inc., State College, PA) was inserted after the pump. An Optilab-903 interferometric refractometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) was connected in-line following the light-scattering photometer. The P2 sample cell used in the refractometer has a path length of 0.2 mm. A Hitachi model 100-10 uv-visible spectrophotometer with flow cell in the fluid line follows the refractometer. Calibration was performed as described in the Wyatt manual. The relationship between molecular weight and light-scattering is given (23Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1099-1116Crossref Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 24Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley, New York1961: 275-316Google Scholar) by the equation, KcRθ=1Mw⋅1P(θ)+2Bc+⋯(Eq. 1) where K=4π2n02dndc2Nλ4 (n0 is the refractive index of the solvent, dn/dc, is the refractive index increment, N is Avogadro's number, and λ is the wavelength in vacuo) and c is the weight concentration of protein. B is the second virial coefficient. Rθ is the angle-dependent Rayleigh ratio, given by Rθ = Iθr2/I0V where Iθ is the intensity of scattered light at angle θ; I0, the incident light intensity; V, the volume of scattering solution; and r, the distance from this volume to the detector. P(θ)−1 is given by the Zimm equation (23Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1099-1116Crossref Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 24Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley, New York1961: 275-316Google Scholar). P(θ)−1≅1+16π2n023λ2RG2sin2θ2(Eq. 2) This is a limiting expression, strictly valid only as θ approaches zero (24Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley, New York1961: 275-316Google Scholar). RG is the radius of gyration. Here λ is the wavelength in vacuo and n0 is the refractive index of the solvent. All light-scattering data are linearly extrapolated to θ = 0; an example is shown in Fig. 1. Calibration of the photometer is achieved by using toluene with known Rayleigh ratio of 1.406 × 10−5 cm−1 at the wavelength of the laser to relate the R90 value (R at 90°) to the detector voltage. R90=ACSCCV90−V90, dark Vlaser −Vlaser , dark (Eq. 3) The configuration-specific calibration constant, ACSCC, is solvent-specific. An instrument constant, Ainst, dependent only on geometrical factors, is derived from ACSCC, as described in the Wyatt manual (Astra Program, Version 2.11). Once Ainst is known, values of ACSCC in other solvents can be calculated from known refractive indices of solvent and glass. Calibration of the other detectors was achieved by the use of an isotropic scatterer that scatters light equally in all directions. Although the initial normalization was performed with methanol, later measurements utilized the averaged results from bovine serum albumin and carbonic anhydrase. No significant difference in values for molecular weights was found. The Wyatt Optilab model 903 interferometric refractometer measures the difference between the refractive indices of sample and reference cells. The refractometer has the following features (22Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Collimated white light polarized at 45° is split by a Wollaston prism into vertically polarized sample and horizontally polarized reference beams. Recombination of these beams by a second Wollaston prism followed by a quarter-wave plate and analyzer filter gives a plane polarized beam rotated with respect to the initial 45°. The rotational phase difference is proportional to the refractive index difference between solvent and solution. An interference filter with maximal transmission at 630 nm is placed in front of the detector. A three-way valve makes possible fluid flow through both sample and reference cells (flush) or only through the sample cell. The cells are thoroughly flushed at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with deionized “nanapure” HPLC-grade water (resistance = 17.9 megohm) filtered through a 0.2-μm nylon filter (Schleicher & Schuell, catalog no. 00040). The valve is then turned so that fluid flows only through the sample cell. The temperature is maintained at 25°C for all experiments with water from an external bath. Calibration provides the difference in refractive index between sample and reference cells per volt from the signal detector. Both NaCl and sucrose were used as calibrants. NaCl (Aldrich, catalog no. 20-4439), 99.999% pure, was found to give satisfactory results with the value of the refractive index increment, dn/dc, taken to be 0.1741 ml/g at 25°C and 589 nm (25International Critical Tables, (1930) International Critical Tables, (1930) 7, 64–73.Google Scholar). This value was used in all calculations. Interpolation of the data of Kruis (26Kruis A. Z. Phys. Chem. 1936; 34: 13-50Google Scholar) yields a slightly higher value, 0.1744 ml/g at 632.8 nm and 25°C. The NaCl (Aldrich) was dried at 180°C overnight, weighed, and dissolved in a 1-liter volumetric flask with nanapure water passed through a 0.2-μm filter. All dilutions were made with great care using a single calibrated Pipetman. Calibration and dn/dc measurements were made either “off-line” directly into the refractometer by siphon or through the HPLC system but bypassing the column. For the latter procedure, a 1-ml injection loop was used with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Sucrose (Baker, analytical reagent, catalog no. 4072-01) with a dn/dc value of 0.1422 ml/g (25International Critical Tables, (1930) International Critical Tables, (1930) 7, 64–73.Google Scholar) was used as a second standard. The calibration constants obtained from NaCl and from sucrose agreed to within 0.3%. The calibrating solutions were not filtered because filtration was found to give poor, non-reproducible results. Recalibration with sucrose one year later gave an identical result. Determination of the molecular mass by light scattering is critically dependent on the accurate determination of dn/dc. This was measured for L. terrestris Hb as follows. The last dialysate used for the dry weight and heme determination (see our companion study (16Zhu H. Hargrove M. Xie Q. Nozaki Y. Linse K. Smith S.S. Olson J.S. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29999-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) was also used to obtain dn/dc. Dilutions were made by weight from the stock solution (0.1642 mM heme). The dry weight determination (16Zhu H. Hargrove M. Xie Q. Nozaki Y. Linse K. Smith S.S. Olson J.S. Riggs A.F. J. Biol.

An identical value was obtained by assuming the (abcd)2L stoichiometry previously determined (15Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol.

The weight concentration ci in each slice in the elution pattern was calculated from the refractive index difference and the value of dn/dc, ni− n0 = (dn/dc)ci. The refraction per gram of amino acids has been determined by McMeekin et al. (27McMeekin T.L. Wilensky M. Groves M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 151-156Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These values, multiplied by the partial specific volumes (28Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar) for each amino acid, should provide an estimate of the value of dn/dc for each amino acid. Values of dn/dc for the polypeptides of L. terrestris Hb, calculated on this basis, together with the weight-average value for the intact Hb, are given in Table I. We have assumed that the subunits of L. terrestris Hb have the same dn/dc value found for the whole molecule. Although partial specific volumes calculated from amino acid compositions have been widely used in ultracentrifugation, calculation of dn/dc for proteins from their amino acid composition remains to be tested for its possible general applicability.Table I.Comparison of calculated and measured values of the refractive index increment, dn/dcCalculatedaWeight-average values calculated from the amino acid compositions of the polypeptides, and the refractive index data of McMeekin et al.

The nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA has shown that it encodes a 35.5-kDa protein with one consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation and alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. To determine the intracellular localization of Dri 42 we have raised polyclonal antibodies in hens against a bacterially produced Dri 42-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Immunofluorescence detection with these antibodies has shown specific staining of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the relatively undifferentiated fetal rat intestinal cell line FRIC B and in sections of rat small intestine. ER membrane localization of Dri 42 was confirmed by laser confocal microscopy of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing a Dri 42-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion protein by transfection. Pulse labeling experiments on transiently transfected cells demonstrated that the protein does not acquire Golgi modifications up to 4 h after synthesis, thus indicating that Dri 42 is an ER resident protein. The transmembrane disposition of Dri 42 was studied using in vitro insertion of Dri 42-CAT fusion proteins into microsomal membranes. The fusion proteins consisted of several different lengths of truncated Dri 42 and a reporter protein, CAT, that was linked in-frame after each hydrophobic segment. We found that hydrophobic segments H1, H3, and H5 had a signal/anchor function, and that membrane insertion of Dri 42 was achieved co-translationally by the action of a series of alternating insertion signals and halt transfer signals, resulting in the exposure of both termini of the protein to the cytosolic side.

INTRODUCTIONThe epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa undergo constant renewal in the adult small intestine and represent therefore a good model to study the mechanisms of epithelial differentiation (1Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The three differentiated cell types that constitute the mature villus epithelium (absorptive enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells) all arise from a progenitor stem cell, anchored in the crypt compartment, and acquire a differentiated phenotype during migration from crypt to villus tip, where they eventually detach from the underlying mesenchyme and shed into the lumen. Paneth cells are the only cell type of this epithelium which migrates in the opposite direction during differentiation, as they are exclusively located at the crypt base. Commitment to differentiation and loss of proliferation capacity occur at very early stages of the migration process along the crypt-villus axis, before the cells reach the crypt-villus junction. They are accompanied by increasing expression of specific proteins that are necessary to perform the absorptive functions of the mature epithelium. In the enterocytes, which represent the most abundant villus cell type, the major classes of proteins whose expression is turned on during differentiation are digestive enzymes, transport proteins, and structural components of the microvillar cytoskeleton.Several studies have been conducted in recent years to identify the key factors involved in transcriptional activation of differentiation-specific intestinal genes. Among the transcription factors that have been shown to bind to intestinal gene promoters, some are expressed also in other tissues (members of the hepatic nuclear factor, GATA, retinoic acid receptor, and retinoid X receptor families) (2Crabtree G.R. Schibler U. Scott M.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1063-1102Google Scholar), while others appear to be intestine-specific (Cdx1 and Cdx2) (3Duprey P. Chowdhury K. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gruss P. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Molecular analysis of the promoters of cloned intestinal genes has shown that each of them contains distinct combinations of binding sites for different transcription factors, and a clear picture has not emerged yet of the general mechanisms underlying the regulation of intestinal gene transcription (5Boyle W.J. Brenner D.A. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 1995; 11: 121-127Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One aspect that can be further pursued to provide information on common mechanisms is the isolation of novel genes that are up-regulated during development and differentiation in the small intestine. In our laboratory, differentially expressed genes have been isolated in the past few years from rat intestinal epithelium by subtractive hybridization. Among the cDNA clones that we have identified with this approach, two novel genes have been previously reported (6Barilà D. Murgia C. Nobili F. Gaetani S. Perozzi G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both genes, named Dri 27 1The abbreviations used are: Dridifferentially expressed in rat intestineCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCdxcaudal-type homeoboxERendoplasmic reticulumFRICfetal rat intestinal cellsGSTglutathione S-transferaseMDCKMadine-Darby canine kidneyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. and Dri 42 (Dri, differentially expressed in rat intestine), share similar in vivo expression characteristics. In particular, the results of Northern hybridization experiments in developing rat intestine indicate a gradual increase in the steady-state levels of Dri 42 mRNA between the last week of pregnancy and the second week after birth. During this period, the morphogenetic events that lead to formation of a functional gastrointestinal tract occur in parallel with the process of epithelial cell differentiation. Moreover, expression of the Dri 42 gene is induced during developmental maturation also in other rat epithelia (liver, kidney, and lung). The geographical distribution of Dri 42 mRNA in the adult small intestine is highest in the distal jejunum and ileum. In situ hybridization experiments on sections of adult rat small intestine have shown that transcription of Dri 42 mRNA occurs along the entire villus epithelium, as well as in a cluster of positively hybridizing cells at the crypt base, presumably corresponding to the differentiated cell types that are present in this heterogeneous compartment. Therefore, Dri 42 gene expression appears to be up-regulated not only during development, but also in adult animals, along both the horizontal (duodenum-to-ileum) and the vertical (crypt-to-villus) axes of the intestinal epithelium.In this paper, we report the molecular analysis of the novel clone Dri 42 and the intracellular localization and membrane topology of the encoded protein.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we have presented the following findings: (a) the primary structure of the novel protein Dri 42, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA, consists of 312 amino acid residues and one consensus N-linked glycosylation site at position 171; (b) the N-linked glycosylation site was confirmed to be glycosylated by in vitro translation of the Dri 42 transcript in a reticulocyte cell-free system, in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes and followed by Endo H treatment; (c) Dri 42 is a polytopic membrane protein, whose membrane insertion is co-translationally initiated by the first hydrophobic segment (H1), while the following hydrophobic segments (H2-H6) are inserted by the action of alternating halt transfer and insertion signals, resulting in the cytosolic location of both NH2 and COOH termini; (d) immunofluorescence microscopy, and a biochemical method that utilizes sensitivity of N-linked glycoproteins to Endo H treatment, have shown that Dri 42 is exclusively localized in the ER membrane.Topogenic Properties of Hydrophobic Segments in Dri 42In vitro membrane insertion experiments (Fig. 8) have shown that all six hydrophobic segments of Dri 42 function either as signal/anchor (H1, H3, and H5) or as halt transfer signals (H2, H4, and H6). As previously demonstrated with membrane insertion of Na,K-ATPase α subunit (10Xie Y. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11985-11991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the results of such in vitro assays reflect the in vivo membrane topology, since these properties have been determined in the native context. Further support in this direction comes from the results obtained with the fusion protein 42 CAT-5, which showed the same membrane disposition determined in vitro when expressed in transiently transfected MDCK cells (see Fig. 4A, lanes 13-15, and Fig. 8). All six Dri 42 hydrophobic segments detected by hydropathy analysis had topogenic function, although some of them had very low average hydrophobicity indices. The average hydrophobicity index, calculated according to Kyte and Doolittle (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar), is generally considered to be a primary concern for the topogenicity determinant. These values for Dri 42 hydrophobic segments were 2.11 (Hl), 2.25 (H2), 0.85 (H3), 1.29 (H4), 1.49 (H5), and 2.22 (H6). Although the values for H3, H4, and H5 were relatively low, these segments definitely functioned as either signal/anchor or halt transfer sequences, indicating that there must be another determinant within the hydrophobic segment. These results raised the interesting question of which are the major determinant(s) for the topogenicity of such segments in Dri 42. Several investigators have recently reported that in a polytopic membrane protein not all hydrophobic segments detected by hydropathy analysis have topogenic function. Examples of such proteins are: CHIP 28 water channel protein (26Skach W.R. Shi L. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), human protein P-glycoprotein (27Skach W.R. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6903-6908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), H,K-ATPase α subunit (28Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Na,K-ATPase α subunit (29Xie Y. Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Bellovino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Among the hydrophobic segments of these proteins with average hydrophobicity indices lower than 2.0, some did have topogenic function. Further analysis of these segments led to an interesting observation: when the largest average index of 12 consecutive amino acid residues within a hydrophobic segment (defined as a core hydrophobicity index) is larger than 2, the segment shows topogenic function even if the average hydrophobicity index is lower than 2. The core hydrophobicity indices of Dri 42 hydrophobic segments H3, H4, and H5 were calculated to be 1.65 (H3), 1.43 (H4), and 1.83 (H5). These values are still too low to support their topogenic function. Therefore, there must be strong factors other than hydrophobicity involved in topogenic determination. Hartmann et al. (30Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and von Heijne (31von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) reported that the distribution of charged amino acids of both NH2- and COOH-terminal flanking regions is an important factor for the topogenic determinant. Hartmann et al. (30Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) found a striking correlation between membrane topology of the first signal/anchor sequence and the charge difference of the 15 COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal flanking amino acids. The difference was calculated using the formula: δ = C − N, where δ represents the charge difference, while C and N represent the sum of the assigned values of charged amino acid residues present in the COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal 15 flanking residues, respectively. lf δ is larger than 0, the COOH terminus of the hydrophobic segment is found on the luminal side, while if the value is negative, the NH2 terminus of the segment is found on the cytosolic side. Using their formula, we obtained the following values for the charge difference of Dri 42 hydrophobic segments: −3 (H1), +3 (H2), −0.5 (H3), +2.5 (H4), −3 (H5), and +0.5 (H6). Therefore, in our case the calculated orientation of each hydrophobic segment into the lipid bilayer perfectly matches the orientation determined by in vitro membrane insertion experiments (Fig. 8A). For this reason we conclude that the topogenic properties of the six hydrophobic segments in Dri 42 is determined by both hydrophobicity and charge difference between NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal 15 flanking residues. Dri 42 appears to represent an exceptional case, because the charge effect on the orientation of hydrophobic segments in a polytopic membrane protein is applicable in most cases only to the first one that contains a signal/anchor sequence (28Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Xie Y. Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Bellovino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol.

A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).A Novel Mechanism 5 be Involved in the ER Retention of Dri 42Biochemical and immunofluorescence studies clearly demonstrated ER localization of Dri 42 (Figs. 4, 5, 6). The primary sequence, however, does not contain any of the COOH-terminal consensus sequences for ER retention of membrane proteins, such as XKKXX, KXKXX, and XXKKX (25Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). However, Dri 42 contains two lysine residues at the extreme NH2 terminus, within the sequence MQSYKYDK. Jackson et al. (25Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that COOH-terminally located double lysine residues function as ER retention signal in HeLa cells. It remains to be established whether two amino-terminal lysines can also function as ER retention signal. If this case proves to be true for Dri 42, an alternative interpretation of ER retention signals could be provided, as two lysines within 8 residues from either terminus could play an important role in the ER retention of membrane proteins. Alternatively, if the double lysine signal functions only at the carboxyl terminus, the most likely interpretation of our results is that Dri 42 remains in the ER membrane by a new mechanism.Functional Implications of the Dri 42 Unique SequenceWe have reported in this paper the molecular and biochemical analysis of the novel protein Dri 42, whose expression was previously shown to increase during epithelial differentiation in rat small intestine as well as in kidney, liver, and lung (6Barilà D. Murgia C. Nobili F. Gaetani S. Perozzi G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dri 42 steady-state mRNA levels were found to increase also during in vitro differentiation of human adenocarcinoma cells Caco 2, while no difference was observed in the mouse myogenic C2 cell line, before and after myotube differentiation (data not shown). Therefore, although the Dri 42 gene is expressed ubiquitously, differentiation-dependent regulation of its expression appears to be specific for epithelial tissues. This observation led us to analyze further the Dri 42 gene product and its possible role in differentiating epithelia. Isolation and sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone encoding rat Dri 42 allowed to deduce the primary sequence of this protein, which does not share relevant sequence homology with previously identified proteins of known function. The only significant homology that was found in the EMBL and GenBank sequence data bases is with a recently isolated protein of yet unknown function (HIC-53), which is induced transcriptionally by hydrogen peroxide treatment of ras-transformed mouse osteoblasts (32Egawa K. Yoshiwara M. Shibanuma M. Nose K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although the cloned portion of HIC-53 is incomplete at the amino terminus, the two proteins share 48% homology over a stretch of 211 amino acid residues (33-244 in the Dri 42 sequence), encompassing the first five hydrophobic segments of Dri 42. We have determined that the Dri 42 protein contains six transmembrane regions and both the amino and carboxyl termini on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Such structure, together with the molecular mass and the membrane topology of Dri 42, is similar to that of aquaporins, the recently described water channel proteins of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 33van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. Dempster J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 291-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence homology, Dri 42 and HIC 53 may therefore represent a novel class of channel proteins. Further support in this direction comes from the features that are conserved between these two proteins. They both contain a repeating motif (R-X-X)n (between residues 218-230 in the Dri 42 sequence), which has been implicated in the conformational change that accompanies voltage gating in ion channel proteins, and a potential leucine zipper immediately downstream of this motif (residues 278, 285, and 292) (Ref. 34Pongs O. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S69-S87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). We do not have any evidence that Dri 42 can interact with itself or with other proteins, but it is tempting to speculate that it might be a subunit of an ER-specific channel. Outside of the apparent conservation of these motifs, the overall sequence homology with ion channel proteins is not very significant, but it is of interest to note that all channel proteins cloned so far have been localized in the plasma membrane. Chloride channels have been described in the ER, which may be involved in facilitating calcium uptake into the organelle or to associate with protein-conducting channels (Ref. 35Al-Awquati Q. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, and references therein), but no molecular data are yet available for sequence comparison.Further studies on the role of Dri 42 in intestinal epithelial differentiation, its putative function as a channel protein, and the mechanism of its ER retention are currently in progress in our laboratory. INTRODUCTIONThe epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa undergo constant renewal in the adult small intestine and represent therefore a good model to study the mechanisms of epithelial differentiation (1Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The three differentiated cell types that constitute the mature villus epithelium (absorptive enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells) all arise from a progenitor stem cell, anchored in the crypt compartment, and acquire a differentiated phenotype during migration from crypt to villus tip, where they eventually detach from the underlying mesenchyme and shed into the lumen. Paneth cells are the only cell type of this epithelium which migrates in the opposite direction during differentiation, as they are exclusively located at the crypt base. Commitment to differentiation and loss of proliferation capacity occur at very early stages of the migration process along the crypt-villus axis, before the cells reach the crypt-villus junction. They are accompanied by increasing expression of specific proteins that are necessary to perform the absorptive functions of the mature epithelium. In the enterocytes, which represent the most abundant villus cell type, the major classes of proteins whose expression is turned on during differentiation are digestive enzymes, transport proteins, and structural components of the microvillar cytoskeleton.Several studies have been conducted in recent years to identify the key factors involved in transcriptional activation of differentiation-specific intestinal genes. Among the transcription factors that have been shown to bind to intestinal gene promoters, some are expressed also in other tissues (members of the hepatic nuclear factor, GATA, retinoic acid receptor, and retinoid X receptor families) (2Crabtree G.R. Schibler U. Scott M.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1063-1102Google Scholar), while others appear to be intestine-specific (Cdx1 and Cdx2) (3Duprey P. Chowdhury K. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gruss P. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Molecular analysis of the promoters of cloned intestinal genes has shown that each of them contains distinct combinations of binding sites for different transcription factors, and a clear picture has not emerged yet of the general mechanisms underlying the regulation of intestinal gene transcription (5Boyle W.J. Brenner D.A. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 1995; 11: 121-127Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One aspect that can be further pursued to provide information on common mechanisms is the isolation of novel genes that are up-regulated during development and differentiation in the small intestine. In our laboratory, differentially expressed genes have been isolated in the past few years from rat intestinal epithelium by subtractive hybridization. Among the cDNA clones that we have identified with this approach, two novel genes have been previously reported (6Barilà D. Murgia C. Nobili F. Gaetani S. Perozzi G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both genes, named Dri 27 1The abbreviations used are: Dridifferentially expressed in rat intestineCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCdxcaudal-type homeoboxERendoplasmic reticulumFRICfetal rat intestinal cellsGSTglutathione S-transferaseMDCKMadine-Darby canine kidneyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. and Dri 42 (Dri, differentially expressed in rat intestine), share similar in vivo expression characteristics.

Therefore, in combination with strand displacement activity, RTH1 nucleases may serve as an important alternative to other pathways in repair of abasic sites in DNA. Abasic lesions occur in DNA for several reasons, including spontaneous depurination (1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), release of the base from a damaged sugar residue, or enzymatic removal of an inappropriate (e.g. uracil) or damaged (e.g. alkylated, deaminated, or oxidized) base by specialized glycosylases (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 139-169Google Scholar). Timely repair of abasic lesions is necessary, since during replication the lesion could lead to potentially lethal or mutagenic substitutions (3Wallace S.S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1994; 66: 579-589Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Repair of an abasic site is predominantly initiated by an apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: APapurinic-apyrimidinicdRpasedeoxyribophosphodiesteraseRTH1RAD2 homolog 1PEIpolyethyleneiminePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDdownstream primerMmiscellaneous primerTtemplateUupstream primer. endonuclease that cleaves immediately upstream of the baseless sugar, creating a 3′-hydroxyl terminus and a 5′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate terminus (4Mosbaugh D.W.

The next step, removal of the baseless sugar from the downstream strand, likely occurs by one of three distinct mechanisms. apurinic-apyrimidinic deoxyribophosphodiesterase RAD2 homolog 1 polyethyleneimine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis downstream primer miscellaneous primer template upstream primer. One mechanism involves removal of 5′-terminal sugar-phosphate residues by a Mg2+-dependent hydrolytic reaction, which releases 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate. The activity responsible for this reaction, deoxyribophosphodiesterase (dRpase), was discovered in Escherichia coli (6Franklin W.A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was later shown to result from cleavage by either exonuclease I (7Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4699-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or the RecJ protein (9Dianov G. Sedgwick B. Daly G. Olsson M. Lovett S. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The product of the RecJ gene was previously identified as a single strand-specific 5′- to 3′-exonuclease (10Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, enzymes with dRpase activity have no associated double strand-specific 5′- to 3′-exonuclease function, so only a 1-nucleotide gap is produced after removal of the baseless sugar. A DNA polymerase fills in the single gap, and then a DNA ligase fuses the nick. There is support for this pathway, known as base excision repair. It has been shown in vitro that the majority of uracil residues in DNA are repaired by replacing a single nucleotide (11Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and this pathway has been reconstituted with purified enzymes, one of which was the RecJ protein (12Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There is also evidence of dRpase activity in Deinococcus radiodurans (13Mun C. Del Rowe J. Sandigursky M. Minton K.W. Franklin W.A. Radiat. Res. 1994; 138: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and in humans (14Price A. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but these activities have been only partially purified and, therefore, have not yet been linked with a specific gene. Another mechanism entails removal of a 5′-terminal baseless sugar-phosphate residue by a β-elimination reaction, releasing unsaturated deoxyribose-phosphate derivatives. The C(3′)-O-P bond 3′ to a 5′-terminal abasic site is extremely labile, with a half-life of about 2 h in the absence of any β-elimination catalysts (e.g. spermine or basic proteins), prompting some to propose that enzymatic removal of the sugar-phosphate residue may not be necessary (15Bailly V. Verly W.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Bailly V. Verly W.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Others have demonstrated that a β-elimination reaction can be catalyzed by the Fpg protein in E. coli (17Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by DNA polymerase β in a reconstituted system (18Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). A third mechanism involves removal of 5′-terminal sugar-phosphate residues by endonucleolytic cleavage downstream of the baseless sugar. Previous studies indicate that the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I (6Franklin W.A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Price A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and human DNase IV (14Price A. Lindahl T.

Recent work with calf RTH1 and murine flap endonuclease 1 revealed that both exonuclease and endonuclease activities are enhanced when an upstream strand forms a nick structure directly adjacent to the annealed region of a downstream strand, whether fully annealed or bearing an unannealed 5′-tail (25Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that RTH1 nucleases prefer specific substrate structures to efficiently induce exonuclease and endonuclease cleavage. This led us to investigate whether removal of 5′-terminal baseless sugars as small oligonucleotides could be enhanced by simulating strand displacement synthesis. Such substrate structures may arise from a DNA polymerase extending the resulting upstream strand after an AP endonuclease cleaves at an internal abasic site but before removal of the baseless sugar-phosphate residue. Unless otherwise noted, DNA modification enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides were from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Radiolabeled nucleotides were from DuPont NEN. Sequenase version 2.0 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose resin was from Qiagen. Micropure™ EZ minicolumns were from Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyethyleneimine (PEI) cellulose TLC plates (20 × 20 cm) were from EM Science (via VWR Scientific). All other reagents, including 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, were from Sigma. Recombinant human RTH1 was obtained from bacteria using the T7 RNA expression system (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) following the procedure of Shen et al. (24Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coding sequence for human RTH1 was cloned into the expression vector pET-28b (Novagen) upstream and in frame with the coding sequence for 6 histidine residues. The resulting plasmid, pET-FCH, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown at 37°C and induced with a final concentration of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The recombinant protein, which contains the entire amino acid sequence for human RTH1 with a histidine tag at the C-terminal end, was purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column chromatography as recommended by Qiagen. Fractions were collected and tested for 5′- to 3′-exonuclease and -endonuclease activities as described previously (25Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled and further purified by hydroxylapatite as described in Murante et al. (25Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for calf RTH1. The final preparation was ∼95% pure according to analysis by SDS-PAGE stained with silver. Purified enzyme (0.15 mg/ml) was dialyzed into a storage buffer (20% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA and EGTA) and then stored at −80°C. For control experiments using substrates without an abasic residue at the 5′-terminus, a 22-mer oligonucleotide (M22; Table I) with a deoxyuridine at the 5′-terminus was annealed to a complementary template (T44; Table I) so that a single unpaired guanine nucleotide remained at the 5′-terminus of the template. The primer M22 was radiolabeled by template-directed incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) at its 3′-terminus using Sequenase (version 2.0). The resulting 23-mer (D*; Table I) primer with a labeled 3′-terminus and a 5′-terminal deoxyuridine was gel purified and annealed to a 39-mer template (T39; Table I) to form one of four primary substrates (D*:T39; Fig. 2). For experiments using substrates with an abasic lesion at the 5′-terminus, a 39-mer oligonucleotide (M39; Table I) with an internal deoxyuridine was 3′-radiolabeled as above, gel purified, and then annealed to the template (T39). In every instance, template T39 allowed at least 4 residues to overhang at both 3′-ends to prevent degradation of the substrate by exonuclease III at a later step (Fig. 1, lane 1). The substrate was stored at −20°C until use. For each experiment, a small aliquot was removed from storage and further prepared as follows. The uracil base was removed using uracil-DNA-glycosylase at 37°C for 120 min. The substrate was then incubated at 37°C with 2 units of exonuclease III for 35 min to specifically cleave on the 5′-side of the deoxyribose-5-phosphate lesion. Under the conditions used, exonuclease III continued to degrade the resulting upstream strand until only 3-5 nucleotides remained (Fig. 1, lane 5), at which point this short primer could be easily displaced from the template. This formed the second primary substrate (APD*:T39; Fig. 2). Exonuclease III was removed by centrifuging the substrate through a Micropure™ EZ column (Amicon). A control experiment confirmed that exonuclease III is completely removed by the minicolumn (Fig. 1, lane 3).Table I.Oligonucleotide sequencesDownstream primersD*(23-mer):5′-UTCTTTTCTTTCCCTTCCTCTTC-3′aU within a sequence context is defined as deoxyuridine.

A different substrate (*APD:T39) with a 5′-terminal abasic residue was subjected to gel electrophoresis (lane 6) to verify that this resolving method causes spontaneous detachment of the baseless residue. Products were analyzed by 12% PAGE-urea and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A 22-mer oligonucleotide (M22; Table I) with a deoxyuridine at the 5′-terminus was 5′-radiolabeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). For control experiments using substrates without an abasic residue at the 5′-terminus, this labeled oligomer was annealed to a complementary 39-mer template (T39; Table I) to form a third primary substrate (*D:T39; Fig. 2). For experiments using substrates with an abasic lesion at the 5′-terminus, this labeled oligomer was annealed to a complementary 44-mer template (T44) along with a 17-mer oligonucleotide (U17; Table I) which annealed immediately upstream of the labeled 22-mer oligonucleotide. The upstream and downstream strands were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The resulting 39-mer oligonucleotide with an internal, 5′-labeled deoxyuridine was gel purified and annealed to the 39-mer template used above (T39). The substrate was stored at −20°C until use. For each experiment, a small aliquot was removed from storage and further prepared as follows. The uracil base was removed using uracil-DNA-glycosylase at 37°C for 120 min. The substrate was then incubated at 37°C with 2 units of exonuclease III for 35 min to specifically cleave on the 5′-side of the deoxyribose-5-phosphate lesion. As above, exonuclease III degraded the resulting upstream strand until only 3-5 nucleotides remained. This formed the fourth primary substrate (*APD:T39; Fig. 2). As above, exonuclease III was removed by centrifuging the substrate through a Micropure™ EZ column (Amicon). Results on a PEI cellulose TLC plate (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2) confirm that the minicolumn does not disrupt the labile 5′-terminal abasic residue; it remained attached to the downstream primer for subsequent experiments. Enzyme reactions (25 μl) contained 50 mM Tris, pH 7.75, 6 mM MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 pmol of an upstream primer (U17, U18, U19, U20, or U22; Table I) or no primer, approximately 175 fmol of a radiolabeled primary substrate, and 0.15 μg of human RTH1 nuclease. The reactions were incubated at 37°C, and aliquots (5 μl) were removed at the indicated times. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of either 90% (v/v) formamide with bromophenol blue and xylene cyanole markers for gel electrophoresis or chilled 50 mM EDTA for TLC plate analysis. For experiments using primary substrates (D*:T39, APD*:T39, or *D:T39), reaction products were resolved on a 12% PAGE, 7 M urea sequencing gel. For experiments using the other primary substrate (*APD:T39), samples were analyzed by PEI cellulose thin layer chromatography (32Randerath K. Randerath E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12A: 323-347Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The mobile phase was a mixture of 50% 1 M formic acid and 50% 1 M sodium formate (pH 3.4). Previous work with calf RTH1 and murine flap endonuclease 1 showed that endonuclease activity was efficient on annealed primers with unannealed 5′-tails. In addition, cleavage was often enhanced when an upstream primer formed a nick structure directly adjacent to the first annealed nucleotide of the downstream primer (25Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Such structures would result in vivo from a strand displacement synthesis activity that extends the upstream strand at a single stranded break in duplex DNA into the annealed region of the downstream strand, thereby displacing a 5′-terminal segment of the downstream strand. This prompted us to explore whether removal of 5′-terminal baseless sugars as small oligonucleotides could be enhanced by simulating strand displacement synthesis. Four primary substrates were first created from which all additional substrates were made. The two primary substrates (D*:T39 and *D:T39; see Fig. 2) with intact 5′-terminal deoxyuridine residues and that were either 3′- or 5′-radiolabeled, respectively, were created as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The other two primary substrates (APD*:T39 and *APD:T39) consisted of fully annealed downstream primers having a baseless sugar-phosphate residue at the 5′-terminus and were either 3′- or 5′-radiolabeled, respectively. Removal of a uracil base by uracil glycosylase is inefficient when the base is located near the ends of DNA (data not shown; Ref. 14Price A. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In view of this, we designed these primary substrates by either creating or using oligonucleotides containing an internal deoxyuridine residue as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” These oligomers were annealed to a template (T39) and treated with uracil glycosylase to create an internal abasic site. The template (T39) (Table I) was designed to allow 4 residues to overhang at both 3′-ends to prevent degradation of the substrate prematurely during the following step. The substrates were then treated with exonuclease III, which has both AP endonuclease activity and 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity on recessed 3′-termini of double stranded DNA. This nuclease initially cleaves on the 5′-side of the internal abasic residue and then digests the resulting upstream strand. Thorough digestion of the resulting upstream primer was necessary, since we wanted to introduce several new upstream primers of increasing length. Finally, exonuclease III was removed by centrifuging the substrates through a Micropure™ EZ minicolumn (Amicon). As shown in Fig. 1, several control experiments were conducted to monitor the substrate design procedures. Fig. 1, lane 1, depicts 5′-radiolabeled *M39:T39 (Table I) treated with exonuclease III for 60 min to verify that the overhanging 3′-ends protect the downstream primer and the template from being degraded. Fig. 1, lane 2, shows the same substrate after it has been treated for 120 min with uracil-DNA glycosylase. The result verifies that the substrate with an internal abasic lesion is stable when resolved by gel electrophoresis, although some β-elimination reaction product is evident. Fig. 1, lane 3, depicts the substrate from lane 2 after it had been further treated with exonuclease III, quickly centrifuged through a Micropure™ EZ minicolumn, and then incubated at 37°C for 75 min. This confirms that: 1) the uracil base is mostly removed; 2) exonuclease III is an efficient AP endonuclease; and 3) the minicolumn completely removes the exonuclease III. Fig. 1, lane 5, shows the substrate from lane 2 after it has been incubated with exonuclease III for 45 min, confirming that the enzyme almost fully digests the upstream primer created after initial AP endonuclease cleavage. Finally, in Fig. 1, lane 6, the 5′-radiolabeled primary substrate having a 5′-terminal abasic lesion (*APD:T39) was gel electrophoresed. The result indicates that a 5′-terminal baseless sugar-phosphate residue is so labile that it spontaneously detaches during the electrophoresis procedure. For this reason, experiments using the primary substrate (*APD:T39) were analyzed instead by PEI cellulose thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, four sets of six substrates were designed with a series of upstream primers that increasingly displaced a fully complementary downstream primer. An approximately 270-fold molar excess of five increasingly long upstream primers (U17, U18, U19, U20, and U22; Table I) were separately annealed to the four primary substrates (D*:T39, APD*:T39, *D:T39, and *APD:T39; see Fig. 2). These structures were likely in equilibrium, so that part of the time, a segment of the downstream primer was displaced by the upstream primers. The rest of the time, the upstream primer was displaced. Unannealed 3′-tails, however, are not suitable for cleavage by RTH1 nucleases. Using these substrates, we tested the ability of human RTH1 nuclease to endonucleolytically cleave downstream of either an intact 5′-terminal deoxyuridine residue or a 5′-terminal abasic lesion. Cleavage was monitored by the production of radiolabeled cleavage products over a time course. Control experiments also were performed without upstream primers. The first experiment was designed to determine the cleavage specificity of human RTH1 nuclease on substrates made from D*:T39 with an intact 5′-terminal deoxyuridine residue (Fig. 3). Fig. 3, lanes 3-6, shows that without an upstream primer, cleavage was inefficient and somewhat nonspecific, releasing primarily 1 or 2 nucleotides. Once a nick structure was formed by primer U17 positioned immediately upstream of a fully annealed downstream primer, the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease function became predominant, releasing mostly 1 nucleotide (Fig. 3, lanes 8-11). Exonucleolytic cleavage became even more efficient (Fig. 3, lanes 12-15) when the primer (U18) was long enough to displace the 5′-terminal nucleotide on the downstream primer. Here, the majority of substrate was converted to product within the first 10 min, whereas the rest was resistant to cleavage, perhaps because some downstream primers remained completely unannealed. Cleavage activity shifted from exonucleolytic to endonucleolytic as the upstream primer became long enough to displace dimer (Fig. 3, lanes 18-21), trimer (Fig. 3, lanes 22-25), or pentamer (Fig. 3, lanes 27-30) unannealed tails on the downstream primer. The results indicate that cleavage always occurred on the 5′-side of the first annealed nucleotide at the base of the tail. Cleavage was most eff"

Recent investigations indicate that overexpression of Hsp27 confers resistance to heat stress in cultured cells and protects the actin cytoskeleton from disruption by ATP depletion, cytochalasin D, and other stresses (10Chretien P. Landry J. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 137: 7-15Google Scholar, 11Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stabilization of the actin-based cytoskeleton may be related to the ability of Hsp27 to bind barbed ends of actin filaments (13Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Miron T. Wilchek M. Geiger B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Hsp27 diminishes its affinity for F-actin, thereby suggesting that stabilization of cytoskeleton by sHsps is a reversible and regulated process (11Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol.

Ser82 of Hsp27 is rapidly phosphorylated in cells exposed to heat stress, arsenite, or interleukin-1, and serves as a downstream target for a “stress-activated” protein kinase cascade that includes an extracellular regulated kinase homolog designated P38 and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (15Landry J.

In vitro, Hsp27 and α crystallin decelerate the aggregation of partially denatured proteins and promote correct (“native”) folding of such proteins via cycles of reversible binding and release of the “client” proteins (8Merck K.B. Groenen P.J. Voorter C.E. deHaard-Hoeckman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The preceding observations suggest that sHsps are molecular chaperones that augment or complement functions of Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar, 2Nover, L., Scharf, K.-D., in Heat Shock Response, (Nover, L., ed) pp. 41–128, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar, 3Ciocca D.R.

Interactions between partially folded proteins and members of the Hsp60/Hsp70 families are strictly dependent on the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by the chaperones; in contrast, sHsps promote folding in an ATP-independent manner (8Merck K.B. Groenen P.J. Voorter C.E. deHaard-Hoeckman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Investigations on sHsps have focused principally on the ability of these proteins to protect cells against physical, chemical, and biological stresses. However, the properties of small molecular chaperones are also well suited for subserving physiological roles in unstressed cells. For example, the rate and level of protein synthesis are markedly elevated at various stages of embryogenesis in many organisms. As a consequence, cellular machinery that ensures efficient, high fidelity folding of polypeptides may be required for embryonic homeostasis. Hsp70 chaperones are absent during early developmental stages in mammals, and the forced expression of these proteins in Drosophila embryos results in lethality (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar, 4Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Thus, embryonic expression of small molecular chaperone proteins, which inhibit nascent polypeptide aggregation and promote accurate folding of newly synthesized proteins, could potentially support and facilitate the rapid progression of early development. Small molecular chaperones that reversibly associate with actin filaments may also be intimately involved in the multiple cycles of cytoskeleton reorganization that accompany serial cell divisions and extensive cell differentiation in embryos. At present, little is known about expression, structure, regulation, and possible functions of sHsp-related proteins during early embryogenesis in mammals and most other organisms. The nonparasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model system for investigations on these topics. Adult C. elegans are composed of 959 somatic cells, which are organized into highly specialized tissues that constitute reproductive, digestive, muscular, hypodermal, and nervous systems (23Sulston J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis Elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 123-155Google Scholar, 24Sulston J. Horvitz H.R. Kimble J. Wood W.B.

Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cellular and developmental biology of the nematode have been characterized in exceptional detail, and the lineage for each cell in the animal has been established (23Sulston J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis Elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 123-155Google Scholar, 24Sulston J. Horvitz H.R. Kimble J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis Elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 457-489Google Scholar, 25Kenyon C. Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, the molecules and mechanisms that govern signal transduction and development in C. elegans are universal and control similar processes in higher organisms, including mammals (26Han M. Sternberg P. Cell. 1990; 65: 921-931Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 27Clark G.S. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Embryogenesis in C. elegans is an invariant, stereotypical process that is completed over a period of 14 h (28Wood W.B. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis Elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 215-241Google Scholar). Approximately 60% of the adult's ultimate constellation of cells is generated from the zygote during the first 6 h of embryogenesis. Morphogenesis of the embryo into an L1 larva ensues in the subsequent 8 h. Compression of intensive embryonic protein synthesis and multiple cytoskeletal rearrangements into a relatively brief time frame creates an environment in which the demand for efficient and accurate protein folding is extremely high. Previous investigations on C. elegans failed to identify small molecular chaperones that are expressed in normally developing, unstressed embryos. Candido and co-workers (29Russnak R.H. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Jones D. Russnak R.H. Kay R.J. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12006-12015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) characterized four homologous C. elegans genes (hsp16-41, hsp16-48, hsp16-1, and hsp16-2) that encode putative sHsps composed of 143 or 145 amino acid residues. Portions of the central and COOH-terminal regions of these predicted C. elegans polypeptides share substantial sequence identity/similarity with corresponding, highly conserved regions in mammalian Hsp27 and α crystallin homologs. However, C. elegans hsp16-1, hsp16-2, hsp16-41, and hsp16-48 genes are fully repressed and uninducible during early embryogenesis (31Stringham E.G. Dixon D.K. Jones D. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Moreover, accumulation of the various nematode HSP16 proteins at later stages of development is strictly dependent upon heat shock or other stresses. We now report the discovery of a C. elegans gene (sec-1) that encodes a novel, developmentally regulated chaperone protein (Mr 18,000) that performs critical functions in early embryogenesis. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans was grown at 20°C as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To synchronize C. elegans for developmental studies, embryos were hatched in the absence of nutrients and then transferred to plates containing E. coli as a food source. Under these conditions, the worms develop synchronously into reproductive adults (33Wood W.B. Hecht R. Carr S. Vanderslice R. Wolf N. Hirsch D. Dev. Biol. 1980; 74: 446-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). L1 larvae were harvested 6 h after feeding, L2 larvae at 20 h, L3 at 29 h, L4 larvae at 40 h, young adult worms at 53 h, and egg-laying adult nematodes at 75 h. A purified population of embryos was obtained by alkaline hypochlorite treatment of gravid C. elegans, as described by Sulston and Hodgkin (34Sulston J. Hodgkin J. The Nematode Caenorhabditis Elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 603-605Google Scholar). C. elegans were adapted to grow under conditions of heavy metal stress (2 mM CdCl2) as described in a previous paper (35Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A library that is enriched in stress-induced cDNAs was constructed in the bacteriophage λZAPII (Stratagene) using mRNA from CdCl2-treated nematodes as a template (35Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The library was screened with single-stranded 32P-labeled cDNAs that were generated from mRNAs that were isolated from control and cadmium-adapted C. elegans. Hybridization and washing conditions are given by Smith et al. (36Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A group of recombinant phage clones that contain stress-induced cDNAs were obtained by this differential screening procedure. The cDNA inserts were subcloned into the plasmid pGEM7Z (Promega) and sequenced. One of the stress-induced cDNAs (λZ500) encoded a novel partial protein that was related to sHsps from mammals and C. elegans. This protein was named SEC-1. A 325-bp fragment of SEC-1 cDNA was excised with SalI and used a template to generate a random-primed, 32P-labeled probe. The probe was used to screen a more complete C. elegans cDNA library in the phage λgt11 (Clontech), using the conditions described in Smith et al. (36Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four positive recombinant phage clones were plaque-purified, and the cDNAs were subcloned in pGEM7Z and sequenced. Further details are provided under “Results.” A 32P-labeled, 325-bp SEC-1 cDNA fragment (see above) was used as a probe to screen a λEMBL4 library that contains the C. elegans genome. The library and screening procedures are described in previous papers (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lu X. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 2.4-kilobase pair fragment of genomic DNA, which includes the SEC-1 structural gene and 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM7Z and sequenced. Further details are provided under “Results.” Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA) and the BLAST and FASTA programs (38Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar, 39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) provided by the NCBI (National Center For Biotechnology Information) server and the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health. Fragments of C. elegans genomic DNA were generated by digestion with restriction endonucleases, fractionated in a 0.6% agarose gel, and transferred to a Nytran membrane as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Southern blot was probed with 32P-labeled SEC-1 cDNA (2 × 106 cpm/ml). Conditions for hybridization, as well as high and low stringency washing of the membrane, are given by Hu and Rubin (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total C. elegans RNA was prepared as indicated in in a previous paper (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was purified with a “Fast Track” Kit (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (40Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a 32P-labeled, 262-bp 3′ SalI fragment of SEC-1 cDNA as a probe. For some Northern analyses, nematodes were grown under environmental stresses prior to harvesting. Stressful conditions included heat shock (31°C for 1, 3, or 12 h), cold shock (4 or 10°C for 1, 2, or 12 h), starvation (22, 48, or 63 h), or acute exposure to cadmium (0.2 mM CdCl2 for 1, 2, or 24 h). SEC-1 cDNAs and genomic DNA fragments containing the sec-1 gene were subcloned into the plasmid pGEM7Z. DNA inserts were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure of Sanger et al. (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using T7, SP6, and custom oligonucleotide primers as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lu X. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing reagents were from Amersham Corp. An antisense 32-mer oligonucleotide (5′-ATGCTGTGACGCTGAGCCCAGTATGGCATCAT-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 108-139 in exon I of the sec-1 gene was radiolabeled at its 5′-terminus (108 cpm/μg) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Poly(A+) RNA (10 μg) from C. elegans was annealed to labeled primer (1 × 106 cpm) in 40 mM PIPES buffer (pH 6.4) containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.4 M NaCl, and 80% formamide, by denaturing at 85°C for 10 min and then incubating at 42°C for 8 h. The hybridized primer was extended using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, as described by Reeder et al. (42Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Dunaway M. Cell. 1983; 35: 449-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The extended product was characterized by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and subsequent autoradiography. A 507-bp XbaI-EcoRI restriction fragment of SEC-1 cDNA was subcloned into the pRSET-C expression plasmid (Invitrogen). This places the entire coding region of SEC-1 cDNA downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and 45 codons that constitute an NH2-terminal fusion peptide. The peptide contains a stretch of six consecutive His residues, which form a nickel binding domain. E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the expression plasmid and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 1 h at 37°C. The host bacterium contains a chromosomal copy of the phage T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lac promoter. Bacteria were harvested, disrupted, and separated into soluble and particulate fractions as described for previous studies (43Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The SEC-1 fusion protein was recovered in the pellet fraction, because it is insoluble in the standard 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer system (pH 8) used for bacterial lysis. Recombinant SEC-1 was dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl supplemented with 8 M urea and purified to near homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography (in the presence of 8 M urea) as described previously (43Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When urea was eliminated by extensive dialysis against 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.9, the SEC-1 fusion protein remained soluble (see “Results” for details). Approximately 5 mg of highly purified SEC-1 fusion protein was obtained from a 500-ml culture of E. coli. Samples of the SEC-1 fusion protein were injected into rabbits (0.2-mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of three booster injections) at Hazelton Corning Laboratories (Vienna, VA) for the generation of antisera. Serum was collected at 3-week intervals. Samples of proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (44Bregman B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Albumin (Mr 67,000), ovalbumin (Mr 43,000), carbonic anhydrase (Mr 29,000), myoglobin (Mr 17,000), and cytochrome C (Mr 12,000) were used as standards for the estimation of Mr values. The cytosolic and particulate fractions of C. elegans homogenates were prepared as described previously (45Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of C. elegans proteins and SEC-1 fusion protein were blocked, incubated with antiserum (1:2000), and washed as described previously (46Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SEC-1 was visualized by an indirect chemiluminescence procedure as previously reported (46Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pRSET-C expression plasmids that contained no insert, a cDNA encoding full-length SEC-1, or an unrelated cDNA (clone YPP, a cDNA encoding a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of a C. elegans protein-tyrosine phosphatase). In the latter two instances, the recombinant proteins were constitutively expressed in the absence of inducer (see “Results”). Bacteria were grown to A600 = 0.3. Next, the cultures were diluted 1:4000 into fresh medium and incubated for 1 h at 28°C. Subsequently, the bacteria were subjected to heat stress by shifting the incubation temperature to 58°C for 30 min. After rapid cooling, the cells were maintained at 28°C for 48 h. Growth was monitored by determination of A600 values at various times. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Link Inc. (Thornwood, NY). Two antisense oligonucleotides were employed. αS-1 (5′GACGGCCAGTGTATGGGCAGA-3′) corresponds to the inverse complement of nucleotides 17-37 in SEC-1 cDNA (Fig. 1); αS-2 (5′-TGAGCCCAGTATGGCATCAT-3′) corresponds to the inverse complement of nucleotides 67-86 in SEC-1 cDNA (Fig. 1). S1 (5′-TCTGCCCATACACTGGCCGTC-3′), which corresponds to nucleotides 17-37 in SEC-1 cDNA (Fig. 1), served as a “sense” control. A mixture of antisense oligonucleotides (5 μMαS1 plus 5 μMαS2) was injected into the gonadal syncytium of 25 young adult C. elegans as described previously (40Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control, sense oligonucleotide (10 μM S1) was injected into a second group of 25 animals. Injected oligonucleotides diffuse throughout a common cytoplasm that is associated with many oocyte nuclei. As oocyte differentiation proceeds, plasma membranes are generated, and the oligonucleotides are sequestered in individual oocytes. These oocytes are destined for fertilization and externalization (as developing embryos) within a 24-h period. Individual injected C. elegans were placed on plates containing E. coli as a food source. After 24 h, embryonic nematodes derived from injected parental C. elegans were examined for abnormalities via microscopy. Results were recorded on film as described previously (40Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA library was prepared in the bacteriophage λZAPII, using template mRNA isolated from nematodes that were stressed with 2 mM CdCl2 (35Slice L.W. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant phage that contain cDNAs encoding stress-induced proteins were identified by differential screening. A 521-bp cDNA insert from a recombinant phage designated λZ500 encodes a partial polypeptide (amino acid residues 4-159, Fig. 1) with a novel sequence. A translation termination codon and 3′-untranslated nucleotides followed the open reading frame. Four additional cDNAs were retrieved from another C. elegans library in bacteriophage λgt11 by screening with 32P-labeled probes corresponding to λZ500 cDNA. The largest cDNA (Fig. 1) encodes a polypeptide that is composed of 159 amino acids and has a calculated Mr of 17,839. The remaining cDNA sequences were included within the sequence presented in Fig. 1. As the result of overlaps, the cDNA sequence was determined three times, an"

We have now further characterized the intracellular pool of N-type calcium channels in both IMR32 human neuroblastoma and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. Intracellular N-type calcium channels were found to be accumulated in subcellular fractions where the chromogranin B-containing secretory granules were also enriched. 125I-ω-Conotoxin GVIA binding assays on fixed and permeabilized cells revealed that intracellular N-type calcium channels translocate to the plasma membrane in cells exposed to secretagogues (KCl, ionomycin, and phorbol esters). The kinetics, Ca2+ and protein kinase C dependence, and brefeldin A insensitivity of N-type calcium channels translocation were similar to the regulated release of chromogranin B, while no correlation was found with the constitutive secretion of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. A PC12 subclone deficient in the regulated but not in the constitutive pathway of secretion had a small intracellular pool of N-type calcium channels, and no secretagogueinduced translocation occurred in these cells. Calcium channel translocation was accompanied by a stronger response of Fura-2-loaded cells to depolarizing stimuli, suggesting that the newly inserted channels are functional. An intracellular pool of N-type voltage-operated calcium channels has recently been described in different neuronal cell lines. We have now further characterized the intracellular pool of N-type calcium channels in both IMR32 human neuroblastoma and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. Intracellular N-type calcium channels were found to be accumulated in subcellular fractions where the chromogranin B-containing secretory granules were also enriched. 125I-ω-Conotoxin GVIA binding assays on fixed and permeabilized cells revealed that intracellular N-type calcium channels translocate to the plasma membrane in cells exposed to secretagogues (KCl, ionomycin, and phorbol esters). The kinetics, Ca2+ and protein kinase C dependence, and brefeldin A insensitivity of N-type calcium channels translocation were similar to the regulated release of chromogranin B, while no correlation was found with the constitutive secretion of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. A PC12 subclone deficient in the regulated but not in the constitutive pathway of secretion had a small intracellular pool of N-type calcium channels, and no secretagogueinduced translocation occurred in these cells. Calcium channel translocation was accompanied by a stronger response of Fura-2-loaded cells to depolarizing stimuli, suggesting that the newly inserted channels are functional."
https://openalex.org/W2065459365,"The mouse ST8Sia II (mST8Sia II/STX) gene encodes a neural cell adhesion molecule-specific polysialic acid synthase whose expression is regulated during the developmental stages of mouse brain. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the expression is tissue-specifically and developmentally regulated, we isolated the complete genomic DNA and characterized the promoter of the gene for mST8Sia II. The gene encoding mST8Sia II was found to span about 80 kilobases and to be composed of six exons. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses revealed that the transcription started from 167 nucleotides upstream of the translational initiation site. Promoter analyses of the 5′-flanking region of the mST8Sia II gene using a luciferase gene reporter system revealed strong promoter activity in retinoic acid-induced differentiated P19 cells, which highly express the mST8Sia II gene. Deletion analyses demonstrated that the minimal promoter activity detected for the proximal region 325 base pairs upstream from the translational initiation codon (−158 to +167) could be modulated by various sequences within the 9.5-kilobase 5′-flanking region. The minimal promoter was embedded in a GC-rich domain (74%, GC content), in which two Sp1 binding motifs as well as a long purine-rich region were found, but it lacked TATA and CAAT boxes. The positive regulatory region located between −159 and −659 contained two additional Sp1 binding motifs and a long pyrimidine-rich region. We also found that the minimal promoter region of the mST8Sia II gene was sufficient for expression of a reporter gene in mST8Sia II gene-expressing neural differentiated P19 cells but not in nonexpressing ones. Thus the TATA-less GC-rich minimal promoter region of mST8Sia II probably controls the cell type-specific expression of the mST8Sia II gene.

Mouse ST8Sia II (mST8Sia II) exhibits overall amino acid sequence identity of 56% with mouse ST8Sia IV (mST8Sia IV). Both sialyltransferases can synthesize PSA on α2,3-linked sialic acids on N-CAM without any initiators (16Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J.

Northern blot analysis indicated that expression of the mST8Sia II gene was restricted to the brain and testis, whereas the mST8Sia IV gene was expressed strongly in lung and heart rather than brain (13Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The expression of the mST8Sia II gene in the brain was strictly regulated during developmental stages (13Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), i.e. an mST8Sia II transcript could be detected in brain on embryonic day 14, which peaked on embryonic day 20 and then decreased progressively to an almost undetectable level by 2 weeks after birth. The expression of the mST8Sia IV gene was also higher in fetal than adult brain but was less regulated during brain development compared with that of the mST8Sia II gene (16Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying of their tissue- and development-specific expression, it is important to know the structures and activities of their promoters.We showed recently that expression of the mST8Sia II gene increased in parallel with the increased activity of PSA synthase and the quantity of PSA N-CAM during neuronal differentiation of mouse teratocarcinoma P19 cells, which provides us with an in vitro model system for studying its promoter activity in the neural differentiation processes (21Kojima N. Kono M. Yoshida Y. Tachida Y. Nakafuku M. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22058-22062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the genomic structure and promoter sequence of the mST8Sia II gene and determination of the 5′-flanking region responsible for the cell type-specific promoter activity by means of transfection experiments using differentiated P19 cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we determined the entire genomic organization of the mST8Sia II gene, characterized the functional promoter activity for the 5′-flanking region in transient transfection assays, and investigated the expression of the gene in mouse teratocarcinoma P19 cells. We demonstrated that the minimal promoter region of the mST8Sia II gene is sufficient to express cell type-specific promoter activity, which is correlated with mST8Sia II gene expression in the cells.Previously, the genomic structures of five other sialyltransferase genes have been reported, i.e. rat galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase (rST6Gal I) (26Svensson E.C. Soreghan B. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20863-20868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wang X. O'Hanlon T.P. Young R.F. Lau J.T.Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 931-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), mouse N-acetylgalactosamide α2,6-sialyltransferase (mST6GalNAc II) (30Kurosawa N. Inoue M. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15109-15116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and mouse sialoside α2,8-sialyltransferase (mST8Sia III) (22Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Taguchi A. Arita M. Kojima N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The genomic structure of the mST8Sia II gene was most similar to that of the mST8Sia III gene, as follows (Fig. 6). The putative active domains of mST8Sia II and mST8Sia III were encoded by only three and two exons, respectively, whereas those of the other genes consisted of at least five exons. In particular, the positions of the two exon-intron boundaries of the mST8Sia II gene (introns 3 and 5) and the mST8Sia III gene (introns 2 and 3) were identical, and all of their splice junctions occurred after the second nucleotide of the amino acid codon. Although in mST8Sia III sialyl motif L, a highly conserved putative nucleotide sugar binding domain (31Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) is encoded by one exon, the corresponding motif in mST8Sia II is encoded by discrete exons, like those observed in other genes. The similarity of the genomic organization and amino acid sequences between mouse ST8Sia II and ST8Sia III suggests that these genes constitute a subgroup distinct from other sialyltransferase genes.The results of primer extension and S1 protection analyses showed that mST8Sia II gene has a single transcription initiation site. In addition, we demonstrated that the 5′-flanking sequence of the mST8Sia II gene contained a functional promoter that was highly active in neural differentiated P19 cells, which strongly express the mST8Sia II gene. Deletion analysis clearly indicated that the minimal promoter, the region contained within the 158 bp upstream of the transcription start site (pBO1-XN0.35), exhibited substantial tissue specificity (Fig. 5). In differentiated P19 cells, an approximately 10-fold increase in promoter activity was observed with the pBO1-XN0.35 construct compared with that in undifferentiated P19 cells. We showed recently that the expression of the mST8Sia II gene in neural differentiated P19 cells increased dramatically to a level approximately 10-20 times higher than that in undifferentiated cells (21Kojima N. Kono M. Yoshida Y. Tachida Y. Nakafuku M. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22058-22062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The increase in minimal promoter activity on neural differentiation is correlated with the gene expression of mST8Sia II in P19 cells. Moreover, the promoter activity was negligible in NIH 3T3 cells, in which the mST8Sia II gene was not expressed. Therefore, the minimal promoter region may possess the ability to initiate transcription in a cell-specific fashion.The proximal region 158 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site was characterized as a minimal promoter that contained two functional Sp1 binding sites but lacked consensus TATA and CAAT boxes. In addition, the 5′-untranslated region of the mST8Sia II gene contained a large GC-rich domain with the characteristics of a CpG island. These structural features are usually associated with housekeeping gene promoters. However, recent studies have shown that many tissue-specific gene promoters, including neural cell-specific promoters, include the structural features of housekeeping gene-like promoters. Neuron-specific TATA-less promoters have been shown to have either a single transcription initiation site, as observed in the synapsin I gene (32Sauerwald A. Hoesche C. Oschwald R. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synapsin II gene (33Chin L.-S. Li L. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18507-18513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nerve growth factor receptor gene (34Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and several olfactory neuron-specific genes (35Wang M.M. Tsai R.Y.L. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5805-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or to have multiple initiation sites, such as those found in the genes encoding synaptophysin, the type II sodium channel (36Maue R.A. Kraner S.D. Goodman R.H. Mandel G. Neuron. 1990; 4: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the D1A dopamine receptor (37Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Monswa F.J. Sibley D.R. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and brain-specific aldolase C (38Vibert M. Henry J. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mST8Sia II promoter may belong to the former group, i.e. GC-rich and TATA-less promoters with a single transcription initiation site.Two Sp1 binding sites were found in the minimal promoter region, and DNase I protection assays with the purified Sp1 protein revealed that these two sites were functional (Fig. 4). Moreover, two additional Sp1 binding sites were present in the regulatory regions (−158 to −293 and −293 to −659). It was reported previously that the distantly located site functions synergistically with the promoter-proximal site to activate transcription strongly in vivo, and that this synergism is a direct consequence of interactions between remote and local Sp1s (39Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5670-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Deletion of the sequence from positions −158 to −293 of mST8Sia II reduced the promoter activity, suggesting that Sp1 bound to the site at −170 probably interacts with another Sp1 in the minimal promoter region. The expression of Sp1 is ubiquitous, but it was reported previously that Sp1 levels appeared to be highest in developing hematopoietic cells, fetal cells, and spermatides in the mouse (40Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The regulated expression of the mST8Sia II gene in fetal and newborn brain and testis seemed to correspond to that of Sp1. Although Sp1 was found to be expressed in NIH 3T3 and undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells (data not shown), the expression level of the reporter gene fused to the minimal promoter sequence of ST8Sia II (−158/+168) was very low in undifferentiated P19 cells and hardly detectable in 3T3 cells. These results suggest that some cell-specific transcription factor is involved in differentiated P19 cells and that it might be required for interaction with Sp1 in the minimal promoter elements, which allows activation of the mST8Sia II gene promoter. Further studies involving identification of the regulatory elements and their binding factors will facilitate elucidation of the tissue-specific and developmental regulation of ST8Sia II gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2069894826,"Rat liver 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), a member of the aldoketoreductase superfamily, inactivates circulating steroid hormones using NAD(P)H as cofactor. Despite determination of the 3α-HSD·NADP+ binary complex structure, the functional elements that dictate the binding of steroids remain unclear (Bennett, M.J., Schlegel, B.P., Jez, J.M., Penning, T.M., and Lewis, M. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 10702-10711). Two tryptophans (Trp86 and Trp227) near the active site may have roles in substrate binding, and their fluorescence may be quenched upon binding of NADPH. Trp86 is located within an apolar cleft, while Trp227 is found on an opposing loop near the active site. A third tryptophan, Trp148, is on the periphery of the structure. To investigate the roles of these tryptophans in protein fluorescence and ligand binding, we generated three mutant enzymes (W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y) by site-directed mutagenesis. Spectroscopic measurements on these proteins showed that Trp148 contributed the most to the enzyme fluorescence spectra, with Trp227 adding the least. Trp86 was identified as the tryptophan quenched by bound NADPH through an energy transfer mechanism. The W86Y mutant altered binding of cofactor (a 3-fold increase in Kd for NADPH) and steroid (a 7-fold increase in Kd for testosterone). This mutation also dramatically decreased the catalytic efficiency observed with one-, two-, and three-ring substrates and decreased the binding affinity for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but had little effect on the binding of aldose reductase inhibitors. Interestingly, mutation of Trp227 significantly impaired steroid binding (a 22-fold increase in Kd for testosterone), but did not alter binding of cofactor, smaller substrates, or inhibitors. Kinetically, the W148Y mutant was similar to wild-type enzyme. Our results demonstrate that Trp86 and the apolar cleft is part of the substrate binding pocket. In addition, we propose a role for Trp227 and its associated loop in binding steroids, but not small substrates or inhibitors, most likely through interaction with the C- and D-rings of the steroid. This work provides the first evidence that tryptophans on opposite sides of the apolar cleft are part of the steroid binding pocket and suggests how the enzyme may discriminate between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aldose reductase inhibitors like zopolrestat. A model of how androstanedione binds in the apolar cleft is developed. These data provide further evidence that loop structures in members of the aldoketoreductase superfamily are critical determinants of ligand binding. Rat liver 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), a member of the aldoketoreductase superfamily, inactivates circulating steroid hormones using NAD(P)H as cofactor. Despite determination of the 3α-HSD·NADP+ binary complex structure, the functional elements that dictate the binding of steroids remain unclear (Bennett, M.J., Schlegel, B.P., Jez, J.M., Penning, T.M., and Lewis, M. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 10702-10711). Two tryptophans (Trp86 and Trp227) near the active site may have roles in substrate binding, and their fluorescence may be quenched upon binding of NADPH. Trp86 is located within an apolar cleft, while Trp227 is found on an opposing loop near the active site. A third tryptophan, Trp148, is on the periphery of the structure. To investigate the roles of these tryptophans in protein fluorescence and ligand binding, we generated three mutant enzymes (W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y) by site-directed mutagenesis.

Rat liver 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD, EC 1.1.1.213) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: 3α-HSD3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or 3α-hydroxysteroid-NAD(P)+-oxidoreductase (formerly EC 1.1.1.50 and now EC 1.1.1.213 because of its A-face specificity in hydride transfer)HSDhydroxysteroid dehydrogenaseAKRaldoketoreductaseNSAIDnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugandrosterone5α-androstan-3α-ol-17-oneandrostanedione5α-androstane-3,17-dioneBMEβ-mercaptoethanolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a representative hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) with the principal physiological role of inactivating circulating androgens, progestins, and glucocorticoids. It also functions as a dihydrodiol dehydrogenase by oxidizing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trans-dihydrodiols (proximate carcinogens) into ortho-quinones with the production of reactive oxygen species and semiquinone radicals that may contribute to chemical carcinogenesis (1Smithgall T.E.

It is very similar (>69% amino acid sequence identity) to its human homologues, including human type I and type II 3α-HSDs (4Pawlowski J.E. Huizinga M. Penning T.M. J. Biol.

In endocrine target tissues, like the prostate, 3α-HSD converts 5α-dihydrotestosterone (a potent androgen) into 3α-androstanediol (a weak androgen) (7Hoff H.G. Schriefers H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and may act as a molecular switch by regulating occupancy of the androgen receptor. As the most thoroughly characterized mammalian 3α-HSD, rat liver 3α-HSD serves as an excellent model for investigating the structure and function of these enzymes. 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or 3α-hydroxysteroid-NAD(P)+-oxidoreductase (formerly EC 1.1.1.50 and now EC 1.1.1.213 because of its A-face specificity in hydride transfer) hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase aldoketoreductase nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 5α-androstan-3α-ol-17-one 5α-androstane-3,17-dione β-mercaptoethanol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cDNA cloning indicates that the mammalian 3α-HSDs are members of the aldoketoreductase (AKR) superfamily and are 45-60% identical in amino acid sequence to other AKR proteins, including aldose reductase, aldehyde reductase, 17β-HSD, and 20α-HSD (8Bohren K.M.

This similarity raises the issue of how closely related enzymes recognize different substrates (aldo-keto sugars versus steroid hormones) and is an important concern in developing therapeutic agents against specific protein targets. For example, retinopathic, neuropathic, and nephropathic diabetic complications have been associated with the conversion of glucose to sorbitol catalyzed by aldose reductase (13Petrash J.M. Tarle I. Wilson D.K. Quiocho F.A. Diabetes. 1995; 43: 955-959Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As such, aldose reductase inhibitors may be useful therapies for these complications of diabetes, but the specificity of existing compounds has been lacking (14Tomlinson D.R. Stevens E.J. Diemel L.T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Similarly, the potential role of 3α-HSDs in the regulation of hormone levels in endocrine target tissues and in carcinogen activation make these enzymes candidate drug targets. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit rat liver 3α-HSD, these compounds are not specific for this protein (15Penning T.M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 80: 4504-4508Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An understanding of how these enzymes achieve substrate specificity would provide insight into designing effective and specific AKR inhibitors. The three-dimensional structures of the rat liver 3α-HSD apoenzyme and the E·NADP+ binary complex have been solved at 3.0- and 2.7-Å resolutions, respectively (16Hoog S.S. Pawlowski J.E. Alzari P.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10702-10711Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This protein adopts an (α/β)8-barrel fold and contains three tryptophans (Trp86, Trp148, and Trp227). Although the location of the cofactor in the binary complex and site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified the residues involved in catalysis (18Pawlowski J.E. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13502-13510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the functional components of the substrate binding site remain unknown. The active site is at the base of an apolar cleft. Projecting toward the center of the barrel, this cleft is about 11 Å deep, is large enough to accommodate steroid ligands, and could be the substrate binding site in rat liver 3α-HSD. Trp86 and other apolar residues (Leu54, Phe128, and Phe129) form one side of this cleft and would provide an ideal environment for binding steroid hormones. A flexible loop containing Trp227 may form part of the opposite side of the substrate binding pocket. However, this loop was disordered in the electron density of the apoenzyme structure, and in the binary complex structure Trp227 made a crystal contact with the second molecule in the asymmetric unit. Neither structure clearly indicates the location of Trp227 or the flexible loop in relation to the putative steroid binding site. Finally, binding of NADPH quenches the fluorescence emission of 3α-HSD, suggesting that either Trp86 or Trp227 may be near bound cofactor (18Pawlowski J.E. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13502-13510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ricigliano J.W. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The third tryptophan, Trp148, should have no function in ligand binding based on its location away from the active site. In this work, we used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of tryptophans in protein fluorescence and to delineate the structural components of the steroid and inhibitor binding site by constructing the following mutants of rat liver 3α-HSD: W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y. Our results indicate that the contribution of each tryptophan to the overall fluorescence of 3α-HSD corresponds to the local environment of each residue, with Trp148 (the most buried tryptophan) dominating the spectrum and Trp227 (the most solvent-exposed tryptophan) providing the smallest contribution. We demonstrate that an energy transfer mechanism quenches Trp86 upon binding of NADPH. Our work provides the first functional evidence that Trp86 is important in binding steroids and NSAIDs and that the apolar cleft in which it resides is part of the substrate/inhibitor binding pocket. The mutagenesis data also suggest that Trp227 plays an important role in binding steroid hormones but has no role in accommodating one-, two-, or three-ring substrates or NSAIDs. Also, mutations of Trp86 and Trp227 had little effect on the binding of aldose reductase inhibitors. A model for binding androstanedione and how the enzyme may discriminate between NSAIDs and aldose reductase inhibitors is proposed. These data provide another example where loop structures in (α/β)8-barrel proteins are determinants in ligand binding. The DNA Synthesis Service in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania synthesized the primers used for polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis. The DE-52 cellulose was from Baxter; and the Blue Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and 4-chloro-1-naphthol were from Bio-Rad. Smithgall and Penning (20Smithgall T.E. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) previously described the preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-rat 3α-HSD antiserum. NAD+, NADH, and NADPH were from Boehringer-Mannheim. Androsterone, androstanedione, and testosterone were obtained from Steraloids. Radiolabeled [3H]testosterone (92.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN DuPont. Zopolrestat and ponalrestat were provided courtesy of Dr. Florante Quiocho. All other compounds were ACS grade or better and obtained from Sigma or Aldrich. The pKK-3α-HSD expression vector and details of the polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis protocols were previously described (18Pawlowski J.E. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13502-13510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis to produce the W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y mutant enzymes used the following oligonucleotide primers, respectively: 5′-dCTTCAAAGCTTTATAGCACTTTCCA-3′; 5′-dACTTGTGACACATATGAGGCCATGG-3′; and 5′-dGAGACAAAACATATGTGGATCAGAA-3′. Dideoxysequencing ensured fidelity of the mutant constructs. The mutant expression vectors transformed competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and the overexpressed proteins were purified. Four-liter cultures of E. coli cells containing pKK-3α-HSD (either wild-type or mutant) grown in LB media with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 30 h at 37°C were pelleted, resuspended, and lysed by sonication. Pooled sonicates were dialyzed overnight in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.6) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol (BME), and 20% glycerol. The dialyzed fraction was loaded onto a DE-52 cellulose anion exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted using a 0-250 mM NaCl salt gradient. SDS-PAGE and assays for androsterone oxidation located the peak fractions. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM BME, and 20% glycerol and loaded onto a Blue Sepharose column equilibrated in dialysis buffer. The column was washed in dialysis buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with 1.5 M KCl. Eluted fractions were dialyzed overnight against 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM BME, and 30% glycerol. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze protein purity (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.J. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots confirmed the identity of the expressed protein using a 1:1000 dilution of the polyclonal rabbit anti-rat 3α-HSD sera 71535. Visualization of proteins used rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate with 4chloro-1-naphthol as chromogenic substrate. Samples of the homogeneous enzymes were stored as aliquots at −70°C. Measurement of the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of recombinant wild type and the tryptophan mutants at 25°C were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer LS5 spectrophotometer equipped with an ATT 6300 personal computer. The FLUOR program (Softways, Inc.) digitized the spectra. Scans of the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were performed in 1-ml systems containing 20 μg of protein and 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer. Determination of the energy transfer emission spectra of the apoenzymes, the E·NADPH binary complexes, and the E·NADPH·testosterone ternary complexes of wild-type 3α-HSD and each tryptophan mutant used the same system as above with 4% acetonitrile as co-solvent. The binary complex spectra were measured in the presence of 1.5 μM NADPH, while the ternary complex spectra were scanned with 50 μM testosterone added. Initial velocities were measured on either a Gilford 260 spectrophotometer or a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer by observing the rate of change in absorbance of pyridine nucleotide at 340 nm (ϵ = 6270 M−1 cm−1) in 1-ml systems at 25°C using a 1-cm path length. Throughout the purifications, enzyme activity was monitored using a standard assay system containing 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2.3 mM NAD+, and 75 μM androsterone with 4% acetonitrile as co-solvent. Measurements of the Km and kcat values for androsterone oxidation were made at 2.3 mM NAD+ with varied steroid concentration (11.5-73.0 μM). Km and kcat values for NAD+ were determined at 75 μM androsterone by varying the NAD+ concentration (0.09-3.3 mM). Kinetic constants for androstanedione reduction were measured at 180 μM NADH with varied steroid concentration (2.4-28.4 μM). Determination of the kinetic constants for NADH oxidation used 30 μM androstanedione and were made by varying the NADH concentration (4.3-177 μM). These measurements all used the standard assay system. Determination of kinetic constants with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (0.02-2.0 mM) and 2-decalone (0.2 - 5 mM) as substrates used the same assay system at pH 6.0 with 200 μM NADH. Assays with 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (1-30 μM) used 200 μM NADPH as cofactor in the pH 6.0 buffer. All reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and were corrected for nonenzymatic rates. Calculation of all kcat and Km values used the ENZFITTER nonlinear regression analysis program (23Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC (and True Compatibles). BioSoft, Cambridge, UK1987Google Scholar) to fit untransformed data with a hyperbolic function, as originally described by Wilkinson (24Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar), yielding estimates of the kinetic constants and the associated standard error. Initial velocities were measured using the standard androsterone assay system as described above with various concentrations of inhibitors in 20 μl of methanol, ethanol, or acetonitrile. Control velocities were determined in the presence of appropriate quantities of organic solvents. Calculations of IC50 values were from median effect plots (25Chou T.C. Talalay P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Measurements of the binding constants for NADPH to recombinant wild type and the W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y mutants were made by measuring protein fluorescence on a Perkin-Elmer model 650-10M flurometer following the incremental addition of NADPH (0-2.5 μM). Each 1-ml sample contained 20 μg of protein in 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer at 20°C in a 0.4 × 1.0-cm quartz cuvette. The total volume change from the addition of NADPH was less than 5%, and the necessary corrections for changes in cofactor concentrations were made. Excitation of samples was at 280 nm with fluorescence emission scanned from 300 to 500 nm at 120 nm/min with excitation and emission band pass each set at 5 nm. Untransformed fluorescence data were plotted as the percentage change in fluorescence at emission λmax (%ΔF) versus NADPH concentration. Fitting of these data to a saturation absorption isotherm by ENZFITTER provided an estimate of the Kd and the associated standard errors (23Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC (and True Compatibles). BioSoft, Cambridge, UK1987Google Scholar). Transformation of these data used the Lineweaver-Burk equation to generate a linear plot of 1/%ΔF versus 1/[NADPH]. Binding of testosterone to the E·NADH binary complex was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Aliquots (100 μl) of 10 μM 3α-HSD (either wild-type or mutant) were placed in dialysis tubing with a saturating concentration of NADH (2.5 mM) and no steroid in 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer with 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM BME, and 4% acetonitrile as co-solvent. The 1-ml dialysate contained 2.5 mM NADH and increasing concentrations of [3H]testosterone (0.5-61 μM; 75,000 cpm/nmol) in an identical buffer. At equilibrium (16 h at 20°C), scintillation counting measured the amount of radiolabeled steroid ligand in both the dialysate and the bag. Since steroid binding does not occur in the absence of NADH, corrections for nonspecific binding were not necessary. Determination of the Kd values for the binding of [3H]testosterone to wild-type and mutant 3α-HSDs used Scatchard analysis with the ENZFITTER program (23Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC (and True Compatibles). BioSoft, Cambridge, UK1987Google Scholar). Molecular modeling on a Silicon Graphics workstation utilized the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Bennett et al. (17Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10702-10711Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) reported the structure of the rat liver 3α-HSD·NADP+ binary complex; and the coordinates of androstanedione were obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database (26Coiro V.M. Giglio E. Lucano A. Puliti R. Acta. Crystallogr. 1973; B29: 1404-1409Crossref Google Scholar). Androstanedione was manually docked into the apolar cleft of the binary complex structure using the following guidelines: 1) the position of the C3 ketone was placed within hydrogen bonding distance of Tyr55, His117, and NADP+; 2) the α-face of the steroid was oriented toward the active site to retain the 4-pro-R-stereospecificity of hydride transfer. The loop containing Trp227 was modeled as in the apoenzyme structure (16Hoog S.S. Pawlowski J.E. Alzari P.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), since this loop forms a crystal contact in the binary complex. The model was then energy-minimized using a conjugate gradient algorithm for 100 cycles with CHARMm (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Wild-type 3α-HSD and the W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y mutants were overexpressed in E. coli DH5α cells and purified (Table I). The specific activities of the purified proteins for androsterone turnover were 1.50, 0.059, 0.674, and 0.080 μmol/min/mg for wild-type enzyme and the W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y mutants, respectively. The wild-type and mutant forms of the 3α-HSD appeared as single homogeneous bands of the same molecular weight on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1A). Each of the mutants was also immunoreactive with rabbit anti-rat 3α-HSD antiserum, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B).Table IPurification of recombinant wild-type 3α-HSD and the W86Y, W148Y, and W227Y mutantsVolumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurification factorYieldmlmgμmol/minμmol/min/mg%Recombinant 3α-HSD wild typeSonicate (step 1)44.0512.085.550.1671.00100DE52 cellulose (step 2)5.117.615.280.8685.2017.9Blue Sepharose (step 3)3.09.7814.641.509.1017.1W86Y (step 3)5.73.880.22900.0599.1515.0W148Y (step 3)7.25.833.9290.67411.020.1W227Y (step 3)3.18.230.65680.0809.8012.0 Open table in a new tab The 3α-HSD mutants allowed the contribution from each tryptophan to the overall protein fluorescence spectrum to be assessed. Although the fluorescence signals of the tryptophans were not strictly additive, Trp148 dominated the spectra, Trp86 provided the next largest share, and Trp227 contributed the least. Removal of each tryptophan also shifted the emission λmax relative to wild-type enzyme and provided an indication of the local environments of these residues (Fig. 2). Wild-type 3α-HSD had an emission λmax = 336 nm. The W86Y and W227Y mutants were blue-shifted with emission λmax of 332 and 331 nm, respectively, and suggested a partly solvent-accessible environment for these tryptophans (27Permyakov E.A. Luminescent Spectroscopy of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 57-65Google Scholar). The W227Y mutant also displayed a noticeable loss of emission in the higher wavelengths, indicating that this residue is highly solvent-exposed. Finally, mutation of Trp148 had the opposite effect; it red-shifted the emission λmax to 343 nm, consistent with this residue being buried away from solvent. These mutations showed that the contribution of each tryptophan to the fluorescence spectra corresponds to their solvent exposure in the three-dimensional structure; the more solvent-inaccessible the tryptophan, the greater contribution to the observed spectra. Trp148 is solvent-inaccessible on the interior of an α-helix facing the β-barrel, and Trp86, in the apolar cleft, is partly accessible to solvent. In contrast, Trp227 is on a flexible loop near the active site, and the potential for extensive solvent quenching would explain its low fluorescence yield. The emission spectra of the apoenzyme, the E·NADPH binary complexes, and the E·NADPH·testosterone ternary complexes of wild-type 3α-HSD and each tryptophan mutant clearly identified Trp86 as the tryptophan quenched by NADPH through an energy transfer mechanism (Fig. 3). The emission spectra of the binary complexes of the wild-type enzyme, the W148Y mutant, and the W227Y mutant each exhibited an energy transfer emission band of approximately the same intensity at 450 nm. The W86Y mutant lacked this band, indicating Trp86 as the quenched tryptophan. This emission signal was unobservable in controls containing only 1.5 μM NADPH at the same excitation wavelength (data not shown). The fluorescence spectra of the ternary complexes of wild-type enzyme and each tryptophan mutant showed additional quenching of protein fluorescence emission. With the exception of the W86Y mutant, there was a decrease in emission at 450 nm upon binding of testosterone to the E·NADPH complexes. Since the energy transfer band is assignable to Trp86, this decrease in emission indicates that steroid binding interferes with energy transfer between NADPH and Trp86. The kinetic properties of the recombinant wild-type enzyme and the three tryptophan mutants were compared using four standard substrates: androsterone and NAD+ (oxidation reaction) and androstanedione and NADH (reduction reaction) (Table II). Mutation of Trp86 altered both substrate and cofactor kinetics. The W86Y mutant resulted in a 3-fold increase in Km for androsterone and a 6-fold increase in Km for androstanedione. Likewise, this mutation increased the Km for NAD+ 6-fold and the Km for NADH 8-fold. In addition, of the three mutant enzymes, the W86Y mutant exhibited the lowest catalytic efficiency for all four substrates. The W227Y mutant displayed significantly impaired kinetics for each steroid substrate with 9- and 43-fold increases in Km for androsterone and androstanedione, respectively, but only slight differences with NADH (4-fold increase in Km) and none with NAD+. The inability to saturate the W227Y mutant due to solubility limitations of the steroid substrates emphasizes the importance of this residue in steroid binding and contributes to the low turnover numbers observed with this mutant. As expected from its position in the three-dimensional structure, the W148Y mutant gave only modest changes in kinetic constants compared with wild-type enzyme for all substrates.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of wild type and the tryptophan mutants of 3α-HSDSubstrateWild typeW86YW148YW227YAndrosteronekcat (min−1)65.8 ± 5.56.34 ± 1.0045.0 ± 2.630.6 ± 8.3Km (μM)45.4 ± 7.9146 ± 3742.0 ± 6.2408 ± 134kcat/Km (min−1/μM)1.450.0431.070.075NAD+kcat (min−1)59.4 ± 1.97.78 ± 0.3734.9 ± 3.06.37 ± 0.31Km (μM)853 ± 595132 ± 459875 ± 162954 ± 107kcat/Km (min−1/μM)0.0700.00150.0400.007Androstanedionekcat (min−1)18.5 ± 0.51.83 ± 0.119.08 ± 0.2924.7 ± 6.76Km (μM)4.2 ± 0.424.0 ± 3.54.5 ± 0.5173 ± 61kcat/Km (min−1/μM)4.410.0762.020.143NADHkcat"

Each half-molecule has 6 intrachain disulfide bonds, which form loops in the carboxyl-terminal region of each of the chains. Aα chain has one disufide loop (Cys442-Cys472), Bβ has three (Cys201-Cys286, Cys211-Cys240, and Cys394-Cys407), and γ has two loops (Cys153-Cys182 and Cys326-Cys339). The intrachain loops are conserved in fibrinogens of different species. We changed, by site-directed mutagenesis, the cysteines, which form the intrachain loops, to serine or alanine. Fibrinogen chain assembly and secretion was determined in transiently transfected COS cells expressing two normal and a mutant fibrinogen chain. In the Bβ and γ chains, disruption of the disulfide loops closest to the “coiled-coil” region (CysBβ211-Cys240, CysBβ201-Cys286, and Cysγ153-Cys182) abolished chain assembly and secretion, indicating that the disulfide loops closest to the coiled-coil region are essential for chain assembly.

When Gt was in the high affinity complex with Rh*, the αt subunit was almost completely protected from proteolysis. The protection of αt at Arg310 was complete, while Arg204 was substantially protected. The cleavage of αt at Lys18 was protected in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, ROS membranes kept in the dark, or ROS membranes containing Rh*. The cleavage of βt was slower in the presence of ROS membranes or phospholipid vesicles. When the Rh*·Gt complex was incubated with guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate, a guanine nucleotide analog known to release the high affinity interaction between Gt and Rh*, the protection at Arg310 and Arg204 was diminished. From our results, we propose that Rh* either physically blocks access of trypsin to Arg204 and Arg310 or maintains the heterotrimer in such a conformation that these cleavage sites are not available. Since Arg204 is involved in the switch interface with βγt (Lambright, D. G., Sondek, J., Bohm, A., Skiba, N. P., Hamm, H. E., and Sigler, P. B. (1996) Nature 379, 311-319), it may be that βγt is implicated in protecting this cleavage site in the receptor-bound, stabilized heterotrimer. Arg310 is not near the βγt subunit, thus we believe that the high affinity binding of Gt to Rh* physically or sterically blocks access of trypsin to this site. Thus, Arg310, only a few angstroms away from the carboxyl terminus of αt, which is known to directly bind to Rh*, is likely to also be a part of the Rh* binding site. This is in agreement with other studies and has implications for the mechanism by which receptors catalyze GDP release from G proteins. The protection of Lys18 in the presence of phospholipid vesicles suggests that the amino-terminal region is in contact with the membrane, consistent with the crystal structure of the heterotrimer (Lambright, D.

Two key steps in the propagation of signals across the cell membrane and within the cell are the exchange of GDP for GTP and the subsequent hydrolysis of GTP by guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (1Bourne H.R.

Due to the central place of these events in signal propagation, several mechanisms have evolved to initiate and terminate the G-protein activation cycle. For heterotrimeric G-proteins, binding of agonist to a heptahelical receptor is a trigger for guanine nucleotide exchange. However, the efficiency of this process varies among cell types (5Sato M.

Both the heterotrimeric and monomeric G-protein signaling systems are likely to operate within a signal transduction complex, which is either preexisting or is generated by the biological stimuli. The components of such a signaling complex are unclear, particularly for systems using the heterotrimeric G-protein family. In addition to receptor and effector, there may be additional proteins that influence events at the receptor-G-protein or G-protein-effector interface and regulate the key steps of nucleotide exchange and/or GTP hydrolysis (5Sato M.

Such accessory proteins include kinases, arrestins, and phosphatases that influence receptor coupling to G-protein, as well as unknown entities that together with the receptor may contribute to the formation of a signal transduction complex on the inner face of the plasma membrane. Such proteins may influence the “direction” or strength of the agonist-induced signal or may also act independently of receptor to influence the activation state of G-protein. Examples of such putative entities include neuromodulin, tubulin, caveolin, the yeast protein Sst2p and the egl-10 gene product of Caenorhabditis elegans. The calmodulin-binding protein neuromodulin colocalizes with Go in neuronal growth cones, accelerates binding of nucleotide to G-protein, and is postulated to facilitate the transfer of signal from receptor to G-protein (13Strittmatter S.M.

Membranes, prepared as described (10Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were solubilized with 1% detergent (detergent:protein ratio of 2:1) in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM EDTA) with stirring at 4°C for 60 min. The solubilized membrane extract was isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Using the detergent Thesit, approximately 40% of membrane protein was solubilized under these conditions. The biophysical and structural properties of the G-protein activator were determined using DEAE ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and a lectin affinity matrix. Solubilized membrane proteins (10-20 mg of protein in 5-10 ml) were applied (0.8 ml/min) to a column (0.8 × 6.25 cm) of DEAE-agarose (DEAE Bio-Gel A gel) equilibrated with 20 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.1% Thesit, followed by washing with the same buffer containing 10 mM NaCl until the optical density of the effluent was zero. Proteins retained on the resin were eluted with a linear gradient of 10-100 mM NaCl (0.8 ml/min, gradient volume = 50 ml) in buffer A containing 0.1% Thesit; 1.6-ml fractions were collected. Peak activity fractions eluted from DEAE ion exchange resins were concentrated in a Centricon concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) (molecular weight cutoff = ∼100,000) and further fractionated by gel filtration using BioGel A-0.5m (fractionation size ∼10,000-500,000). Samples (1.5 ml, ∼300 - 800 μg of protein) were applied to size exclusion columns (1.5 × 93 cm) at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min (1-ml fractions collected), and proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 0.1% Thesit and 100 mM NaCl. The void volume (V0) of the column was determined using blue dextran, and the separation properties of the resin were evaluated by determining the Ve of sizing standards. The collected fractions were assayed for bioactivity and protein amounts. Aliquots (80 μl, ∼10-15 μg of protein) of the peak activity fraction from a size exclusion column were incubated with a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin affinity matrix (20-25 μl) for 2 h at 4°C. The resin was washed with 2 × 500 μl of buffer A containing 0.1% Thesit and retained proteins eluted by incubation (3 h, 4°C) with the same buffer (80 μl) containing 500 mM N-acetylglucosamine. Protein concentrations in the samples eluted from the size exclusion resin were determined by the Micro BCA assay system (Pierce), by Coomassie Blue staining following denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by Amido Black staining of nitrocellulose spotted with aliquots of sample and known amounts of standard protein to provide internal consistency in the calculation. Protein concentrations of the fractions eluted from the WGA lectin affinity resin were estimated by the latter procedure. Binding of [35S]GTPγS to purified bovine brain G-protein (26Hildebrandt J.D.

Greater than 95% of the isolated brain G-protein binds the nonhydrolyzable analog of guanosine triphosphate GTPγS, and approximately 85% of the G-protein population corresponds to Go. The standard assay system was as follows. A preincubation mixture was prepared for each assay point. Nonspecific binding was defined with 100 μM GTPγS. Unless indicated otherwise, the final concentration of GDP was 1 μM. The preincubation mixture consisted of brain G-protein, GDP, and other components in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM EDTA). The concentrations of brain G-protein and GDP in the preincubation mixture were 5 times the final concentration desired in the assay tube. After a 1-h incubation of the preincubation mixture at 4°C, 10 μl of the mixture was added to the assay tube containing buffer A plus (final concentrations) 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, ∼230,000 cpm (∼2 nM) [35S]GTPγS, vehicle or 100 μM GTPγS (total volume = 50 μl). Unless indicated otherwise, samples were incubated at 24°C for 30 min. In studies concerned with the initial rate of [35S]GTPγS binding to G-protein, samples were preincubated with extract as described above and then added to the assay tube as above, except that the tube contained increasing amounts of GTPγS and incubation was at 24°C for 5 s to 5 min. The desired concentration of GTPγS was obtained by dilution of [35S]GTPγS with the appropriate amount of nonradioactive GTPγS and the initial rate determined as described previously (29Ferguson K.M.

Incubated reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through nitrocellulose filters (Scheicher & Schuell BA85) with four 4-ml washes with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 4°C). Radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Membrane extracts were cleared of neuromodulin by immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibody clone 91E12. Several preliminary experiments were performed to determine the optimal conditions for antibody concentration, amount of extract, and protein G-Sepharose. Final conditions were as follows. Membrane extract (40 μl) was incubated with 15 μg of antibody at 4°C for 12 h (0.05% Thesit) before addition of 3 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads. After incubation at 4°C for 3 h, protein G-Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and aliquots of the supernatants were evaluated by immunoblotting and bioactivity assays. The pellets were washed with 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.05% Thesit and prepared for denaturing gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (31Coupry I. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9852-9857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A solution phase assay was developed to search for substances that influenced nucleotide binding to heterotrimeric G-protein. The assay took advantage of the essentially nondissociable binding of [35S]GTPγS to heterotrimeric G-proteins. Membrane extracts were incubated with bovine brain G-protein in the presence of GDP, and aliquots were added to binding tubes containing [35S]GTPγS to determine effects of extracts on nucleotide binding to G-protein. In the presence of excess GDP, the rate of association of [35S]GTPγS to G-protein is decreased, optimizing the detection of entities that might accelerate nucleotide exchange. Relatively low concentrations of G-protein (0.5-25 nM) and membrane extract protein (1-10 μg) were used in the assay system, and [35S]GTPγS binding to G-protein was evaluated in three sets of tubes for each experiment: 1) sample extract alone, 2) G-protein alone, and 3) sample extract and G-protein following preincubation. Thus, greater or less than additive amounts of nucleotide binding in set 3 compared with the sum of sets 1 and 2 would indicate the presence of a factor that influenced nucleotide binding in a stimulatory or inhibitory manner, respectively. Such a strategy was used previously to demonstrate the existence of a factor in PC-12 cell membrane extracts that increased the amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to G-protein. This bioactivity was absent in a detergent-solublized extract of membranes prepared from NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (5Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M.D. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15269-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Screening of additional cell lines and tissues indicated that this bioactivity was most abundant in membrane extracts prepared from the neuroblastoma × glioma cell hybrid NG108-15 (Fig. 1). Preincubation of membrane extracts from NG108-15 but not the parent C6B4 cell line increased the binding of nucleotide to bovine brain G-protein by 460% (Fig. 1A). Nucleotide binding to NG108-15 and C6B4 extracts alone in the absence of G-protein was 2.69 ± 0.021 and 0.62 ± 0.035 fmol, respectively. Under these experimental conditions, ∼4 fmol of [35S]GTPγS was bound to G-protein when assayed in the absence of membrane extract. The stimulatory effect of the membrane extract from NG108-15 cells was heat-sensitive and was retained in the concentrate following centrifugation in a YM-30 microconcentrator (fractionation size ∼30,000 daltons), indicating that this factor is likely a protein rather than a small organic molecule. Several series of experiments were performed to determine optimal conditions for solubilization of the bioactivity from NG108-15 cells. The nonionic detergent Thesit (polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether) proved most effective in terms of the total amount of bioactivity extracted and the specific activity of the extract (Fig. 1B). The NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cell line was used as a source for partial purification and characterization of the bioactivity. The solubilized membrane preparation was first fractionated by DEAE ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2). The activity was monitored using purified brain G-protein in the solution-phase assay as described above. Under the experimental conditions used, greater than 95% of the bioactivity was retained by the resin. The level of nucleotide binding to eluted fractions in the absence of G-protein ranged from 0.9 to 3.8 fmol. In the set of tubes containing G-protein alone, the level of nucleotide binding was 12.9 fmol. Preincubation of aliquots of eluted fractions with G-protein increased nucleotide binding to G-protein up to 8-fold. The magnitude of the activation of G-protein by the fractionated material was linearly dependent upon the concentration of protein in the assay system (Fig. 3). Fractionation of the solubilized material by DEAE ion exchange chromatography resulted in a ∼47-fold increase in specific activity, with a calculated recovery of ∼100-150%. 2Specific activity was determined by calculating the -fold increase in [35S]GTPγS binding to brain G-protein elicited by the G-protein activator per microgram of protein in the extract when assayed under conditions where the -fold increase was linearly related to sample dilution. -Fold purification was calculated as the ratio of specific activities before and after each fractionation step. Analysis of the eluted fractions by immunoblotting using a Goα antisera that recognizes known Goα isoforms indicated that the bioactivity exhibited an elution profile distinct from that of the general population of Go. 3As ion exchange chromatography is an important step in the purification of different Go heterotrimer populations from bovine brain, it is likely that the diffuse distribution of immunoreactive Go observed in the eluted fractions actually represents different Go isoforms or heterotrimer combinations (Fig. 2) (26Hildebrandt J.D.

It is not known if the G-protein activator elutes from the resin with a distinct subpopulation of Go.Fig. 3Effect of increasing amounts of G-protein activator on nucleotide binding to brain G-protein. Fractions of NG108-15 membrane extract eluted from the DEAE ion-exchange resin containing peak bioactivity (fractions 8-14) were pooled, and increasing amounts of protein were preincubated with bovine brain G-protein. [35S]GTPγS (2 nM) binding to bovine brain G-protein (12.5 nM) was determined in the solution phase assay (100 μl) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dilution was corrected to contain a similar amount of detergent for each point. Nucleotide binding to G-protein was not altered by addition of bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) (at protein concentrations equivalent to that found in eluted fraction), indicating that protein concentration of the sample itself was not an interfering factor. [35S]GTPγS binding to membrane extract alone = 0.28-0.8 fmol. Data are representative of three experiments using different sample preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pooled peak activity fractions eluted from DEAE-ion exchange resins were used to characterize the functional, structural, and biophysical properties of the bioactivity. The bioactivity eluted from the ion exchange resin was retained in the concentrate following centrifugation in a YM-100 microconcentrator, and this step (∼95% recovery of bioactivity) resulted in an additional increase in specific activity (2-10-fold), which was somewhat dependent on the amount of material processed. Proteins in the concentrated material were further resolved by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4). The peak activity fraction eluted from the size exclusion matrix exhibited a Ve/V0 of 1.2 for the detergent-solubilized complex corresponding to the Stoke's radius of a globular protein with a molecular weight of ∼246,000 (Fig. 4, inset). The degree of purification achieved by size exclusion chromatography and the recovery of applied material ranged from 2- to 4-fold and 26 to 45% in five individual experiments using different preparations of membrane extracts. The bioactivity eluted from the size exclusion resin was retained on a WGA lectin affinity matrix, indicating that the bioactive factor is either glycosylated via N-linked oligosaccharides or else it is tightly associated with such a protein (Fig. 5). Approximately 60% of the bioactive material retained by the resin was recovered by elution with N-acetylglucosamine.Fig. 5Interaction of NG108-15 membrane extract bioactivity with a lectin affinity matrix. An aliquot (∼80 μl, ∼10 μg of protein) of the peak activity fraction eluted from a size exclusion column was incubated with the WGA-lectin affinity matrix as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pre-resin, sample prior to incubation with resin. post-resin, sample following incubation with resin. elution, sample obtained following incubation of the resin with 500 mM N-acetylglucosamine. Aliquots (6 μl) of the pre-, post-, and eluted samples were assayed for their effects on [35S]GTPγS binding to G-protein (1.25 nM). The protein concentration in the pre-resin material was ∼125 μg/ml, whereas the eluted material contained less than 100 μg/ml. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several proteins are known to influence the function of heterotrimeric G-proteins, and it was of interest to determine if the activity characterized above is related to any of these entities. One such protein is neuromodulin or GAP-43, a calmodulin-binding protein that is enriched in neural tissue and increases the binding of [35S]GTPγS to brain G-protein. Neuromodulin is expressed in both NG108-15 and PC-12 cells, where it colocalized with Go. Two approaches were used to indicate that the bioactivity isolated from NG108-15 cells did not correspond to neuromodulin. First, the effect of PC-12 and NG108-15 extract on nucleotide binding to G-protein was compared before and after reducing the amount of neuromodulin in the extract by immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody to neuromodulin. Second, the elution profile of neuromodulin from the DEAE ion exchange column was determined by immunoblotting and compared with that of the peak bioactivity detected in the solution phase assay. As indicated in Fig. 6 (A and B), the ability of the membrane extract to increase nucleotide binding was not altered by reduction of the amount of neuromodulin in the solubilized extract. In addition, the elution profile of neuromodulin from the ion exchange resin differed from that of the extract bioactivity, clearly indicating that the bioactivity detected under these conditions could not be attributed to neuromodulin (Fig. 6C). Immunoblot analysis using antibodies for other proteins known to influence nucleotide binding to G-protein, indicated that the bioactivity was also distinct from caveolin, tubulin, and β-amyloid precursor protein (Fig. 7). This was demonstrated by comparing the immunoreactivity for each protein in the starting material to that found in fractions eluted from the ion exchange resin containing the highest level of bioactivity in our assay system. As the bioactivity appears to represent a novel protein, it is henceforth referred to as a G-protein activator and we further investigated its effects using the pooled peak fractions of bioactivity eluted from the ion exchange resin.Fig. 7Immunoblot analysis of peak activity fractions for expression of tubulin, β-amyloid precursor protein, and caveolin. Membranes, solubilized membranes, and the fractions of NG108-15 membrane extracts eluted from the ion exchange resin (see Fig. 2) exhibiting the highest levels of bioactivity were electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (10%) and evaluated by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Top panel, α-tubulin antibody (0.15 μg/ml) and β-tubulin antibody (0.3 μg/ml); rat brain membranes, 15 μg of protein; NG108-15 membranes, 15 μg of protein; NG108-15 membrane extract (pre-resin, 10 μl), 20 μg of protein; flow-through from DEAE ion exchange res"

The Mr of the enzyme was 37,952, and it was composed of a single polypeptide chain. The optimal pH for activity was ∼10.3. The enzyme was strictly D-stereospecific toward oligopeptides composed of Dphenylalanine such as (D-Phe)3 and (D-Phe)4. The enzyme also acted to a lesser extent on (D-Phe)6, Boc-(D-Phe)4 (where Boc is tert-butoxycarbonyl), Boc-(D-Phe)4 methyl ester, Boc-(D-Phe)3 methyl ester, Boc-(D-Phe)2, (D-Phe)2, and others, but not upon their corresponding peptides composed of L-Phe, (D-Ala)n (n = 2-5), (D-Val)3, and (D-Leu)2. The mode of action of the enzyme was clarified with synthetic substrates ((D-Phe)2-D-Tyr and D-Tyr-(D-Phe)2) and eight stereoisomers of (Phe)3.

Thus, the enzyme was categorized as a new “penicillin-recognizing enzyme.” INTRODUCTIONSome peptidases act on peptides containing D-amino acids. Soluble Streptomyces carboxypeptidase DD catalyzes not only the transpeptidation reaction on the peptide intermediate in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, but also the hydrolysis of Nα,Nϵ-diacetyl-L-lysyl-(D-Ala)2 in water (1Frère J.-M. Joris B. CRC Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 11: 299-396Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A D-peptidase has been purified and characterized from an actinomycete, although it is not strictly specific toward peptides containing D-amino acids (2Sugie M. Suzuki H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 1397-1402Google Scholar). In Enterococcus, the vanX gene product, (D-Ala)2 hydrolase, plays a role in vancomycin resistance (3Reynolds P.E. Depardieu F. Dutka-Malen S. Arthur M. Courvalin P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The chemically synthesized “D-enzyme” of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, in which all of the amino acids were replaced with the corresponding D-amino acids, displays D-stereospecificity (4Del Milton R.C. Milton S.C.F. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We discovered D-aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.19) from Ochrobactrum anthropi and found that its primary structure is similar to the β-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (5Asano Y. Nakazawa A. Kato Y. Kondo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14233-14239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Asano Y. Kato Y. Yamada A. Kondo K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The enzyme acts mostly on peptides with D-Ala at the NH2 terminus to yield D-amino acids and does not act on D-amino acid derivatives with bulkier substituents. We proposed that D-aminopeptidase is a new “penicillin-recognizing enzyme” (1Frère J.-M. Joris B. CRC Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 11: 299-396Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), based on its primary structure, inhibition by β-lactam compounds, and the ability to catalyze peptide bond formation in organic solvents, although the enzyme does not show β-lactamase activity (6Asano Y. Kato Y. Yamada A. Kondo K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Asano Y. Takai K. Frontiers and New Horizons in Amino Acid Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 333-336Google Scholar).In this paper, we describe the screening of soil microorganisms for D-stereospecific endopeptidases using a synthetic peptide ((D-Phe)4), characterization of the new enzyme alkaline D-peptidase (ADP), 1The abbreviations used are: ADPalkaline D-peptidaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyBoctert-butoxycarbonylkbkilobase pair(s)ORFopen reading frame. as well as cloning and sequencing of the adp gene from Bacillus cereus strain DF4-B.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we synthesized (D-Phe)4 in eight steps to screen for a new microbial endopeptidase. A strain degrading (D-Phe)4, indicated by a clear zone on LB agar plates, was isolated and identified as B. cereus. We purified the enzyme 300-fold to homogeneity from 140 liters of culture broth in 8% yield. We designated the enzyme as alkaline D-peptidase. It is the first D-stereospecific endopeptidase isolated with β-lactamase activity.Since the NH2-terminal amino acid of the natural enzyme could not be determined, probably because it was modified, the Mr of the enzyme was determined by mass spectrometry. The observed Mr of the enzyme was 37,952. Serine (223AGT) appears to be the first residue of the mature protein for the following reasons. Bacillus species seem to prefer small neutral amino acid residues at positions −1 and −3 of the signal peptide (14Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), especially at Ala−3-Xaa-Ala−1, where cleavage occurs after the carboxyl-terminal alanine. However, both of the alanine residues are occasionally substituted by other amino acid residues with a short side chain. In fact, β-mannosidase produced by Bacillus sp. has the sequence Ser−3-Met-Ser−1-Ser+1 (23Akino T. Kato C. Horikoshi K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3178-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is similar to the sequence Ser−3-Val-Ser−1-Ser+1 found in ADP (Fig. 4). However, assuming that the NH2-terminal amino acid of the secreted mature protein is serine (223AGT), the signal peptide of ADP (39 amino acids) is longer than those of other exported proteins of bacilli (18-35 amino acids) (14Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ADP might be synthesized as a propeptide with a few extra residues between the signal peptide and mature regions, like the α-amylase from B. subtilis (24Takase K. Mizuno H. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11548-11553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the β-lactamases from B. cereus (25Mezes P.S.F. Yang Y.Q. Hussain M. Lampen J.O. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Bacillus licheniformis (14Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We synthesized several derivatives of D-Phe oligopeptides. The enzyme showed D-stereospecific dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and endopeptidase activities. The calculated Vmax/Km values for (D-Phe)3 and (D-Phe)4 were ∼1000 times higher than for (D-Phe)2. The enzyme was active toward (D-Phe)n, Boc-(D-Phe)n, (D-Phe)n methyl ester, D-Phe-NH2, Boc-(D-Phe)n methyl ester, and Boc-(D-Phe)n tert-butyl ester, but not toward (D-Ala)n (n = 2-4), (D-Val)3, and (D-Leu)2. The enzyme digested (D-Phe)2-D-Tyr into (D-Phe)2 and D-Tyr and digested D-Tyr-(D-Phe)2 into D-Tyr-D-Phe and D-Phe. The enzyme attacked (D-Phe)4, forming (D-Phe)2, which was then slowly hydrolyzed to D-Phe. The product (D-Phe)3 was not formed. The enzyme had an optimal pH of ∼10.3, and it was stable in a relatively wide pH range. The enzyme was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue is responsible for exerting the enzyme activity. Thus, the enzyme was named alkaline D-peptidase (D-stereospecific peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.11.-). Although the enzyme showed β-lactamase activity toward ampicillin and penicillin G, carboxypeptidase DD (13Duez C. Piron-Fraipont C. Joris B. Dusart J. Urdea M.S. Martial J.A. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and D-aminopeptidase activities were not detected. The kinetic measurements have clearly shown that the enzyme prefers (D-Phe)3 and (D-Phe)4 to the penicillins. ADP activity similar to that described in this study has not been reported, although some β-lactamases and carboxypeptidase DD are known to be active toward acyclic depsipeptides (26Pratt R.F. Govardhan C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Adam M. Damblon C. Plaitin B. Christiaens L. Frère J.-M. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme acts on aromatic ring-containing substrates and is excreted into the medium, the enzyme might have evolved to be active toward the synthetic substrates ampicillin and penicillin G.We found that ADP (350 amino acids after modification) is homologous to the sequence of carboxypeptidase DD from Streptomyces R61 (13Duez C. Piron-Fraipont C. Joris B. Dusart J. Urdea M.S. Martial J.A. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), penicillin-binding proteins, class C β-lactamases, and D-aminopeptidase from O. anthropi (6Asano Y. Kato Y. Yamada A. Kondo K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the sequence Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Lys is perfectly conserved in this class of enzymes, and the consensus sequence is located ∼60 residues from the NH2 termini of most of the enzymes. Thus, we propose that alkaline D-peptidase from B. cereus could be categorized as a new member of the penicillin-recognizing enzymes, which include penicillin-binding proteins, β-lactamases, and D-aminopeptidase.

Microbiol. 1985; 11: 299-396Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), based on its primary structure, inhibition by β-lactam compounds, and the ability to catalyze peptide bond formation in organic solvents, although the enzyme does not show β-lactamase activity (6Asano Y. Kato Y. Yamada A. Kondo K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Asano Y. Takai K. Frontiers and New Horizons in Amino Acid Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 333-336Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the screening of soil microorganisms for D-stereospecific endopeptidases using a synthetic peptide ((D-Phe)4), characterization of the new enzyme alkaline D-peptidase (ADP), 1The abbreviations used are: ADPalkaline D-peptidaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyBoctert-butoxycarbonylkbkilobase pair(s)ORFopen reading frame. as well as cloning and sequencing of the adp gene from Bacillus cereus strain DF4-B. alkaline D-peptidase high performance liquid chromatography tert-butoxycarbonyl kilobase pair(s) open reading frame. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we synthesized (D-Phe)4 in eight steps to screen for a new microbial endopeptidase. A strain degrading (D-Phe)4, indicated by a clear zone on LB agar plates, was isolated and identified as B. cereus. We purified the enzyme 300-fold to homogeneity from 140 liters of culture broth in 8% yield. We designated the enzyme as alkaline D-peptidase. It is the first D-stereospecific endopeptidase isolated with β-lactamase activity.Since the NH2-terminal amino acid of the natural enzyme could not be determined, probably because it was modified, the Mr of the enzyme was determined by mass spectrometry. The observed Mr of the enzyme was 37,952. Serine (223AGT) appears to be the first residue of the mature protein for the following reasons. Bacillus species seem to prefer small neutral amino acid residues at positions −1 and −3 of the signal peptide (14Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), especially at Ala−3-Xaa-Ala−1, where cleavage occurs after the carboxyl-terminal alanine. However, both of the alanine residues are occasionally substituted by other amino acid residues with a short side chain. In fact, β-mannosidase produced by Bacillus sp. has the sequence Ser−3-Met-Ser−1-Ser+1 (23Akino T. Kato C. Horikoshi K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3178-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is similar to the sequence Ser−3-Val-Ser−1-Ser+1 found in ADP (Fig. 4). However, assuming that the NH2-terminal amino acid of the secreted mature protein is serine (223AGT), the signal peptide of ADP (39 amino acids) is longer than those of other exported proteins of bacilli (18-35 amino acids) (14Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ADP might be synthesized as a propeptide with a few extra residues between the signal peptide and mature regions, like the α-amylase from B. subtilis (24Takase K. Mizuno H. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11548-11553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the β-lactamases from B. cereus (25Mezes P.S.F. Yang Y.Q. Hussain M. Lampen J.O. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Bacillus licheniformis (14Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We synthesized several derivatives of D-Phe oligopeptides. The enzyme showed D-stereospecific dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and endopeptidase activities. The calculated Vmax/Km values for (D-Phe)3 and (D-Phe)4 were ∼1000 times higher than for (D-Phe)2. The enzyme was active toward (D-Phe)n, Boc-(D-Phe)n, (D-Phe)n methyl ester, D-Phe-NH2, Boc-(D-Phe)n methyl ester, and Boc-(D-Phe)n tert-butyl ester, but not toward (D-Ala)n (n = 2-4), (D-Val)3, and (D-Leu)2. The enzyme digested (D-Phe)2-D-Tyr into (D-Phe)2 and D-Tyr and digested D-Tyr-(D-Phe)2 into D-Tyr-D-Phe and D-Phe. The enzyme attacked (D-Phe)4, forming (D-Phe)2, which was then slowly hydrolyzed to D-Phe. The product (D-Phe)3 was not formed. The enzyme had an optimal pH of ∼10.3, and it was stable in a relatively wide pH range. The enzyme was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue is responsible for exerting the enzyme activity. Thus, the enzyme was named alkaline D-peptidase (D-stereospecific peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.11.-). Although the enzyme showed β-lactamase activity toward ampicillin and penicillin G, carboxypeptidase DD (13Duez C. Piron-Fraipont C. Joris B. Dusart J. Urdea M.S. Martial J.A. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and D-aminopeptidase activities were not detected. The kinetic measurements have clearly shown that the enzyme prefers (D-Phe)3 and (D-Phe)4 to the penicillins. ADP activity similar to that described in this study has not been reported, although some β-lactamases and carboxypeptidase DD are known to be active toward acyclic depsipeptides (26Pratt R.F. Govardhan C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Adam M. Damblon C. Plaitin B. Christiaens L. Frère J.-M. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme acts on aromatic ring-containing substrates and is excreted into the medium, the enzyme might have evolved to be active toward the synthetic substrates ampicillin and penicillin G.We found that ADP (350 amino acids after modification) is homologous to the sequence of carboxypeptidase DD from Streptomyces R61 (13Duez C. Piron-Fraipont C. Joris B. Dusart J. Urdea M.S. Martial J.A. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), penicillin-binding proteins, class C β-lactamases, and D-aminopeptidase from O. anthropi (6Asano Y. Kato Y. Yamada A. Kondo K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2316-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the sequence Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Lys is perfectly conserved in this class of enzymes, and the consensus sequence is located ∼60 residues from the NH2 termini of most of the enzymes. Thus, we propose that alkaline D-peptidase from B. cereus could be categorized as a new member of the penicillin-recognizing enzymes, which include penicillin-binding proteins, β-lactamases, and D-aminopeptidase.

https://openalex.org/W2028913667,"A central characteristic of integrin adhesion receptors is their capacity to become activated, thereby enhancing their affinity for ligands. Here, we report the identification of a discrete site within the I domain of integrin αMβ2, which modulates the adhesive activity of this receptor. Based upon the crystal structure, this region is composed of two short and spatially proximal loops, E162QLKKSKTL and Q190NNPNPRS. Mutations in these loops yield receptors which support spontaneous cell adhesion to fibrinogen, whereas mutation of an adjacent region and wild-type receptors require activation to adhere to this substrate. An activating monoclonal antibody enhanced the adhesive activity of one but not the other loop mutants, suggesting that the activation states of these two mutant receptors were not identical. Given that similar I domains exist in several other integrin α subunits and non-integrin proteins, and possibly in all integrin β subunits, these two loop segments may represent a universal target for controlling integrin activation and the function of other I domain-containing proteins. In support of this hypothesis, several naturally occurring mutations that activate von Willebrand factor map to the same loops of its I(A) domain.

I(A) domains, inserted domains of ∼200 amino acids, are common structural motifs in numerous proteins, including several integrin α-subunits, von Willebrand factor (vWF), 1The abbreviations used are: vWFvon Willebrand factordOvadenatured ovalbuminEC3biC3bi-coated sheep erythrocytesFgfibrinogenFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingHBSSHank's balanced salt solutionmAbmonoclonal antibodyNIFneutrophil inhibitory factorPBSphosphate buffered salineICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule. and the complement components C2 and factor B (1Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Interactions of these proteins with other proteins are often mediated by their I domains. As two examples pertinent to this study: 1) the I domain mediates the interaction of vWF with collagen and with its platelet receptor GPIb/IX, thereby allowing vWF to bridge platelets to the subendothelial matrix, and 2) contact sites for several αMβ2 ligands, including NIF (2Muchowski P.J.

The crystal structures of the αMI- and αLIdomains recently have been determined (1Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

A cation binding site is formed at the vertex of the β-sheets, and the bound cation is coordinated in a “MIDAS” motif (1Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Structural flexibility within the I domains allows them to exist in two distinct conformational states, which differ in the mode of cation coordination (5Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Common to many I domain-containing proteins is their capacity to be “activated” such that their affinities for other proteins are enhanced. vWF can be activated by botrocetin (7Sugimoto M. Mohri H.

Med. 1982; 155: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and to execute certain αMβ2-dependent functions, such as the adhesion to endothelium (10Gamble J.R. Harlan J.M. Klebanoff S.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8667-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), the adhesion-dependent respiratory burst (11Shappell S.B. Toman C. Anderson D.C. Taylor A.A. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2702-2711PubMed Google Scholar), and phagocytosis (12Anderson D.C. Miller L.J. Schmalsteig F.C. Rothlein R. Springer T.A. J.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 2702-2711PubMed Google Scholar), bacterial products (lipopolysaccharides), and mAbs, such as KIM185 (13Ortlepp S. Stephens P.E. Hogg N. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), can activate αMβ2. The inherent flexibility noted in the crystal structure of the αMI-domain (5Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 6Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) may be relevant to such activation. Spontaneous binding of vWF to platelets is observed in type IIB vWF disease (14Ginsburg D. Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which is associated with platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia. This activation of vWF has been ascribed to several mutations which map to its A1 domain. Based upon primary sequence homology and the crystal structures of the αMI- and αLI-domains, these vWF mutations are clustered in a spatially proximal site composed of two loop (L) segments, which connect secondary structural elements: 1) the loop region between helix 1 and β-sheet B, termed L(1-B), and 2) the loop between helix 2 and 3, termed L(2-3), of the αMI-domain. The recognition sequence in the A1 domain of vWF for botrocetin also is located in this region (7Sugimoto M. Mohri H. McClintock R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18172-18178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the structural similarity between I domains and the clustering of activating mutations to a local region within this domain of vWF, we hypothesized that mutations within the L(1-B) and L(2-3) region of the αMI-domain might influence the activation state of αMβ2. To test this hypothesis, these two segments were switched individually to their counterparts in αL to minimize gross perturbations of structure. These mutations are, in fact, shown to differentially influence the activation state of αMβ2. Thus, a very precise region that may be generally involved in the activation of I domain-containing proteins has been defined. Human kidney 293 cells and the expression vector, pCIS2M, were gifts from Dr. F. J. Castellino (Notre Dame, IN). The cDNAs of CD11b and CD18 were obtained from Dr. B. Karan-Tamir (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), and NIF was provided by Dr. M. Moyle (Corvas Intl., San Diego, CA). The αMβ2-activating mAb, KIM185, was a gift from Dr. M. Robinson (Celltech, Berkshire, UK). mAbs 2LPM19c and MHM23 were from Dako (Carpinteria, CA); TS1/18, OKM1, M1/70, and LM2/1 were from ATCC (Rockville, MD). G418, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, HBSS, DH5α cells, and restriction enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc./BRL (Life Technologies, Inc.). All mutations were created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using uracil-containing single stranded M13mp18 DNA (15Zhang L. Castellino F.J.

Primer 5′-CTGCATCAAAGAGAACTGGTAGCTGGTGTTGCTTAATTTCTTCATCACAGTTGAGAC-3′ (57-mer) was used to create mutant αM[L(1-B)], in which the αM segment of E162QLKKSKTL was changed to the corresponding αL segment of KKLSNTSYQ. Primer 5′-TATTGGCTTCACCAGTGCGTCGGGGTCTTTCCATTTAACGAACTCTTTGAAGGT-3′ (54-mer) was used to create mutant αM[L(2-3)], in which the αM segment of Q190NNPNPRS was changed to the corresponding segment of VKWKDPDA in αL. DNA sequencing of the entire I domain was conducted to confirm the desired mutations without alteration of the remaining sequence. The mutant I domains were reinserted into αM using previously introduced ClaI535 and NheI1141 sites (16Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reconstructed cDNAs of αM and β2 were then inserted separately into the expression vector pCIS2M by employing XbaI and XhoI sites. In this vector, αM and β2 expression is under the control of human cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer (15Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each expression vector was purified using CsCl gradients and transfected, together with pRSVneo (neomycin resistance gene), into 293 cells according to our established procedure (15Zhang L.

G418 (600 μg/ml) resistant colonies were pooled, and αMβ2-expressing cells were sorted by FACS analysis (FACStar, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using an αM-specific mAb, OKM1, which recognizes an epitope outside of the I domain (17Diamond M.S.

The procedure for C3bi binding was modified from the original method of Bilsland (18Bilsland C.A. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J.

For immunoprecipitation, αMβ2-expressing 293 cells were 125I-surface-labeled with lactoperoxidase according to a published method (21Phillips D.R. Agin P.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For protein modeling, the coordinates for αMI-domain were assigned according to the crystal structure of αLI-domain (5Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) using the HOMOLOGY program and then energy minimized using the DISCOVER program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). Based on the location of the vWF-activating mutations (14Ginsburg D. Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and the crystal structures of the integrin I-domains (1Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 5Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), three mutant αM were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant αM[H(1)], αM[L(1-B)], or αM[L(2-3)] contained a switch of the (M153KEFVST) segment within the helix 1, the loop between Helix 1 and β-sheet B (E162QLKKSKTL), and the loop between Helix 2 and Helix 3 (Q190NNPNPRS), to their counterpart sequences in αL (ILDFMKD, KKLSNTSYQ, and VKWKDPDA), respectively (see Fig. 5). Upon introduction of these mutant and wild-type αMβ2 into 293 cells, all were stably expressed. Immunoprecipitation of surface labeled cells with OKM1, a mAb to the αM subunit, or TS1/18, a mAb to the β2 subunit, showed two bands by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulfate (nonreducing) of the same mobility as wild-type αMβ2 with estimated molecular weights of 165 and 95 kDa, indicating that all three mutants were correctly assembled into heterodimers on the cell surface. FACS analyses showed that the mean fluorescence intensities of the three mutants with any one of a panel of mAbs against αM (OKM1, 44, LM2/1, M1/70) or β2 (MHM23) differed by less than 15%, suggesting that the three mutants were expressed at similar levels as the wild-type receptor. The interactions of NIF, C3bi, and dOva with the αMβ2 mutants were examined. Varying quantities of 125I-NIF were added to the transfectants. The binding isotherms obtained with all the αMβ2-bearing cells were very similar (Fig. 1A), providing evidence for saturable binding. Specificity was supported by the failure of mock-transfected 293 cells to bind NIF and the abolition of 125I-NIF binding (>98% inhibition) by excess unlabeled NIF or EDTA. From the binding curves, the following Kd values were calculated: 7.0 ± 1.6 nM for wild-type; 11.4 ± 3.4 nM for αM[H(1)], 5.0 ± 1.9 nM for αM[L(1-B)] and 14.2 ± 5.6 nM for αM[L(2-3)]. The similarity in binding parameters for the three mutant and wild-type αMβ2 indicates that the mutated sites are not directly required for NIF recognition (αLβ2 does not bind NIF (2Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and that overall conformation and function of the I domain in the αMβ2 receptors had been preserved. EC3bi binding (Fig. 1B) and adhesion to dOva (Fig. 1C) also were not altered by the mutations. Verifying the specificity of EC3bi binding, uncoated or IgM-coated erythrocytes did not interact with the three mutant and wild-type αMβ2-transfectants; mock-transfected 293 cells did not rosette with EC3bi; and EDTA abolished binding (Fig. 1B). Thus, EC3bi bound to the mutants without a requirement for activation, consistent with the reports in the literature (16Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Rabb H. Michishita M. Sharma C.P. Brown D. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 990-1002PubMed Google Scholar). The interactions of the mutants with dOva were completely inhibited by 0.5 mM EDTA, indicating divalent cation dependence, or 10 μg/ml NIF, indicating αMβ2 dependence. Mutation of the H(1) segment of αM had no effect on adhesion, whereas the L(1-B) and L(2-3) mutants exhibited a 2-fold increase in adhesion. mAb 2LPM19c, which recognizes a conformational epitope in the I domain (23Violette S.M. Rusche J.R. Purdy S.R. Boyd J.G. Cos J. Silver S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3092-3101PubMed Google Scholar), blocks many αMβ2-mediated functions including ICAM-1, Fg, and C3bi binding and neutrophil aggregation (17Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbí A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, 2LPM19c inhibited the adhesion of wild-type αMβ2 to dOva (Fig. 2A). However, the mAb had no effect on the adhesion of αM[H(1)], αM[L(1-B)], or αM[L(2-3)] to this substratum. One explanation for this result is that the mutated regions of the receptor contributed to the epitope of 2LPM19c. FACS analyses supported this interpretation. As shown in Fig. 2B, while 2LPM19c reacted well with wild-type αMβ2-bearing cells, it failed to bind to the three mutant αMβ2 lines. Adhesion of wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells to Fg requires activation of the receptor such as with mAb KIM185 (16Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is verified in Fig. 3A, as was also the case for mutant αM[H(1)]. In contrast, αM[L(1-B)] and αM[L(2-3)] mutants adhered aggressively to Fg in the absence of KIM185. Compared to wild-type αMβ2, the adhesion of the αM[L(1-B)]β2 and αM[L(2-3)]β2 increased by 9- and 8-fold, respectively. Addition of 10 μg/ml NIF (Fig. 3A), 1 mm EDTA, or 5 μg/ml of the blocking mAb MHM23 (not shown) abrogated adhesion of all the αMβ2-transfectants by more than 95%, confirming that the enhanced adhesion of the loop mutants remained αMβ2- and cation-dependent. In concert with their ability to adhere spontaneously to Fg, both αM[L(1-B)] and αM[L(2-3)] acquired a distinct morphology (Fig. 3B). More than 90% of the two mutant cell lines that adhered to Fg also spread upon the substratum, forming lamellipodia extensions and developing a very flattened appearance. In contrast, the few wild-type αMβ2- or αM[H(1)]β2-bearing cells which did adhere remained round and rarely spread (<5% of adherent cells). The ability of KIM185 to further activate the two loop mutants was examined (Fig. 4). Addition of 2 μg/ml of KIM185 significantly enhanced the adhesion of wild-type αMβ2 (11-fold) and the αM[L(2-3)] mutant (2.5-fold) to Fg. However, the mAb had little effect on the adhesion of αM[L(1-B)](1.1-fold), though it bound αM[L(1-B)] well as judged by FACS analysis(data not shown). Despite the fact that the unstimulated adhesion of αM[L(2-3)] was lower than that of αM[L(1-B)], its adhesive activity exceeded that of αM[L(1-B)] upon further activation with KIM185, suggesting that the mechanisms of activation of these two mutants are distinct. In the A domain of vWF, activating mutations, which lead to spontaneous binding to platelets, cluster in two noncontiguous regions, M540MERLRISQKWVRV and P574SELR (14Ginsburg D. Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5A). These segments correspond to the loop regions between helix 1 and β-sheet B and between helix 2 and 3 of the αMI-domain (see Fig. 5B). We hypothesized that mutation of these two loop regions might control the activation state of αMβ2 and, accordingly, created two mutants, αM[L(1-B)] and αM[L(2-3)], in which the loop regions between helix 1 and β sheet B (E162QLKKSKTL), helix 2 and helix 3 (Q190NNPNPRS), were switched to counterparts sequences in αL (based upon their recently published crystal structures) (1Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 5Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Consistent with our hypothesis, αM[L(1-B)] and αM[L(2-3)] transfectants were constitutively active, whereas wild-type and αM[H(1)], in which helix 1 itself was switched, were not. Thus, our study supports the role of two short segments of the αMI-domain in controlling receptor activation and suggests that the corresponding regions of other I domain proteins, including other integrins may serve similar regulatory functions. Given the possible existence of an I domain in all integrin β subunits (1Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), this site may represent an universal target for modulation of integrin activation and the function of all I domain-containing proteins. Upon introduction of the cDNAs into 293 cells, all three mutant and wild-type αMβ2 were expressed as functional heterodimers on the cell surface as evidenced by their ability to: 1) react with mAbs to both the αM and β2 subunits, 2) bind NIF with similar affinities, 3) rosette with C3bi, and 4) adhere to dOva. As the latter three properties are attributes of αMβ2 which are not shared with αLβ2 (13Ortlepp S. Stephens P.E. Hogg N. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the region composed of H(1), L(1-B), and L(2-3) is not required for binding of these representative ligands. The ability of the L(1-B) and L(2-3) region to modulate the activation state of αMβ2 was demonstrated by the following observations: 1) segment switching at either site converted αMβ2 into a constitutively active receptor; i.e. compared to wild-type αMβ2, the adhesive of the two mutants to Fg increased by about 10-fold. A similar increment in adhesion of neutrophils to Fg is observed upon activation of the cells (24Barnard J.W. Biro M.G. Lo S.K. Ohno S. Carozza M.A. Moyle M. Soule H.R. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4876-4881PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The two mutant cell lines acquired a distinct morphology. They adhered and spread upon coverslips, formed lamellipodia extensions, and displayed a very flattened morphology. These changes indicate that the activating mutations could transmit outside-in signals, such that the cytoskeletal network within the cell reorganized. 3) The 2LPM19c mAb to αM blocked functions of wild-type but not the two mutant receptors which lacked the 2LPM19c epitope as assessed by FACS analysis. Thus, the inhibitory effects of the mAb is likely to arise from its allosteric effect on the receptor conformation. This explanation suggests that the mAb has similar recognition requirements but the opposite effect of botrocetin on vWF activation. 2LPM19c recognizes H(1), L(1-B), and L(2-3), and these segments are homologous to two critical regions in vWF for botrocetin recognition (residues 539-553 and 569-583) (7Sugimoto M. Mohri H. McClintock R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18172-18178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Thus, the binding sites for 2LPM19c and botrocetin correspond to overlapping regions although the sites are not precisely identical. The alternative possibility that 2LPM19c sterically blocks ligand binding cannot be excluded but seem unlikely in view of the distance of the epitope from the “MIDAS” motif of the receptor (1Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In addition to the two loop regions of the αMI-domain, it is likely that other spatially adjacent segments also might influence receptor activation. In particular, the region composed of amino acids 117-130 of αM is a reasonable candidate. In the crystal structure of the αMI-domain, this segment, which lies outside the I domain and in front of the β-sheet A, is in close spatial proximity to the L(1-B) and L(2-3) segments (Fig. 5B). Mutations in the homologous region of vWF induce its activation, including two vWF type IIB mutations, Pro503→ Leu (25Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and His505→ Asp (14Ginsburg D. Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the loop mutations in αMβ2 or in vWF induce activation remains uncertain. Qu and Leahy (5Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) proposed that the mutations within this region of vWF might interfere with interactions between A domains which normally suppress GPIb binding. Our data are consistent with this explanation but also support an alternative; namely, mutations in this region changed the relative conformations of the loop between β-sheet A and helix 1, and the loop between helix 3 and 4, thus affecting the receptor activity. The latter possibility was supported by the observation of Lee et al. (6Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) that the αMI-domain is capable of adopting two different conformations and undergoing large structural changes. Further experiments are required to distinguish these two mechanisms. One of the two loop mutants, αM[L(2-3)], could be further activated by the β2-activating mAb, KIM185, thus producing a “superadhesion” receptor. Mutation of a residue in the β3 subunit of αIIbβ3 also has been shown to produce a “superintegrin” (26Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. Gawaz M.P. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22211-22216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distinction between the two loop mutants in response to KIM185 suggests the existent of different activation states of the αMβ2. In our study, short amino acid segments were altered to generate these different activation states. By analogy to vWF, point mutations or polymorphisms also may lead to αMβ2 receptors with different functional properties. Recently, it has been shown that a polymorphism in the β3 subunit is associated with a thrombotic phenotype (27Weiss E.J. Bray P.F. Tayback M. Schulman S.P. Kickler T.S. Becker L.C. Weiss J.L. Gerstenblith G. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1090-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Mutations which alter the activation states of αMβ2 could have broad ranging consequences including altered susceptibility to infection.

Phosphorylation of specific proteins is an important mechanism for regulating many cellular processes (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). Protein kinases that catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to the side chains of serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine residues comprise a highly conserved enzyme superfamily (2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, protein kinases control cellular function by altering the catalytic activity, localization, state of assembly, and/or stability of their target substrates. Protein kinases themselves are highly regulated by mechanisms as diverse as binding of small molecule effectors (such as cyclic 3′,5′-AMP or diacylglycerol), association with regulatory proteins (such as cyclins or small GTP-binding proteins), and direct phosphorylation by other protein kinases. Calcium ion is thought to be a critical second messenger in many cell types (3Nemeth E.F. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the unicellular eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), Ca2+ is required for cell growth and is essential for cell cycle progression (4Davis T.N. Thorner J. Hicks J.B. Yeast Cell Biology. Vol. 33. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1986: 477-503Google Scholar, 5Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Iida H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1093: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Many of the effects of Ca2+ are mediated via binding of the ion to Ca2+-binding proteins. One such protein found ubiquitously in all eukaryotes is calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinCaM kinasetype II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseGSTS. japonicum glutathione S-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase pair(s)TBSTris-buffered salineEF-2elongation factor 2. (6Means A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Upon binding Ca2+, CaM undergoes a conformational change (7Weinstein H. Mehler E.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 213-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that enables the Ca2+/CaM complex to bind to its target proteins (8James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae gene (CMD1) encoding yeast CaM has been cloned and shown to be essential for cell viability (9Davis T.N. Urdea M.S. Masiarz F.R. Thorner J. Cell. 1986; 47: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Because Cmd1 is indispensible and its role is to modulate the function of other proteins, it follows that one or more of its specific targets is also necessary for cell survival. One Cmd1-binding protein that is critical for mitotic progression is Nuf1, a component of the spindle pole body (10Geiser J.R. Sunderberg H.A. Chang B.H. Muller E.G. Davis T.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7913-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Stirling D.A. Welch K.A. Stark M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4329-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Another Cmd1-binding protein that is essential for properly localized cell surface growth is Myo2, a so-called class V myosin required for the translocation of secretory vesicles along actin cables (12Johnston G.C.

Another CaM target is the class of type II Ca2+/CaM-activated protein kinases, which display a broad substrate specificity, designated “CaM kinases” (14Schulman H. Lou L.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 62-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are at least 17 distinct CaM kinase isotypes encoded by at least four discrete genes (15Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). 2H. Schulman, personal communication. These enzymes are thought to regulate many cellular functions in response to changes in internal Ca2+ concentration. Even S. cerevisiae, a unicellular eukaryote, possesses two genes (CMK1 and CMK2) that encode Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases with sequence homology, structural organization, and in vitro biochemical properties similar to their mammalian counterparts (17Pausch M.H. Kaim D. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Ohya Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Londesborough J. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12784-12794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the presumed importance of this class of enzyme in animal cells, yeast strains lacking either Cmk1 or Cmk2 (or both) are viable and display no detectably deleterious phenotype under standard growth conditions. However, critical function(s) of Cmk1 and Cmk2 might not be manifested, because additional protein kinases may be present that can substitute for Cmk1 and Cmk2. Ample precedent for such a situation in S. cerevisiae exists. For example, the yeast genome contains three different genes (TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3) that encode isotypes of the catalytic subunit of cyclic 3′,5′-AMP-dependent protein kinase (19Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. McMullen B. Huwitz H. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Cells lacking any one or any pair of these genes are viable, but cells lacking all three are not. It was initially brought to our attention that the nucleotide sequence upstream of the YEF3 gene on chromosome 12 that was originally deposited in GenBank™ (20Qin S. Moldave K. McLaughlin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7802-7807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained a partial open reading frame with significant similarity to CaM kinases. 3B. Baum, personal communication. To determine if this genomic segment actually contained an authentic CaM kinase-related gene, we cloned and sequenced this region, delineated the open reading frame that encodes this CaM kinase-like protein kinase, which we designated CLK1, and examined in detail the biochemical properties and cellular localization of this enzyme. S. cerevisiae strain YPH501 (MATa/MATα ade2-101oc/ade2-101oc his3-Δ200/his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1/leu2-Δ1 lys2-801am/lys2-801am trp1-Δ63/trp1-Δ63 ura3-52/ura3-52) (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the parental strain for the construction of all mutant strains, unless noted otherwise. A protease-deficient strain, BJ2168 (MATa leu2 trp1 ura3-52 prb1-1122 pep4-3 prc1-407 gal2) (22Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), was used for experiments involving enzyme expression and immunoprecipitation. Strain AS306 (MATa GAL+ ade2-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100), originally designated CRY1 and obtained from R. S. Fuller (Dept. of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), was used for experiments involving gene induction by galactose. Yeast cells were grown either in a rich medium containing 2% glucose (YPGlc) or 2% galactose (YPGal) or in a synthetic medium containing 2% glucose (SGlc) or 2% galactose (SGal) that was supplemented with twice the recommended concentration of nutrients (23Sherman F.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) but lacking those components required to maintain selection for plasmids. DNA-mediated transformation of yeast cells was carried out either by electroporation (24Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) or by a modified version of the lithium acetate method (25Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains NM522 and DH5α were used for construction and propagation of plasmids (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized in the DNA Synthesis Facility (University of California, Berkeley, CA) or by IDX, Inc. (Coralville, IA). To screen an S. cerevisiae genomic DNA library for segments derived from the portion of chromosome 12 upstream of the YEF3 gene (20Qin S. Moldave K. McLaughlin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7802-7807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a probe based on the published sequence of this region (27Qin S. Xie A. Bonato M.C.M. McLaughlin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1903-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (5′-CAATGTTATGTGGGTTCCGCCATT-3′) was prepared, end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]ATP, and separated from unincorporated nucleotide using a NICK™ column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The radiolabeled probe was hybridized to five nitrocellulose filter replicas (15-cm diameter) of plates (∼8,000 colonies/plate) containing a yeast genomic DNA library in the plasmid vector, pSB32 (gift of F. Spencer and P. Hieter, Dept. of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The bacterial cells were grown, transferred to filters, and screened by hybridization using standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two independently isolated clones (YCpMM1.4 and YCpMM1.6), which reproducibly hybridized to the probe in subsequent secondary and tertiary tests, were recovered. Restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim, New England Biolabs, or Stratagene and were used as recommended by the manufacturer. Conventional methods were used for the construction, propagation, and purification of all plasmids (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments separated on agarose gels were recovered from the gels via adsorption to powdered glass (GeneClean™, Bio 101, Inc.). For certain purposes, it was necessary to eliminate the EcoRI site in the vector Bluescript SK (Stratagene), which was accomplished by cleaving with EcoRI, filling in the resulting 5′-overhangs by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and incubation with T4 DNA ligase and ATP. A 3-kb ApaI fragment was excised from YCpMM1.6 and inserted into the ApaI site of this modified version of Bluescript SK, yielding plasmid pMMR2. The same fragment was ligated in the reverse orientation in the standard Bluescript SK, producing pMMA3. To generate a version of Clk1 containing a 16-residue epitope from the c-Myc oncoprotein (-LEEQKLISEEDLLRKR-COOH) attached in frame to the C-terminal end of Clk1, the polymerase chain reaction and a three-primer scheme (28Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) were used. For this purpose, the template DNA was YCpMM1.6, the 5′-primer was 5′-AAGAAGACCGTATGGGG-3′, the joiner oligonucleotide was 5′-TTTCTGCTCCTCGAGTTCCCTGATAGTGGC-3′, and the 3′-primer encoding the tag was 5′-TTACCTCTTCCTGAGGAGGTCCTCTTCGCTGATTAATTTCTGCTCCTCGAG-3′. Amplification was achieved using the following program: four cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 s), annealing (40°C, 30 s), and synthesis (72°C, 30 s) followed by 16 cycles under the same conditions, except that annealing was carried out at 45°C. The resulting product was ligated into the vector, pCR™1000 (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, to generate plasmid pCR-MM1. A NarI-KpnI fragment of pCR-MM1 was excised and used to replace the corresponding NarI-KpnI segment in plasmid pMMR2, thereby creating plasmid pMM15. To express full-length c-Myc-tagged CLK1 from its own promoter, a PstI-KpnI fragment of pMM15 was ligated into YEp352 (29Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagaloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) that had been previously digested with PstI and KpnI, yielding pMM16. Polymerase chain reaction was also used to construct a derivative of CLK1 containing a C-terminal truncation. For this purpose, the template DNA was pMMR2, the 5′-primer was 5′-GGGGGATCCCCATGCTTAAAATAAAGGCC-3′, which included a BamHI site (boldface type) 7 base pairs upstream of the sequences corresponding to the ATG (underlined) at the start of the CLK1 open reading frame, and the 3′-primer was 5′-CCCGTCGACTCATTACTTTGGTAAACAATCGAA-3′, which included two stop codons (underlined) after codon 486 of the CLK1 coding sequence immediately followed by SalI site (boldface type). Amplification was achieved using the following program: 22 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 s), annealing (37°C, 30 s), and synthesis (72°C, 30 s). To remove any overhanging 3′-extensions, the resulting product was incubated with T4 DNA polymerase (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and then ligated into Bluescript SK that had been cleaved with EcoRV, yielding plasmid pBS-ΔC. A BamHI-SalI fragment was excised from pBS-ΔC and inserted immediately downstream of the GAL1 promoter in the vector, YEp351GAL (30Benton B.M. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), that had been cleaved with BamHI and SalI, yielding plasmid pMM25. To place expression of full-length CLK1 under GAL1 promoter control, the HindIII fragment in pMM25 was replaced by the HindIII fragment from pMMA3, generating plasmid pMM51. To express a catalytically inactive mutant version of full-length CLK1 from the GAL1 promoter, the HindIII fragment in pMM25 was replaced with the HindIII fragment from plasmid pMM45 (described below), which contains the clk1(K201R) allele that was generated by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (see “In Vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis”), yielding plasmid pMM52. To express a catalytically inactive mutant version of the C-terminally truncated derivative of CLK1 from the GAL1 promoter, several steps were required. First, the BamHI-SalI fragment of pMM42 (described below) was inserted into pBluescript SK that had been digested with BamHI and SalI. Second, a ClaI-EcoRI fragment of the resulting plasmid was then replaced by the ClaI-EcoRI fragment of pMM45, generating pMM55. Finally, the BamHI-SalI fragment of pMM25 was replaced with the BamHI-SalI fragment of pMM55, to yield the desired plasmid pMM56. To facilitate purification, chimeras containing various portions of Clk1 fused to the C terminus of Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) were constructed. A chimera containing codons 135-610 of CLK1 joined in frame to the GST coding sequence was generated by ligating the EcoRV-KpnI fragment of pMMA3 into the E. coli expression vector, pGEX-3x (Pharmacia), that had been digested with SmaI and KpnI, yielding pMM23. A chimera containing all 610 codons of the CLK1 gene joined in frame to the GST coding sequence was generated in two steps. First, the BamHI-EcoRI fragment of pMM25 was ligated into pGEX-3x that had been cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI, yielding plasmid pMM36. Second, the EcoRI fragment of pMMA3 was ligated into the EcoRI site of pMM36, yielding plasmid pMM37, which expresses the desired fusion. A chimera containing codons 1-486 of the CLK1 gene joined in frame to the GST coding sequence was generated by replacing the HindIII fragment in pMM36 with the HindIII fragment from pMM25, yielding plasmid pMM42, which expresses the GST::Clk1(Δ487-610) fusion. A chimera containing the clk1(K201R) allele fused in frame to the GST coding sequence was constructed in two steps. First, the HindIII fragment in pMM37 was replaced with the HindIII fragment of pMM21 (see “In Vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis”), yielding plasmid pMM44. Second, the EcoRI fragment of pMM44 was replaced with the EcoRI fragment of pMMA3, to yield pMM45. To generate a template for constructing the Lys-to-Arg mutation at codon 201 of the CLK1 coding sequence, the PstI-EcoRI fragment from pMMR2 was ligated into the double-stranded replicative form of the phage vector, M13mp19 (New England Biolabs), and single-stranded phage DNA was prepared from the resulting construct using standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Using a commercial in vitro mutagenesis kit (Amersham Corp.) and the mutagenic primer, 5′-GCCTTTTTAATAACTCTAATGGCAACAGCTT-3′ (mismatched base underlined), mutant DNA was generated and purified, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Introduction of the desired mutation was confirmed by direct nucleotide sequence analysis (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The corresponding fragment was excised from the replicative form of the mutant phage by digestion with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pMM15 to generate plasmid pMM21. The PstI-KpnI fragment of pMM21 was inserted into the corresponding sites in YEp352 to yield plasmid pMM22. Plasmid pMMR2 was purified using a Magic Mini-Prep™ kit (Promega), and the nucleotide sequence of most of the insert was determined on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide method and a double-stranded DNA sequencing procedure (32Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase™ (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) form of T7 DNA polymerase, [α-35S]dATP (Amersham) (33Biggin M.D. Gibson T.J. Hong J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3963-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar) and, where necessary, custom-synthesized oligonucleotide primers. The GenBank™ accession number for this sequence is U23464. To confirm the map location of the CLK1 locus, an internal (EcoRI-NarI) fragment of the CLK1 coding sequence was excised from plasmid pMMR2, purified by gel electrophoresis, radiolabeled by a random primer method (34Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar), and hybridized to a blot of intact yeast chromosomes (gift of G. Anderson, Dept. of Plant Biology, University of California, Berkeley) separated by orthogonal field gel electrophoresis (35Gerring S.L. Connelly C. Hieter P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 57-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The same probe also was hybridized to a set of filters containing an ordered array of fragments of the yeast genome in a bacteriophage λ vector (36Link A.J. Olson M.V. Genetics. 1991; 127: 681-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generously provided by L. Riles and M. Olson (Dept. of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA species were isolated as described (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.A. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated in a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized against the same EcoRI-NarI probe derived from pMMR2 as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The EcoRI-NarI fragment in pMMR2 was replaced with an EcoRI-NarI fragment from pJJ217 (37Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 362-366Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar), which contains the entire HIS3 gene, to yield pMM11. The ApaI fragment of pMM11 was excised and used for DNA-mediated transformation of diploid strain YPH501. His+ colonies were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA hybridization (38Southern E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21353) Google Scholar) using a 2.5-kb EcoRI-ScaI fragment excised from YCpMM1.6 as the probe to identify transformants in which the CLK1 locus on one homolog had been replaced with the clk1-Δ1::HIS3 allele by homologous recombination. Such a clk1-Δ1::HIS3/CLK1 heterozygous diploid (YMM3) was sporulated on potassium acetate plates, and the resulting tetrads were dissected and analyzed for the segregation of markers. To generate a cmk1Δ cmk2Δ clk1Δ triple mutant, a MATa clk1-Δ1::HIS3 spore derived from YMM3 was mated with strain MPY62 (MATα cmk1-Δ1::HIS3 cmk2-Δ1::TRP1) (17Pausch M.H. Kaim D. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), to produce diploid strain YMM6. Haploids containing all three mutant loci were recovered from those tetrads in which His+:His− segregated 2:2 and in which the Trp+ marker also co-segregated into the His+ spores. As determined by immunoblotting (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) prior to immunization, two rabbits (1188 and 1189) displayed negligible cross-reaction against a cell-free extract of strain YPH499 and were injected, as the primary inoculation, with 50% complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) containing 1 mg of a GST-Clk1(Δ487-610) fusion protein that had been purified by adsorption and elution from glutathione-agarose beads from lysates of E. coli cells induced to express plasmid pMM42 by treatment with 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Four weeks and 8 weeks later, each rabbit was injected with 200 μg of the same antigen in 50% incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). One rabbit (1188) received an additional injection 19 weeks after the primary inoculation. Bleeds (4-20 ml) were drawn at 6, 10, and 14 weeks after the initial injection for rabbit 1189 and at 6, 10, and 21 weeks for rabbit 1188 and stored in 0.02% sodium azide at −70°C. Equal amounts of protein from cell extracts or in immune complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE), electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose using a dry blotting system (Multiphor II, Pharmacia), and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of either preimmune serum or an appropriate antiserum. For detection of Clk1, antiserum from rabbit 1188 was used. For detection of Clk1 derivatives tagged with the c-Myc epitope, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated 9E10 (40Evan G.I. Leiws G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar), was used. To detect immobilized primary antibodies, an appropriate secondary antibody (either horse anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins) coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used and visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL™, Amersham) and x-ray film (Biomax or XAR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Autophosphorylation was measured as the incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP into a species that co-migrated with authentic Clk1 protein and was immunoprecipitable with anti-Clk1 antibodies. To measure the phosphotransferase activity of Clk1, immune complexes generated as described immediately below were incubated under the same conditions but in the presence of various exogenously added protein substrates. For these purposes, a culture (40 ml) of yeast strain YMM3.1a (MATa clk1-Δ1::HIS3) containing an appropriate plasmid was grown in a selective medium (SGlc or SGal) to late exponential phase (a value of 100 on a Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter equipped with a number 66 red filter). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed by resuspension and recentrifugation in sterile distilled deionized water, resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by five 1-min bursts of vigorous vortex mixing with an equal volume of glass beads (0.45-0.5-mm diameter) alternating with 1-min periods of cooling on ice. The resulting crude extract was separated from the beads by placing the bead-lysate slurry in a conical Eppendorf tube punctured at the bottom with 25-gauge syringe needle and recovered into another Eppendorf tube by brief sedimentation in a clinical centrifuge at 3,000 rpm. After clarification by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at maximum rpm for 5 min, the resulting supernatant solution was subjected to sedimentation at 100,000 × g in a tabletop ultracentrifuge (TL100, Beckman). A sample (∼20 mg of total protein) of the resulting supernatant fraction was incubated overnight with a 1:100 dilution of ascites fluid containing anti-c-Myc mAb 9E10. The immune complexes so generated were collected by adsorption to 20 mg of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), washed three times by resuspension and recentrifugation in lysis buffer, and resuspended in kinase assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol). For each reaction, a sample of the resuspended immune complexes (typically 5 μl, representing (null)/1;10 of the total volume) was incubated for 10-20 min at either 25 or 30°C in a final volume of 40 μl in kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci/mmol, Amersham) in the presence and absence of various divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, and/or Ca2+), with or without purified yeast Cmd1 protein (0.5 μg) (gift of M. Pausch, this laboratory). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055"

A cDNA clone coding for FGF-1 was isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the clone contained, in addition to the protein coding region, an untranslated exon (FGF-1B) 34 base pairs upstream of the translation start codon ATG.

https://openalex.org/W2026295446,"Many studies suggest that insulin utilizes multiple signal transduction pathways. Insulin's effects are initiated by insulin binding to the insulin receptor, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and intracellular substrates, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), IRS-2, or Shc. We recently demonstrated that immediate-early gene egr-1 transcription was fully induced without phosphorylation of IRS-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Harada, S., Smith, R. M., Smith, J. A., Shah, N., Hu, D.-Q. & Jarett, L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 26632-26638). In the present study, we examined the effects of insulin on immediate-early gene egr-1 and c-fos expression in 32D cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (32D/IR), IRS-1 (32D/IRS), or both (32D/IR+IRS) and compared these effects with insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Insulin (17 nM) increased egr-1 and c-fos expression in 32D/IR and 32D/IR+IRS cells, but not in parental cells or 32D/IRS cells, as determined by Northern blot analysis. Insulin treatment (5 min at 37°C) markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including the insulin receptor, IRS-1, and Shc, in 32D/IR+IRS cells as determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In contrast, only two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, i.e. insulin receptor and Shc, were detected in 32D/IR cells. These data suggest that insulin receptor and Shc phosphorylation is necessary for insulin-induced egr-1 and c-fos expression, but IRS-1 phosphorylation is not necessary or sufficient for the expression of these genes. Furthermore, the effect of specific inhibitors on insulin-induced egr-1 expression was examined. Wortmannin (25 nM), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, had no effect on insulin-induced egr-1 expression. In contrast, PD 98059 (30 μM), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, totally blocked egr-1 expression induced by insulin. These data indicate that mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, is involved in insulin-induced egr-1 expression. Taken together, insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation appear to be the signal transduction pathway responsible for insulin-induced egr-1 expression in 32D cells.

Stewart T.N. Gilman M.Z. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Medema R.H. Wubbolts R. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5963-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, recent reports suggested that induction of expression of some immediate-early genes was independent of growth factor receptor autophosphorylation. For instance, Eldredge et al. (7Eldredge E.R. Korf G.M. Christensen T.A. Connolly D.C. Getz M.J. Maihle N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 14: 7527-7534Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reported that epidermal growth factor induced c-fos expression in cells expressing kinase-deficient epidermal growth factor receptors. Mundschau et al. (8Mundschau L.J. Forman L.W. Weng H. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16137-16142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that induction of egr-1, but not c-fos, c-myc, and JE, was independent of platelet-derived growth factor receptor autophosphorylation using three different conditions in which platelet-derived growth factor receptor autophosphorylation was blocked. The early growth response gene egr-1, also known as NGF1A, Krox-24, zif 268, and T1S-8, encodes a protein with three zinc finger motifs, structures that are present in many DNA-binding transcription factors (9Huang R.-P. Ngo L. Okamura D. Tucker M. Adamson E.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that insulin induced egr-1 mRNA transcription to a similar level as the maximum stimulation by serum in CHO cells expressing low numbers of insulin receptors (CHONEO cells) or tyrosine kinase-defective insulin receptors (CHOA1018K cells) as well as in cells expressing wild-type insulin receptors (CHOHIRc cells) (10Harada S.

These results indicate the existence of multiple signaling mechanisms, which may operate independently of insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation and affect some, but not all, nuclear responses to growth factor stimulation. A potential problem in interpreting the results with CHO cells is their low levels of endogenous insulin receptor or IRS-1. The argument could be made that undetectable levels of insulin receptor or IRS-1 phosphorylation could account for insulin's effects in the CHONEO and CHOA1018K cells, despite data to the contrary. 32D cells are mouse myeloid progenitor cells and are insensitive to insulin because they have very low levels of insulin receptors and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors and no detectable IRS-1 or related molecules, e.g. IRS-2/4PS (11Wang L.-M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). 32D cells overexpressing insulin receptors, IRS-1, or both have been used to investigate the requirement of these molecules in insulin signaling mechanisms. Previous studies using 32D cells demonstrated that insulin receptors or IRS-1 alone is not sufficient for insulin-stimulated mitogenesis (11Wang L.-M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). IRS-1 is essential for insulin stimulation of PI 3-kinase and p70S6K (12Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.-M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas insulin receptors alone are sufficient to mediate insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and activation of p21ras and MAP kinase (13Myers Jr., M.G. Wang L.-M. Sun X.-J. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Schlessinger J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this study, we assessed the effects of insulin on immediate-early gene expression in 32D cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (32D/IR), IRS-1 (32D/IRS), or both (32D/IR+IRS) and compared these effects with insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that insulin-induced egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression in 32D cell clones requires the insulin receptor and its phosphorylation, but not IRS-1 phosphorylation. Shc phosphorylation, Shc-GRB-2 association, and MAP kinase activation seem to be a pathway responsible for insulin-induced egr-1 and c-fos expression. Mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine, the insulin receptor β-subunit, or Shc were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against GRB-2 (C-23) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin was from Rockland Inc. Porcine insulin was a gift from Dr. R. E. Chance (Eli Lilly Research Laboratory, Indianapolis, IN). PD 98059 was kindly provided by Dr. Alan R. Saltiel (Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, MI). The plasmid DNAs for c-fos, egr-1, and α-tubulin were obtained from Drs. R. Taub, J. G. Monroe, and J. L. Swain (all at the University of Pennsylvania), respectively. 125I-Protein A (>30 μCi/μg) was from ICN, and [α-32P]dCTP (370 MBq/ml, 10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. 32D mouse myeloid progenitor cell clones that express no insulin receptors or IRS-1 (32D), insulin receptors but no IRS-1 (32D/IR), IRS-1 but no insulin receptors (32D/IRS), and both insulin receptors and IRS-1 (32D/IR+IRS) were cloned as described previously (11Wang L.-M.

The 32D cell clones were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% WEHI conditioned medium that contained interleukin-3 under 5% CO2 (12Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C.

The cells expressing IRS-1 were cultured in the presence of 2.5 mM histidinol. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 5 h (serum deprivation) and then incubated with 0-100 nM insulin for 0-90 min at 37°C. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated with inhibitors, PD 98059 or wortmannin (Sigma), before adding insulin. After the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, total cellular RNA was extracted, isolated, applied to 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) as described previously (10Harada S. Smith R.M. Smith J.A. Shah N. Hu D.-Q. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26632-26638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes for c-fos, egr-1, and α-tubulin, and the 32P-labeled bands were detected by a PhosphorImager and analyzed by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The cells were incubated with or without insulin for 1-5 min, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates (0.7 mg) were incubated with specific antibody (2 μg) for 18 h at 4°C. The immunocomplex was precipitated with protein A beads (Trisacryl, Pierce). For anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), rabbit anti-mouse antibody was added before adding protein A beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, solubilized in Laemmli buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.) using a Bio-Rad miniature slab gel apparatus (Mini-Protean II). Western blot analysis with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (1:500), the insulin receptor β-subunit (1:250), Shc (1:250), or GRB-2 (1:250) was performed as described previously (10Harada S. Smith R.M. Smith J.A. Shah N. Hu D.-Q. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26632-26638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the labeled proteins were detected by a PhosphorImager. To determine the requirement of the insulin receptor or IRS-1 in insulin signaling mechanisms that lead to immediate-early gene expression, we examined the effect of insulin on immediate-early gene egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression in 32D cell clones. 32D, 32D/IR, 32D/IRS, or 32D/IR+IRS cells were incubated with 17 nM insulin for 0-90 min at 37°C. Total cellular RNA was extracted for Northern blot analysis with α-32P-labeled probes for egr-1, c-fos, and α-tubulin. α-Tubulin, an insulin-insensitive gene, was used as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 1, insulin increased egr-1 mRNA expression in 32D/IR and 32D/IR+IRS cells with a similar time course. Insulin increased c-fos mRNA expression also, but more transiently, and it decreased to the basal level in 90 min. In contrast, insulin had no effect on egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression in 32D and 32D/IRS cells. These results suggest that insulin-induced egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression requires the insulin receptor, but not IRS-1. To determine the sensitivity to insulin, we next examined the effect of different concentrations of insulin on immediate-early gene expression. 32D/IR or 32D/IR+IRS cells were incubated with 0-100 nM insulin for 30 min at 37°C. The level of egr-1 and c-fos mRNAs in Northern blot analysis was quantified by a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software and was expressed as a percentage of maximum stimulation (at 100 nM). The level of α-tubulin mRNA did not change significantly under any conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, both 32D/IR and 32D/IR+IRS cells showed a similar insulin concentration-dependent response of egr-1 and c-fos expression; the response reached close to the maximum at a concentration of 1 nM. These results indicate that both 32D/IR and 32D/IR+IRS cells have a similar sensitivity to insulin, i.e. IRS-1 does not contribute to immediate-early gene expression. To determine the pathways by which insulin induces immediate-early gene expression, we examined the effect of insulin on the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade in 32D/IR or 32D/IR+IRS cells by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis, both with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, insulin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including the insulin receptor β-subunit (95 kDa), IRS-1 (180 kDa), and Shc (52 kDa), in 32D/IR+IRS cells. In contrast, in 32D/IR cells, insulin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins, the insulin receptor β-subunit and 52-kDa Shc. We confirmed that the 95- and 52-kDa phosphoproteins were the insulin receptor β-subunit and Shc, respectively, by stripping the membrane and reblotting with specific antibodies. Neither the insulin receptor nor Shc was phosphorylated in 32D/IRS cells (data not shown). Interestingly, phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was less and slower in 32D/IR cells, although they have equal or greater numbers of the insulin receptor as determined by binding studies (data not shown). These data suggest that Shc phosphorylation is independent of IRS-1 phosphorylation and that Shc seems to be the only detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate of the insulin receptor in 32D/IR cells. In 32D/IR+IRS cells, IRS-1 contributes to a phosphorylation cascade, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of several additional substrates. We next examined the effect of insulin on Shc phosphorylation and Shc-GRB-2 association. 32D/IR or 32D/IR+IRS cells were incubated with or without 100 nM insulin for 5 min at 37°C. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody or anti-GRB-2 antibody, followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against Shc, GRB-2, or phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 4, Shc expression levels were similar in 32D/IR and 32D/IR+IRS cells. In this cell line, we could not detect other forms of Shc (66 and 46 kDa). Insulin treatment caused tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in both cell types, but the amount of phosphorylated Shc was greater in 32D/IR cells, which is consistent with Fig. 3. When the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GRB-2 antibody, GRB-2 expression levels were similar in both cell types. In 32D/IR+IRS cells, GRB-2 associated with both IRS-1 and Shc, whereas Shc is the only protein that was associated with GRB-2 in 32D/IR cells. GRB-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies against phosphotyrosine or Shc in the lysates from both 32D/IR and 32D/IR+IRS cells when the cells were treated with insulin (data not shown). These results suggest that the insulin receptor, but not IRS-1, is necessary for phosphorylation of Shc and association of Shc with GRB-2. This phosphorylation and association with GRB-2 may be responsible for the pathway that results in insulin-induced immediate-early gene expression. Last, to determine the downstream pathways involved in insulin-induced immediate-early gene expression, we examined the effect of wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, or PD 98059, a MEK inhibitor, on egr-1 and c-fos expression. 32D/IR or 32D/IR+IRS cells were preincubated with no addition or with 25 nM wortmannin or 30 μM PD 98059 for 15-30 min; then 17 nM insulin was added, and the cells were further incubated for 45 min at 37°C. Total RNA was extracted for Northern blot analysis with α-32P-labeled cDNA probes for egr-1, c-fos, and α-tubulin. The quantitative data were expressed as a percentage of maximum stimulation in samples with no inhibitor. α-Tubulin mRNA levels were not affected by either insulin or inhibitors (data not shown). 25 nM wortmannin had no inhibitory effect on insulin-induced egr-1 expression as shown in Fig. 5. Even with 100 nM wortmannin, egr-1 expression was not inhibited, but actually slightly increased in 32D/IR+IRS cells (data not shown). In contrast, PD 98059 almost completely inhibited insulin-induced egr-1 expression (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with c-fos expression (data not shown). These results suggest that MEK and MAP kinase activation, but not PI 3-kinase activation, is involved in insulin-induced immediate-early gene expression. The insulin signaling network is complex and involves molecules that regulate each other. Adding to the complexity are the observations that different cell types may have different and cell-specific concentrations of these signaling molecules. Recently, several studies have shown that IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation, but not p21ras or MAP kinase activation, are necessary for insulin's metabolic effects, such as glucose transporter GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14Gould G.W.

In contrast, p21ras or MAP kinase activation seems to be related to insulin's mitogenic effects (19Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 20Jhun B.H. Meinkoth J.L. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5699-5704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that insulin-induced immediate-early gene egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression requires insulin receptor phosphorylation, Shc phosphorylation, Shc-GRB-2 association, and MAP kinase activation. These effects appear to be independent of IRS-1 phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activation. Previous studies with 32D cells showed that insulin receptors alone are sufficient to mediate insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and activation of p21ras and MAP kinase (12Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.-M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the insulin receptor, Shc-GRB-2-SOS, p21ras, MEK, and MAP kinase constitute the pathway that leads to insulin-induced immediate-early gene expression. Others have shown that insulin-induced mitogenesis, measured by thymidine incorporation, requires IRS-1 phosphorylation (11Wang L.-M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 21Yenush L. Fernandez R. Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. Schlessinger J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that an IRS-1 pathway is necessary for complete mitogenesis, which requires many other events, such as translation and activation of transcription factors. The mechanisms involved in translation are not completely understood. In one of the best characterized systems, phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E and its binding protein, PHAS-I (phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein), correlates with an increase in the rate of protein synthesis under a variety of in vivo conditions including stimulation by insulin. Recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E and PHAS-I requires IRS-1-mediated stimulation of PI 3-kinase and p70S6K (18Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Mendes P. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Regulation of PHAS-I seems to be independent of MAP kinase activation or SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (18Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Mendes P. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results suggest that insulin utilizes different pathways depending on the different actions of insulin. Induction of immediate-early genes, one of the earliest steps for mitogenesis, requires Shc and MAP kinase activation, whereas PI 3-kinase and p70S6K are necessary in protein synthesis. Interestingly, we saw more Shc phosphorylation in 32D/IR cells than in 32D/IR+IRS cells, although phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit was less in the former. These results suggest that Shc and IRS-1 may compete for the binding site on the insulin receptor. This speculation is supported by the data obtained with a yeast two-hybrid system showing that both IRS-1 and Shc bind to the same region of the insulin receptor β-subunit (23He W. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23258-23262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, less insulin receptor is available for Shc to bind to in the cells overexpressing IRS-1. Another possibility is that an IRS-1 pathway and a Shc pathway may negatively regulate each other. A recent study demonstrated that constitutively active MEK (MAP kinase kinase) inhibited GLUT4 translocation by negative regulation of PI 3-kinase, 2E. Van Obberghen, unpublished data. suggesting that a MAP kinase pathway and a PI 3-kinase pathway negatively regulate each other. These interactions appear to be important for regulation of cell-specific insulin action. Our data showing that inhibition of PI 3-kinase in 32D/IR+IRS cells actually increased egr-1 expression are consistent with these findings. Finally, the results with 32D cells demonstrated in this study are different from our previous report with CHO cells, which demonstrated that insulin-induced egr-1, but not c-fos, mRNA expression was independent of phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or IRS-1 (10Harada S. Smith R.M. Smith J.A. Shah N. Hu D.-Q. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26632-26638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reason may be because each cell type utilizes different and cell-specific signaling mechanisms. We saw an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of 120-kDa proteins in CHO cells, whereas phosphorylation of these 120-kDa proteins was not regulated by insulin in 32D cells. Alternatively, CHO cells, even CHONEO cells, have considerable amounts of insulin receptor or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor compared with 32D cells. So even though we could not detect receptor or IRS-1 phosphorylation, we cannot rule out the possibility that the downstream substrate may be more sensitive, and minute phosphorylation of the receptor may be enough to conduct insulin signaling. In summary, we demonstrated that insulin induced egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression in a similar manner in 32D/IR cells and 32D/IR+IRS cells, but not in 32D cells or 32D/IRS cells. The signaling mechanisms involved seem to be insulin receptor phosphorylation, Shc phosphorylation, Shc-GRB-2 association, and MAP kinase activation. IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation were not involved in the pathway. These results clearly separate and identify the signaling mechanism for one of the many actions of insulin. Whether or not each cell type has different and cell-specific pathways and how to regulate this complicated insulin network will require further study. We thank Dr. Alan R. Saltiel for providing PD 98059."

https://openalex.org/W1984478455,"To test whether glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked T-cadherin is a component of cell junctions like classical cadherins, we have examined its distribution and targeting in polarized epithelial cells. In vivo, T-cadherin was detected on the apical cell surface of the chick intestinal epithelium. In cultures of transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, T-cadherin was also expressed apically, whereas classical N-cadherin resided basolaterally. Both cadherins were directly targeted to their respective membrane domains. Mutant proteins were expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells to identify the regions responsible for differential cadherin localization. NΔcyt, an N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant, was stably distributed basolaterally. This mutant was transported to both the apical and basolateral membrane compartments, followed by preferential removal from the apical surface. T-NΔcyt, a T-cadherin mutant with the N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain deletion, was localized basolaterally, whereas N-TGPI, a GPI-anchored N-cadherin mutant, resided at the apical domain. The T-cadherin carboxyl-terminal 76 amino acids contain the apical targeting signal and include the signal for GPI anchor attachment. Basolateral localization of N-cadherin is achieved through targeting signals in the cytoplasmic domain. Thus, GPI-linked T-cadherin is not a component of cell junctions, consistent with a function as a recognition rather than a cell adhesion molecule.

This mutant was transported to both the apical and basolateral membrane compartments, followed by preferential removal from the apical surface. T-NΔcyt, a T-cadherin mutant with the N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain deletion, was localized basolaterally, whereas N-TGPI, a GPI-anchored N-cadherin mutant, resided at the apical domain. The T-cadherin carboxyl-terminal 76 amino acids contain the apical targeting signal and include the signal for GPI anchor attachment. Basolateral localization of N-cadherin is achieved through targeting signals in the cytoplasmic domain. Thus, GPI-linked T-cadherin is not a component of cell junctions, consistent with a function as a recognition rather than a cell adhesion molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2075497267,"CYP2C12 is a steroid hydroxylase cytochrome P450 whose female-specific expression in adult rat liver is transcriptionally activated by the continuous plasma growth hormone (GH) profile characteristic of adult female rats. DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift analysis of the 5′-flank of the CYP2C12 gene were carried out to identify cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that may contribute to the GH-regulated, sex-dependent transcription of this P450 gene. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed sex- and GH-regulated DNase I hypersensitivity sites at the boundaries of several protein binding sites detected along a 1560-nucleotide upstream segment of CYP2C12. Five distinct sites bound a novel continuous GH-regulated nuclear factor, GHNF, which is enriched in adult female and continuous GH-treated male liver nuclear extracts compared to untreated male liver nuclear extracts. Two other footprinted sites correspond to binding sites for the liver transcription factors C/EBP and albumin D element-binding protein and a third to an HNF1 binding site. A specific binding site for GHNF was also found in the 5′-proximal promoter of CYP2C11, an adult male-specific liver P450 gene, suggesting that GHNF may contribute to the down-regulation of that gene by continuous GH. GHNF was distinguished from the nuclear factors that bind to a GH response element upstream of the rat Spi 2.1 gene and is also distinct from the GH-activatable latent cytoplasmic transcription factors STAT 1, STAT 3, and STAT 5. These findings support the hypothesis that continuous GH-activated transcription of CYP2C12 in adult female rat liver (a) involves the activation of a novel GH-regulated nuclear factor which binds to multiple sites along the 5′-flank of this cytochrome P450 gene, and (b) proceeds via a signaling pathway distinct from the GH pulse-activated STAT5 pathway proposed to induce CYP2C11 and other male-expressed liver genes.

Steroid hormones are metabolized by liver P450 enzymes with a higher degree of regio- and stereoselectivity than many foreign compound substrates (1Waxman D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), suggesting that these endogenous lipophiles serve as physiological P450 substrates. The physiological requirements with respect to liver steroid hormone hydroxylation differ between the sexes, and, accordingly, several steroid hydroxylase liver P450s belonging to gene families CYP2 and CYP3 (2Nelson D.R.

CYP2C11, the major male-specific androgen 16α- and 2α-hydroxylase in adult rat liver, is induced at puberty in males but not females (4Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Corresponding patterns of sex-dependent liver gene expression have also been reported for several mouse liver steroid hydroxylase P450s (13Noshiro M. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar).The imprinting effect of neonatal androgen on the expression of these liver-specific steroid hydroxylase P450 genes is mediated by the hypothalamus and its regulation of pituitary GH secretory patterns (17Jansson J.-O. Ekberg S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Three distinct responses of liver P450s to plasma GH profiles can be discerned (18Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1055-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar): (a) continuous plasma GH, a characteristic of adult female rats, stimulates expression of female-specific liver enzymes, such as CYP2C12; (b) intermittent plasma GH pulsation, associated with adult male rats, induces the expression of male-specific liver enzymes, such as CYP2C11; and (c) continuous GH markedly suppresses liver expression of the male-specific P450s. The underlying mechanisms whereby GH regulates expression of these sex-dependent liver P450s are only partially understood. Continuous GH can act directly on the hepatocyte to regulate liver P450 expression, but in a manner that cannot be mimicked by insulin-like growth factor I (19Guzelian P.S. Li D. Schuetz E.G. Thomas P. Levin W. Mode A. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9783-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a mediator of GH's effects on extrahepatic tissues. Discrimination by the hepatocyte between male and female plasma GH profiles is likely to occur at the cell surface and may involve the activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways by a chronic (female) as compared to an intermittent (male) pattern of plasma GH stimulation. This hypothesis is supported by the recent demonstration that intermittent, but not continuous, plasma GH activates the latent cytoplasmic transcription factor liver STAT 5 by a mechanism that involves both Jak2 kinase-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation and serine or threonine phosphorylation followed by nuclear translocation of the STAT protein (20Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). GH pulse frequency is the most critical determinant for intermittent GH stimulation of male liver P450 expression, which is characterized by a requirement for a well-defined minimum recovery period that is not met in the case of female rat hepatocytes exposed to GH continuously (22Waxman D.J. Pampori N.A. Ram P.A. Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This recovery period may serve to reset the Jak2/STAT 5 intracellular signaling apparatus, or perhaps may provide time needed for replenishment of cell surface GH receptors following GH pulse-induced receptor internalization.GH regulates steroid hydroxylase P450 expression at a pretranslational level (18Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1055-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with a requirement for ongoing protein synthesis in the case of 2C12 mRNA (23Tollet P. Enberg B. Mode A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Unprocessed nuclear 2C12 heterogeneous nuclear RNA responds to circulating GH profiles in a manner that is indistinguishable from the corresponding mature, cytoplasmic mRNA (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, transport of 2C12 mRNA to the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic 2C12 mRNA stability are unlikely to be important control points for GH-regulated P450 expression. Nuclear run-on transcription analyses have further established that GH regulates the sex-specific expression of CYP2C12, as well as CYP2C11, at the level of gene transcription initiation (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Legraverend C. Mode A. Westin S. Strom A. Eguchi H. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies of other CYP2C genes have identified promoter elements involved in basal or liver-specific gene expression (26Yoshioka H. Lang M. Wong G. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14612-14617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Venepally P. Chen D. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17333-17338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yano M.

Attempts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response of CYP2C12 to continuous GH, including promoter analysis to identify continuous GH-response elements and their cognate binding factors, have been greatly hampered by the absence of a suitable stable cultured cell model that responds to the pattern-dependent effects of GH, and by the unresponsiveness of in vitro transcription systems to the sex-dependent regulation that is evident in vivo (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary in vitro investigation of the CYP2C12 gene has suggested that 2C12's 5′-flanking DNA may interact with nuclear factors which are differentially expressed in male versus female rat liver in a GH-regulated manner (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhao S. Waxman D.J. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 1250Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify a novel GH-regulated nuclear factor (GHNF) that is present in female but not male rat liver and binds to multiple sites along the CYP2C12 promoter. In contrast to the GH pulse-responsive STAT proteins (20Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), GHNF is shown to be activated by continuous plasma GH, thus establishing the occurrence in hepatocytes of multiple GH plasma pattern-responsive nuclear signaling factors.DISCUSSIONThe present study was carried out to identify specific binding sites for liver-enriched transcription factors, as well as binding sites for GH-regulated liver nuclear factors that may contribute to regulated expression of CYP2C12. Eight specific regions that are footprinted by rat liver nuclear proteins were identified in the 5′-1.5 kilobase DNA of the CYP2C12 gene, and three of these regions were shown to bind well-characterized liver-enriched transcription factors in binding site competition and gel supershift experiments (site A1, factor HNF1, and sites B and D, factors DBP and C/EBP). Five other regions of the 2C12 5′-flank (regions C, C4, E, F, and H) were shown to bind nuclear factor(s) that are highly enriched in female as compared to male rat liver nuclei. Continuous GH treatment of adult male rats feminized the pattern of liver nuclear DNA binding activity to each of these latter 2C12 promoter elements, just as this same hormone treatment stimulates 2C12 gene expression in vivo (3Waxman D.J. Chang T.K.H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 391-417Crossref Google Scholar). Competition experiments demonstrated that the same, or a closely related, female-dominant liver nuclear factor, designated GHNF, binds to all five CYP2C12 DNA sites. Furthermore, although GHNF activity was low or undetectable in adult male liver nuclei, it was readily detectable in liver nuclei from immature male and immature female rats, which both express CYP2C12 at a low level (6Waxman D.J. Dannan G.A. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Together, these findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that one or more of the corresponding 2C12 DNA-binding regions serves as an important site for continuous GH activation of 2C12 gene expression and that GHNF may be an important mediator of this hormonal stimulatory effect in vivo.GHNF was distinguished from the GH-regulated nuclear factor that binds to and regulates the GH-inducible rat liver Spi 2.1 gene (42LeCam A. Pages G. Auberger P. LeCam G. Leopold P. Benarous R. Glaichenhaus N. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as shown by the inability of a GH response element/binding site oligonucleotide derived from that gene (36Yoon J.B. Berry S.A. Seelig S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19947-19954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to compete for GHNF binding to the 2C12 promoter sites. Recently, the latent transcription factor STAT 5 was identified as a major liver factor which binds to the Spi 2.1 GH response element used in our competition studies (44Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, antibody to STAT 5 did not supershift GHNF-containing complexes formed on 2C12 promoter fragments under conditions where a strong supershift was obtained with a bona fide STAT 5 complex formed by male liver nuclear extract on the rat β-casein promoter (see Ref. 21Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). STAT 5 is activated in adult male but not female rat liver by intermittent GH pulses (20Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and it likely contributes to the male-specific expression of liver P450 genes, such as CYP2C11, which are activated by GH pulsation (20Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 39Subramanian A. Teixeira J. Wang J. Gil G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4672-4682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other STAT proteins, STAT 1 and STAT 3, also are activated by GH in rat liver (21Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 45Gronowski A.M. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Thomas M.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 171-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Campbell G.S. Meyer D.J. Raz R. Levy D.E. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3974-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), albeit with a dependence on GH dose and plasma profile that is distinct from that of STAT 5 (21Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, neither of these STATs is a component of GHNF, as demonstrated by gel mobility supershift studies. GHNF was also distinguished from 20 other well-characterized transcription factors, including 5 liver-enriched factors, by gel mobility shift competition experiments. GHNF is thus a novel, GH-activated nuclear factor that is distinct from many other general and GH-responsive factors. Our attempts to further characterize GHNF with respect to definition of its core target DNA sequence were hampered by the apparent absence of a readily identifiable core consensus sequence that is shared by the six GHNF sites identified in the present study (five in CYP2C12 and one in CYP2C11) and by the loss of GHNF activity that we encountered when GHNF binding sites shorter than 43-47 nt were used as DNA probes in gel shift analysis. These findings, together with our observation that GHNF migrates as a large, somewhat diffuse complex in gel shift studies, suggest that GHNF may correspond to a large protein complex that makes multiple DNA contacts over an extended region. Further study will be required to identify the constituent components of GHNF and to elucidate the mechanisms whereby it is activated in female rat liver in response to continuous plasma GH stimulation.Analysis of the 5′-flank of CYP2C11 led to our discovery of a GHNF binding site, located at 2C11 nt −135 to −85 in this male-expressed P450 gene. Although the male-specific expression of 2C11 is primarily regulated through the positive effects of GH pulses, continuous GH suppression in adult female rats is also likely to be an important control mechanism, as indicated by the basal expression of 2C11 in female rat liver that first becomes detectable following hypophysectomy, and by the complete suppression of 2C11 mRNA levels that follows continuous GH treatment of these rats (47Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Notani G. LeBlanc G.A. Alberta J.A. Morrissey J.J. Sundseth S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the binding of GHNF to 2C11 nt −135 to −85 detected in the present study (Fig. 8) may serve as a mechanism for shutting off CYP2C11 gene transcription in female rats. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that a corresponding DNA element has the capacity to suppress expression of a heterologous promoter when transfected into primary hepatocytes (29Strom A. Eguchi H. Mode A. Legraverend C. Tollet P. Stromstedt P.E. Gustafsson J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 805-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Continuous GH treatment in vivo stimulated liver nuclear GHNF activity, indicating that this nuclear factor is either induced by GH de novo or that continuous GH activates pre-existing GHNF protein by phosphorylation or perhaps by some other signaling mechanism. GHNF activity is greatly enriched in female as compared to male liver nuclei, indicating that the GH-dependent signaling pathway which leads to GHNF activation can readily discriminate between continuous and intermittent plasma GH profiles. Since, as noted above, GHNF does not contain any of the STAT factors that are presently known to respond to GH in rat liver, GHNF activation may proceed independent of the GH-activated Jak/STAT pathway, which in male rats leads to intermittent activation of liver STAT 5 coincident with a GH pulse (20Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to ascertain whether GHNF requires tyrosine phosphorylation for DNA binding activity, as do the GH-activated STAT proteins. The precise mechanisms for GHNF activation in response to continuous, but not intermittent, GH are still undefined, but could involve GH-stimulated Ca2+ signaling mechanisms, which may proceed independent of Jak2 kinase (48Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P. Allevato G. Ilondo M. Nielsen J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or perhaps a phospholipase A2-dependent signaling pathway such as the one that may facilitate GH-stimulated expression of 2C12 in rat hepatocytes (49Tollet P. Hamberg M. Gustafsson J.A. Mode A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12569-12577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In addition to binding sites for GHNF, the CYP2C12 promoter was shown to contain multiple binding sites for the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF-1 and C/EBP, DBP. Presumably, one or more of these sites contributes to the liver specificity that characterizes CYP2C12 gene expression. HNF-1 plays a role in liver-specific expression and postnatal developmental activation of CYP2E1 (50Liu S.Y. Gonzalez F.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). C/EBP and/or DBP have been shown to contribute to the expression of multiple liver-expressed P450s, including 2C6 (28Yano M. Falvey E. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2847-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), 2D6 (51Lee Y.H. Yano M. Liu S.Y. Matsunaga E. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Although no significant sex differences in C/EBP-DBP binding to 2C12 sites B and D were detected in the present study, these sites, as well as a C/EBP-DBP-like site adjacent to site H, could still contribute to the GH-regulated expression of this P450 gene, as suggested by the finding that GH can rapidly activate two isoforms of C/EBP in preadipocytes (54Clarkson R.W.E. Chen C.M. Harrison S. Wells C. Muscat G.E.O. Waters M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to clarify whether GH stimulates a comparable activation of C/EBP in liver and what role it might play in CYP2C12 gene expression.

Steroid hormones are metabolized by liver P450 enzymes with a higher degree of regio- and stereoselectivity than many foreign compound substrates (1Waxman D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), suggesting that these endogenous lipophiles serve as physiological P450 substrates. The physiological requirements with respect to liver steroid hormone hydroxylation differ between the sexes, and, accordingly, several steroid hydroxylase liver P450s belonging to gene families CYP2 and CYP3 (2Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W.

CYP2C11, the major male-specific androgen 16α- and 2α-hydroxylase in adult rat liver, is induced at puberty in males but not females (4Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The female-specific steroid sulfate 15β-hydroxylase CYP2C12 is induced at puberty in female rat liver (6Waxman D.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3915-3921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Corresponding patterns of sex-dependent liver gene expression have also been reported for several mouse liver steroid hydroxylase P450s (13Noshiro M. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15923-15927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Squires E.J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for several non-P450 liver enzymes (e.g. Refs. 15Srivastava P.K. Waxman D.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Jeffery S. Carter N.D. Clark R.G. Robinson I.C.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Jansson J.-O. Ekberg S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar).The imprinting effect of neonatal androgen on the expression of these liver-specific steroid hydroxylase P450 genes is mediated by the hypothalamus and its regulation of pituitary GH secretory patterns (17Jansson J.-O. Ekberg S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Three distinct responses of liver P450s to plasma GH profiles can be discerned (18Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1055-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar): (a) continuous plasma GH, a characteristic of adult female rats, stimulates expression of female-specific liver enzymes, such as CYP2C12; (b) intermittent plasma GH pulsation, associated with adult male rats, induces the expression of male-specific liver enzymes, such as CYP2C11; and (c) continuous GH markedly suppresses liver expression of the male-specific P450s. The underlying mechanisms whereby GH regulates expression of these sex-dependent liver P450s are only partially understood. Continuous GH can act directly on the hepatocyte to regulate liver P450 expression, but in a manner that cannot be mimicked by insulin-like growth factor I (19Guzelian P.S. Li D. Schuetz E.G. Thomas P. Levin W. Mode A. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9783-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a mediator of GH's effects on extrahepatic tissues. Discrimination by the hepatocyte between male and female plasma GH profiles is likely to occur at the cell surface and may involve the activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways by a chronic (female) as compared to an intermittent (male) pattern of plasma GH stimulation. This hypothesis is supported by the recent demonstration that intermittent, but not continuous, plasma GH activates the latent cytoplasmic transcription factor liver STAT 5 by a mechanism that involves both Jak2 kinase-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation and serine or threonine phosphorylation followed by nuclear translocation of the STAT protein (20Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). GH pulse frequency is the most critical determinant for intermittent GH stimulation of male liver P450 expression, which is characterized by a requirement for a well-defined minimum recovery period that is not met in the case of female rat hepatocytes exposed to GH continuously (22Waxman D.J. Pampori N.A. Ram P.A. Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This recovery period may serve to reset the Jak2/STAT 5 intracellular signaling apparatus, or perhaps may provide time needed for replenishment of cell surface GH receptors following GH pulse-induced receptor internalization.GH regulates steroid hydroxylase P450 expression at a pretranslational level (18Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1055-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with a requirement for ongoing protein synthesis in the case of 2C12 mRNA (23Tollet P. Enberg B. Mode A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Unprocessed nuclear 2C12 heterogeneous nuclear RNA responds to circulating GH profiles in a manner that is indistinguishable from the corresponding mature, cytoplasmic mRNA (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, transport of 2C12 mRNA to the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic 2C12 mRNA stability are unlikely to be important control points for GH-regulated P450 expression. Nuclear run-on transcription analyses have further established that GH regulates the sex-specific expression of CYP2C12, as well as CYP2C11, at the level of gene transcription initiation (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Legraverend C. Mode A. Westin S. Strom A. Eguchi H. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies of other CYP2C genes have identified promoter elements involved in basal or liver-specific gene expression (26Yoshioka H. Lang M. Wong G. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14612-14617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Venepally P. Chen D. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17333-17338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yano M.

Attempts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response of CYP2C12 to continuous GH, including promoter analysis to identify continuous GH-response elements and their cognate binding factors, have been greatly hampered by the absence of a suitable stable cultured cell model that responds to the pattern-dependent effects of GH, and by the unresponsiveness of in vitro transcription systems to the sex-dependent regulation that is evident in vivo (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary in vitro investigation of the CYP2C12 gene has suggested that 2C12's 5′-flanking DNA may interact with nuclear factors which are differentially expressed in male versus female rat liver in a GH-regulated manner (24Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhao S. Waxman D.J. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 1250Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify a novel GH-regulated nuclear factor (GHNF) that is present in female but not male rat liver and binds to multiple sites along the CYP2C12 promoter. In contrast to the GH pulse-responsive STAT proteins (20Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), GHNF is shown to be activated by continuous plasma GH, thus establishing the occurrence in hepatocytes of multiple GH plasma pattern-responsive nuclear signaling factors."
https://openalex.org/W2130354759,"The interaction of a mouse monoclonal antibody (4A6) and birch profilin, a structurally well conserved actin- and phosphoinositide-binding protein and cross-reactive allergen, was characterized. In contrast to serum IgE from allergic patients, which shows cross-reactivity with most plants, monoclonal antibody 4A6 selectively reacted with tree pollen profilins. Using synthetic overlapping peptides, a continuous hexapeptide epitope was identified. The exchange of a single amino acid (Gln-47 → Glu) within the epitope was found to abolish the binding of monoclonal antibody 4A6 to other plant profilins. The NMR analyses of the birch and the nonreactive timothy grass profilin peptides showed that the loss of binding was not due to major structural differences. Both peptides adopted extended conformations similar to that observed for the epitope in the x-ray crystal structure of the native birch profilin. Binding studies with peptides and birch profilin mutants generated by in vitro mutagenesis demonstrated that the change of Gln-47 to acidic amino acids (e.g. Glu or Asp) led to electrostatic repulsion of monoclonal antibody 4A6. In conclusion the molecular and structural analyses of the interaction of a monoclonal antibody with a continuous peptide epitope, recognized in a conformation similar to that displayed on the native protein, are presented.

INTRODUCTIONTo study the mode of the interaction of protein antigens with their antibodies, defined experimental systems are required. In those cases in which crystal structures of antibodies with their corresponding antigen have been determined, it was found that the epitopes (antigenic determinants) belonged to the discontinuous type of epitopes, i.e. several surface loops are involved in the interaction with the corresponding paratope (Amit et al., 2Amit A.G. Mariuzza R.A. Phillips S.E.V. Poljak R.J. Science. 1986; 233: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar; Sheriff et al., 44Sheriff S. Silverton E.W. Padlan E.A. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J.

In contrast, it has been proposed that epitopes on native proteins consist mainly of short sequence segments of about 6 amino acids that can be mimicked by utilizing synthetic peptides (Green et al., 22Green N. Alexander H. Olson A. Alexander S. Shinnick T.N. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was demonstrated that small peptides can elicit antibodies with sequence and structural requirements for binding antigens comparable to antibodies raised against the native protein (Geysen et al., 19Geysen H.M. Barteling S.J. Meloen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and that overlapping oligopeptides can be used for epitope analysis (Geysen et al., 20Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Tribbick G. Schoofs P.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Despite these data, the existence of epitopes consisting of small continuous sequence motifs in native proteins has been questioned with the argument that antibodies elicited against peptides might selectively react with denatured, unfolded proteins (Jemmerson and Blankenfeld, 25Jemmerson R. Blankenfeld R. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this context, we studied the interaction of a structurally well defined protein antigen with a monoclonal antibody. We used birch pollen profilin as a model (Valenta et al., 56Valenta R. Duchêne M. Pettenburger K. Sillaber C. Valent P. Bettelheim P. Breitenbach M. Rumpold H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. Science. 1991; 253: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Profilins are small (14-17 kDa) proteins found in all eukaryotic phyla that bind to actin and to polyphosphoinositol lipids, particularly to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and thus may represent a link between the cytoskeleton and signal transduction (Machesky and Pollard, 30Machesky L.M.

In addition all profilins bind to poly-L-proline (Tanaka and Shibata, 53Tanaka M. Shibata H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the first biologically relevant proline-rich ligand for profilin was identified (Reinhard et al., 37Reinhard M. Giehl K. Abel K. Haffner C. Jarchau T. Hoppe V. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).Profilins have also been described as potent allergens (Valenta et al., 56Valenta R. Duchêne M. Pettenburger K. Sillaber C.

Vial O. Deviller P. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1992; 22: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). IgE antibodies from profilin-allergic patients were shown to cross-react with profilins from different sources, which has led to the designation of profilins as “pan-allergens” (Valenta et al., 57Valenta R. Duchêne M. Ebner C. Valent P. Sillaber C. Deviller P. Ferreira F. Tejkl M. Edelmann H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In the present study we have analyzed the interaction of birch profilin with a specific mouse monoclonal antibody at the molecular and structural level.mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCDRcomplementary determining regionPCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered salineTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyROESYrotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy. 4A6 bound to a continuous hexapeptide epitope that, according to the comparison of the peptide NMR analysis and the crystal structure of birch profilin, formed a similar conformation as in the native protein. Gln-47 was determined as the crucial amino acid for the contact with mAb 4A6 using structural data, peptide variants, and protein mutants.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe interaction of birch pollen profilin and a specific mouse monoclonal antibody, designated 4A6, was investigated. Birch profilin (Valenta et al., 56Valenta R. Duchêne M. Pettenburger K. Sillaber C. Valent P. Bettelheim P. Breitenbach M. Rumpold H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. Science. 1991; 253: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar; 1992; 1993) was chosen as a model for antigen-antibody interactions for two reasons. First, although they display only modest sequence homology, profilins are structurally well conserved eukaryotic proteins, which may be due to their conserved function as actin-binding proteins (Almo et al., 1Almo S.C. Pollard T.D. Way M. Lattman E.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 950-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; Fedorov et al., 15Fedorov A.A. Pollard T.D. Almo S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed it could be shown that despite a low degree of sequence similarity, profilin and actin from different species could interact in vitro as well as in vivo (Valenta et al., 58Valenta R. Ferreira F. Grote M. Swoboda I. Vrtala S. Duchêne M. Deviller P. Meagher R.B. McKinney E. Heberle-Bors E. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Biol.

Additionally, profilins are potent allergens that induce cross-reactive IgE antibodies in about 20% of allergic patients (Valenta et al., 56Valenta R. Duchêne M. Pettenburger K. Sillaber C. Valent P. Bettelheim P. Breitenbach M. Rumpold H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. Science. 1991; 253: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar).mAb 4A6 consists of an IgG1 heavy chain and a κ light chain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 4A6 amino-terminal heavy chain fragment and its corresponding light chain are shown in Fig. 1. In the CDRs of the light chain two acidic amino acids were found, whereas in the CDRs of the heavy chain five acidic amino acids were observed. Despite a high degree of sequence identity of approximately 80% among profilins from higher plants, mAb 4A6 was able to discriminate between tree pollen profilins and other plant profilins (Fig. 2). The 4A6 epitope was mapped using synthetic dodecapeptides that spanned the deduced amino acid sequence of birch profilin by 10 amino acids of overlap. mAb 4A6 bound strongly to peptides (amino acids 38-49 and amino acids 40-51) of birch profilin, whereas peptides (amino acids 36-47 and amino acids 42-53) reacted more weakly. All peptides reacting with 4A6 shared the 6-amino acid sequence motif PQFKPQ. This sequence motif was compared with the relevant region in other plant profilins (Staiger et al., 48Staiger C.J.

The only consistent sequence difference between birch profilin and the other plant profilins was seen in the last position of the hexapeptide. Here, only birch profilin contained Gln-47 instead of Glu.Fig. 2Reactivity of mAb 4A6 and anti-plant profilin antisera with nitrocellulose-blotted profilins from different plant species. Protein extracts were prepared from pollens of different plant species, comprising dicotyledonic plants (birch, Betula verrucosa; alder, Alnus glutinosa; mugwort, Artemisia vulgaris; tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum) and monocotyledonic plants (timothy grass, Phleum pratense; maize, Zea mais; wheat, Triticum sativum), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose strips were then incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-birch profilin antibody (4A6), a mouse monoclonal antibody without specificity for profilins (mK), a rabbit antiserum raised against celery root profilin (RP1), a rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant birch profilin (RP2), a rabbit antiserum raised against the birch profilin carboxyl terminus (RP3), and a normal rabbit serum (nrs). Antibodies bound to profilin at 14 kDa were detected with a 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit antiserum, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The difference in binding of mAb 4A6 to different plant profilins was further investigated at the epitope level using peptides corresponding to the birch, timothy grass, and tobacco epitope. Peptides comprising 14 amino acids of the plant profilins were probed for binding to mAb 4A6 by dot blotting (Fig. 3). 4A6 did not bind to the timothy grass and tobacco peptides but reacted with the birch epitope peptides synthesized as 14-mer, 12-mer, and hexapeptide. The binding intensity decreased with the length of the peptides. Thus, as the minimal epitope for mAb 4A6, the birch hexapeptide PQFKPQ was identified, which differed from the other plant profilin peptides by a single amino acid (Gln-47 → Glu).Fig. 3Reactivity of mAb 4A6 with peptides from different plant profilins tested by dot blotting. In lane 1 peptides were tested with a monoclonal antibody without specificity for birch profilin, and in lane 2 mAb 4A6 was used. Approximately 100 ng of each peptide were dotted to the nitrocellulose in the order shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the affinity of recombinant birch profilin with a synthetic peptide epitope spanning amino acids 36-51, competitive ELISA studies were performed (Fig. 4). Purified recombinant birch profilin was coated to ELISA plates and probed with mAb 4A6 that was preincubated either with purified recombinant birch profilin or the synthetic birch profilin peptide BP36/51. The concentration for a 50% competition with recombinant birch profilin was determined to be 1.2 × 10−7M for recombinant birch profilin and 5 × 10−8M for the peptide BP36/51, when 50 ng of purified mAb 4A6 were used per well. Thus, the peptide BP36/51 displayed a slightly higher affinity for mAb 4A6 than the complete recombinant birch profilin.Fig. 4ELISA competition assay. ELISA plates were coated with 100 ng of recombinant birch profilin/well. Purified mAb 4A6 was allowed to bind to recombinant birch profilin using increasing concentrations (x axis) of recombinant birch profilin (∘) or peptide BP 36/51 (▴) as competitor for preincubation. The extinction is displayed as relative absorbance at 490 nm on the y axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hence, the 4A6 epitope represents a continuous epitope, a term coined for peptide epitopes consisting of short sequence motifs (Berzofsky, 6Berzofsky J.A. Science. 1985; 229: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although continuous epitopes have been reported for a number of antigens, and antibodies were described that bound with comparable affinity to a peptide epitope and the complete native protein (Navon et al., 35Navon A.

Smith-Gill S.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 553-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).Crystallographic analyses of antigen-antibody complexes of intact proteins demonstrated that binding predominantly involves conformational epitopes, which are assembled from multiple peptide segments separated in the primary sequence (reviewed in Braden and Poljak, 8Braden C.B. Poljak R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Such conformational epitopes have been described for other birch pollen allergens. A calcium-binding birch pollen allergen, Bet v 3, contained an epitope that was sensitive to depletion of calcium and denaturation (Seiberler et al., 43Seiberler S. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Lonsdale D. Valenta R. EMBO J. 1994; 15: 3481-3486Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). IgE epitopes of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 (Breiteneder et al., 9Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Bito A.

Vrtala, K. Hirtenlehner, L. Vangelista, A. Pastore, H.-G. Eichler, W. R. Sperr, P. Valent, C. Ebner, D. Kraft, and R. Valenta, submitted for publication.In order to obtain information whether the different binding of mAb 4A6 to the plant peptides might be due to conformational differences, the protein backbone conformations for the birch, maize, timothy grass, tobacco, and wheat peptides were calculated from the data base with the Boltzmann device (Sippl, 45Sippl M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 859-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), revealing a rather similar structure for the different peptides (data not shown). The prediction was confirmed by NMR analysis of the birch (SFPQFKPQEITG) and timothy (SFPQFKPEEITG) peptide. Both peptides showed extended conformation in solution (Fig. 5). The alignment of the ensemble of NMR structures calculated for the birch P3-Q8 peptide segment gave a consistent set of structures, whereas the timothy P3-E8 peptide segment displayed more variability, due to fewer and weaker nuclear Overhauser effects.Fig. 5Superimposition of the 10 best NMR structures of the QE (birch, left) and EE (timothy, right) peptides. The Cα traces, along with proline side chains, are shown for the residues corresponding to positions 42-47 of the birch profilin sequence. The structures were aligned to minimize the root mean squared deviations between the positions of equivalent backbone atoms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The x-ray structure of birch profilin, determined at 2.4-Å resolution,2 also showed that the 4A6 epitope adopted an extended conformation in the native birch profilin molecule. When the peptide was considered in the context of the folded protein (Table I) a significant burial of surface area is seen for only two amino acids. Pro-42 and Phe-44 have a large buried surface area due to extensive packing in the hydrophobic core of birch pollen profilin. In contrast, Gln-43, Lys-45, Pro-46, and Gln-47 are positioned at the surface of the folded molecule and are thus accessible to the solvent. Fig. 6 shows the superposition of the two peptide epitope structures as determined by NMR with the observed crystal structure for residues 42-47 from birch pollen profilin. Although the fits were not complete (root mean sequence of 1.38 and 1.6 Å on backbone atoms of the birch and timothy peptide, respectively), the extended conformation of both peptides suggested that they may readily conform to the appropriate conformation required for antibody binding.Table I.Solvent accessibility of the 4A6 epitope in the protein background and in isolationAmino acidAccessibility in intact proteinAccessibility in isolated peptideBuried surfaceaBuried surface area is calculated as the difference in calculated accessibility of residues in the isolated peptide and the peptide in the intact protein (i.e. accessible surface in isolated peptide − accessible surface area in protein).BuriedbPercent buried is calculated as (accessible surface in isolated peptide − accessible surface area in protein)/(accessible surface area in protein).Å2Å2Å2%Pro-424018114178Gln-431461763017Phe-442316814586Lys-451241755129Pro-46871253830Gln-471111766537a Buried surface area is calculated as the difference in calculated accessibility of residues in the isolated peptide and the peptide in the intact protein (i.e. accessible surface in isolated peptide − accessible surface area in protein).b Percent buried is calculated as (accessible surface in isolated peptide − accessible surface area in protein)/(accessible surface area in protein).

One possibility was that 4A6 binds to the epitope without requiring a significant change in the epitope conformation. In this model, Gln-43, Lys-45, Pro-46, and Gln-47 would make extensive contacts with the CDRs, whereas Pro-42 and Phe-44 would not contact the CDRs. A second model involves a conformational change of the epitope upon binding to 4A6 such that residues with low accessibility in the native protein would make significant contributions to the binding interface. However, if Phe-44 was involved in complex formation, it would have to leave the hydrophobic core of the protein. Considering the energetic cost of such a rearrangement, this possibility seemed unlikely.The comparison of the NMR structure of the birch peptide with the timothy peptide containing the Gln-47 → Glu exchange showed that both peptides have an extended conformation that could be superimposed to the 4A6 epitope deduced from the crystal structure of birch profilin. These data indicated that the lack of cross-reactivity of mAb 4A6 with other plant profilins was not due to a local conformational change of this epitope due to the Gln-47 → Glu exchange. Binding tests with mutant peptides (Fig. 7) demonstrated that a change of Phe-44 to Tyr-44 did not affect the 4A6 binding. Gln-47 could be exchanged to Asn-47 without altering 4A6 reactivity. However, the substitution of Gln-47 by acidic amino acids such as Glu-47 or Asp-47 abolished binding of 4A6 completely.Fig. 7Reactivity of mAb 4A6 with mutant birch profilin peptides. mAb 4A6 was tested with dot-blotted mutant peptides. The sequences and order of the peptides are displayed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The peptide binding data could be reproduced using recombinant birch profilin mutants (Fig. 8). Birch profilin mutants Phe-44 → Tyr and Gln-47 → Asn were bound by mAb 4A6, whereas the Gln-47 → Glu mutant was not recognized. A band of approximately 28 kDa observed in the Phe-44 → Tyr mutant preparation was recognized by the antibodies and therefore most likely represented a dimer. Antibodies with specificity for other epitopes (serum IgE from a birch profilin allergic individual or a rabbit antiserum raised against the birch profilin carboxyl terminus RP3) reacted with all three mutant proteins. In addition all birch profilin mutants could be purified by poly-L-proline affinity chromatography, indicating correct folding and functional activity of the molecules (Vrtala et al., 62Vrtala S. Wiedemann P. Mittermann I. Eichler H.G. Sperr W.R. Valent P. Kraft D. Valenta R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 8Reactivity of nitrocellulose-blotted recombinant birch profilin (wild type) and birch profilin mutants with antibodies. E. coli extracts containing approximately 1 μg/cm gel recombinant birch profilin wild type (P) and mutagenized birch profilins (clone 4, Phe-44 → Tyr; clone 25, Gln-47 → Glu; clone 35, Gln-47 → Asn) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Nitrocelluloses were probed with serum IgE from a profilin-allergic patient, mAb 4A6, and a rabbit anti-birch carboxyl terminus antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The binding experiments with peptides and birch profilin mutants together supported the first model of interaction, which involves Gln-43, Lys-45, Pro-46, and Gln-47 as direct contact sites of birch profilin with mAb 4A6. It is further assumed that changes of Gln-47 to structurally similar acidic amino acids such as Glu or Asp abolished binding, most likely as a consequence of electrostatic repulsion caused by acidic amino acid residues present in the CDRs of mAb 4A6. This hypothesis was corroborated by the fact that changes of Gln-47 to Asn, an amino acid of similar structure and functionality, did not abolish binding of mAb 4A6.In conclusion we have characterized a monoclonal antibody specific for a potent allergen that is an important component of the plant cytoskeleton. A continuous hexapeptide motif was identified as the minimal epitope and studied at the molecular and structural level. It was demonstrated that the natural immune response toward protein antigens can result in the production of peptide-directed antibodies that derive substantial binding energy from linear epitopes. These analyses may contribute to the general concepts on epitope-paratope interactions. INTRODUCTIONTo study the mode of the interaction of protein antigens with their antibodies, defined experimental systems are required. In those cases in which crystal structures of antibodies with their corresponding antigen have been determined, it was found that the epitopes (antigenic determinants) belonged to the discontinuous type of epitopes, i.e. several surface loops are involved in the interaction with the corresponding paratope (Amit et al., 2Amit A.G.

In contrast, it has been proposed that epitopes on native proteins consist mainly of short sequence segments of about 6 amino acids that can be mimicked by utilizing synthetic peptides (Green et al., 22Green N. Alexander H. Olson A. Alexander S. Shinnick T.N. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was demonstrated that small peptides can elicit antibodies with sequence and structural requirements for binding antigens comparable to antibodies raised against the native protein (Geysen et al., 19Geysen H.M. Barteling S.J. Meloen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and that overlapping oligopeptides can be used for epitope analysis (Geysen et al., 20Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Tribbick G. Schoofs P.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Despite these data, the existence of epitopes consisting of small continuous sequence motifs in native proteins has been questioned with the argument that antibodies elicited against peptides might selectively react with denatured, unfolded proteins (Jemmerson and Blankenfeld, 25Jemmerson R. Blankenfeld R. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this context, we studied the interaction of a structurally well defined protein antigen with a monoclonal antibody. We used birch pollen profilin as a model (Valenta et al., 56Valenta R. Duchêne M. Pettenburger K. Sillaber C. Valent P. Bettelheim P. Breitenbach M. Rumpold H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. Science. 1991; 253: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Profilins are small (14-17 kDa) proteins found in all eukaryotic phyla that bind to actin and to polyphosphoinositol lipids, particularly to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and thus may represent a link between the cytoskeleton and signal transduction (Machesky and Pollard, 30Machesky L.M.

IgE antibodies from profilin-allergic patients were shown to cross-react with profilins from different sources, which has led to the designation of profilins as “pan-allergens” (Valenta et al., 57Valenta R.

A fraction enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport vesicles (CV2, ρ = 1.158) was subjected to immunoisolation, and proteins of the bound and non-bound subfractions were analyzed by Western blotting. To our surprise, we found that immunoisolated vesicles contained not only ER markers (105-kDa form of the polymeric IgA receptor (pIgAR)) but also transcytotic markers (dIgA and the 120-kDa form of pIgAR), suggesting that Rab1a is associated with transcytotic vesicles in rat liver. To investigate this possibility, we used an antibody to the cytoplasmic domain of pIgAR to immunoisolate transcytotic vesicles from a fraction (CV1, ρ = 1.146) known to be enriched in these vesicles. Rab1a was detected in the immunoadsorbed subfractions. The composition of the vesicles immunoisolated from the CV1 fraction on anti-Rab1a was similar to that of transcytotic vesicles immunoisolated from the same fraction on pIgAR. Both were enriched in transcytotic markers and depleted in ER and Golgi markers. The main difference between the two was that those isolated on anti-Rab1a appeared to be enriched in postendosomal transcytotic vesicles, whereas those isolated on pIgAR contained both pre- and postendosomal elements. Analysis of anti-Rab1a isolated vesicles using [α-32P]GTP overlay demonstrated the presence of multiple GTP-binding proteins. Some of these were identified by immunoblotting as epithelia-specific Rab17 and ubiquitous Rabs1b, −2, and −6. Taken together, these results indicate that: 1) Rab1a is associated with both ER to Golgi and postendosomal transcytotic vesicles, and 2) multiple GTP-binding proteins are associated with each class of isolated vesicle.

Membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells is mediated by vesicular carriers, which bud from a donor compartment and are targeted to and fuse with the appropriate acceptor membrane. The Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins is known to play an important role in the control of these complex events (1Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev.

Although common transport pathways in most cells use ubiquitously expressed Rabs, highly differentiated cells with unique transport pathways may require specific Rab proteins. To date several tissue- or cell type-specific Rabs have been identified (23Darchen F. Zahraoui A. Hammel F. Monteils M.P. Tavitian A. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lehtonen E. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For example, Rab3a is preferentially expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neurons, where it is specifically associated with synaptic vesicles and appears to mediate neurotransmitter release (23Darchen F. Zahraoui A. Hammel F. Monteils M.P. Tavitian A. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5692-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Fischer von Mollard G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Rab3d is mainly expressed in adipocytes and pancreatic acinar cells and is thought to control regulated exocytosis of glucose transporter-containing vesicles and zymogen granules (25Baldini G.

Jamieson J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Rab17 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells, where it is localized at the basolateral PM and in apical endosomes and is assumed to be involved in regulation of transcytosis across epithelial cells (26Lutcke A. Jansson S. Parton R.G. Chavrier P. Valencia A. Huber L.A. Lehtonen E. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear whether one Rab or a set of Rabs are required for each transport step. Recent studies have localized more than one Rab in the same vesicular carriers and related intracellular compartments (28Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Killisch I. Lutcke A. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1249-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Murphy C. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Valencia A. Simons K. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3437-3448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that multiple Rabs may associate with vesicular carriers operating at the same relay. If multiple Rabs are present on a single class of transport vesicles, are the sets of Rabs relay-specific or is there overlap? To address these questions, isolation and characterization of distinct classes of homogeneous vesicular carriers and identification of their associated Rab proteins are required. An excellent system for studying this problem is the hepatocyte in which the major intracellular transport pathways (exocytosis, endocytosis, and transcytosis) are well characterized (30Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1582-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Bartles J.R. Hubbard A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, specific markers (different forms of the polymeric IgA receptor (pIgAR) and dimeric IgA (dIgA)) are available for vesicles operating along these pathways (32Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J.

In this study we have immunoisolated Rab1a-associated vesicles from rat liver fractions and, to our surprise, found that Rab1a is associated with vesicles involved in transport along both the exocytic and transcytotic pathways, leading us to postulate that transcytosis may be regulated through interactions between specific (Rab17) and ubiquitous Rabs (Rab1a and others). Sprague-Dawley rats (Bantin & Kingman, Fremont, CA), weighing 150-250 g, were used in these experiments. Magnetic beads (M500) were from Dynal Inc. (Lake Success, NY). S107 hybridoma cells were a gift from Dr. D. Bole (University of Michigan). Recombinant Rab1a and Rab1b proteins (15Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J.

Balch (Scripps Research Institute); recombinant Rab6 was kindly provided by Dr. B. Goud (Institut Pasteur). Affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies to Rab1a and Rab6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Affinity-purified antibody to the cytoplasmic tail of pIgAR was prepared as described (36Saucan L. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), affinity-purified anti-peptide antibody against Rab2 was generously provided by Dr. J.

Gill (University of California, San Diego), respectively. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies for BiP and rat dIgA were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. (Neshanic, NJ) and the Binding Site Inc. (Birmingham, United Kingdom), respectively. S107 hybridoma cells, which secrete dIgA, were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN) for 20 h at which time medium was collected, and dIgA was concentrated with a Centriprep 30 concentrator (Amicon) to 0.5 ml (1.5 × 109 cpm/ml) for use as a specific transcytotic vesicle marker. Asialofetuin was biotinylated using an immunoprobe biotinylation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation the biotinylated protein was passed though a Sephadex G-25 column to remove free biotinamidocaproate-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide, then concentrated with a Centriprep 10 to 4 mg/ml. The level of biotinylation was determined by the avidin-HABA assay provided in the kit. The molar ratio of biotin/asialofetuin was 1.5. Rat liver was labeled in vivo by injection through the portal vein. 2 mCi of Tran35S-label (to label ER to Golgi and intraGolgi transport vesicles) or 7.5 × 108 cpm dIgA (to label transcytotic vesicles) were injected into the portal vein 15 or 30 min before removing the livers. Similarly, 2 mg of biotinylated asialofetuin (B-AF, to label endosomes) was injected 6 min prior to removing the livers. The livers were flushed in situ with cold 0.25 M sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, all at 1 μg/ml), then removed and homogenized for subcellular fractionation. Liver homogenization and preparation of cytosol and total microsomal membranes were as described by Saucan and Palade (36Saucan L. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The procedure for preparation of Golgi and vesicular carrier-enriched fractions was modified from Sztul et al. (37Sztul E. Kaplin A. Saucan L. Palade G. Cell. 1991; 64: 81-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by adding one more layer of sucrose (1.18 M). Briefly, total microsomal membranes were adjusted to 1.24 M sucrose and loaded at the bottom of a 32-ml discontinuous sucrose gradient with 8 ml each of 1.18, 1.14, 0.86, and 0.25 M sucrose and centrifuged at 82,000 × g (25,000 rpm, SW28 rotor) for 3 h. Bands at the interface between 0.25 M/0.86 M and 0.86 M/1.14 M sucrose, which are enriched in Golgi elements, were collected and designated as Golgi light and Golgi heavy fractions (36Saucan L. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fractions 1.14 and 1.18 were defined as carrier vesicle fraction 1 and 2 (CV1 and CV2), respectively, and fraction 1.24 as the residual microsome fraction. The protein concentration of each fraction was determined by BCA assay (Bio-Rad). Magnetic beads (M500) as provided by the manufacturer are smooth-surfaced beads activated with p-toluene-sulfonyl chloride to provide reactive groups for coavalent binding of antibodies containing primary amino or sulfhydryl groups. Affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) (Biodesign, Kennebunk, ME) was bound to the beads by incubation of 10 μg/mg beads in 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 9.5, for 16-24 h at room temperature. The amount of bound IgG (usually 3-6 μg/mg beads) was assessed by measuring the A280 before and after incubation. The beads were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (anti-Rab1a or anti-pIgAR) in 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 16 h at 4°C and washed three times for 15 min each with 1% FCS in PBS (PBS/FCS) after each incubation. Fraction CV1 or CV2 was incubated with primary antibody-coated magnetic beads at 50-70 μg of protein/5 mg of beads in PBS/FCS for either 3 h or overnight. Beads with the bound subfractions were collected with a magnet (38Howell K.E. Gruenberg J. Ito A. Palade G.E. Morre D.J. Cell-free Analysis of Membrane Traffic. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1988: 77-90Google Scholar) and washed four times for 15 min each with PBS/FCS, 200 mM NaCl. Supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to pellet the membranes, which represent the non-bound subfractions. An equal aliquot (50-70 μg of protein) of starting material for immunoisolation was also centrifuged as above. All samples were resuspended in equal volumes of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled, and equal amounts were loaded onto gels. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 5-15% gradient gels, in order to determine the distribution of proteins in the bound versus the nonbound subfractions. For immunoprecipitation of 35S-pIgAR and 35S-dIgA from liver fractions, 0.5 ml (for pIgAR) or 0.5 mg of protein (for dIgA) of each fraction was lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate), and antibody for pIgAR (2 μl) or dIgA (1 μg/ml) was added. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. The amount of pIgAR and dIgA was normalized to the total volume and protein concentration, respectively. For immunoprecipitation of Rab1a and Rab6 from immunoisolated vesicles, bound subfractions were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Antibodies for Rab1a or Rab6 (1 μg/ml) were added, and the lysates were rocked for 2 h at 4°C. Antibody-antigen complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose. The supernatants depleted of Rab1a or Rab6 were then precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid at 4°C for 30 min. Samples were resuspended in equal volumes of SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as above. A combination of isoelectric focusing (IEF) and SDS-PAGE was used to resolve proteins in two dimensions as in Bollag and Edelstein (39Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 161-180Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, liver total microsomes or immunoisolated samples were solubilized in IEF sample buffer (8 M urea, 0.4% ampholyte pH 3-10, 2% ampholyte pH 5-7, 2% Triton X-100, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a slab IEF acrylamide gel consisting of 8 M urea, 0.4% ampholyte pH 3-10, 2% ampholyte pH 5-7. The samples were separated by isoelectric focusing (first dimension) in a minigel apparatus (Novex, X-Cell II) using 20 mM NaOH as the catholyte and 10 mM H3PO4 as the anolyte for 30 min at 150 V, 2 h at 200 V, and 2 h at 500 V. After separation the gel was removed and equilibrated in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol for 15-30 min. The gel strips were then cut and applied on the top of 10% SDS gels and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (second dimension) on a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus. After electrophoresis on either two-dimensional or one-dimensional gels, the separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with primary and then secondary antibodies in 1% FCS/PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h each, washed three times for 15 min each between each incubation, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) according to manufacturer's instructions. Radiolabeled dIgA was detected and quantitated on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. [α-32P]GTP overlay was modified from the procedure detailed by Nickel et al. (40Nickel W. Huber L.A. Kahn R.A. Kipper N. Barthel A. Fasshauer D. Söling H.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, PVDF membranes were soaked in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.3% Tween 20, 100 mM ATP twice for 15 min each, followed by incubation with [α-32P]GTP (DuPont NEN) in the same buffer at 1 μCi/ml for 2 h. The membranes were washed with the same buffer six times for 2 min each and air-dried. The bound [α-32P]GTP was detected by autoradiography (2 h to overnight exposure) on Kodak X-Omat film. For quantitation of the amount of Rab1a or Rab6 associated with immunoisolated vesicles, standard curves of recombinant Rab1a or Rab6 with 5- or 10-ng increments were made over a 10-100-ng range. Recombinant proteins and immunoisolation samples were loaded onto the same gels, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membranes were blotted with anti-Rab1 or anti-Rab6 followed by 50 μCi of 125I-protein A (DuPont NEN). The bound 125I-protein A was quantitated on a PhosphorImager, and a standard curve was plotted for each protein. The amount of Rab1a or Rab6 associated with the isolated subfractions was then determined from the standard curve. The numbers shown represent the averages of four gels for Rab1a and two for Rab6. For quantitation of the total protein bound to immunoadsorbents, starting material and non-bound subfractions were spun at 100,000 × g to remove the serum proteins added (as blocking agents) during immunoisolation. The membrane pellets were resuspended in PBS, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. The total protein bound to the beads was determined by subtracting non-bound from the starting material. The numbers were normalized to μg of protein/mg of beads (mean ± S.D., n = 3). Vesicles immunoisolated on magnetic beads were fixed, stained and sectioned as described previously (36Saucan L. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 41McCaffery M. Farquhar M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, beads were fixed for 45 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, followed by 1% OsO4 in the same buffer for 1 h. Samples were stained in block with 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were cut, stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Philips CM-10 electron microscope. Subcellular fractions obtained from rat liver total microsomes by flotation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient have been characterized previously (36Saucan L. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To obtain more enriched ER to Golgi and transcytotic vesicle fractions, we modified the fractionation procedure and separated the crude vesicular fraction into two carrier vesicle fractions, CV1 and CV2. Characterization of these fractions was carried out using pIgAR and dIgA as markers. dIgA is present only in transcytotic vesicles. pIgAR has three forms with different mobilities and locations (32Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J.

A. 1986; 83: 4759-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1): a 105-kDa ER form (endo H-sensitive), a 116-kDa fully glycosylated Golgi form (endo H-resistant), and a 120-kDa phosphorylated form, which is a marker for the transcytotic pathway (34Larkin J.M. Sztul E.S. Palade G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4759-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine the forms of pIgAR present in CV1 and CV2, Tran35S-label was injected into the portal vein, and 15 or 30 min later the liver was removed and processed for fractionation. After 15 min, ∼35% of the newly synthesized 105-kDa form of the pIgAR was found in the CV2 fraction and another 45% was associated with the residual microsomes, indicating that CV2 is enriched in ER to Golgi transport vesicles (Fig. 1, top panel). CV1 contains little (<8%) of the 105- or 116-kDa forms, suggesting that this fraction contains relatively few ER to Golgi and intraGolgi transport vesicles. The 120-kDa mature form is not seen at 15 min after injection of the label (37Sztul E. Kaplin A. Saucan L. Palade G. Cell. 1991; 64: 81-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, 30 min after injection >36% of the 120-kDa form of the receptor was found in CV1 (data not shown). Similarly, when 35S-dIgA was injected into the portal vein to label transcytotic vesicles of hepatocytes, most (∼54%) of the dIgA was recovered in the CV1 fraction at 30 min after injection and only 11% in CV2 (Fig. 1, middle panel). These results indicate that whereas CV2 is enriched in ER to Golgi transport vesicles, CV1 contains very few of these vesicles and is enriched in transcytotic vesicles. Contamination of CV1 and CV2 with other organelles has also been examined using protein disulfide isomerase (ER), α-mannosidase II (Golgi), and B-AF (endosomes) as markers. CV1 contains a small amount of the total protein disulfide isomerase and α-mannosidase II (1.5 and 11%, respectively) in the total microsomes and ∼30% of the total B-AF. By contrast, the percentages of the total of these three markers in CV2 are 40, 30, and 10%, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, CV1 and CV2 represent fractions highly enriched in transcytotic and ER to Golgi vesicular carriers, respectively, and because of this are appropriate as starting material for immunoisolation of the respective carriers. Rab1a has been localized by immunogold labeling to the membranes of clusters of vesicles located between the ER and the Golgi region of NRK cells (14Pind S.N. Nuoffer C. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H.

Since Rab1a is known to be associated with ER to Golgi transport vesicles, we decided to use it to isolate this population of vesicles. Rab1a is anchored to the membrane via geranylgeranyl moieties covalently attached at cysteine residues located at the carboxyl terminus (43Khosravi-Far R. Lutz R.J. Cox A.D. Conroy L. Bourne J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2058589367,"Function of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is regulated by agonist-generated signals interacting with its cytoplasmic tails. When αIIbβ3 is expressed in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes, stimulation of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results in αIIbβ3-mediated lymphocyte adherence to immobilized fibrinogen, as well as soluble fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, indicating that agonists increase the affinity of αIIbβ3 for fibrinogen in these cells. To address the contribution of the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic tails to this process, we mutated each tail and expressed the mutants in B lymphocytes. Truncation of the αIIb tail did not impair unstimulated or stimulated lymphocyte adherence to fibrinogen, regardless whether the truncation was proximal or distal to the conserved GFFKR sequence. However, deleting GFFKR or replacing it with alanines markedly reduced αIIbβ3 expression due to impaired intracellular assembly of αIIbβ3 heterodimers, probably due to a mutation-induced change in the conformation of αIIb. Introducing β3 mutations known to impair αIIbβ3 function in platelets into the cytoplasmic tail of β3 in lymphocytes also impaired αIIbβ3 function in these cells. These studies demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of αIIb is not required for αIIbβ3 function in lymphocytes, although the presence of GFFKR in the αIIb tail is required for αIIb to interact with β3.

https://openalex.org/W2092396836,"To investigate the relationship between the modulation of topoisomerase II activity and its phosphorylation state during the cell cycle, a monoclonal antibody against C-terminal peptide (residues 1335-1350) of topoisomerase IIα containing a consensus sequence of casein kinase II, TDDE and its phosphorylated threonine were prepared. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the antibody, named PT1342, recognized the immunogenic phosphopeptide but not the non-phosphorylated form of the peptide. The PT1342 antibody reacted only with a 170-kDa protein from HeLa cells and recognized anti-topoisomerase IIα immunoprecipitants. Furthermore, the antibody did not react with the human topoisomerase IIα mutated at codon 1342 from threonine to alanine, showing that PT1342 was directed against the phosphorylated threonine 1342. To examine the level of phosphorylation of threonine 1342 of topoisomerase IIα through the cell cycle, HeLa cells were stained simultaneously for phosphorylated topoisomerase IIα and DNA and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells in the G2-M phase contained about double the PT1341-reacted topoisomerase IIα than did cells in G1 or S phases. The antibody stained the nuclei in interphase and mitotic chromosomes and its periphery, as seen with anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody. Thus, threonine 1342 in topoisomerase IIα is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle. To investigate the relationship between the modulation of topoisomerase II activity and its phosphorylation state during the cell cycle, a monoclonal antibody against C-terminal peptide (residues 1335-1350) of topoisomerase IIα containing a consensus sequence of casein kinase II, TDDE and its phosphorylated threonine were prepared. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the antibody, named PT1342, recognized the immunogenic phosphopeptide but not the non-phosphorylated form of the peptide. The PT1342 antibody reacted only with a 170-kDa protein from HeLa cells and recognized anti-topoisomerase IIα immunoprecipitants. Furthermore, the antibody did not react with the human topoisomerase IIα mutated at codon 1342 from threonine to alanine, showing that PT1342 was directed against the phosphorylated threonine 1342. To examine the level of phosphorylation of threonine 1342 of topoisomerase IIα through the cell cycle, HeLa cells were stained simultaneously for phosphorylated topoisomerase IIα and DNA and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells in the G2-M phase contained about double the PT1341-reacted topoisomerase IIα than did cells in G1 or S phases. The antibody stained the nuclei in interphase and mitotic chromosomes and its periphery, as seen with anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody. Thus, threonine 1342 in topoisomerase IIα is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle. DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that play an important role in DNA replication and transcription by relieving torsional or interlocking constraints of DNA accumulating during processes of macromolecular syntheses (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 2Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 879-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 3Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Topoisomerases I and II relax supercoiled DNA through transient single- and double-strand breaks, respectively, and topoisomerase II unknots or decatenates the knotted or catenated DNA. The latter activity of topoisomerase II is presumably related to chromosome dynamics in mitosis, where topoisomerase II is absolutely required (4Dinardo S. Voelkel K. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 5Uemula T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition to catalytic activity, topoisomerase II may function to anchor chromosomal DNA loops to the nuclear scaffold (8Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 16-22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Earnshaw W.C. BioEssays. 1988; 9: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); topoisomerase II is a major non-histone protein present in nuclear scaffold fractions (10Earnshaw W.C. Halligan B. Cooke C.A. Heck M.M.S. Liu L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1706-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 11Gasser S.M. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de la Tour E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 613-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and DNA sequences that bind preferentially to the nuclear matrix/chromosomal scaffold (MAR/SAR) contain topoisomerase II cleavage consensus (12Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 511-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of topoisomerase II in the maintenance of chromosomes was not supported in studies done using Xenopus egg extracts or Xenopus embryos (13Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Fisher D. Hock R. Scheer U. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II has been considered as one of the targets for anticancer drugs (15D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as etoposide or 4′-(9-acridinylamino) methane sulfon-m-anisidide, stabilize a catalytic reaction intermediate termed “cleavable complex” in which the enzyme binds covalently to 5′-phosphoryl termini of broken DNA (15D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar). There are two known isoforms of topoisomerase II in mammalian cells, topoisomerase IIα and IIβ. They have molecular masses of 170 kDa and 180 kDa, respectively. These isoforms are mapped to different genes on chromosomes 17 and 3 (16Tan K.B. Dorman T.E. Falls K.M. Chung T.D.Y. Mirabelli C.K. Crooke S.T. Mao J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and have distinct susceptibility to various topoisomerase II inhibitors (17Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because topoisomerase II plays an important role in the cell cycle, especially in M phase, the activity of the enzyme may be regulated through the cell cycle. Indeed, topoisomerase II protein levels increase following cell proliferation and cell cycle progression from G1 to S and G2-M phase (18Duguet M. Lavenot C. Harper F. Mirambeau G. DeRecondo A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1059-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Heck M.M.S. Earnshaw W.C. J.

The phosphorylation of topoisomerase II also changes throughout the cell cycle, in parallel with level of the protein (21Estey E. Adlakha R.C. Hittelman W.N. Zwelling L.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4338-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Heck M.M.S. Hittelman W.N. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and sites of phosphorylation are similar but not identical throughout the cell cycle of budding yeast (24Cardenas M.E. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, topoisomerase II is phosphorylated at specific sites in G2-M phase; MPM-2 antibody (25Davis F.M. Tsao T.H. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), which recognizes phosphoprotein in G2-M phase, reacts with topoisomerase IIα and IIβ (26Taagepera S. Rao P.N. Drake F.H. Gorbsky G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Threonine residue of topoisomerase II are phosphorylated in mitosis but not in the other cell cycle phases (27Burden D.A. Goldsmith L.J. Sullivan D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, distinct sites of topoisomerase II are phosphorylated in interphase and in mitosis (28Burden D.A. Sullivan D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14651-14655Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II is phosphorylated in vitro by various protein kinases such as casein kinase II, protein kinase C, CDC2 kinase, and Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (29Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3164-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30Sahyoun N. Wolf M. Besterman J. Hsieh T.-S. Sander M. LeVine III, H. Chang K.-J.

Among these protein kinases, casein kinase II has been given much attention because the major in vivo phosphorylation sites of topoisomerase II correspond to those of casein kinase II in vitro in Drosophila and budding yeast (33Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12653-12660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V.C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and topoisomerase II was copurified with casein kinase II from budding yeast and from Drosophila (32Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sander M. Nolan J.M. Hsieh T.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 22920-22926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of topoisomerase II by casein kinase II increased Drosophila enzyme activity and reactivated the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme inactivated by alkaline phosphatase (29Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3164-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 32Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V.C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), although the fission yeast topoisomerase II was not inactivated by phosphatase (37Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When the mechanism by which phosphorylation of topoisomerase II stimulates the enzyme activity was examined, the increased catalytic activity of phosphorylated topoisomerase II was found to be due to enhanced ATP hydrolysis (38Corbett A.H. DeVore R.F. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20513-20518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of yeast topoisomerase II also enhances affinity of the enzyme for linear DNA (39Dang Q. Alghisi G.-C. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 10-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites of yeast topoisomerase II are concentrated at the C-terminal region, although some phosphorylation was noted in the N-terminal region of the enzyme (34Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V.C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because most catalytic functions of topoisomerase II occur in N-terminal and central regions, the significance of C-terminal phosphorylation, although not well understood, is speculated to remove the negative regulatory function of the C terminus (40Cardenas M.E. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of topoisomerase II also influences susceptibility of the enzyme to topoisomerase II inhibitors. One factor that stimulates topoisomerase II activity is a protein kinase; it enhances the 4′-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidide-induced DNA cleavage (41Darkin-Rattray S.J. Ralph R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

To closely examine the biological role of phosphorylation of topoisomerase II, we prepared an antibody against the C-terminal phosphopeptide of topoisomerase IIα. Using this specific antibody, we have shown that the threonine at 1342 was phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle. This is the first report that threonine 1342 in topoisomerase IIα is phosphorylated in vivo. HeLa S3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, penicillin (10 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. A peptide in human topoisomerase IIα, FSDFDEKTDDEDFVPC (T1342), and its phosphothreonine-containing peptide (PT1342), synthesized as described (43Wakamiya T. Saruta K. Kusumoto S. Nakajima K. Yoshizawa-Kumagaye K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kanegasaki S. Chem. Lett. 1993; 1993: 1401-1404Crossref Google Scholar), were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan. A phosphopeptide, PT1342, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanine (KLH), as described by Nishizawa et al. (44Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Saga S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3074-3079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody was prepared as described previously (45Yano T. Taura C. Shibata M. Hirono Y. Andoh S. Kusubata M. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 175: 1144-1151Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, PT1342-KLH emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. A booster of the PT1342-KLH emulsion was given to the mice at 2-week intervals. Three days after the final boost, the spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma cell SP2/0-Ag 14, using polyethylene glycol 4000. The hybridomas producing anti-PT1342 antibody were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in microtiter plates coated with PT1342. The cells from the positive wells were cloned twice to ensure monoclonality. In this manner, the hybridoma clone 3DA producing PT1342 antibody was developed. The hybridoma cell 3D4 was grown as ascites tumors in BALB/c mice primed with pristane. A homogeneous IgG fraction was prepared by applying ascites fluid on protein A-gel (Bio-Rad) and eluting it, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immediately after the elution, IgG protein was dialyzed against PBS. Topoisomerase II purified from HL60 cells or SDFPTEPPSLPRTGRARKE, a peptide in the C terminus of human topoisomerase IIβ conjugated with KLH, was injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice four times at 14-day intervals. Three days after the final boost, the splenocytes were fused with the myeloma line P3-X63Ag8,653. The culture medium were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The isolated clones, 4E12, 3H10, and 1H6, produced antibodies that specifically recognized topoisomerase IIα, IIβ, or both IIα and IIβ, respectively. The human topoisomerase IIα expression plasmid YEpWOB6 (46Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar) was altered at position A4024G by site-directed mutagenesis, using the Stratagene Chimera system, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The base change altered the codon 1342 from threonine to alanine. This plasmid was transformed into yeast, and protein expression was induced with galactose. Recombinant human topoisomerases IIα and IIβ proteins were overexpressed as described previously (47Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Wasserman R.A. Willmore E. Sayer P.J. Wang J.C. Fisher L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15739-15746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Exponential-phase HeLa S3 cells were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and lysed on ice for 1 h by resuspension in cold lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, 350 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mM Na2EDTA, and 50 mM NaF, pH 7.4] containing protease inhibitors (2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting after boiling for 5 min in 3 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Topoisomerase IIα was immunoprecipitated from whole-cell lysates, using 5 μl of anti-topoisomerase II antibody (4E12) per 50 μg of lysate protein. The lysate/antiserum mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Then 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors described above were added, and the mixture was shaken at 4°C for 30 min. Protein A-Sepharose-topoisomerase II complexes were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and washed three times with 500 μl of cold lysis buffer containing the protease inhibitors. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12.5% glycerol, 1.25% SDS, and 1.25% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, the resulting supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated with PT-1342 antibody for 1 h and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG serum (Amersham) for 1 h and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Corp.). Cells were incubated with various concentrations of VP-16 for 1 h, pelleted, and lysed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, sonicated, and then boiled for 5 min. The samples were electrophoresed, blotted, and detected by ECL as described above, except that anti-topoisomerase IIαβ was used as a first antibody. KB cells were lysed at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml and treated with 10 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase in a total of 20 μl of alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mM glycine, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2, pH 9.8). The reactions were run at 37°C for 30 min and halted by adding 6.67 μl of 8% SDS, 800 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 40% glycerol. The samples were then boiled, elctrophoresed in a 6% SDS-PAGE gel, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane as described above. Blots were detected by ECL. Topoisomerase II activity was measured as decatenation activity of kinetoplast DNA (Topo GEN, Inc.). The reaction mixture contained 10 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 120 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml BSA, 200 ng of kinetoplast DNA, and 2 units of human topoisomerase II (Topo GEN, Inc.). For the inhibition assay by antibody, topoisomerase II was pretreated with PT1342 antibody (1.25 mg/ml) for 1 h at 4°C and then further incubated for 20 min at 37°C after adding the reaction mixture. Reactions were halted with 1 μl of 1% SDS and 0.0025% bromphenol blue. Electrophoresis was done on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate-20 mM EDTA) for 60 min at 50 V. Ethidium bromide-stained gels were photographed. Fixation of cells and double staining of cells for DNA and phosphorylated topoisomerase II were done as described by Steven et al. (48Steven W.S. Daphne F.R. Andrew L.K. Robert T.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde at 4°C for 24 h. Fixed cells were pelleted and washed with PBS. The cells were suspended in permeabilization medium (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 4% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 15 min on ice. Four volumes of PBS were added to the suspension, and then the the cells were repelleted. The samples were stained for 3 h at room temperature with 200 μl of PBS containing RNase A (0.5 mg/ml), propidium iodide (PI, 10 μg/ml), and PT1342 antibody (1:1000). After washing the cell pellets with PBS, they were incubated for 20 min in PBS containing secondary antibody (1:1000 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG). The cells were washed and resuspended in PBS containing PI and then analyzed. After passing the cells through nylon mesh, flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). Reactions were carried out at room temperature unless stated otherwise. HeLa cells were cultured on glass coverslips, rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and then washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were treated with 1 mg/ml RNase in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS, and then treated with 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 10 min. The cells on coverslips were incubated overnight at 4°C with PT1342 antibody (1:1000), washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) (Kirkeggad & Perry Laboratories) for 1 h. After staining with PI (0.1 μg/ml) for 5 min, the samples were washed four times with PBS, mounted in a solution (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicycle[2.2.2]octane), and examined under a confocal microscope (Olympus, LSM-GB200). Topoisomerase II is a ubiquitous enzyme in pro- and eukaryotic cells and has conserved sequences in the N-terminal and in the central regions, while the sequences in the C-terminal region are diverged (49Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and Its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton1993: 207-214Google Scholar). The sites of phosphorylation of topoisomerase II are mostly located at C-terminal domain (34Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V.C. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo phosphorylation sites correspond well to those phosphorylated by casein kinase II. Thus, we focused a topoisomerase II peptide in the C-terminal domain containing the consensus recognition site for casein kinase II (TXXE) to examine the relation between modulation of topoisomerase II activity and its phosphorylation. In particular, we chose threonine 1342 as the phosphorylation site of the casein kinase II because we are interested in phosphorylation of topoisomerase II in M phase, and the threonine residue of the enzyme is phosphorylated only in M phase (27Burden D.A. Goldsmith L.J. Sullivan D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nuclear localization sequence is located near threonine 1342. The phosphopeptide corresponding to 1335-1350 in human topoisomerase II was synthesized. Threonine 1342 was phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II (data not shown). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the phosphopeptide were prepared and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using phosphopeptide or non-phosphopeptide as an antigen. The polyclonal antibody recognized not only the phosphopeptide but also the non-phosphopeptide. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1, the monoclonal antibody recognized only the phosphopeptide, not the non-phosphopeptide. The monoclonal antibody was named PT 1342. To determine whether the PT1342 antibody recognizes topoisomerase IIα, HeLa cell extracts were prepared, subjected to electrophoresis, electroblotted, and probed with the PT1342 antibody and the ECL Western blot detection system. The antibody recognized the 170-kDa protein, a size corresponding to topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 2a). To confirm that the 170-kDa protein recognized by PT1342 is topoisomerase IIα, the protein was first immunoprecipitated with anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitated materials were probed with anti-topoisomerase IIα and PT1342 antibody. Both antibodies recognized the anti-topoisomerase II immunoprecipitated protein as a single band of 170 kDa (Fig. 2b). The PT1342 antibody immunoprecipitated protein also reacted with anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody, yielding a band of 170 kDa (date not shown). On the contrary, PT1342 antibody did not recognize anti-topoisomerase IIβ immunoprecipitated protein (data not shown). Topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as VP-16 and 4′-(9-acridinylamino) methanesulfon-m-anisidide, stabilize a covalent DNA·topoisomerase II complex (50Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Since topoisomerase II in the complex is resistant to extraction with SDS from cell nuclei, the amount of the topoisomerase II interacting with the inhibitor can be detected by band depletion assay (51Zwelling L.A. Hinds M. Chan D. Mayes J. Sie K.L. Parker E. Silberman L. Radcliffe A. Beran M. Blick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16411-16420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the PT1342 antibody recognizes topoisomerase IIα, the amount of SDS-extracted protein recognized by the antibody will be reduced in VP-16-treated cells. HeLa cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of VP-16 for 1 h, and the SDS-extracted proteins were proved with PT1342 or anti-topoisomerase IIαβ. Both antibodies recognized the protein corresponding to 170 kDa and slightly lower molecules, which may be degradation products (Fig. 3). Anti-topoisomerase IIαβ also reacted with 180-kDa protein that is overlapped with 170 kDa in lane 5 but separated in lanes 6 and 7. The band recognized with PT1342 antibody was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that PT1342 antibody specifically recognizes topoisomerase IIα. We next asked whether the PT1342 antibody would recognize the phosphorylated sites of topoisomerase II. Crude extracts of HeLa cells were treated with an alkaline phosphatase, electrophoresed, and tested with PT1342 antibody. The 170-kDa band, detected in non-phosphatase-treated samples, disappeared after phosphatase treatment (data not shown).Fig. 3Band depletion assay. Cells were exposed to various concentrations of VP-16, a topoisomerase II inhibitor for 1 h. Lanes 1 and 5, no drug; lanes 2 and 6, 30 μM; lanes 3 and 7, 100 μM; lanes 4 and 8, 300 μM. The cells were dissolved in SDS solution, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The SDS-extractable proteins were immunoblotted with PT1342 antibody (lanes 1-4) or with anti-topoisomerase IIαβ antibody (lanes 5-8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further confirmation that PT1342 was directed against the phosphorylated threonine 1342 was provided by a mutant human topoisomerase IIα lacking threonine 1342, produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Western blotting of this mutant topoisomerase IIα, alongside recombinant human topoisomerase IIα, human topoisomerase IIβ, and a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein of the human topoisomerase IIα C-terminal domain (amino acids 1244-1531), 2C. A. Austin and L. M. Fisher, unpublished observations. confirmed that antibody PT1342 only recognized phosphorylated human topoisomerase IIα containing threonine 1342 (Fig. 4). Threonine 1342 is located at the C-terminal region of human topoisomerase IIα. This region is not involved in enzyme activity such as ATPase, DNA breakage, and rejoining (49Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and Its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton1993: 207-214Google Scholar); the site may be related to regulatory elements of enzyme activity (3Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 52Cardenas M.E. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PT1342 interacts with topoisomerase II, the effect of the antibody on HeLa topoisomerase II activity was examined using kinetoplast DNA as a substrate. The decatenating activity of the topoisomerase II was completely inhibited by PT1342 (Fig. 5). In mammalian cells, the amount and phosphorylation of topoisomerase IIα increases following cell cycle progression from G1 to S and M phases (19Heck M.M.S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2569-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 23Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Burden D.A. Goldsmith L.J. Sullivan D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To clarify whether phosphorylation of threonine 1342 changes during the cell cycle, cells were stained simultaneously with PT1342 antibody for topoisomerase IIα and with PI for DNA and examined using flow cytometry. Fig. 6 shows a bivariate distribution of cells stained for DNA and phosphorylated topoisomerase IIα. Because cells in G2-M are about one-half the numbers of those in G1 and S phase, cells in G2-M contain about double the phosphorylated topoisomerase IIα at threonine 1342. Topoisomerase IIα locates in the nuclei in interphase and associated mitotic chromosomes (53Earnshaw W.C. Heck M.M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 54Gasser S.M. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de La Tour E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 613-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). We examined the subcellular distribution of P-topoisomerase II, using the PT1342 antibody. As shown in Fig. 7, the antigen detected by PT1342 antibody locates in interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes and its periphery, thereby confirming that threonine 1342 in topoisomerase IIα is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle. We obtained evidence that PT1342 antibody recognizes phosphorylated threonine 1342 in topoisomerase IIα. The antibody-recognized protein is present in the nuclei of interphase and is associated with the mitotic chromosome, findings in agreement with the cellular distribution of topoisomerase IIα (53Earnshaw W.C. Heck M.M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 54Gasser S.M. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de La Tour E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 613-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of threonine-1342 in human topoisomerase IIα occurs throughout the cell cycle, albeit the extent of the phosphorylation is about twice that in G2-M phase as compared to G1 and S phases (Fig. 6). Threonine 1342 is located in the C-terminal region of topoisomerase IIα in a casein kinase II consensus sequence. The C-terminal domain of eukaryotic topoisomerase II is the least conserved, in contrast with the N-terminal domain, which has a highly conserved sequence. The region does not contain the catalytically functional regions, such as the ATP binding site, or the active tyrosine for DNA breakage and reunion (44Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Saga S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3074-3079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, transport of topoisomerase II into nuclei is reduced partially by C-terminal deletion (35Sander M. Nolan J.M. Hsieh T.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6938-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar results that the C-terminal domain is involved in nuclear transport functions were obtained by deletion analysis in Drosophila and S. cerevisiae (55Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21328-21334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Caron P.R. Watt P. Wang J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3197-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The region is also speculated to be related to dimerization or to the regulation of enzyme activity (49Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and Its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton1993: 207-214Google Scholar). Recently, Watt et al. (57Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.T. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) have found that a protein related to Escherichia coli RecQ protein interacts with the C-terminal domain of S. cerevisiae topoisomerase II in vivo (57Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.T. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, PT1342 antibody completely inhibited topoisomerase II activity; thus, it is most likely that the catalytically active sites and threonine 1342 are close in secondary structure and interact, even though they are separated in the primary structure. The biological role of casein kinase II is unclear, but it is known that it phosphorylates many growth-related proteins or transcription factors (58Meisner H. Crech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); For example, c-Myb, a transforming protein is phosphorylated by casein kinase II, and its phosphorylation inhibits DNA binding of Myb. v-Myb, which lacks the casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, binds to DNA with a high affinity. Mutation of Ser-132 in E1A to Gly inhibits the induction of DNA synthesis and transformation. Anti-oncogene p53 is also phosphorylated by casein kinase II. In addition, casein kinase II stimulates the rate of nuclear transport (59Rihs H-P Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Cdc2 kinase also activates casein kinase II (60Mulner-Lorillon O. Cormier P. Labbe J.-C. Doree M. Poulhe R. Osborne H. Belle R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using ICRF-193, a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase II, we clarified that this enzyme is essential for mitotic chromosome condensation, segregation, and decondensation but not for other biological events in the cell cycle (7Ishida R. Sato M. Narita T. Utsumi K.R. Nishimoto T. Morita T. Nagata H. Andoh T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 61Ishida R. Miki T. Narita T. Yui R. Sato M. Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 62Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This does not mean that topoisomerase II functions only in M phase. In yeast, deletion mutants in topoisomerase I can survive, but topoisomerases I and II double mutants have more severe defects related to cell growth compared with single topoisomerase II mutants, where DNA synthesis was completely inhibited in the former but was not inhibited in the latter (65Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, in mammalian cells, topoisomerase I presumably can complement the biological role of topoisomerase II in other cycles except M phase, and topoisomerase II is presumably involved in resolving torsional constraints accumulating in macromolecular synthesis in a cooperative manner with topoisomerase I. Because topoisomerase II is a sine qua non for mitotic chromosomal dynamics, the activity of the enzyme would be expected to increase in M phase. Indeed, topoisomerase II activity increases through the cell cycle from G1-S to G2-M (19Heck M.M.S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2569-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 21Estey E. Adlakha R.C. Hittelman W.N. Zwelling L.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4338-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Burden et al. (27Burden D.A. Goldsmith L.J. Sullivan D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that serine residues of topoisomerase II are phosphorylated in all phases of the cell cycle, whereas the threonine residue is phosphorylated only in the mitotic phase. The threonine phosphorylation of topoisomerase IIα in G2-M was also suggested with the use of the MPM2 antibody, which recognizes topoisomerase IIα and phosphothreonine (26Taagepera S. Rao P.N. Drake F.H. Gorbsky G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Threonine 1342 does not correspond to the mitotic-specific phosphothreonine, because the site is phosphorylated through the cell cycle. A possible candidate of threonine phosphorylated in M phase is threonine 949, which may be phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase. We are attempting to identify the threonine residue phosphorylated in M phase. In mammalian cells, two phosphorylation sites proved to be serine 1524 and serine 1376, and their neighboring amino acid sequence contained the casein kinase II consensus (66Wells N.J. Addison C.M. Fry A.M. Ganapathi R. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29746-29751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site of phosphorylation we identified is close to serine 1376. These clustered sites of phosphorylation render these regions negatively charged and may interact with basic regions of DNA or other proteins. Rihs et al. (67Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) reported that nuclear transport is enhanced by the site of casein kinase II phosphorylation. It is intriguing that the nuclear localization signal locates close to the clustered phosphorylation sites. We thank M. Ohara for comments on the manuscript and E. Jazrawi for the GST-fusion protein."

For example, the E3/19K protein inhibits the transport of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules to the cell surface and thereby prevents cell lysis by cytotoxic T cells. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) stimulates expression of MHC molecules on the cell surface of normal cells but not of E3+ cells, rather, a further reduction of MHC expression is evident. This was attributed to the increased expression of E3/19K upon TNF treatment, an effect also observed for other E3 proteins. We investigated the mechanism of the TNF-mediated up-regulation of E3 products. We show that TNF stimulates expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the E3 promoter. Mutation of individual transcription factor binding sites within the E3 promoter reveals the importance of the NF-κB binding site κ2 for TNF inducibility. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using antibodies directed against various members of the NF-κB family demonstrate that stimulation by TNF is mediated by the p50-p65 NF-κB complex.

A key role for regulating the interaction of the virus with its host and perhaps for viral persistence has been attributed to proteins encoded in the non-essential early transcription unit 3 (E3) of the virus (4Wold W.S.M.

Cell.

Both mechanisms may prolong survival of infected cells in vivo, allowing efficient virus reproduction in the face of an ongoing immune response. In support of this hypothesis, an Ad5 mutant with an E3/19K deletion shows a much stronger immunopathology in vivo than wild type viruses (13Ginsberg H.S. Lundholm-Beauchamp U. Horswood R.L.

Furthermore, E3 transgene products expressed in transplanted pancreas tissue seem to prevent tissue rejection, leading to prolonged survival of the allogeneic transplant (14Efrat S. Fejer G.

Efficient transcription of the E3 region as well as of the other early regions, E1B, E2, and E4, is dependent on expression of the immediate early gene product E1A which has a variety of functions (15Berk A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 45-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Akusjärvi G. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 130 base pairs immediately upstream of the E3 transcription start site are sufficient for both basal promoter activity and E1A induction of the E3 promoter in fibroblasts (17Leff T. Elkaim R. Goding C.R. Jalinot P. Sassone-Corsi P. Perricaudet M. Kedinger C. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4381-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Weeks D.L. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5389-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) revealed four protein binding sites within the E3 promoter, namely those for NF-1, ATF, and AP-1, and the TATA box (19Garcia J. Wu F. Gaynor R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8367-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1132-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); the latter three sites are located within the 130-base pair segment. AP-1 and ATF are both responsible for the E1A response and can individually confer E1A inducibility, AP-1 being more efficient in this process (21Buckbinder L. Miralles V.J. Reinberg D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4239-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Kornuc M. Kliewer S. Garcia J. Harrich D. Li C. Gaynor R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2004-2013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, E3 promoter activity analyzed in lymphoid cell lines lead to the identification of two additional binding sites located between the AP-1 and NF-1 sites (23Williams J.L. Garcia J. Harrich D. Pearson L. Wu F. Gaynor R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4435-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These two sites show homology to the NF-κB binding consensus (24Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar) and are necessary for full transcriptional activity in lymphoid cells. NF-κB is composed of two subunits and is present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to an inhibitory subunit termed IκB. Various stimuli lead to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. This allows the nuclear translocation of an active heterodimer which can bind DNA and activate transcription (for reviews, see Refs. 25Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar and 26Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The heterodimer is composed of a p50-like and a p65-like subunit. Two p50 homologues, p50 and p52, are distinguished whereas the second subunit can either be p65 (also called RelA), RelB, or c-Rel. We recently investigated the effect of TNF on cell surface expression of MHC molecules in E3+ fibroblasts. Unlike the stimulation of MHC expression in E3− cells, TNF treatment further reduced MHC expression on the cell surface of E3+ cells. Concomitantly, an increased expression of E3/19K (27Körner H. Fritzsche U. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as well as other E3 proteins was noted (28Deryckere F. Ebenau-Jehle C. Wold W.S.M. Burgert H.-G. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggested that TNF stimulates E3/19K expression and thereby reduces MHC antigen levels on the cell surface. TNF is an inflammatory cytokine, produced primarily by macrophages but also by T cells (for reviews, see Refs. 29Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 30Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors. Raven Press, New York1992Google Scholar). It exhibits several antiviral properties. High doses of TNF can inhibit replication of RNA and DNA viruses and many virus-infected cells become sensitive to TNF-mediated lysis (32Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1986; 323: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 33Mestan J. Digel W. Mittnacht S. Hillen H. Blohm D. Möller A. Jacobsen H. Kirchner H. Nature. 1986; 323: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, TNF activates neutrophils and stimulates the killing activity of macrophages and NK cells, both of which are involved in the early antiviral response of the innate immune system (29Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNF also supports the adaptive immune system by up-regulating class I major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, which in turn increases the efficiency of killing by cytotoxic T cells (34Israel A. Le Bail O. Hatat D. Piette J. Kieran M. Logeat F. Wallach D. Fellous M. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ad appears to induce TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 in the infected tissue in mice. Thus, the observed stimulation of E3 expression by TNF may be a feedback mechanism allowing efficient expression of immunosubversive E3 proteins which might be beneficial for survival of the virus in its host. Consistent with this interpretation, there is good correlation between high levels of TNF in the blood and severity of Ad-induced disease in humans (35Mistchenko A.S. Diez R.A. Mariani A.L. Robaldo J. Maffey A.F. Bayley Bustamante G. Grinstein S. J. Pediatr. 1994; 124: 714-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the mechanism by which TNF stimulates E3 expression. We found that TNF activates the E3 promoter by utilizing the cytosolic transcription factor NF-κB. Two NF-κB family members, p50/relA, strongly bind to the κ2 site within the E3 promoter and therefore seem to mediate this effect. Interestingly, E3 appears to be the only early promoter sensitive to the presence of TNF. The implications of this response mechanism for the natural infection are discussed. The EcoRV C fragment, subcloned in pBluescript II KS− (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) encompasses the entire E3 region of Ad2 including 273 base pairs upstream of the E3 transcription start site (27Körner H. Fritzsche U. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The E3 promoter, contained within a 360-base pair long SacI fragment, was cut out of the subcloned EcoRV C fragment utilizing the SacI site of the vector and the E3 SacI site at nucleotide +29 and inserted into the SacI site in front of the luciferase reporter gene of the “pGL2 basic” vector (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). The orientation of the inserted fragment was determined by sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemicals, Bad Homburg, Germany). Polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (36Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) of the E3 promoter using vector and mutant primers listed in Table I was carried out as described previously (37Sester M. Burgert H.-G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5423-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenized double-stranded fragments were cleaved with SacI and inserted into pGL2 basic. Orientation and correct sequence of the resulting mutant E3 promoter constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Table I.Oligonucleotides used for the EMSA probes and for site-directed mutagenesisOligonucleotideOligonucleotide sequenceaSubstitutions in the mutant oligonucleotides are underlined.E3 κ2 WT senseTGTACCAGGAAAGTCCCGCTCCCE3 κ2 WT antisenseTGGTGGGAGCGGGACTTTCCTGGTE3 κ1 WT senseACCACTGTGGTACTTCCCAE3 κ1 WT antisenseGGGCGTCTCTGGGAAGTACCE3 AP-1 WT senseCCGAAGTTCAGATGACTAAE3 AP-1 WT antisenseCCTGAGTTAGTCATCTGAAE3 ATF WT senseGGGCGGCTTTCGTCACAGGGE3 ATF WT antisenseACCGCACCCTGTGACGAAAGE3 NF WT senseCCCGTAGTTGGCCCGCTGCCE3 NF WT antisenseGGTACACCAGGGCAGCGGGE3 κ2 mutant senseACCAGGAACTCGAGGCTCCCE3 κ2 mutant antisenseGGGAGCCTCGAGTTCCTGGTE3 κ1 mutant senseGGTACCTCGAGGAGACGCCCE3 κ1 mutant antisenseGGGCGTCTCCTCGAGGTACCE3 AP-1 mutant senseGAAGTTCAGCTCGAGACTCAGGGE3 AP-1 mutant antisenseCCTGAGTCTCGAGCTGAACTTCE3 ATF mutant senseGGGCGGCCTTAGTGACAGGGE3 ATF mutant antisenseCCCTGTCACTAAGGCCGE3 NF-1 mutant senseGTAGTTGATCCGCTATCCTGGTE3 NF-1 mutant antisenseGGTACACCAGGATAGCGGATCAACTACa Substitutions in the mutant oligonucleotides are underlined. Open table in a new tab 293 and HeLa cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method according to a standard protocol (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, a 6-cm dish of cells was transfected with 5 μg of DNA of each luciferase construct together with 2 μg of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter-β-galactosidase internal control plasmid. Routinely, 200 μl of calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitate was added to a 6-cm dish of cells at 25% confluency. The cells were washed two times with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 4 h later (for 293 cells) or 24 h later (for HeLa cells) and further incubated in the same medium. For enzymatic assays, cells were harvested 48 h after the start of the transfection. TNF (PBH, Hannover, Germany) treatment (320 units/ml) was performed for 5 h at the end of the incubation period. Cells were scraped with a rubber policeman in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.6), and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles consisting of sequential incubations in liquid nitrogen and in a 37°C waterbath. Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and the supernatants were analyzed for enzymatic activities. Luciferase, CAT, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 39de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helsinki D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

TNF treatment of the cells was carried out as described above. For the extraction of the nuclear proteins, cells from a 6-cm dish were lysed for 5 min on ice in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 M sucrose, 15 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.125 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM spermine, 0.125 mM spermidine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors: 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin), the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C. After resuspending the nuclei in 105 μl of NEB 0.14 (140 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2 containing the same concentration of protease inhibitors as above), nuclear proteins were extracted by adding 75 μl of NEB 0.7 (700 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2 with protease inhibitors) and incubation for 20 min on ice. Soluble extracts were separated from non-soluble material by a 5-min centrifugation at 11,000 × g (4°C). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford dye-binding assay using a Bio-Rad kit (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). The nuclear extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. End-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (sequences are listed in Table I) were used as probes for EMSA. All complementary oligonucleotides were designed to have a 5′ overhang for labeling by Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and cold dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. EMSA binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixture contained 5 μg of nuclear extracts, 0.5 ng of the radiolabeled probe (20,000 cpm), and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 16 μl of binding buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.8 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM MgCl2). For EMSA using the NF-κB probe, unspecific complexes were eliminated by further incubating the binding reactions with 3 mM chloroquine (24Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift analysis the binding mixture was preincubated with 1 μl of specific antibody for 1 h on ice before adding the radiolabeled probe. The binding reactions were run on a native 5% polyacrylamide 0.5 × TBE gel for 2 h at 150 V. Virus infections of HeLa cells and subsequent immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (27Körner H. Fritzsche U. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We previously reported that TNF up-regulates expression of the E3/19K protein (27Körner H. Fritzsche U. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as well as the other E3 proteins (28Deryckere F. Ebenau-Jehle C. Wold W.S.M. Burgert H.-G. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The coordinated induction of all E3 proteins indicated a mechanism acting prior to translation. Indeed, the level of E3/19K mRNA is also increased (27Körner H. Fritzsche U. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To examine if this increased synthesis is due to stimulation of the E3 promoter, we subcloned the Ad2 E3 promoter (−273, +29) in front of the luciferase reporter gene (the resulting plasmid is termed pE3Luc). As efficient expression from the E3 promoter requires E1A, human 293 cells which constitutively express E1A (41Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3445) Google Scholar) were used for the transfection assays. Transient transfection of pE3Luc into 293 cells gave rise to higher luciferase activity than the positive control plasmid expressing luciferase under the control of the SV40 promoter/enhancer (data not shown), showing that the E3 promoter is highly active in these cells. However, when the transiently transfected cells were treated with TNF, the luciferase activity measured was further increased by a factor of 3.3 (see top of Fig. 1). This level of induction is very similar to the increase of E3/19K protein synthesis that we reported previously (27Körner H. Fritzsche U. Burgert H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11857-11861Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the TNF-mediated up-regulation of E3 expression may be entirely due to activation of transcription driven by the E3 promoter. Previous analysis of the E3 promoter led to the identification of transcription factor binding sites for AP-1, ATF, and NF-1. Two additional sites showing homology to the NF-κB consensus binding site were specifically occupied in lymphoid cells (18Weeks D.L. Jones N.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (see schematic representation on Fig. 1, left). To examine which cis-acting element of the E3 promoter is required for its TNF inducibility, each transcription factor binding site was separately mutated by substitution of 3-6 nucleotides (for details, see Table I). The inability of the mutated sites to bind the corresponding nuclear factor was confirmed by EMSA (see below, Fig. 2A). Mutated E3 promoters were inserted in front of the luciferase gene and the resulting constructs were transfected into 293 cells. The luciferase activity was determined in the presence and absence of TNF (Fig. 1). Luciferase activity obtained with the wild type promoter construct without TNF treatment was set to 1. For each construct, the ratio between luciferase activities with and without TNF treatment is indicated on the right. As expected from previous studies (18Weeks D.L. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5389-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Garcia J. Wu F. Gaynor R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8367-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1132-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Buckbinder L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), both AP-1 and ATF mutations have a drastic effect on the basal level and/or E1A driven expression of the reporter gene, while TNF stimulation appears only weakly affected. Mutation of the NF-1 binding site alters neither the TNF induction potential of the promoter, nor its basal activity. A more pronounced reduction of the TNF-mediated induction is exhibited by mutating the potential binding sites for NF-κB, κ1, and κ2. In particular, the mutation of κ2 reduces inducibility by 90%. A double mutation of κ2 and κ1 abolishes TNF induction completely. Thus, it seems that the NF-κB binding sites of the E3 promoter are primarily responsible for the induction of the E3 promoter by TNF. Apparently the κ2 element plays the most critical role in this phenomenon. It is intriguing that the κ2 site is strongly conserved among the known Ad E3 promoter sequences while κ1 is not (Table II). Moreover, all κ2 elements align well with the NF-κB consensus binding site (24Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the κ1 sites generally do not fit the NF-κB consensus except for κ1 of Ad2 and Ad5 which contains only one mismatch to the NF-κB consensus (Table II).Table II.Potential binding sites for NF-κB within the E3 promoters of different adenovirus subtypesSubgroupAd subtypeκ1 (antisense)aNucleotides not aligning with the consensus binding site for NF-κB (GGGRNNYYCC (24)) are written in lower case.

Open table in a new tab To analyze which proteins bind to the E3 promoter in the absence and presence of TNF, EMSA were performed. Nuclear extracts of non-induced and TNF-induced 293 cells were prepared and tested with the probes indicated below the autoradiographs in Fig. 2A. The specificity of the binding reactions was confirmed by competition with a 200 M excess of unlabeled wild type and mutant oligonucleotides. The mutant double-stranded oligonucleotides were identical to the primers used for generation of the E3 promoter constructs tested above (Fig. 1). While the wild type oligonucleotides efficiently competed with binding of the probes (Fig. 2A, lanes 4, 9, 14, and 19), the mutant oligonucleotides were unable to do so (Fig. 2A, lanes 5, 10, 15, and 20). This demonstrated that the introduced mutations disrupt the binding to the corresponding nuclear factors. As can be seen, NF-1, AP-1, and ATF bind to the E3 promoter in the absence of TNF (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 12, and 17). In agreement with the results of the mutational analysis shown in Fig. 1, induction with TNF has no effect on proteins binding to the NF-1 and ATF probes (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 18), whereas a slight increase is observed with the AP-1 probe (1.6-fold; Fig. 2A, lane 13). In contrast, a protein complex with κ2 is only formed when extracts from TNF-treated 293 cells are used (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 7 and 8). A complex of similar size but in much lower amounts can be detected using the κ1 probe after TNF induction (data not shown). We therefore compared the affinities of κ1 and κ2 for the TNF-induced complex in competition assays using radiolabeled κ2 (Fig. 2B). A 10 times higher concentration of cold κ1 is necessary to give an equivalent competition to κ2 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 6 and 7). This showed that the affinity of the bound protein(s) for κ2 is much greater than for κ1. The question arises which members of the NF-κB family of transcription factors bind to the NF-κB elements within the E3 promoter. Therefore, supershift experiments were performed using antibodies directed against individual NF-κB subunits (Fig. 3). Antibodies against p50 and p65 decrease the migration of the complex whereas antibodies against RelB, c-Rel, and p52 (data not shown) seem to have no effect. Thus, we conclude that the TNF-activated transcription"

We have also redetermined the heme content of the intact Hb to resolve the wide variation in previously measured values (3Vinogradov S.N. Sharma P.K. Walz D.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 98B: 187-194Google Scholar). These discrepancies might be attributed to oxidation which would enhance the rate of heme loss. Therefore, we have measured the rate of autoxidation and of hemin loss from intact L. terrestris Hb and its isolated subunits. L. terrestris Hb was prepared essentially as described previously (4Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 0-4°C in CO-saturated 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0. Protease inhibitors were used as described previously (4Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The clear Hb-containing supernatant was precipitated with 10% polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, ∼8000) overnight. The polyethylene glycol was removed by pelleting the Hb at 200,000 × g for 90 min, resuspending the Hb in polyethylene glycol-free buffer, and pelleting again. The Hb was then passed through a column (5 cm × 88 cm) of Sephacryl HRS-200 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with the same buffer. The final HbCO solution was exhaustively dialyzed against 400 volumes (five changes over 6 days) of CO-saturated 5 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, prepared with high purity deionized water. A final solution of 2.4 ml at a nominal concentration of ≈3.6 mg/ml was used in all heme, dry weight, and amino acid analyses. Heme was measured by the alkaline hematin “AHD” method with the use of a millimolar extinction coefficient of 6.960 ± 0.046 (mM−1 cm−1) at 575 nm for the hematin product (17Wolf H.U. Lang W. Zander R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 136: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This method was compared with the CN-metHb method (18van Assendelft O.W. Spectrophotometry of Haemoglobin Derivatives. Royal van Gorcum, Assen, Netherlands1970: 100-118Google Scholar) with an extinction coefficient for human CN-metHb of 10.99 mM−1 cm−1 at 540 nm (heme basis) (18van Assendelft O.W. Spectrophotometry of Haemoglobin Derivatives. Royal van Gorcum, Assen, Netherlands1970: 100-118Google Scholar). The two methods agreed to within 1% for both human HbO2 and L. terrestris HbCO. The average of two dilutions in the AHD method gave 0.1642 mM heme for the L. terrestris HbCO sample. The dilutions were made with two Pipetmen (20 and 200 μl) calibrated by weighing various amounts of water delivered by the instruments. Great care was exercised at every step of the dry weight determination. The exhaustively dialyzed HbCO together with the dialyzing buffer were shipped on wet ice to the laboratory of Dr. Y. Nozaki, Durham, NC. The dry weight measurements followed an ultra-micro method 3Y. Nozaki, manuscript in preparation. developed from the previous dry weight technique (19Nozaki Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Five zirconium drying vessels (∼20 mg) were cleaned, dried first in air and then in vacuo at 107 ± 1°C. Two were used for the undiluted HbCO sample and three for an aliquot diluted 3.075-fold by weight. Four aliquots of the dialysate were also dried and weighed. The total salt concentration in the final dialyzing buffer was found to be 1.0004 ± 0.0056 mg/g or 0.9983 mg/ml. This is very close to the calculated value of 1.004 mg/ml for the sum of all components. Consideration was given to the possibility that the salt and buffer ion concentrations were too low to eliminate a discrepancy arising from the Donnan equilibrium effect.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enabled us to estimate the approximate number of charges on a molecule of HbCO at pH 7. We assumed that all Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp residues were ionized and that half the His residues were ionized. On this basis, the Donnan contribution to the salt concentration was calculated to be less than 1% and was ignored. The gravimetrically determined grams protein per gram of solution was converted to grams protein/ml by using the density of 0.9979 g/ml measured for the dialysate at 24.4°C. A Beckman P/ACE 5000 instrument of the Protein Microanalysis Facility at the University of Texas was used with the eCAP SDS 14-200 or eCAP SDS 200 kits supplied by Beckman Instruments. The first set of three analyses used a short capillary (100 μm ×∼38 cm) and a stock solution of unreduced Hb (≈10 mg/ml) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10% polyethylene glycol. All runs were made at 20°C in 1% SDS. Eight analyses were performed with a 100 μm ×∼57-cm column with a stock solution of 10 mg/ml Hb in 25 mM bis-tris propane of pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2. Four of the last eight samples were boiled, and four were not boiled; the results of all 11 analyses were averaged. The values for the area fractions obtained by the Beckman software were found to be within 2.5% of values obtained by cutting out and weighing the paper corresponding to the peaks. Capillary electrophoresis was also performed with 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.6 (at 15°C) without SDS with the capillaries maintained at 15°C. This procedure was used for the experiments shown in Fig. 3. A 15% polyacrylamide gel was prepared in 0.38 M Tris buffer at pH 8.8 with a running buffer of glycine (192 mM)-Tris (25 mM) of pH 8.3 measured at room temperature. Thus the pH of the buffer at 4°C would be 8.9 for the running buffer on the basis that ΔpK/ΔT ≈−0.031 deg−1. Loading samples contained 10% glycerol. Gels with 14 lanes (16 × 20 × 0.2 cm) were run at 4°C at ∼200 V (∼10 V/cm) for 10-15 h. The positions of protein components were determined by cutting out one lane on each side of the gel and staining them with Coomassie Blue. Gel slices containing the desired protein bands were then excised. The proteins were electroeluted from the gel slices with a Bio-Rad model 422 Electro Eluter run at 4°C in the pH 8.3 electrophoresis buffer at a constant current of 8 mA/tube for 4-5 h; the voltage gradually dropped from 200 to 100 V during this time. A 12% acrylamide gel was prepared in 0.38 M Tris at pH 8.8 containing 0.1% SDS. The running buffer was 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.3, with 0.1% SDS. The sample was loaded with 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS and 10% glycerol. Samples were boiled 1-3 min before loading. The time courses for autoxidation were measured essentially as described by Brantley et al. (20Brantley Jr., R.E. Smerdon S.J. Wilkinson A.J. Singleton E.W. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6995-7010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The measurements were made for almost 2 days in the presence of 3 mmol each of catalase and superoxide dismutase per mol of Hb heme, in 0.15 M phosphate, 0.45 M sucrose, pH 7.0, 20°C. These conditions were chosen to correspond to those used in the hemin loss measurements. Rates of hemin loss from oxidized L. terrestris Hb and its subunits were measured as described by Hargrove et al. (21Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Large absorbance changes occur at 600 nm when hemin is taken up from ferric hemoglobin by an excess of sperm whale H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin which has a much higher affinity for the prosthetic group than the Hb. Ferrous samples of hemoglobin were oxidized with an excess of ferricyanide, gel-filtered on a small Sephadex G25 column, and diluted to ∼6 μM (heme). Then an excess of H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin was added. The reaction buffer was 0.15 M phosphate, 0.45 M sucrose, pH 7.0. This concentration of sucrose was found to inhibit the precipitation of apomyoglobin or human globin without a significant effect on the rate of hemin loss (21Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses were performed with an Applied Biosystems model 420A-3 Derivitizer-Analyzer at the Protein Microanalysis Facility at the University of Texas. The automated hydrolysis option was not used because it gave much poorer results than careful manual hydrolysis. All dilutions were made by weight. The final application of a sample to the fritted disc of the instrument was made with a calibrated Pipetman. Initial tests were made with human HbAo (major component) which had been purified as HbCO by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The concentration of Hb was determined by the alkaline hematin method (ADH) (17Wolf H.U. Lang W. Zander R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 136: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Initial analyses of the mass of the sample of L. terrestris Hb showed only about 80-85% recovery on the basis that the hemin measurement would provide the correct total mass when the previously determined stoichiometry (4Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 192 hemes/molecule were assumed. We found that the low yield did not depend on these assumptions but on the hydrolysis conditions. The yield could be greatly increased by the inclusion of thioglycolic acid (22Matsubara H. Sasaki R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 35: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis was carried out for 24 h in 6 N HCl with 0.05% phenol and 3% thioglycolic acid. A Pierce Chemical Co. no. 20088H standard amino acid mixture (given as 2.5 ± 0.1 μmol/ml in 0.1 N HCl) was used for calibration. The Pierce standards are analyzed for the Pierce Chemical Co. by Hazelton Laboratories with a Beckman model 7300 amino acid analyzer with ninhydrin post-column derivitization calibrated with Beckman amino acid standards. 4Pierce Chemical Company, private communication. The Pierce standards were compared by us with amino acid Standard Reference Material 2389, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The mean total mass of the NIST standard mixture (six analyses) recovered was 2.9% higher than expected from the NIST specifications when the Pierce standards were used as standards. This is well within the mean uncertainty of 3.59 ± 0.41% specified for the individual amino acids by NIST. Heme was not removed prior to hydrolysis because the additional steps required for its removal appeared likely to involve additional loss of protein. The results indicate that the presence of iron released from the hemin had no detectable effect on the total mass of protein recovered. Possible effects of iron on the recovery of individual amino acids was not investigated. SDS-capillary electrophoresis (CE) completely resolves the globin subunits (abc trimer (T) and chain d (“monomer”)) and separates them from linkers. Fig. 1 shows the pattern obtained from one of the 11 experiments. The mean proportions from 11 experiments, determined from the integrated absorbances at 214 nm, are given in Table I together with previous estimates of proportions obtained by both HPLC and Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The CE and HPLC results agree closely with each other and with values predicted on the basis of the proposed (abcd)2 L stoichiometry (4Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data provide no support for the earlier Coomassie Blue-based conclusion that linker chains comprise 33-36% of the total mass (10Vinogradov S.N. Lugo S.D. Mainwaring M.G. Kapp O.H. Crewe A.V.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13091-13096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the Coomassie Blue-derived values for the polypeptide mass ratio of abc trimer (T) to chain d is revealing. The polypeptide weight ratio, T/d, is known to be close to 3.19 from amino acid sequence analysis (4Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CE data give a mean T/d ratio of 3.22 which is within 1% of the sequence-based value. However, the T/d ratio from Coomassie Blue staining (Table I) varies from 1.6 to 2.7, or 16-49% lower than expected. This variation, by itself, is sufficient to show that quantification with Coomassie Blue can give erroneous results.Table I.Proportions of subunits in hemoglobin of L. terrestrisExperimentalaValues determined by integration of peak areas of 11 patterns of SDS-CE monitored at 214 nm and nine HPLC patterns monitored at 220 nm (4).TheorybValues calculated on the basis of the masses determined by sequence analysis, mass spectrometry and the assumption of the (abcd)2L stoichiometry.Densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gelscValues taken from Tables II of Refs. 12 and 13 and Table I of Ref. 10, all of which are the results of densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250.SDS-CEHPLCPolypeptideRef. 13Kapp O.H.

These CE-derived molecular masses permit identification of peaks 1-3 in Fig. 1 by comparison with known values determined by mass spectrometry (4Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T.

The results are very close to the values obtained by Shlom and Vinogradov (23Shlom J.M. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7904-7912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on unreduced L. terrestris Hb (Table II, column a). The conclusions of the time (24Weber K. Pringle J.R. Osborn M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar) were that molecular masses are more accurately determined by SDS-electrophoresis of completely reduced proteins. However, the data of Table II show that the values for the masses of unreduced linkers correspond more closely to those from mass spectrometry than the values obtained in the presence of mercaptoethanol. The values of 31 and 37 kDa (Table II, column b), obtained with hemoglobin treated with 0.1% SDS and mercaptoethanol, were used for many years as the masses of the linker chains now designated as L1 and L2. Table II clearly shows that the use of mercaptoethanol can result in an overestimation by 12-15% of the masses of L1 and L2. L3 and L4 are not evident on the reduced gels.Table II.Masses of linker chains estimated from SDS-capillary electrophoresisFractionaThe positions of fractions 1-5 are indicated in Fig.1.CE-massbApparent molecular masses estimated by using chain d and abc trimer as calibrants for the pattern in Fig. 1.

(ii) Linker chains L1, L2, and L3 have previously been shown to be present in equal or nearly equal molar proportions (4Ownby D.W. Zhu H. Schneider K. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol.

The COX Vb promoter also contains multiple YY-1 binding sites that are important for both transcription initiation and tissue-dependent transcription suppression (9Basu A. Park K. Atchison M.L.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Recently, bovine genes for the muscle-specific isologs VIa(H) and VIIa(H) have been sequenced (4Seelan R.S. Grossman L.I.

However, the nature of the promoter elements controlling cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific expression of these genes has not yet been investigated.Transcription regulation of a large majority of skeletal muscle-specific genes is dependent on E box binding bHLH transcription factors (19Kadesch T.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2104-2111Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar), although factors binding to immediately flanking CArG or A/T-rich MEF2 motifs in conjunction with the E box binding protein appear to be important for the expression of some muscle-specific promoters (23Catala F.

Myo-D, myogenin, MRF4, and myf-5 are members of the skeletal muscle-specific class II bHLH proteins that are important determinants of the skeletal muscle lineage (22Olson E.N.

Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In particular, heterodimerization between the class I type ubiquitous E2A family proteins with cell- and tissue-specific class II proteins plays a pivotal role in the transactivation of skeletal muscle-specific genes. In contrast, binding of E2A homodimers to E box motifs has been reported to play a key role in the B cell-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (26Murre C. Voronova A.

The expression of muscle-specific actin, MCK, troponin C, and other genes in cardiac cells has been shown to depend upon serum response factor binding to CArG box sequences (24Sartorelli V. Hong N.A.

More recently three different groups (33Cross J.C. Flannery M.L. Blanar M.A. Steingrimsson E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Rutter W.J. Werb Z.

Science. 1995; 270: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) have independently characterized bHLH factors dHAND and eHAND (variably termed Th1, Th2 or HXT, HED), which may have roles in the cardiac muscle development. These factors are detected only at certain stages during chick and mouse embryogenesis, and currently their role in the regulation of muscle-specific genes in differentiated cardiac muscle cells remains unclear. In the present paper we have characterized the rat gene for the muscle-specific COX VIII(H) and found that a tandemly duplicated consensus E box is necessary for transcription activation of the promoter in both skeletal and cardiac muscle cell lines. We also show that a bHLH E box binding superfamily factor is involved in transcriptional activation of the promoter in differentiated H9C2 cardiomyocytes.DISCUSSIONNuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins contain one or more common sequence motifs in their 5′ proximal promoter regions (49Nagley P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9330-9334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although NRF1 and GABP (NRF2, E4TF1) are not unique to genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (14Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 52Chau C.M. Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol.

Rothenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4725-4735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is believed that these and other common transcription factor binding motifs might be involved in the coordinate regulation of nuclear genes coding for various mitochondrial proteins. There is evidence suggesting a global regulation of mitochondrial destined genes in yeast by members of the HAP1/HAP2/HAP3 family of transcription factors (55Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 56Pfeifer K. Arcangioli B. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Results presented in this paper indicate the absence of functionally important NRF1, GABP (NRF2, E4TF1), or OXBOX sequence motifs in the 5′ promoter region of the rat COX VIII(H) gene, suggesting that a different set of regulatory controls may exist for the expression of tissue-specific mitochondrial genes. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the rat COX VIII(H) gene is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues with no detectable expression in nonmuscle tissues. Interestingly, the same two E box sequence motifs closest to the transcription start site are important for both cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific regulation of the gene.Extensive studies in the skeletal muscle system have provided compelling evidence that the expression of one or more bHLH factors like Myo-D, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF-4 is sufficient to induce myogenesis and that these master regulatory genes play a central role in skeletal muscle cell determination and differentiation (22Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2104-2111Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 25Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S.

It is well known that Myo-D and other myogenic determinants are expressed only in differentiated skeletal muscle cells and activate only the myogenic genes (19Kadesch T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar, 21Murre C. Bain G. Van-Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Although a number of nonmuscle enhancers such as the IgH enhancer contain E boxes, such nonmuscle promoters are not activated in muscle cells due to the presence of negative acting elements that inhibit Myo-D-dependent transcription activation (47Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In view of this, the 12-14-fold increase in the transcription activity of the −158CAT construct in induced C2C12 skeletal myocytes and also a 7-8-fold stimulation by co-expression with the Myo-D cDNA suggest that the two E boxes (E1 and E2 boxes) of the rat COX VIII(H) promoter characterized in this study function cooperatively as skeletal muscle-specific promoter elements. The results of mutations targeted to single E boxes also suggest some degree of cooperativity between the two protein-bound complexes for transcriptional activity. Such cooperative interactions between Myo-D and related heterodimeric bHLH factors binding to two tandemly spaced E box sites have been observed previously (59Brennan T.J. Olson E.N.

Transcriptional activation of these genes during cardiac muscle differentiation has been shown to involve multiple pathways, involving different enhancer binding proteins, including the recently identified bHLH factors (33Cross J.C. Flannery M.L. Blanar M.A. Steingrimsson E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Rutter W.J. Werb Z. Development. 1995; 121: 2513-2523PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F.

Science. 1995; 270: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). For example, the expression of the cardiac troponin T gene requires distinctly different sequence motifs than those required for its expression in skeletal myocytes (65Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A minimal promoter region containing two CAAT-like motifs, designated as M-CAT, was sufficient for full expression in skeletal muscle cells. An additional ∼75-nucleotide sequence upstream of the two M-CAT motifs was required for its expression in cardiac myocytes (66Iannello R.C. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3309-3316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the cardiac muscle-specific troponin C enhancer, on the other hand, requires the binding of zinc finger transcription factor GATA-4 (31Ip H.S. Wilson D.B. Heikinheimo M. Tang Z. Ting C.N. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7517-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Additionally, many muscle-specific genes contain CArG boxes (also referred to as SRE) that are important in the cardiac muscle-specific expression of a number of genes (24Sartorelli V. Hong N.A. Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4047-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Vincent C.K. Gualberto A. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Mol. Cell.

Additionally, A/T-rich motifs binding to the myocyte-specific enhancer factor MEF-2 have been implicated in the cardiac-specific expression of a number of genes (29Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2757-2764Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 46Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Reports of cardiac muscle-specific transcription regulation involving the bHLH family of transcription factors have been relatively rare. Studies with the human cardiac α-actin gene suggested that the CArG box motif was essential for enhancer activity, although an E box motif located immediately downstream was also important for maximal activity in cardiac myocytes (24Sartorelli V. Hong N.A. Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4047-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 67Moss J.B. McQuinn T.C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12731-12740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a functional cooperativity between proteins binding to the two sequence motifs. In the present study, a minimal promoter region containing the two proximal E boxes and a GRE (sequences −158 to −44) exhibited cardiac muscle-specific transcription activation in induced H9C2 myocytes (Fig. 3). Our results also show that mutations in a single E box caused a reduction in activity comparable with the activity of the basal promoter and a reduction in its ability to respond to cardiac muscle-specific differentiation signals. Further support for the myogenic specificity of the E box containing distal promoter comes from the observation that the putative enhancer sequence is unable to stimulate transcription in nonmuscle cells such as COS cells (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, the COX VIII(H) gene is the first gene to be reported where duplicated E boxes act as tissue-specific transcription activators in both skeletal- and cardiac-specific expression. Although the 5′ upstream region of the promoter contains three imperfect CArG-like sequence motifs (ΨCArG), results of progressive deletion studies suggested no apparent functional significance for this region in both the cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific activation of transcription. This is in contrast to a possible functional cooperativity between SRF and E box binding proteins in the tissue-specific expression of a number of genes (23Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Sartorelli V. Hong N.A. Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12731-12740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Gel shift analysis and Yae antibody supershift patterns presented in this study (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) confirm and extend earlier observations (24Sartorelli V. Hong N.A. Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4047-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Litvin J. Montgomery M.O. Goldhamer D.J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Bader D.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) on the possible occurrence of an E box binding bHLH protein in differentiated cardiomyocytes. Direct support for the functional significance of the bHLH protein in cardiac muscle-specific transcription activation of the COX VIII(H) promoter comes from the observation that Id overexpression specifically inhibited the transcriptional activity in induced H9C2 myocytes (Table II). Our results also show a 12-14-fold difference in the in vivo transcription activities of the −158CAT construct in uninduced versus induced H9C2 myocytes (Fig. 3). Additionally, results of gel mobility analysis with extracts from uninduced and induced H9C2 myocytes (Fig. 7) show marked differences in the migration of Yae antibody supershifted complexes. These results provide evidence that the E box binding protein necessary for cardiac muscle-specific activation of the COX VIII(H) promoter is either induced or activated during myogenesis. Recent studies using the yeast two-hybrid system (34Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 35Srivastava D. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Science. 1995; 270: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) demonstrated the expression of two bHLH proteins, dHAND and eHAND (Th1, Th2) during heart muscle early embryonic stages, that are not detected in the adult heart (34Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In support of these observations, coexpression with both dHAND and eHAND did not affect the transcription activity of the −158CAT construct in differentiated H9C2 cells (results are not presented). Although, our results suggest that the antibody supershifting complex may be different from an E2A homodimer, this may contain an E2A-like protein in association with a cell-specific bHLH protein. UV cross-linking and Western blot analyses (results not shown) indeed show the presence of E2A antibody-reactive proteins in nuclear extracts from induced H9C2 myocytes and adult rat heart.

However, the nature of the promoter elements controlling cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific expression of these genes has not yet been investigated.Transcription regulation of a large majority of skeletal muscle-specific genes is dependent on E box binding bHLH transcription factors (19Kadesch T.

In particular, heterodimerization between the class I type ubiquitous E2A family proteins with cell- and tissue-specific class II proteins plays a pivotal role in the transactivation of skeletal muscle-specific genes.

These factors are detected only at certain stages during chick and mouse embryogenesis, and currently their role in the regulation of muscle-specific genes in differentiated cardiac muscle cells remains unclear. In the present paper we have characterized the rat gene for the muscle-specific COX VIII(H) and found that a tandemly duplicated consensus E box is necessary for transcription activation of the promoter in both skeletal and cardiac muscle cell lines. We also show that a bHLH E box binding superfamily factor is involved in transcriptional activation of the promoter in differentiated H9C2 cardiomyocytes."

The ability of purified Hsp70s to uncoat clathrin-coated vesicles or to stimulate the post-translational translocation of precursor proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the nucleus was previously shown not to be sensitive to the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). During purification of factors required for protein folding in the cytosol, we found that the ATP-agarose binding activity of the yeast Hsp70 Ssa1p in postribosomal supernatants was inhibited by NEM. We also found that completely removing nucleotides from purified Ssa1p rendered its ATP-agarose binding activity, ATPase activity, and post-translational translocation-stimulating activity sensitive to NEM. We modified nucleotide-free Ssa1p with [14C]NEM and then digested it with proteases. Purification and sequencing of the radiolabeled proteolytic fragments revealed that each of Ssa1p's three cysteine residues (Cys-15, Cys-264, and Cys-303) was modified with [14C]NEM. ADP protected each of the cysteine residues from modification and protected Ssa1p from inactivation. The cysteine residues are the reactive centers of three NEM-reactive sites (NRS1-3). A comparison of Ssa1p's NRSs to sequences of other Hsp70s and actin revealed that Cys-15 of NRS1 is highly conserved and that sensitivity to NEM may be a property of many Hsp70s. Based on the three-dimensional structure of Hsc70, the predicted locations of Ssa1p's cysteine residues suggest that NEM may disrupt the conformation of Ssa1p or interfere with its ability to bind nucleotides.

AF-1 is a DNA-binding protein composed of low molecular mass polypeptides of 7-17 kDa that exists in solution as a 34-kDa complex.

Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this fraction, significant stimulatory activity was found to reside in a set of 29-23-kDa polypeptides. In this current work we describe the identification, partial purification, and properties of a second active component of this 0.8 M NaI fraction as a multimeric DNA-binding protein composed of 7-17-kDa polypeptides. This factor, termed AP-1-associated factor 1 (AF-1), enhances JunD·AP-1 DNA binding by forming a tri-molecular complex with AP-1 dimers and DNA that binds with a 100-fold higher affinity than JunD alone. Interestingly, inducible AF-1·Jun complexes can be demonstrated in nuclear extracts from mitogen-stimulated T-cells that are partially inhibited in the presence of cyclosporine A. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, leupeptin, pepstatin A, PMSF, Hepes, Tween 20, BSA, NaI, and poly[d(I-C)] were purchased from Sigma. DEAE-53 cellulose was from Whatman. Protein A-agarose, Triton X-100, and Bio-Rex 70 resin were from Bio-Rad. Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Affinity-purified antibodies against JunD were prepared as described (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Jurkat human T-cell line and MLA144 cells (gibbon T-cell lymphoma) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were washed three times with 3 volumes of cold PBS prior to preparation of nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts were prepared from resting or mitogen-stimulated Jurkat T-cells by a extensive modification of the procedure described by Ohlsson and Edlund (30Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cells (approximately 1-3 × 109) were harvested and washed as decribed above. The cells were then resuspended in 5 volumes of Buffer A (10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM BME, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5) and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and allowed to stand for 10 min at 4°C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of Buffer A and homogenized with 16 strokes of a Teflon pestle (fitted for 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes) driven at 1500 rpm by a hand-held 0.75-hp power drill. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The isolated nuclei were resuspended in 5 volumes of Buffer B (0.2 mM EDTA, 4 mM BME, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20% glycerol, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5). 4 M ammonium sulfate, pH 7.9, was added to yield a final concentration of 0.3 M, and the suspension was allowed to incubate at 4°C with gentle rocking for 30 min. The nuclear suspension was then clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was quickly recovered prior to re-swelling of the nuclear pellet and assayed directly for DNA binding activity. 10 mg of anti-JunD, prepared as described previously (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was bound to 2 ml of protein A-agarose in buffers containing PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mM PMSF at 4°C for 1 h. The antibody-coated agarose beads were washed into buffers containing 100 mM Hepes, pH 8.2, and chemically cross-linked by incubation with 10 mM ethyleneglycol bis-(succinimidylsuccinimate) for 1 h at room temperature. The column was quenched by washing the beads with 5 volumes of 1 M Tris-HCl and washed successively with 100 ml of buffer (containing 2 M urea, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 M glycine, 1 mM sodium azide), 200 ml of buffer (containing 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM sodium azide, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5 at 4°C), and finally equilibrated with 5-6 column volumes of buffer (containing PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mM sodium azide). A second nonspecific (anti-glutathione S-transferase antibody) antibody column was prepared from 10 ml of protein A-agarose and 30 mg of anti-GST antibodies. Nuclear extracts of MLA 144 T-cells were prepared as described previously (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dialyzed against PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 1 mM azide, pH 7.5, for 3 h at 4°C. The extract was then passed over a 10-ml anti-GST column, and the resulting flow-through was then passed over a 2-ml (5 mg/ml) anti-JunD affinity column. After washing successively with 25 column volumes each of 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes; 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5; and 1 M MgCl2, the column was eluted with 4 M MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mM sodium azide. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, screened for protein concentration, analyzed for JunD content by Western blot, pooled, and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 2000 volumes of buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, 8 mM BME, 0.05% Tween 20, 20% glycerol, and 1 mM sodium azide, pH 7.5. Cellular JunD prepared in this manner can be stored at −70°C with no loss in DNA binding activity for over 16 months. Nuclei that had been sequentially extracted with 250 and 600 mM NaCl were prepared from 40L of MLA144 cells as described previously (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated nuclei were then resuspended in 180 ml of Buffer D (800 mM NaI, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 20% glycerol, 4 mM BME, pH 7.5) and incubated with gentle rocking for 1 h at 4°C. The suspension was then clarified by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 3 h. The supernatant was collected and diluted to 0.4 M NaI by the addition of ice-cold Buffer D containing 0 mM NaI and adsorbed batchwise with gentle shaking for 30 min at 4°C with 0.2 volume of DE53 previously equilibrated with 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The DE53 suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and passed over a 45-ml phenyl-Sepharose column sequentially equilibrated with 1 volume of distilled water, 1 volume of 100% ethanol, 2 volumes of n-butanol, 1 volume of 100% ethanol, and 1 volume of distilled water prior to equilibration in Buffer D (0.4 M NaI). The flow-through (approximately 350 ml) from the phenyl-Sepharose column was dialyzed overnight against 12 volumes of buffer E (50 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 4 mM BME, 0.25 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5), at 4°C. The dialyzed material was then applied to a 10-ml Bio-Rex 70 column equilibrated in buffer E and developed with a 100-ml 0.05-2 M NaCl linear gradient. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and 1-μl aliquots were screened for the ability to form ternary complexes with immunopurified JunD by EMSA. Active fractions (peak reflecting conductivity between 0.5 and 0.8 M NaCl) were pooled and concentrated by ion exchange on a 2-ml Bio-Rex 70 column equilibrated in Buffer E and eluted with 250 mM NaCl Buffer E, followed by 0.8 M NaCl Buffer E. The 0.8 M NaCl material was adjusted to 0.5 M NaCl, applied to Superose 6 gel filtration column equilibrated in 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium azide. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and 1-μl aliquots were analyzed by EMSA as decribed above. Active fractions were pooled and stored at −70°C. AF-1 purified in this manner yields approximately 10 μg of protein that is stable at −70°C for at least 12 months. The gel filtration column was calibrated with BSA (68 kDa, Stokes radius (RS) = 3.5 nm), ovalbumin (43 kDa, RS = 2.84 nm), chymotrypsinogen A (23.2 kDa, RS = 2.25 nm), and RNase A (13.6 kDa, RS = 1.8 nm). EMSAs were performed by extended electrophoresis at 4°C on 8% polyacrylamide gels for 5-16 h at 180-210 V. Binding was performed at 24°C for 1 h (or as indicated) with either 0.2 ng (0.01 pmol) or indicated amounts of 32P-5′-end-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe in a final volume of 11-14 μl in buffers containing 500 μg/ml BSA, 4 mM BME, 32-80 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2-0.8 μg of poly[d(I-C)], 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and indicated amount of purified protein or nuclear. The oligonucleotide used in this study (other than those described in the figures) was as follows: GALV-TRE, 5′-AGCCAGAGAAATAGATGAGTCAACAGC-3′. Protein·DNA complexes were separated by EMSA as described above. The electrophoretic apparatus was disassembled, and regions of the gel containing radioactive protein·DNA complexes were UV-irradiated with a 2,000-microwatt/cm2 (at 7.6 cm) shortwave UV hand lamp at a distance of 2.5 cm from the surface of the gel for 15 min. The gel was subsequently dried on filter paper (Whatman), and protein·DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and eluted in 0.1% SDS for 14 h. Eluted complexes were lyophilized and resuspended in an appropriate volume of SDS-PAGE buffer, separated on 15-20% SDS-PAGE gels, and dried prior to autoradiography. Copper chemical cleavage footprint analysis of DNA·protein complexes following EMSA was performed as described previously (31Sigman D.S. Kuwabara M.D. Chen C.H. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 414-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Kuwabara M.D. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), except products were separated on 16% acrylamide sequencing gels. Antibodies to JunD and GST were prepared as described previously. Anti-Fos antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Michael Iadarola (National Institutes of Health). Recombinant JunD was prepared from extracts of Escherichia coli transformed with a plasmid construct (pGEX-JunD). The fusion protein, containing GST fused to the amino terminus of JunD was purified on a glutathione-agarose matrix and eluted with glutathione. Full-length bacterially expressed c-Jun was purchased from Promega. Truncated (139-270) bacterially expressed c-Fos was a generous gift from Dr. Tom Kerppola (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). SDS-PAGE was carried out in 0.2% (w/v) SDS with the buffers of Laemmli on 0.75-mm-thick 15-20% acrylamide gradient slabs with a 2.5-cm stacking gel. Protein bands were visualized after electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes by staining with colloidal gold (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Amersham) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Prior studies had identified an activity or activities, isolated from 0.8 M NaI extracts of MLA144 T-cell nuclei, that dramatically enhanced the DNA binding activity of JunD·AP1 (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar non-Fos, non-Jun activity could also be found as contaminating components in DNA affinity-purified preparations of JunD (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Quinn J.P. Farina A.R. Gardner K. Krutzsch H. Levens D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 4713-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The identification of these activities was based solely on the ability of the isolated fractions to stimulate specific binding of purified JunD to oligonucleotides containing the GALV-TRE sequence. To facilitate a more detailed study of this stimulatory activity in the current studies, it was therefore important to utilize preparations of purified JunD that were free of any contaminating components that could interfere with the assessment of regulated JunD-DNA binding activity. This required obtaining active preparations of purified JunD via means that were independent of DNA binding. Such requirements necessarily excluded DNA affinity-purified preparations of T-cell JunD as a suitable substrate for study. Although an attractive alternative, preparations of recombinant JunD contain very low percentages of active molecules. Due to their low DNA binding activity, these preparations must be used at very high protein concentrations. The possibility that the overwhelming excess of inactive molecules could interfere with proper assessment of the regulated function of the active population of JunD rendered recombinant sources of JunD even less suitable than the DNA affinity-purified JunD. JunD isolated from T-cell nuclear extracts by immunoaffinity purification was found to be the most useful and revealing substrate for the task of assessing the modulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity by various purified cellular components. Cellular T-cell JunD was obtained at high purity from nuclear extracts of gibbon ape T-cells by immunoaffinity purification (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nuclear extracts rich in JunD DNA binding activity were generated from isolated gibbon ape T-cell MLA144 nuclei (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After first processing over a nonspecific anti-GST antibody column, the extracts were passed over an affinity column that had been previously coupled to purified polyclonal anti-JunD antibodies at high concentration. Subsequently the column was washed with high salt buffers and eluted with 4 M MgCl2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). JunD purified in this manner was obtained in high purity and demonstrated the same predominant 43-kDa and 38-kDa polypeptides previously described in DNA affinity-purified JunD (29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Quinn J.P. Farina A.R. Gardner K. Krutzsch H. Levens D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 4713-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, this purified T-cell JunD was highly active, specific, and bound DNA at low protein concentrations. This immunoaffinity-purified form of JunD therefore was used throughout the purification and characterization of AF-1. AF-1 was purified from isolated T-cell nuclei by differential salt extraction followed by batchwise anion exchange chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic chromatography, gradient and stepwise cation exchange chromatography, ending with gel filtration chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Isolated fractions were assayed for the ability to stimulate JunD DNA binding activity by EMSA. The peak of AF-1 activity in the final gel filtration step eluted with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa (see “Experimental Procedures”). SDS-PAGE analysis of peak fractions demonstrated a class of low molecular mass polypeptides ranging from approximately 7 to 17 kDa that consistently co-migrated with AF-1 activity (ternary complex formation with JunD and DNA; see Fig. 2A) at each step (Fig. 1, left). The apparent discrepancy in the native molecular mass of AF-1 and the size of the AF-1 polypeptides by SDS-PAGE suggest that AF-1 is multimeric, a highly elongated molecule, or both. EMSA analysis of purified AF-1 in the absence of JunD reveals an intrinsic DNA binding activity that is independent of added factors and can be detected as a rapidly migrating DNA·protein complex (Fig. 1, right).Fig. 1Purification and properties of AF-1. A, left panel, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified AF-1. Arrows indicate position of polypeptides that consistently co-migrated with AF-1 activity.

Quantitative Scatchard analysis of the formation of this complex by EMSA indicates that AF-1 increases the DNA binding affinity of JunD from 14 nM to 93 pM (data not shown). Competition with a series of TRE mutations in which transversions were generated at 4-base intervals along the length of the GALV-TRE AP-1 reveal that ternary AF-1·JunD·DNA and binary JunD·DNA complexes show similar specificity for the consensus TRE sequences (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). In situ UV cross-linking of pre-formed JunD and AF-1·JunD complexes reveals the presence of a 19-kDa protein·DNA adduct exclusively in the AF-1·JunD complex (Fig. 2C, see arrow). The size of the 19-kDa adduct is consistent with the molecular mass of the polypeptides that are present in partially purified AF-1 and confirms that the AF-1·JunD complex is a ternary complex comprising JunD, AF-1, and DNA. Pre-formed JunD and AF-1·JunD protein·DNA complexes were isolated by EMSA and digested in situ by copper cleavage (Fig. 3). Comparison of the cleavage protection produced by the two complexes shows that the AF-1·JunD complex extends the protection produced by JunD alone by at least 9 base pairs (Fig. 3). Protection is increased 7 base pairs in the 3′ direction and at least 2 base pairs in the 5′ direction. 2Evaluation of the extension of the footprint in the 5′ direction could not be reliably interpreted further than 2 bases due to the possibility of variable recovery of oligonucleotide cleavage products of that size. When increasing amounts of JunD are added to a fixed concentration of AF-1 and DNA, a dramatic increase in DNA binding activity occurs with a concomitant decrease in the amount of binary AF-1·DNA complexes (Fig. 4A). The AF-1·JunD·DNA complexes show significantly higher binding than comparable amounts of JunD alone and the gradual decrease in the amount of binary AF-1·DNA complexes indicates that AF-1 has a much higher affinity and/or specificity for DNA complexed with JunD than for DNA alone. Semi-quantitative analysis of the rate of assembly of binary JunD·DNA versus ternary AF-1·JunD·DNA complexes shows that AF-1·JunD complexes assemble onto DNA much more rapidly that JunD alone (Fig. 4B). Time-constrained binding of JunD to a TRE in the presence or absence of AF-1 shows that, while the binding of JunD to the TRE is maximum at 5 min, the formation of the AF-1·JunD complexes occurs much faster (less than 1 min). In fact, the rate of assembly of the AF-1·JunD complex is so rapid, it cannot be measured within the limitation of the assay. Interestingly, the dissociation rates of both the JunD and the AF-1·JunD complexes appear to be very similar (data not shown). Thus, AF-1 exerts its effects on JunD DNA binding by increasing the contacts it makes with DNA and these AF-1-dependent contacts promote a more rapid assembly of AP-1 onto DNA, while having little effect on the half-life of the complex. The extent of AF-1's ability to enhance AP-1 DNA binding activity is dependent on the context of the AP-1 members within the dimeric complex. When measured by EMSA at low concentrations, AF-1 readily stimulates the binding of both purified T-cell JunD and recombinant GST-JunD but has little effect on recombinant c-Jun (Fig. 5A). Similarly, while low concentrations of AF-1 stimulate the binding activity of both purified Jurkat T-cell JunD homodimers and JunD·Fos heterodimers, it shows little effect on the DNA binding activity of either recombinant c-Jun homodimer or c-Jun heterodimerized with c-Fos (Fig. 5B). Although these differences are much less pronounced at higher concentrations of AF-1 (data not shown), they indicate two important points about the mechanism AF-1 interaction. (i) AF-1 can associate with both Jun-containing homodimers and heterodimers containing Fos, and (ii) AF-1 interaction with AP-1 shows protein specificity and will differ depending on the context of the monomeric components present in the dimeric complex. EMSA analysis of crude nuclear extracts prepared from PHA/PMA-stimulated Jurkat T-cells reveals the presence of an inducible AP-1·TRE complex in addition to a slower migrating AP-1-containing complex that comigrates precisely with the AF-1·JunD complex reconstituted from purified JunD and AF-1 components (Fig. 6, A and B). Notably, this complex is highly induced above the levels detectable in unstimulated Jurkat T-cells. Moreover, the inducible AF-1·Jun complex is partially (approximately 33%) inhibited by prior treatment with 100 nM cyclosporine (Fig. 6A). Antibody supershift analysis of these complexes with anti-JunD and anti-Fos antibodies indicates that the predominant complex in uninduced T-cells is composed mainly of Jun homodimers, while the more strongly inducible and slower migrating AF-1·AP-1 complex contain both Jun and Fos (Fig. 6B). These data provide strong evidence that the AF-1·JunD complexes reconstituted from purified AF-1 and cellular JunD are representative of the in vivo complexes found in nuclear extracts from PHA/PMA-induced Jurkat T-cells. This report describes the identification, partial purification, and characterization of a novel protein, termed AF-1, that dramatically facilitates the assembly of AP-1 dimers onto DNA. At present, the actual stoichiometry of the AF-1 subunits in the AF-1·AP-1 complex remains undetermined until sufficient amounts of either purified or recombinant protein become available for quantitative study. Preliminary evaluation of AF-1 DNA binding activity in the absence of JunD or other AP-1 complexes indicates that AF-1 forms complexes with DNA that have little specificity in the absence of other factors (data not shown). The avidity that AF-1 shows for JunD·DNA complexes over DNA alone (see Fig. 4A) is consistent with this observation. The ability of AF-1 to increase AP-1 DNA binding by primarily influencing the on rate of AF-1·JunD DNA binding, while having little or no effect on the half-life of the complex, could occur by two basic mechanisms. By the first model, AF-1 forms a binary complex with JunD dimers prior to binding to DNA. This binary complex could then assemble onto DNA in a more thermodynamically favorable fashion that could occur through stabilization of AP-1 dimer formation, relative lowering of the activation energy barrier for binding to DNA, or both. An essential component of this model is that AF-1 is capable of forming stable complexes with AP-1 dimers that can alter the dimer monomer equilibrium in the absence of DNA. Thus far we have not been able to detect any evidence of protein-protein interactions between AF-1 and either immunopurified or recombinant JunD. By a second model, AF-1 has insignificant affinity for JunD dimers alone but binds avidly to binary JunD·DNA complexes. Accordingly, JunD dimers would also be expected to bind with similar avidity to AF-1·DNA complexes. By this model either AF-1 or JunD binds preferentially to the extended DNA·protein surface created by its bound congener and DNA. This mode of interaction is very similar to that proposed for the tight interaction between calcineurin and the composite drug-protein surface created by the formation of cyclosporine-immunophilin complexes (34Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These models are very similar to those proposed for the mechanism of action of TAX-1 (24Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The observation that AF-1 acts differentially with AP-1 dimers depending on the context of the individual AP-1 dimerization partners is quite intriguing. At the very least, it indicates that AF-1 interactions with dimeric AP-1 shows protein specificity. Whether or not the differential preference of AF-1 for dimers containing JunD, in comparison to those containing c-Jun, reflects a true “Jun family member preference” or is more a reflection of the differential stability of recombinant preparations of c-Jun protein remains to be investigated. It should be noted that these differences appear to be less striking when AF-1 is added to dimers of JunD or c-Jun at higher concentrations. The biological relevance of these differences will be better addressed when recombinant preparations of AF-1 become available for eucaryotic expression. EMSA DNA binding analysis by extended electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels has added a new level of resolution to the analysis of AP-1 protein·DNA complexes. Under conventional conditions (4% acrylamide electrophoresis at 24°C for 1 h), the protein·DNA complexes now known to have altered mobility and composition migrate as superimposed or dissociated complexes during electrophoresis. As a result, the AF-1·Jun·DNA ternary complexes appear indistinguishable from the binary Jun·DNA complexes. In addition to providing greater resolution, the electrophoretic separation of the protein·DNA complexes on 8% acrylamide at 4°C provides a greater stability to the relative steady state ratio of binary and ternary complexes formed at equilibrium prior to electrophoresis. Nonetheless, at subsaturating concentrations of AF-1, this ratio appears to decay as the complexes fall apart during electrophoresis. The net result is an apparent increase in the relative amount of binary complexes at the completion of the electrophoresis. Such transitions are readily apparent in the EMSA analyses shown in Figs. 2A, 5, and 6A. EMSA separation of crude nuclear extracts derived from Jurkat T-cells on 8% acrylamide reveals the presence of two distinct inducible TRE-binding complexes. Both complexes contain Jun. One co-migrates with purified AP-1 dimers and DNA, and the second complex migrates with a mobility that is identical to the AF-1·JunD complexes reconstituted from separately purified components (Fig. 6, A and B). The presence of AF-1 within T-cell activation inducible AP-1 complexes reveals a substantial role for AF-1 as modulator of AP-1 function in T-cells. The partial inhibition of inducible AF-1·Jun complexes by cyclosporine A treatment is quite intriguing and suggests that some step in the pathway to the assembly of the ternary AF-1·Jun complex may be modulated by cyclosporine A. AF-1 represents one of two separate activities in the 0.8 M NaI extract of isolated T-cell nuclei that augment AP-1 DNA binding activity. The previously identified 29-23-kDa polypeptides found to augment JunD binding activity (see Ref. 29Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show no evidence of ternary complex formation and do not alter the mobility of Jun complexes by extended EMSA electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels. 3C. Powers and K. Gardner, unpublished observation. By contrast, AF-1 shifts the mobility of Jun complexes and the AF-1-dependent complexes show increased contacts with sequences flanking the TRE consensus site. Currently, the mechanism of action of the 29-23-kDa polypeptides remains undefined. It is not clear whether or not AF-1 will act as a negative transcriptional regulator or function positively. The observation that AF-1·Jun-like complexes are strongly induced during T-cell activation argues for a more prominent role as a positive regulator of AP-1 function. Like TAX-1, AF-1 could effect the DNA binding properties of multiple basic leucine zipper family members. The predominant role of AF-1 as an accessory protein that accelerates the rate of assembly of transcription factor complexes onto DNA could have profound influences on gene expression pathways that must generate a rapid response once threshold levels of active downstream signal transduction targets have been achieved. AF-1 could have a role in facilitating transcription factor entry and transcriptional co-factor function within the complicated and dynamic chromatin structure that surrounds rapidly inducible genes. Further purification, cloning, and functional characterization of AF-1 will provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing these important cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2040330552,"A novel calcium-binding phosphoprotein was isolated from the oocytes of the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus. This protein exhibits an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa on gel filtration, but migrates as an 8-kDa band on N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels. It has a high content of serine (24% of the total number of residues), and phosphoserine is the sole amino acid phosphorylated in vivo. A similar protein was partially purified from the hemolymph. It resembles the oocyte form of the protein in its NH2-terminal sequence and its ability to be taken up by growing ovaries. 45Ca binding to the oocyte phosphoprotein was determined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by blotting on nitrocellulose membranes. Titration of Ca2+-binding sites shows a high capacity (≅50 mol/mol of protein), but a low affinity (K0.5≅ 10−3M). Based on these characteristics, we have named this protein Rhodnius calcium-binding phosphoprotein. It resembles phosvitin, a phosphoprotein present in the oocytes of nonmammalian vertebrates. A novel calcium-binding phosphoprotein was isolated from the oocytes of the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus. This protein exhibits an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa on gel filtration, but migrates as an 8-kDa band on N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels. It has a high content of serine (24% of the total number of residues), and phosphoserine is the sole amino acid phosphorylated in vivo. A similar protein was partially purified from the hemolymph. It resembles the oocyte form of the protein in its NH2-terminal sequence and its ability to be taken up by growing ovaries. 45Ca binding to the oocyte phosphoprotein was determined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by blotting on nitrocellulose membranes. Titration of Ca2+-binding sites shows a high capacity (≅50 mol/mol of protein), but a low affinity (K0.5≅ 10−3M). Based on these characteristics, we have named this protein Rhodnius calcium-binding phosphoprotein. It resembles phosvitin, a phosphoprotein present in the oocytes of nonmammalian vertebrates. The storage of phosphoproteins as major components of egg yolk is a recurrent strategy in the animal kingdom. Vitellogenin, a phospholipoglycoprotein, is stored in oocytes during oogenesis (1Kunkel J.G. Nordin J.H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology.

Biochemical aspects of its synthesis, uptake, and processing as well as its gene structure have been studied extensively in recent years in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and a number of differences in vitellogenins from these sources have been detected (4Byrne B.M.

Inside the oocytes of nonmammalian vertebrates, vitellogenin (≅200 kDa) is the target of specific proteases whose activity gives rise to a set of smaller yolk polypeptides: lipovitellins (lipovitellin 1 ≅ 120 kDa; lipovitellin 2 ≅ 30 kDa) and phosvitins (28-35 kDa), which are ultimately associated with yolk platelets (4Byrne B.M.

Phosvitin is one of the most phosphorylated proteins found in nature: more than half of its residues are serines, and most of them are phosphorylated (4Byrne B.M. Gruber M. AB G. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

There is a progressive increase in the length of this domain from that in fishes up to that found in the chicken (4Byrne B.M. Gruber M. AB G. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

The high degree of phosphorylation of phosvitins allows these proteins to bind cations such as iron, magnesium, and calcium (16Flickinger R.A. Schjeide O.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1957; 13: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 17Greengard O. Sentenac A. Mendelsohn N. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4399-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, after vitellogenin endocytosis, tightly bound calcium is associated exclusively with the phosvitin domain (20Montorzi M. Falchuk K.H. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Montorzi M. Falchuk K.H. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10851-10858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This binding is usually of low affinity but high capacity, and it has long been proposed to play a role in providing embryos with calcium required for bone and tooth formation (13Nardelli D. Gerber-Huber S. van het Schip F.D. Gruber M. AB G. Wahli W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6397-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Wahli W. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 227-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In invertebrates, vitellogenins contain less phosphate and fewer serines than in vertebrates (1Kunkel J.G. Nordin J.H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Vol. 1. Pergamon Press plc, Oxford1985: 83-111Google Scholar, 4Byrne B.M. Gruber M. AB G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 53: 33-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence of different vitellogenins deduced from their cDNA, insect vitellogenins possess serine-rich stretches, but there is no evidence to show that these segments are removed inside the oocyte to produce an independent protein (5Romans P. Tu Z. Ke Z. Hagedorn H.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 939-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Chen J.-S. Cho W.-L. Raikhel A.S. J. Mol.

Sakurai M.T. Izumi S. Tomino S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, once inside the oocytes of insects, vitellogenin is called vitellin, but it does not suffer the proteolytic processing that generates a polyserine phosphoprotein like phosvitin in nonmammalian vertebrates. During their development, insects do not build structures that require a large amount of calcium, such as bones and teeth. The reduction of the phosphorylated calcium-binding domain in insect vitellogenins suggests that the capacity of these proteins for the storage of this ion in the oocyte is smaller than with vertebrates and that it may also occur by other mechanisms (26Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Although the requirement for calcium is also smaller, its homeostasis in growing oocytes and developing eggs is important for a number of events. Oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryo development are general calcium-mediated processes common to both vertebrate and invertebrate species (27Shiraishi K. Okada A. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Reinhard E. Yokoe H. Niebling K.R. Allbritton N.L. Kuhn M.A. Meyer T. Dev.

In this study, we undertook a search for other maternally derived phosphoproteins besides vitellin with properties appropriate for the functions mentioned above, either in the oocytes or later during egg development. Here we describe the isolation of a low molecular mass calcium-binding phosphoprotein from the oocytes and hemolymph of the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus that resembles phosvitin from nonmammalian vertebrates in its high serine content and in its ability to bind calcium. Insects were taken from a colony of R. prolixus maintained at 28°C and 70% relative humidity. Normal mated females were fed on rabbit blood at 3-week intervals. During 3 months, ≅4000 oocytes were removed from vitellogenic females and stored at −20°C. This was the rate-limiting step in RCBP 1The abbreviations used are: RCBPRhodnius calcium-binding phosphoproteinFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. purification. Five days after a blood meal, chorionated oocytes were dissected free of ovarian tissues and washed with ice-cold 0.15 M NaCl. Oocytes were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors with final concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml each soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and antipain; 1 mM benzamidine; 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffered with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); 10 mM NaF; 0.05 M NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; and 0.02% NaN3. Oocyte homogenate was frozen overnight and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and used as the starting material for the purification of phosphoprotein. Rhodnius calcium-binding phosphoprotein fast protein liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Hemolymph was collected usually on the fourth day after a blood meal in the presence of phenylthiourea (30-130 μg/ml), 5 mM EDTA, and the mixture of protease inhibitors described above. This material was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Fifty adult females were fed with rabbit blood enriched with 32Pi (109 cpm/ml of blood) (2Masuda H. Oliveira P.L. Insect Biochem. 1985; 15: 543-550Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using a special feeder (30Garcia E.S. Macarine J.D. Garcia M.L.M. Ubatuba F.B. An. Acad. Bras. Cienc. 1975; 47: 539-545Google Scholar). Oocytes and hemolymph were collected and processed as described above. Carrier-free 32Pi was purchased from the Comissão Nacional de Energia Nuclear (São Paulo, Brazil) and purified by ion-exchange column chromatography on Dowex 1X-10 (31de Meis L. Masuda H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2057-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Supernatants obtained from radioactive (≅300) and nonradioactive (≅4000) oocytes were combined and used as the starting material. To remove free 32Pi, supernatants were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM benzamidine). The dialysate was then applied to a Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column (2.0 × 128 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was eluted with a flow rate of 15 ml/h, and 2.5-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of 0.1 ml were counted in a liquid scintillation counter, and protein content was measured by absorbance at 280 nm. [32P]RCBP-containing fractions from the Sephadex G-75 column were pooled and applied to a DEAE Toyopearl 650 M column (1.4 × 24 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A, and a linear gradient of 100 ml containing 0.05-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A was developed. Protein content and radioactivity of fractions (0.1 ml) were measured as described above. Fractions containing [32P]RCBP were pooled and dialyzed extensively against deionized water at 4°C and then adjusted to 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) using 0.2 M Tris-HCl. The dialyzed material was then applied to a Mono Q 5/5 Hr FPLC column (1-ml bed volume; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The column was washed and developed with a two-step gradient (0-0.5 and 0.5-1 M NaCl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein content and radioactivity of fractions were measured as already described. Starting from 404 mg of oocyte homogenate, we obtained 0.26 mg of RCBP. Final protein yield was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taking into account the losses that occur during the purification procedures, RCBP composes 0.1-0.2% of total oocyte protein. Hemolymph from insects fed with radioactive and nonradioactive blood was combined. Free 32Pi was removed by dialysis overnight at 4°C against buffer A. The dialysate was combined with 1 ml of 10-fold concentrated buffer A and purified essentially as described for RCBP from oocytes. Since 32P-labeled hemolymph exhibits two low molecular mass 32P-labeled peaks on Sephadex G-75 chromatography (HP 1 and HP 2; see “Results”), these peaks were collected separately and purified further using DEAE Toyopearl 650 M and Mono Q 5/5 Hr FPLC columns for HP 1 and DEAE Toyopearl 650 M for HP 2 as described above for RCBP from oocytes. Starting from 500 mg (≅9 ml) of hemolymph protein, we obtained 0.1 mg of HP 1 and 0.1 mg of HP 2. The apparent molecular mass of RCBP purified from oocytes was determined in a Smart system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) as described (33Wallace R.A. Morgan J.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The following proteins were used as standards: ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), ribonuclease (13.7 kDa), cytochrome c (12.3 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Polyacrylamide gels (15 × 15 × 0.1 cm) were run in the presence of SDS (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) at a constant current of 20 mA. Gels were stained (35Hegenauer J. Ripley L. Nace G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C. The following molecular mass standards were used: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (98 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.3 kDa). The molecular mass of purified phosphoprotein was also determined under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) using 16.5% acrylamide gels in the presence of Tricine (36Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). In this system, myoglobin-derived peptides were used as molecular mass standards (Sigma, MW-SDS-17S kit). Purified RCBP from oocytes (1 nmol) was analyzed for its amino acid composition at the University of Arizona Biotechnology Protein Core Center using an ABI 420 A/H amino acid analyzer. The protein was hydrolyzed in vapor phase using 6 N HCl for 1 h at 155°C and then derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate to form phenylthiocarbamyl-derivatives, which were extracted and transferred to an on-line high pressure liquid chromatography apparatus for analysis at 254 nm. No corrections were made for losses during acid hydrolysis. [32P]RCBP (0.1 mg) was digested in 6 N HCl at 100°C for 2 h. The hydrolyzed sample was dried under vacuum in a Speed Vac concentrator and resuspended in 30 μl of deionized water. Paper electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9 using formic acid, acetic acid, and water (25:78:89, v/v) for 8 h (450 V, 15 mA). Phospho amino acid standards (phosphoserine, phosphotyrosine, and phosphothreonine) were run in parallel with the sample. The total amount of phosphate associated with RCBP was not determined due to the small amount of RCBP available. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes as described by Matsudaira (37Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography at −70°C. After localization, phosphoproteins were excised from membranes and microsequenced in the departmental protein microsequencing laboratory on a Porton 2095 microsequencer. Purified 32P-phosphoproteins (2-5 μg of protein, 20,000-50,000 cpm in 5 μl of 0.15 M NaCl) were injected into the hemocoel of vitellogenic females on the third day after a blood meal using a 5-μl Hamilton syringe. Insects were kept at 28°C until dissection; controls were kept in a flask maintained at 0°C in an ice bath. At the desired times, ovaries and other organs were dissected, extensively washed in Rhodnius physiological saline (38Maddrell S.H.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1969; 51: 71-97Google Scholar), and homogenized in 0.15 M NaCl, and the radioactivity incorporated in the different organs was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. Other conditions were as described (39Oliveira P.L. Gondim K.C. Guedes D.M. Masuda H. J. Insect. Physiol. 1986; 32: 859-866Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Qualitative calcium binding was assayed as described (40Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Briefly, after electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, membranes were washed for 1 h in three changes of a buffer containing 60 mM KCl, 10 mM imidazole (pH 6.8), and 5 mM MgCl2, followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature in the same buffer containing 45Ca obtained from DuPont NEN and adjusted to 0.25 μM (1 mCi/liter). Finally, membranes were washed with distilled water for 5 min, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film for 48 h at −70°C. These experiments were carried out using purified [32P]RCBP that had been stored at −20°C for 6 months to allow 32P decay. Under these conditions, no radioactivity from 32P could be detected on the film. The phosphoprotein could be detected only on membranes incubated with 45Ca. The stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding to purified RCBP was measured by the dot-blotting calcium binding assay (41Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Final concentrations of 45Ca ranging from 0.1 to 10 mM (specific activity = 200 cpm/nmol) in 10 mM imidazole (pH 6.8), 60 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2 were used. Nonspecific calcium binding was estimated using cytochrome c as described (41Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 45Ca bound specifically to RCBP was obtained by subtracting this nonspecific background from the total 45Ca bound to RCBP. When oocyte supernatant is fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 column, the major 32P label is associated predominantly with vitellin (fractions 60-80; Fig. 1A). A second peak of radioactivity in the low molecular mass range can also be detected (fractions 115-125). This 32P-labeled protein was further purified by chromatography on ion-exchange columns (Fig. 1, B and C). Under these conditions, RCBP emerges as a single peak on a Mono Q column (Fig. 1C) and is homogeneous as judged by both SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2).Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of oocyte RCBP purification. Samples from each step of the RCBP purification were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 6-22.5% polyacrylamide separating gel. A shows the gel stained with Coomassie Blue; B shows the 32P-labeled autoradiogram. Lane 1, high molecular mass standards; lane 2, dialyzed oocyte supernatant; lane 3, pooled fractions 115-125 from Sephadex G-75; lane 4, pooled fractions 90-105 from DEAE Toyopearl 650 M; lane 5, pooled fractions 25-30 from Mono Q; lane 6, low molecular mass standards. Prominent bands in lane 2 are vitellin subunits (2Masuda H. Oliveira P.L. Insect Biochem. 1985; 15: 543-550Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analytical gel filtration using purified RCBP reveals an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa (Fig. 3), although on Tricine/SDS-PAGE, it migrates as a band of ≅8 kDa. Anomalous mobility in SDS-PAGE is common to phosphoproteins and is related in part to the phosphorylation state of the molecule (33Wallace R.A. Morgan J.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Wallace R.A. Morgan J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RCBP partially dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase migrates in SDS-PAGE with higher molecular mass (data not shown). Thus, for this study, the 18-kDa value was assigned for RCBP. Analysis of RCBP amino acid composition (Table I) shows that serine alone accounts for 24% of the total number of residues and that Asx (asparagine plus aspartate) and Glx (glutamine plus glutamate) together compose about 23%. RCBP is poor in aromatic amino acids. The phosphoamino acids were identified by high-voltage electrophoresis of an acid hydrolysate of [32P]RCBP. Phosphoserine was the only phosphoamino acid detected (Fig. 4). Since RCBP phosphorylation occurred in vivo, the stoichiometry of serine phosphorylation could not be determined from these data.Table I.Amino acid composition of RCBP from oocytesAmino acidResidues/molAsx13.11Glx23.46Ser38.31Gly12.60His6.17Arg7.38Thr4.51Ala5.23Pro2.82Tyr0.52Val0.30Met10.67CysNDaND, not determined.Ile7.36Leu8.38Phe3.91Lys11.13TrpNDTotal155.86a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In analogy with other oocyte proteins from Rhodnius (39Oliveira P.L. Gondim K.C. Guedes D.M. Masuda H. J. Insect. Physiol. 1986; 32: 859-866Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 43Oliveira P.L. Kawooya J.K. Ribeiro J.M.C. Meyer T. Poorman R. Alves E.W. Walker F.A. Machado E.A. Nussenzveig R.H. Padovan G.J. Masuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), RCBP is also present in a hemolymphatic form. When hemolymph is chromatographed on Sephadex G-75 under the same conditions as those used for Fig. 1A, two 32P-labeled peaks of low molecular mass are found (Fig. 5). These are designated HP 1 and HP 2 (hemolymphatic phosphoproteins 1 and 2). Both peaks were purified further on ion-exchange columns (see legend to Fig. 5). Samples from each step of the purification of HP 1 and HP 2 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The autoradiography of the gels summarizes the purification steps (Fig. 5, B and C). The faster migrating band of the [32P]HP 1 preparation (Fig. 5B) has the same mobility as the [32P]RCBP isolated from oocyte and the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 6), thus suggesting that it may be a hemolymphatic form of RCBP. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of HP 2 differs from that of RCBP in five out of six positions (Fig. 6), and it has a slightly higher mobility (Fig. 5C).Fig. 6NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. Shown are the NH2-terminal primary structures of RCBP isolated from oocytes, the faster migrating band of HP 1 from hemolymph, and HP 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The next experiments were carried out to determine whether [32P]HP 1 or [32P]HP 2 found in the hemolymph could be a precursor of [32P]RCBP in the oocytes. Radiolabeled [32P]HP 1 and [32P]HP 2 were injected separately into the hemocoel of two different lots of vitellogenic females, and various organs were analyzed for 32P-phosphoprotein uptake. Fig. 7A shows that [32P]HP 1 is incorporated specifically by the ovaries, but not by the midgut or fat bodies. At 0°C, as expected, the uptake of protein is inhibited. [32P]HP 2 is not taken up by any of these organs. In a second set of experiments, purified [32P]RCBP from oocytes was injected into the hemocoel of vitellogenic females. Fig. 7B shows that [32P]RCBP is taken up from the hemolymph into the ovaries over a period of hours. The ovaries of insects 16 h after injection were homogenized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The homogenate has a phosphoprotein of the same molecular mass as [32P]RCBP (Fig. 7B, inset). This result indicates that the ovaries can take up [32P]RCBP from the hemolymph. The amino acid composition and the evidence of phosphorylation indicate that RCBP may be negatively charged in vivo. In the next experiments, we examined its ability to bind Ca2+ specifically in the presence of Mg2+. After SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8A), purified RCBP (32P-labeled RCBP allowed to decay for 6 months) was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with 0.25 μM45Ca for 5 min. Bovine brain calmodulin was included as a control. The autoradiogram shows 45Ca bound to both RCBP and calmodulin (Fig. 8B). On a second gel, RCBP and calmodulin that were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes but not exposed to 45Ca did not show any spots on the autoradiogram (Fig. 8C). This control shows that labeling observed in Fig. 8B is due to 45Ca bound to RCBP and not to residual 32P. The stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding to RCBP was determined by dot blotting, which uses less protein than other techniques (41Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The titration was carried out with a constant amount of phosphoprotein while varying the concentration of 45CaCl2 between 0.1 and 10 mM. Cytochrome c was used as a control for nonspecific 45Ca binding (41Chen Y. Bal B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immobilized on nitrocellulose discs, RCBP binds 80 mol of 45Ca/mol of protein (Fig. 9) with a K0.5 of 10−3M. On subtracting the binding to cytochrome c, we find 50 mol of 45Ca/mol of protein. Vitellin is the major protein in the oocytes of R. prolixus (2Masuda H. Oliveira P.L. Insect Biochem. 1985; 15: 543-550Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Oliveira P.L. Gondim K.C. Guedes D.M.

As a result of metabolic labeling in vivo, the amount of 32P covalently associated with each mole of RCBP is about five times higher than with vitellin (2Masuda H. Oliveira P.L.

Invertebrate vitellogenins have less covalently bound phosphate than their vertebrate counterparts (4Byrne B.M. Gruber M. AB G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 53: 33-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar); the serine clusters are shorter (4Byrne B.M. Gruber M. AB G. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Evol. 1991; 34: 478-492Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the total number of phosphorylated residues is not known. There is no evidence for proteolytic processing of Rhodnius vitellogenin after endocytosis. This study is the first to describe a low molecular mass phosphorylated polypeptide associated with insect oocytes. Together, these data suggest that RCBP is a polyserine phosphoprotein that resembles phosvitin of the nonmammalian vertebrates, although it does not appear to be a product of postendocytotic processing since it is already present in the hemolymph. RCBP from oocytes and HP 1 from hemolymph are specifically taken up by the ovaries (Fig. 7), suggesting that an RCBP precursor may be acquired by the oocyte during growth. In both cases, the uptake is a temperature-dependent process, and the molecular mass of the accumulated protein is the same as that of the injected material (Fig. 7B, inset). These observations are consistent with the vectorial transfer of protein from hemolymph to oocytes, which has been demonstrated previously for other yolk proteins (1Kunkel J.G. Nordin J.H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Vol. 1. Pergamon Press plc, Oxford1985: 83-111Google Scholar, 3Raikhel A.S. Dhadialla T.S. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 217-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In addition to Rhodnius vitellogenin, a heme-binding protein present in the hemolymph was also found in the oocytes (43Oliveira P.L. Kawooya J.K. Ribeiro J.M.C. Meyer T. Poorman R. Alves E.W.

Insect Biochem. 1992; 22: 293-304Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a high amount of calmodulin in the oocytes of Blatella germanica. Like RCBP, calmodulin is phosphorylated (47Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30039-30048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and binds calcium. Distinction between the two proteins in this study is based on amino acid composition (Table I), mobility on Tricine/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8A), and calcium binding affinity, which is much lower in RCBP (Fig. 9). The difference in calcium binding affinity of calmodulin and RCBP is due to the presence of the EF hand (48Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) motifs in the former, which confers the ability to bind calcium with high affinity. In RCBP, calcium probably binds to negatively charged amino acids and phosphorylated serines. There is no reason to suppose that the two proteins have similar roles. Calcium-binding phosphoproteins have been isolated and characterized from vertebrates (49Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Bergman T. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6125-6133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 50Sorensen E.S. Hojrup P. Petersen T.E.

The yolk proteins vitellogenin and phosvitin have both been shown to bind calcium (19Grizzuti K. Perlmann G.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4399-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Montorzi M. Falchuk K.H. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Montorzi M. Falchuk K.H. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10851-10858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In titration experiments, phosvitin binds up to 100 mol of calcium/mol of protein (19Grizzuti K. Perlmann G.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4399-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The calcium binding capacity of RCBP lies in the same range (Fig. 9). Preliminary evidence suggests that RCBP is utilized by developing embryos during the initial 10 days post-oviposition (data not shown), while only 10-15% of vitellin is used up in this period (44Oliveira P.L. Petretski M.D.A. Masuda H. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 489-498Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), during which katatrepsis is completed and the yolk is enclosed by the embryo (53Kelly G.M. Huebner E. Can. J. Zool. 1986; 64: 2425-2429Crossref Google Scholar). The extensive degradation of vitellin then occurs inside the digestive system, providing the nutrients for growth as classically proposed for the function of yolk proteins (44Oliveira P.L. Petretski M.D.A. Masuda H. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 489-498Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The difference in the timetable of vitellin and RCBP utilization suggests that these proteins may be localized in different compartments and may play different roles. During embryo development, the peripheral cell layer (blastoderm) gives rise to most cells of the body of the embryo (54Sander K. Gutzeit H.O. Jackle H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Vol. 1. Pergamon Press plc, Oxford1985: 319-385Google Scholar) and encloses the central yolk part where vitellin is located. It is tempting to speculate that RCBP could be utilized for embryo formation together with vitellin, but that the latter is used primarily for embryo growth. Since Rhodnius vitellin also binds calcium, based on dot-blotting experiments (data not shown), both vitellin and RCBP have the potential to contribute to embryo formation and/or growth. The contribution of each of these proteins remains to be investigated. Both are dephosphorylated during embryogenesis (data not shown), and they may release the associated calcium for events such as cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Although RCBP composes a minor amount of total oocyte protein, it could be an important source of intracellular calcium, depending on its localization in the oocyte. This is an important point and is now under investigation. We are currently raising antibodies against RCBP to immunolocalize this molecule inside the oocyte. Ultrastructural observations showing the rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum around the yolk platelets during oocyte maturation (55Jaffe L.A. Terasaki M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the detection of calcium in yolk platelets (56Cardasis C.A. Schuel H. Herman L. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 77: 101-115Google Scholar) have led to the suggestion that this ion may also be required for an early step of yolk storage. Thus, knowledge of the distribution of calcium within the oocyte will indicate in the future how RCBP acts during Rhodnius oogenesis and development. We thank Dr. José Marcos C. Ribeiro for arranging amino acid analyses at the University of Arizona; Dr. Martha M. Sorenson for a critical reading of the manuscript; and Rosane O. M. M. Costa, Lilian S. C. Gomes, Heloísa S. L.

The structure of both constructs has been examined as a function of the nature of the nucleotide intermediate occupying the active site by means of sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium, fluorescence solute quenching, fluorescence anisotropy decay, and limited proteolysis. While the molecular weight of monomeric and dimeric human kinesin constructs, as measured by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium, and the tryptic cleavage pattern are unaffected by the nucleotide intermediate occupying the active site, significant changes in the rotational correlation time of fluorescently labeled kinesin-nucleotide intermediates can be detected. These results suggest that kinesin contains an internal “hinge” whose flexibility varies through the course of the ATPase cycle. In prehydrolytic, “strong” binding states, this hinge is relatively rigid, while in posthydrolytic, “weak” binding states, it is more flexible. Our results, in conjunction with anisotropy decay studies of myosin, suggest that these two molecular motors may share a common structural feature; viz. weak binding states are characterized by segmental flexibility, which is lost upon assumption of a strong binding conformation.

https://openalex.org/W1981720615,"Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) antisense RNA results in a drastic reduction of EGF-R levels in the human carcinoma KB cell line and induces a reversion of their transformed phenotype (Moroni, M. C., Willingham, M. C., and Beguinot, L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2714-2722). We used parental and EGF-R antisense KB clones as a genetic system to study, in the same cell line, the role of transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) in the establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype. KB cells produce TGF-α mRNA, and their conditioned medium is able to sustain growth of antisense cells, mimicking the effect of exogenous EGF or TGF-α. In antisense cells there is a marked reduction of TGF-α mRNA steady-state levels. In addition, the decrease in TGF-α parallels the levels of residual EGF-R in the various antisense clones, indicating a direct correlation between receptors and growth factor levels. The addition of exogenous TGF-α (10 ng/ml) to antisense clones induces TGF-α levels. The half-life of TGF-α mRNA is 40-60 min in antisense cells and more than 8 h in parental KB cells, as determined by actinomycin D decay curves. This result indicates a predominant regulation of TGF-α mRNA at the post-transcriptional level. Nuclear run-on experiments show that there is only a marginal effect at the transcriptional level. We conclude that the autocrine loop responsible for the transformed phenotype of the human carcinoma KB cell line is dependent on both elevated levels of EGF-R and the presence of TGF-α. In addition, TGF-α is able to induce its own mRNA via a signal due to activation of the EGF-R acting predominantly at the post-transcriptional level.

An autocrine stimulatory loop sustaining transformation has been clearly demonstrated in a variety of cell lines in culture (2Nister M. Libermann T.A. Betsholtz C. Pettersson M. Claesson-Welsh L.

The autocrine loop requires the production and the correct expression of both the receptor and the growth factor by the same cell. Regardless of whether activation of the receptor by its ligand occurs intracellularly, both on their route to the plasma membrane, or at the cell surface, it is still a subject of debate. A similar autocrine loop is also present in KB cells as a result of the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF-Repidermal growth factor receptor(s)TGF-α or -βtransforming growth factor α or βTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumbpbase pairskbkilobase(s)GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHB-EGFheparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. together with expression of one of its physiological ligands, transforming growth factor α (TGF-α; 7). This loop is considered responsible for the serum-independent proliferation and the fully transformed phenotype of KB cells. Amplification and overexpression of the EGF-R have been shown in many tumors of epidermal origin; however, little evidence has been reported so far for the presence of a similar loop in human tumor growth in vivo (35Siddiqi I.

KB cells, derived from a human oral carcinoma, express about 2 × 105 EGF-R/cell and are tumorigenic when injected into nude mice. The stable expression of antisense EGF-R RNA in KB cells drastically reduces EGF-R levels and restores serum- and anchorage-dependent growth, reverting their transformed phenotype (1Moroni M.C. Willingham M.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2714-2722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results support the primary role played by the EGF-R in maintaining the transformed phenotype of this tumoral cell line. However, overexpression of the EGF-R alone is not sufficient to induce transformation unless the ligand is also provided (8Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C. Willingham M.C. Merlino G.T. Pastan I.

Since TGF-α mRNA is also produced in KB cells we have now investigated its role in maintaining the uncontrolled cell growth leading to the KB cell line transformed phenotype. Self-induction has been proposed to serve as a mechanism for signal amplification and has been observed for other growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, TGF-β, and interleukin 1 (11Paulsson Y.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the autonomous growth of KB cells is the result of an established autocrine circuit between the EGF-R and TGF-α, in which EGF-R overexpression mediates TGF-α mRNA induction. We also show that TGF-α induction in KB cells is mediated by a regulation acting predominantly at the post-transcriptional level and only marginally at the transcriptional level.

Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells grown to about 90% confluence in 100-mm dishes with regular medium were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated without or with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min at 37°C, washed three times with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA) containing freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate) for 15 min at 4°C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C (19Miloso M. Mazzotti M. Vass W.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19557-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Total proteins were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. For immunoprecipitation experiments total cellular lysates (4 mg of total protein) were incubated with polyclonal serum against EGF-R (antibody 2913) (20Beguinot L. Werth D. Ito S. Richert N. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1801-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 4 h at 4°C, and immunocomplexes were collected by binding to GammaBind G Sepharose 4B. Immunocomplexes were washed five times with an ice-cold buffer (HNTG) containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100; immunoprecipitates solubilized in 1 × Laemmli buffer were boiled and run on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunoblots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were then blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin-TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Blots were incubated for 2 h with monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine, washed in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with 125I-protein A for 1 h. Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film at −80°C with intensifying screen and developed. Quantitation was performed during the linear range of exposure using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. KB, AS FL-30, and control nuclei were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) from cells grown in regular medium. Nuclear run-on transcripts were labeled at 30°C for 30 min in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; 2.5 mM MgCl2; 150 mM KCl; 500 μM ATP, CTP, GTP; and 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, 20 mCi/ml) as described (21Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. 1 and 4. Wiley Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar). Hot nuclear transcripts were purified by the single-step RNA isolation method (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Filters were prehybridized for 2 h at 65°C in 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM TES (Sigma), pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, 0,2% SDS, and 200 μg/ml tRNA. Hybridization proceeded for 2 days at 65°C with the addition to the filters of equal amounts of radioactivity (4 × 106 cpm/ml). Posthybridization washes were performed at 65°C in 2 × SSPE followed by a 37°C wash in 2 × SSPE and 10 μg/ml RNase A. Expression of EGF-R antisense RNA drastically reduces EGF-R levels in human KB cells resulting in suppression of their transformed phenotype. Even in serum-supplemented medium, growth of antisense cells is slower and their doubling time longer than parental KB cells (36 versus 22 h) (1Moroni M.C. Willingham M.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2714-2722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, antisense clones AS 5-7, AS FL-13, and AS FL-30 fail to grow in defined medium; this property is overcome by exogenous addition of 20 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 1). On the contrary, parental KB cells grow in defined medium independent of the presence of EGF. This result suggests that parental KB cells produce an EGF-related molecule, which together with its receptor sustains an autocrine stimulatory loop. This autocrine loop is absent in antisense cells. In this case one would expect a constitutively activated EGF-R tyrosine kinase in KB cells. Indeed, in the absence of EGF, EGF-R autophosphorylation is detected in parental KB but not in AS FL-30 cells, even with a very long exposure of the autoradiogram (Fig. 2 lanes 1 and 3). In the presence of EGF, the EGF-R is autophosphorylated in both parental and AS FL-30 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). Quantitation of the autoradiogram shows that EGF-induced autophosphorylation in AS FL-30 was 18% of that in KB cells, which agrees with the lower residual EGF-R levels in the antisense clone (Table I). Similar results were obtained with antisense clones AS 5-7 and AS FL-13 (data not shown).Fig. 2EGF-R autophosphorylation in parental KB and antisense cells. KB (lanes 1 and 2) and AS FL-30 cells (lanes 3 and 4) were incubated with (lanes 2-4) and without (lanes 1-3) 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min at 37°C and lysates prepared. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-EGF-R (antibody 2913) run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody.

Open table in a new tab If KB cells produce a growth factor their conditioned medium might stimulate growth of antisense cells in the absence of exogenous EGF. AS 5-7 cells, which express 15% of residual EGF-R (Table I), were growth arrested by serum deprivation and then supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml) or KB-conditioned medium. As shown in Fig. 3, conditioned medium from parental KB cells is able to stimulate the growth of antisense cells and to mimic EGF-dependent growth. The growth factor present in KB cell medium most likely belongs to EGF family members such as TGF-α, EGF, amphiregulin, or betacellulin. Indeed, TGF-α mRNA has been detected previously in KB cells (23Derynck R. Goeddel D. Ullrich A. Gutterman J.U. Williams R.D. Bringman T.S. Berger W.H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 702-712Google Scholar). To examine the levels of TGF-α mRNA in KB and antisense cells total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, EGF-R antisense cells show a significant reduction of the 4.5-kb TGF-α mRNA compared with parental or mock-transfected KB cells. AS 5-7, AS FL-30, and AS FL-13 express, respectively, 15, 18, and 23% of TGF-α mRNA levels present in KB cells (Table I). Strikingly, TGF-α mRNA levels correlate well with EGF-R levels in the different clones (Table I). These findings suggest a precise correlation between EGF-R levels and TGF-α production similar to that described between residual EGF-R expression and severity of the transformed phenotype (1Moroni M.C. Willingham M.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2714-2722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF mRNA expression, however, is not detected in KB or antisense cells even after a long exposure of the autoradiogram (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). The 4.9-kb EGF transcript is, however, present in mouse salivary gland, used as a positive control (Fig. 5A, lane 3). In addition, the 3-kb and a longer transcript of betacellulin mRNA are only present in antisense-expressing cells but are not detected in parental KB cells (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). The same two transcripts are observed in the mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA used as a positive control (data not shown). Similarly, the 2.5-kb HB-EGF mRNA is expressed in antisense-expressing cells but only at low levels in parental KB cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). Both betacellulin and HB-EGF mRNA are present in a much lower amount compared with TGF-α. The production of TGF-α by KB cells might be sustained by an autostimulatory mechanism involving the EGF-R (24Coffey R.J. Graves-Deal R. Dempsey P.J. Whitehead R.H. Pittekow M.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 347-354PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bjorge J.D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4021-4027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mueller S.G. Kobrin M.S. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Conversely, the reduction of TGF-α mRNA levels in EGF-R antisense clones may be a consequence of reduced EGF-R expression, which interrupts the autocrine loop. To test this possibility we studied the effects of exogenous TGF-α on its own synthesis. As shown in the Northern blot of Fig. 6 (panel A), the addition of exogenous TGF-α to AS FL-30 cells results in increased steady-state expression of TGF-α mRNA. TGF-α stimulates production of its own mRNA within 4 h after the addition, peaking after 8 h (3-fold over basal expression) and decreasing thereafter (panel B). Similarly, exogenous TGF-α is able to increase TGF-α mRNA levels further in parental KB cells by about 3-4-fold (data not shown). Exogenous EGF is able to stimulate TGF-α mRNA levels as well (data not shown). To determine the level at which exogenous TGF-α increases the steady-state expression of TGF-α, the half-life of TGF-α was studied. Total RNA was extracted from AS FL-30 and parental cells treated for different times with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D and analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 7, parental KB cells display a prolonged stability of TGF-α mRNA compared with the EGF-R antisense cells within a 2-h frame. Later time points show that TGF-α transcript in KB and mock-transfected cells was stable for up to 6-8 h (data not shown). In the antisense clone, the half-life of the TGF-α transcript was approximately 40-60 min, similar to the c-myc transcript, whose regulation depends to a significant degree on rapid mRNA decay. The similarly rapid c-myc mRNA decay in KB, antisense (Fig. 7), and mock-transfected cells (data not shown) demonstrates the specificity of the differential decay of TGF-α. To investigate the mechanism underlying TGF-α mRNA stimulation by TGF-α, we have measured the effect of exogenous TGF-α on the half-life of the TGF-α transcript. The addition of TGF-α (10 ng/ml) to the AS FL-30 cells 8 h before the actinomycin D treatment results in a marked stabilization of TGF-α mRNA but has no effect on c-myc rapid decay (Fig. 8, panels A and B). This result supports the possibility of a TGF-α/EGF-R autocrine loop in parental KB cells acting through a post-transcriptional mechanism. TGF-α stimulation of its own mRNA is also independent of protein synthesis, as determined by cycloheximide experiments (data not shown). Nuclear run-on has also been performed to determine the TGF-α rate of transcription in KB and antisense cells. Quantitation of the data shown in Fig. 9, derived from three independent experiments, shows a less than 2-fold difference in the transcriptional rate of TGF-α RNA in KB versus antisense cells. A similar result is obtained when the amount of nascent TGF-α RNA was compared in mock-transfected and antisense cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results therefore suggest that TGF-α synthesis in KB cells is under a regulatory mechanism acting predominantly through a stabilization of the TGF-α transcript. In this report we used KB clones expressing EGF-R antisense RNA together with their parental cells as a genetic system in which the autocrine loop hypothesis of cell growth could be tested directly in the same cell line. We have demonstrated previously the primary role played by overexpression of EGF-R in the EGF-independent growth of KB cells (1Moroni M.C. Willingham M.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2714-2722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF-R antisense clones with the most reduced EGF-R expression, such as AS FL-30, AS FL-13, and AS 5-7, exhibit a totally restored serum-dependent growth and are unable to grow in the absence of serum and to form colonies in soft agar (1Moroni M.C. Willingham M.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2714-2722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal cells, EGF-R overexpression leads to transformation only when coexpressed with EGF or TGF-α (8Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C. Willingham M.C. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Lowy D.R. Science. 1987; 238: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 9Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Hazan R. Ullrich A. King C.R. Schlessinger J. Aaronson S.A.

KB cells express TGF-α, as shown by the presence of TGF-α mRNA in these cells and by the ability of KB-conditioned medium to sustain the growth of the EGF-R antisense cells and to mimic EGF-dependent growth. In addition, we have evidence of the presence of the 24-kDa TGF-α precursor in KB cell membranes, although we were unable to detect it in antisense-expressing cells (data not shown). Furthermore since EGF, betacellulin, and HB-EGF mRNA are not detectable or expressed at very low levels in parental KB cells, the growth-promoting activity detected in KB-conditioned medium is most likely due to the presence of TGF-α, although we cannot exclude the production of amphiregulin as well. Interestingly, although betacellulin and HB-EGF mRNA are expressed in antisense cells, these two growth factors do not seem to stimulate their growth, as demonstrated by the inability to grow in the absence of exogenous EGF or serum and the lack of basal EGF-R autophosphorylation. Future studies will elucidate the mechanism by which betacellulin and HB-EGF steady-state mRNA levels are increased in antisense cells. The decrease in state-steady TGF-α mRNA levels observed in the EGF-R antisense cells and the strong correlation among EGF-R, TGF-α expression, and transformed phenotype support the possibility that in these clones the autocrine circuit that leads to KB cell growth is impaired, leading to a reversion of the transformed phenotype. A similar autocrine loop is present in A431 cells (28Imanishi K. Yanaguchi K. Suzuki M. Honda S. Yanaihara N. Abe K. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 59: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) where receptor activation and autophosphorylation occur by endogenously produced and secreted TGF-α (29Van de Vijver M.J. Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 268: 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The finding that the most inhibited clones express reduced levels of not only EGF-R, but also TGF-α mRNA and most likely TGF-α protein, suggests that a signal responsible for TGF-α regulation is due to the activation of the EGF-R by TGF-α. Coffey et al. (24Coffey R.J. Graves-Deal R. Dempsey P.J. Whitehead R.H. Pittekow M.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 347-354PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that treatment of human keratinocytes with TGF-α stimulates expression of its own mRNA. The finding that treatment of EGF-R antisense clones with exogenous TGF-α also stimulates TGF-α mRNA expression suggests that the difference in TGF-α mRNA levels between AS FL-30 and parental KB cells may be the result of the inability of low levels of TGF-α, in the EGF-R antisense cells, to stimulate the few residual EGF-R and thus to induce its own mRNA. The TGF-α induction mechanism in KB cells occurs mostly at the post-transcriptional level because of a prolonged stability of the transcript and only minimally at the transcriptional level, since a low increased transcriptional rate is also observed. The half-life of TGF-α mRNA is more than 8 h in parental KB and mock-transfected cells but less than 1 h in AS FL-30 cells. Our results are in agreement with the long half-life of TGF-α mRNA in another carcinoma cell line, the MDA 468 (25Bjorge J.D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4021-4027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses about two million EGF-R/cell and with a very short half-life in normal human keratinocytes and LIM 1215 cells, with very low levels of EGF-R (24Coffey R.J. Graves-Deal R. Dempsey P.J. Whitehead R.H. Pittekow M.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 347-354PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous TGF-α to the antisense clones produces TGF-α transcript stabilization. Interestingly, in KB cells, stabilization of the EGF-R mRNA by EGF was also observed, but the specific mechanism responsible for receptor transcript stabilization has not been further elucidated (30Jinno Y. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additional studies are now in progress to study whether the two mechanisms share similar signal transduction pathways and to address their contribution in the uncontrolled KB cell proliferation. The TGF-α is encoded by a 4.5-kb mRNA (23Derynck R. Goeddel D. Ullrich A. Gutterman J.U. Williams R.D. Bringman T.S. Berger W.H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 702-712Google Scholar) which is the predominant transcript in cells expressing this growth factor. A less represented 1.6-kb mRNA and minor species of 3.8, 3.2, and 2.4 kb have also been described (28Imanishi K. Yanaguchi K. Suzuki M. Honda S. Yanaihara N. Abe K. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 59: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Malden L.T. Novak U. Burgess A.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Todd R.

Kyo E. Tsujino T. Sano T. Niimoto M. Tahara E. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of several transcription start points, alternative use of distinct polyadenylation signals seems to generate this transcript varieties, as shown for the 4.5- and 1.6-kb species (34Qian J.F. Lazar-Wesley E. Breugnot C. May E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In KB cells, as in other transformed cell lines, the predominant 4.5-kb transcript is detected together with a minor 1.6-kb mRNA and two minor species of 3.8 and 2.4 kb (data not shown). The presence of 13 AUUUA sequences in the TGF-α 3′-untranslated region could account for a differential regulation of stability for the different transcripts. Additional experiments are in progress to evaluate the role played by alternative polyadenylation sites on TGF-α mRNA stability and therefore on TGF-α expression in the parental and EGF-R antisense cells.

(1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12873-12880). CaD thus purified co-sediments with actin, inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity, and interacts with Ca2+/calmodulin, similarly to the unheated protein. On the other hand, heat-treated CaD binds to actin filaments in a tether-like fashion, whereas lengthwise binding dominates in vivo (Mabuchi, K., Lin, J. J.-C., and Wang, C.-L. A. (1993) J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 14, 54-64), suggesting that differences do exist between heat-purified CaD and the native protein. We have isolated, without heat treatment, full-length recombinant chicken gizzard CaD overexpressed in insect cells (High-Five™) using a baculovirus expression system. We found that such unheated CaD interacts with calmodulin 10 times stronger than does the heated CaD; its inhibitory action on actomyosin ATPase is reversed by a much lesser amount of calmodulin. Moreover, electron microscopic examination indicated that actin binding at the N-terminal region is more frequent in the unheated CaD, resulting in more lengthwise binding. These findings point to the fact that CaD is not entirely heat-stable; the C-terminal CaM-binding regions and the N-terminal actin-binding region are possibly affected by heat treatment. Smooth muscle caldesmon (CaD) exhibits apparent heat stability. A widely used purification procedure of CaD involves extensive heat treatment (Bretscher, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12873-12880).

Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and Matsumura and Yamashiro (20Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. Curr. Opin.

In vitro CaD inhibits the actomyosin ATPase activity, and this inhibition is reversible by Ca2+/CaM. An inhibitory role of CaD in vivo was also implicated by the observation that an 18-residue CaM-binding CaD peptide (GS17C), which also binds actin in a manner similar to the intact protein, is able to induce force in a permeabilized smooth muscle cell, presumably by nudging off the endogenous CaD from its inhibitory position (Katsuyama et al.,11Katsuyama H. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that CaD regulates smooth muscle contraction by a troponin-like mechanism (Marston et al., 19Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. J. Biol.

CaD, when free in solution, is extremely sensitive to proteolysis. Because of its apparent heat stability, a widely used purification procedure of CaD involves extensive heat treatment (Bretscher, 2Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lynch and Bretscher, 14Lynch W. Bretscher A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Upon boiling for 10-15 min most of the proteins in the tissue homogenate, including proteases, precipitate, and are thereby easily removed by centrifugation, resulting in a protein preparation that is relatively stable in the absence of Ca2+. Since the secondary structure of CaD undergoes reversible helix-coil transition upon heating (Graceffa and Jancsó, 6Graceffa P. Jancsó A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 37Wang C.-L.A. Chalovich J.M. Graceffa P. Lu R.C. Mabuchi K. Stafford W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13958-13963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is generally accepted that thermally unfolded CaD would return to its “native” conformation upon cooling. CaD thus purified retains its capacity to co-sediment with actin, to interact with Ca2+/CaM, as well as the ability to inhibit the actomyosin ATPase activity. On the other hand, heat-purified CaD binds to reconstituted actin filaments in a tether-like fashion, whereas lengthwise binding appears to dominate in the native thin filament (Lehman et al., 12Lehman W.

We were able to do this rather easily, probably because of the much lower proteolytic activities present in these cells. We found that such unheated CaD binds CaM with an affinity that is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of CaD purified with heat treatment. More interestingly, electron microscopy indicates stronger actin binding at the N-terminal region, in comparison to the heated CaD. This finding indicates possible existence of an additional, heatlabile, actin-binding site in the N-terminal region of CaD, and also raises the possibility that the difference previously observed in the binding modes between the native and the reconstituted systems can be explained, at least partly, by alterations of CaD by heating. 500 ml of High-Five™ cells (Invitrogen) at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml were grown in suspension in a 1-liter spinner (CYTOSTIR, Knotes) in Ex-cell 405 medium (JRH Bioscience) at 28°C for 24 h with stirring at 60 rpm. The cells were infected with pVLCaD viral stock (a gift from Dr. J. Bryan) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The infected cells were harvested at maximal expression (48 h after infection). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (100 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM PMSF, 5 μM leupeptin), frozen and thawed twice, and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was, after addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mM, loaded onto a CaM-Sepharose 4B column. The column was washed with buffer B (100 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.25 mM PMSF, 5 μM leupeptin), followed by elution with 5 mM EDTA in buffer B. Fractions containing CaD, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were eluted with a 0.1-0.6 M NaCl gradient in buffer C (0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mM PMSF, 5 μM leupeptin). The purity of CaD (eluted at ∼0.2 M NaCl) was examined by SDS-PAGE. The overall yield was ∼20 mg/liter of cells. CaD was also purified after heat treatment; the procedure was the same as described above, except for a 2-min boiling of the cell suspension in buffer A after freeze and thaw. Heating had little effect on the yield. For the concentration determination of purified CaD, an extinction coefficient of E280 nm1% = 3.3 was used (Graceffa et al.,7Graceffa P. Wang C.-L.A.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 218: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were purified from chicken gizzard. Purified smooth muscle myosin was phosphorylated by MLCK as described previously (Zhuang et al.,40Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding of CaM to both heated and unheated recombinant CaD was studied by adding aliquots of the CaM stock solution (190 μM) to 0.6 ml of a solution containing 1-3 μM CaD in 50 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM PIPES, pH 6.9, and monitoring the tryptophan emission (λex = 295 nm; λem = 320 nm) of CaD on a Perkin-Elmer MPF-4 fluorimeter. The titration data were fitted to a binding equation as described previously (Zhuang et al., 40Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Mg-ATPase activities of the actomyosin complex were measured as described previously (Zhuang et al., 40Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylated chicken gizzard myosin (∼2 μM), rabbit skeletal F-actin (12 μM), chicken gizzard tropomyosin (1.7 μM) were mixed in a solution containing the following reagents: 60 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 4 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM CaCl2; 0.5-2 μM heated or unheated recombinant CaD, or conventionally prepared gizzard native CaD was added to achieve inhibition, and 4-24 μM CaM was used to restore the activity. Total reaction mixture was 250 μl. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 40 min at 25°C before termination with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the amount of inorganic phosphate in the supernatant was determined (Fiske and Subbarow,4Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Heated or unheated CaD (50 μg/ml, or ∼0.6 μM) was first labeled with monoclonal anti-CaD (C18, 75 μg/ml, a gift of Dr. J. J.-C. Lin), in a solution containing 0.1 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, 15% glycerol and 0.2 mM DTT. This antibody reacts with the N-terminal 28-kDa fragments and is specific to CaD (Lin et al.,13Lin J.J.-C. Davis-Nanthakumar E.J. Jin J.-P. Lourim D. Novy R.E. Lin J.L.-C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Labeled CaD was diluted into an F-actin solution (final concentrations: 60 nM actin, 6 nM CaD, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 to 0.25 M ammonium acetate, and 30% glycerol). The proteins were adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica surface and processed for rotary shadowing by a method described previously (Mabuchi, 15Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in which the mica was floated on a protein solution to adsorb the proteins without the use of spraying. The specimens were observed with a Philips EM 300 electron microscope at 60 kV. For a statistical analysis of CaD binding to F-actin, anti-CaD molecules on or very near actin filaments (within 20 nm, or 3 mm at a magnification of × 150,000; judged as linearly bound), as well as those appeared within ∼70 nm from the filament (tethered), were counted as “bound” CaD/anti-CaD complexes. The ratio of bound CaD to actin was estimated by tallying the number of bound CaD/anti-CaD complexes on a given length of actin filament using a value of 14 actin subunits per 37 nm of the filament. For the histogram (see Fig. 6), distances between the far edge of the anti-CaD molecules and the nearest actin filaments were measured and plotted (using KaleidaGraph, v. 3.04; Abelbeck). During the course of this studies we noticed that the densitiy of the recombinant CaD on electron micrographs was far less than expected based on the optical density or the staining of SDS-gel bands. This discrepancy was due to the presence of large aggregates which precipitated upon incubation with anti-CaD; we also found that the use of 50 mM DTT during purification reduced aggregate formation. However, oligomerization at smaller scales was difficult to prevent, particularly for the heated preparations. To check the quality of CaD molecules such as density or aggregates, the specimen was examined at higher concentrations (0.25 M) of ammonium acetate (see Fig. 4). The properties of cell lines are important in works involving baculovirus expression vectors. The cell that is most commonly used with AcMNPV-based vectors is Sf-9 cell line. Full-length recombinant chicken gizzard CaD has previously been overexpressed in Sf-9 cells and purified by conventional procedures that includes a heating step; the insect cell-expressed CaD exhibited identical biochemical properties as CaD purified from gizzard (Wang et al., 38Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Jacob S.S. Gopalakurup S. Chacko S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 646-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this report we took advantage of the High-Five™ cell line (BTI-TN-5B1-4) that has recently become commercially available. Compared to Sf-9 cells, High Five™ cells have shorter doubling time and offer high expression levels for many recombinant proteins (Phillips et al., 25Phillips J.E. Cooper S.T. Potter E.E. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16696-16700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insect cell-expressed CaD, purified without heat treatment by a two-step procedure (see “Materials and Methods”), was reasonably pure on SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1), and analytical ultracentrifugation showed a single Gaussian peak with a sedimentation coefficient s20,w0 = 2.9 S (data not shown), corresponding to a monomeric molecular mass (Mapp) of ∼88,000. Overexpressed CaD inside the insect cells appeared to be in aggregated forms, which could be broken up by treatment with high concentrations (e.g. 50 mM) of DTT in the extraction buffer and 1 mM DTT in the subsequent buffers. CaD was originally identified as a CaM-binding protein (Sobue et al.,31Sobue K. Muramoto Y. Fujita M. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5652-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies on the CaD-CaM interactions by various methods yielded an affinity at around μM range (Malencik et al., 17Malencik D.A. Ausio J. Byles C.E. Modrell B. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8227-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar Pritchard and Marston, 1989; Shirinsky et al., 28Shirinsky V.P. Bushueva T.L. Frolova S.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar; Smith et al., 30Smith C.W.J. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, since binding is accompanied by a conformational change in CaD that increases its tryptophan fluorescence intensity, by monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence change, the binding constant was determined to be 1.8 × 106M−1 (Shirinsky et al., 27Pritchard K. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A C-terminal synthetic peptide, GS17C, also binds CaM with a similar affinity (Zhan et al.,39Zhan Q. Wong S.S. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21810-21814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a weaker affinity relative to other CaM targets (e.g. MLCK, Kass = 109M−1) (see Blumenthal et al., 1Blumenthal D.K. Takio K. Edelman A.M. Charbonneau H. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3187-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) has raised concerns whether or not there is enough CaM in the cell to allow CaM-CaD interactions to be physiologically relevant (Marston and Redwood, 1991). These concerns have led some laboratories to yet inconclusive searches for other Ca2+-binding proteins that would exhibit higher affinities for CaD (Pritchard and Marston,26Pritchard K. Marston S.B. Carraro U. Sarcomeric and Non-Sarcomeric Muscles: Basic and Applied Research Prospects for the 90's. Unipress Padova, Padova, Italy1988: 649-654Google Scholar). On the other hand, despite its lower association constant, CaM's regulatory action may still be accomplished by a relatively rapid on-rate of binding to CaD, as demonstrated by kinetic studies (Kasturi et al.,9Kasturi R. Vasulka C. Johnson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7958-7964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined the interactions between CaM and recombinant CaD by monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence of CaD. Both the heated and unheated CaD were titrated with CaM, and the fluorescence changes were analyzed by curve fitting to a binding equation (Morris and Lehrer, 22Morris E.P. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The binding constant for the heated CaD was (2.3 ± 0.3) × 106M−1, in agreement with previous studies of heated gizzard CaD (Shirinsky et al., 1988); other parameters include the apparent stoichiometry n = 0.76 ± 0.08, and the overall fluorescence enhancement (F/F0)max = 3.05 ± 0.04 (Fig. 2). The binding constant for the unheated CaD, on the other hand, was found to be (2.0 ± 0.9) × 107M−1 (n = 0.69 ± 0.10; (F/F0)max = 2.18 ± 0.03; see Fig. 2). Thus CaD purified without heat treatment interacts with CaM one order of magnitude more strongly than that prepared by boiling. The simplest explanation is that CaM-binding of CaD is weakened by heating; such an effect may result from a heat-induced, apparently irreversible, conformational change in the C-terminal portion of the CaD molecule. This would also suggest that the CaM-CaD interaction has a better chance to play a physiologically significant role. It should be pointed out that several earlier studies also utilized CaD prepared without heating (Bretscher, 1984; Ngai and Walsh, 23Ngai P.K. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13656-13659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Sobue et al., 33Sobue K. Takahashi K. Wakabayashi I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although quantitative measurements of the affinity for CaM have been lacking. The only detailed report using unheated CaD (from sheep aorta) yielded a binding affinity of 0.8 × 106M−1 (Smith et al., 1987); but since the reported purity of this preparation by a rather lengthy procedure was only 70-80% (Smith and Marston, 29Smith C.W.J. Marston S.B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it can not be ruled out that the observed weaker CaD-CaM interaction was due to proteolysis during purification. It is known that CaD is extremely susceptible to proteolysis; in fact one of the major gains of the heat treatment was to rapidly remove the proteases, so that a better yield could be achieved. Apparently High-Five™ cells contain much less proteases than gizzard smooth muscle cells, thus allowing us to purify CaD without heating. Unheated recombinant CaD inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin more effectively than both the heat-treated recombinant CaD and chicken gizzard CaD (Fig. 3A). For the same amount of added CaD, the unheated protein consistently resulted in a greater inhibition than the heated proteins. The inhibition caused by either heated or unheated CaD was reversed by Ca2+/CaM, but the efficiency of such reversal appeared to be different between the two cases. A mere 1-fold excess of total CaM resulted in about 70% recovery of the inhibited ATPase activity caused by unheated CaD, whereas a 4-fold excess of CaM was needed to achieve the same level of deinhibition when the heated CaD was used (Fig. 3B), as shown by much of the earlier reports. That CaM is able to reverse the inhibition induced by unheated CaD at a lower concentration is consistent with its observed higher affinity toward the unheated CaD. It has become apparent that the molecular mechanism involved in the inhibitory effect of CaD on the actomyosin interaction and its reversal by Ca2+/CaM is more complicated than the previously suggested “flip-flop” model (Sobue et al., 32Sobue K. Morimoto K. Inui M. Kanda K. Kakiuchi S. Biomed. Res. 1982; 3: 188-196Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). There are experimental data indicating that even an excess amount of CaD fails to completely inhibit the smooth muscle actomyosin ATPase activity (Nomura and Sobue, 24Nomura M. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar; Sobue et al., 1985), and that the pattern of CaM-induced deinhibition is not always parallel to the binding of CaM to CaD (Pritchard and Marston, 1989). While a more satisfactory mechanism for the deinhibition is still to emerge, the true picture may have been obscured by the varying quality of the purified CaD itself. From this study it is clear that, compared to the conventionally prepared CaD, unheated CaD is more effective in both inhibiting the actomyosin ATPase activity and being de-inhibited by CaM, indicating that either heating itself or the cooling process following the heat treatment may cause alterations in the functional properties of CaD. To visualize the molecular shape of unheated CaD, insect cell-expressed CaD, and F-actin were first mixed in high salt (0.25 M ammonium acetate) and examined by electron microscopy. We found that a globular structure appeared at the C terminus (arrows at the end opposite to the bound antibody; Fig. 4A) of many unheated CaD, including those isolated from chicken gizzard (Fig. 4C, arrows), 2P. Graceffa, unpublished results. but rarely seen for the heated proteins (Fig. 4B). As there was no detectable difference between heated and unheated CaD in their SDS-gel electrophoretograms, it is unlikely that such a globular structure represents another bound protein. Moreover, since the globular structure was not detected when examined by the spray method (data not shown), which is known to generate strong shearing force, it is quite possible that the C-terminal region of unheated CaD is indeed globular but flexible enough to be deformed by heating or shearing force. The change in the molecular shape of the C-terminal region of CaD may be related to the observed difference in the affinity toward CaM. Also noted was that many unheated CaD remained unbound and only a few molecules were closely associated with the actin filament (Fig. 4A). There appeared to be more CaD/anti-CaD complexes associated with actin filaments when heated CaD was used (Fig. 4B). This apparently higher degree of binding, however, may have resulted from the fact that heated recombinant CaD easily formed oligomers (asterisks). Because of the aggregation problem, these samples were deemed not suitable for the analysis of actin-binding by electron microscopy, and CaD purified from chicken gizzard with heating was used instead (see below). There also appeared some differences between heated and unheated CaD in actin binding. Such differences mainly occurred in the N-terminal region of CaD. We found that the N-terminal region of unheated CaD exhibited stronger actin binding than that of the heated CaD. To quantitatively describe the difference in actin binding, we have carried out a statistical analysis of the location of the anti-N terminus antibody in the electron micrograph. As the heated, insect-expressed CaD was unsuitable for this analysis owing to oligomer formation (see above and Fig. 4), conventionally purified chicken gizzard CaD was used instead as a comparison. This is not unreasonable in view of the fact that biochemical studies indicated no differences between the two heat-treated CaD preparations (Wang et al., 1994). In doing so, we assumed that antibodies on or very near the actin filaments (Fig. 5, A and B, arrowheads) represent CaD bound at its N terminus, while those slightly away from the filaments, but within a distance corresponding to the length of a CaD molecule (∼70 nm), represent CaD bound at its C terminus. Examination of a total of ∼1400 (unheated recombinant CaD) and ∼2000 (heated gizzard CaD) antibody/CaD molecules indicated that ∼60% of unheated CaD, but only ∼30% of heat purified CaD, bind at its N terminus, as exemplified in Fig. 5, A and B. To avoid subjective judgment in describing the distribution of anti-CaD, we have measured the distances between the far edge of antibody molecules and the nearest actin filaments in Fig. 5 (magnification of × 150,000) and plotted these distances on histograms (Fig. 6). The results clearly demonstrate that there are more antibodies on or very near the actin filament in the unheated sample (Fig. 6B) than the heated one (Fig. 6A). The abrupt drop of antibody counts at 10 mm (corresponding to ∼70 nm) in both CaD preparations is reasonable for the distribution of the bound CaD considering its dimension. Since the epitope of this antibody is in the N-terminal region of CaD, the higher degree of close association between the antibody and actin filament indicates that unheated CaD is likely to bind actin in a more lengthwise manner than heated CaD. On the other hand, when compared with the heated sample (Fig. 6A), the unheated CaD preparation (Fig. 6B) exhibited a greater number of antibody molecules much farther away from the filaments, which obviously are the free CaD molecules, thus indicating a smaller fraction of bound CaD. An estimate of the stoichiometry of bound CaD to actin by counting the average number of anti-CaD molecules on a unit length of actin filament yielded 1 CaD per ∼14 actin subunits for the heated CaD and 1 CaD per ∼20 actin subunits for the unheated CaD. Such a difference in the stoichiometry may be explained by the lengthwise binding of the unheated CaD which results in fewer available binding sites along the actin filament. Further studies are needed to verify this point. There have been three groups showing independently that purified CaD forms tether-like structure when it binds to actin filaments (Katayama and Ikebe,10Katayama E. Ikebe M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2419-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Mabuchi et al., 1993; Moody et al., 21Moody C. Lehman W. Craig R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, while the two earlier reports acknowledged that tethering might be artificial, the more recent one (Katayama and Ikebe, 1995) argued that tethered binding is the only way CaD associates with actin filaments. It is known that freshly prepared thin filaments do not bundle, whereas aged samples do. Since bundling activity could result from the ability of tethered CaD to cross-link actin filaments, it is conceivable that some CaD molecules in the native thin filaments that have been handled improperly or stored too long become tethered form. Similar phenomenon may account for the observations made with the reconstituted filaments using heated CaD. We have previously shown that both ends of heat-purified CaD could tether to actin filaments in vitro, although the majority of binding occurred at the C-terminal region (Mabuchi et al., 1993). In contrast, native thin filaments isolated from chicken gizzard did not show any sign of tethering of CaD (Mabuchi et al., 1993), indicating that the N-terminal region of CaD in situ is not projecting away from actin filaments. Therefore, it was proposed that the N-terminal portion of intact CaD may actually interact with actin filaments strongly enough to confer a lengthwise binding, instead of tethered binding as seen in the reconstituted system. This difference raises the possibility that the structure of the N-terminal region of CaD may be altered during purification, such as heat treatment. Our finding of the unheated CaD indeed supports this hypothesis. We have shown that it is possible to purify CaD more readily from insect cells using the baculovirus expression system by a two-step procedure without heat treatment. Compared to the similarly prepared CaD from smooth muscle tissues, the recombinant protein offers much less aggregation, lower proteolysis, and therefore, a much higher yield. More significantly, such unheated CaD exhibits more lengthwise binding to actin filaments than heat-treated CaD, suggesting that, although the majority of the structural characteristics of CaD is heat-resistant, there are certain subtle, heat-labile elements, such as an additional actin-binding site in the N-terminal region of CaD. Also affected by heating is the tertiary folding in the C-terminal domain, which confers a stronger interaction with CaM, thus allowing CaM to function as a physiological regulator for CaD's inhibitory effect. These results suggest that full-length recombinant CaD purified without heat treatment alleviates complications owing either to improper renaturation after heating or to proteolysis when purified from tissues and not using heating, thus offering a better and more consistent quality of preparations. Furthermore, the difference previously observed in the binding modes between the native and the reconstituted systems can also be explained without invoking another protein component."

Transcription of the murine gene from two initiation sites generates two Bf mRNA species differing in size and tissue distribution.

To ascertain the functional consequences of this polymorphism in the Bf promoter, we analyzed the effects of strain-specific sequences in the Bf 5′ region on the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene transfected in human and mouse hepatoma cells. The CAT activity and mRNA level produced when transcription was driven by the sequence of strains with high extrahepatic expression were reduced to background levels when the sequence specific to the low expressor strains was used.

Bf is a positive acute phase reactant in that its hepatic synthesis and serum level are increased during the acute phase of the inflammatory response (19Colten H.R. Strunk R.C. Whaley K. Loos M. Weiler J.M. Complement in Health and Disease. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Lancaster, UK1993: 127-158Crossref Google Scholar). Extrahepatic biosynthesis of Bf and other complement components has also been documented in cell lines of nonhepatic origin and in vivo (19Colten H.R. Strunk R.C. Whaley K. Loos M. Weiler J.M. Complement in Health and Disease. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Lancaster, UK1993: 127-158Crossref Google Scholar, 20Naughton M.A. Botto M. Carter M.J. Alexander G.J.M. Goldman J.M. Walport M.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3051-3056PubMed Google Scholar). Extrahepatic Bf expression is usually low constitutively, but it is markedly up-regulated under inflammatory conditions by bacterial endotoxin and by cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ in many cell lines and tissues (17Falus A. Beuscher H.U. Auerbach H.S. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 856-860PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nonaka M. Ishikawa N. Passwell J. Natsuume-Sakai S. Colten H.R. J.

Immunol. 1985; 135: 3645-3647PubMed Google Scholar). The extrahepatic production of complement may be of biological importance especially at early stages of inflammation. In the mouse, the kidney is by far the major extrahepatic site of Bf mRNA constitutive expression (18Nonaka M. Ishikawa N. Passwell J. Natsuume-Sakai S. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1377-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ramadori G. Sipe J.D. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3645-3647PubMed Google Scholar), although Bf mRNA is constitutively present to some extent in many other nonhepatic tissues. Two mRNAs differing in size (2.4 and 2.7 kb) are transcribed from the murine Bf gene as a result of alternative transcriptional initiation at two sites separated by 302 bp (18Nonaka M. Ishikawa N. Passwell J. Natsuume-Sakai S. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1377-1382PubMed Google Scholar). The downstream transcriptional initiation site (DIS) is located 105 bp 5′ to the Bf open reading frame at a position homologous to that of the human gene (12Nonaka M. Gitlin J.D. Colten H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 89: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The upstream initiation site (UIS) is only 88 bp 3′ to the polyadenylation site of the C2 gene (18Nonaka M. Ishikawa N. Passwell J. Natsuume-Sakai S. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1377-1382PubMed Google Scholar). The two Bf mRNA species are present in equal amounts in kidney or intestine, but in the liver, the short mRNA represents at least 95% of Bf transcription products (18Nonaka M. Ishikawa N. Passwell J. Natsuume-Sakai S. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1377-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ishikawa N. Nonaka M. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19040-19046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bf up-regulation during inflammation is accounted for by a preferential increase of expression of the short transcript (18Nonaka M. Ishikawa N. Passwell J. Natsuume-Sakai S. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1377-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 27Passwell J. Schreiner G.F. Nonaka M. Beuscher H.U. Colten H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1676-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which in turn is translated at approximately twice the rate of the long transcript (29Garnier G. Circolo A. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3275-3282PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, extrahepatic Bf expression is up-regulated by the cooperative effects of transcriptional and translational controls. Although the C2-Bf intergenic region is highly conserved between mouse and human (12Nonaka M. Gitlin J.D. Colten H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 89: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a longer Bf mRNA has not yet been found in humans. In certain inbred strains (e.g. H-2f and H-2z MHC haplotypes), both Bf mRNA species are expressed at very low levels in the kidney and intestine, compared with other strains (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This phenotypic difference correlates with DNA sequence polymorphism in the 5′ region of the Bf gene that includes the disruption of a binding site for liver and kidney nuclear protein(s) at the UIS in the low expressor strains (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hepatic expression of Bf in these strains is similar to that in other strains including those with high extrahepatic Bf expression. Cis elements required for Bf up-regulation by cytokines have been mapped in the 5′-flanking regions of the mouse (12Nonaka M. Gitlin J.D. Colten H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 89: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Nonaka M. Huang Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6283-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and human (12Nonaka M. Gitlin J.D. Colten H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 89: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Wu L.C. Morley B.J. Campbell R.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 331-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) genes. However, the molecular mechanisms and transcription factors involved in the control of constitutive and tissue-specific expression of the Bf gene have not yet been identified. In this study, we demonstrate the functional relevance of the sequence polymorphism in the 5′ region of the murine Bf gene in Bf transcription. Differential interaction of the upstream promoter with HNF-4, resulting from the point substitution near the UIS, appears to be the major determinant in extrahepatic strain-specific Bf expression. Bf-CAT constructs were prepared and analyzed according to standard cloning and sequencing procedures (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using Promega enzymes (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and a Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by a PCR-Mate DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Polymerase chain reactions were performed in a Tempcycler (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI) using Perkin-Elmer AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and reagents (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). Bf genomic clones (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) from B10.PL (high expressor) and B10.M (low expressor) mouse strains were used as DNA templates to generate strain-specific Bf 5′-flanking sequences by PCR. The plasmid pCAT-0, a subclone of pSV0-CAT in pBluescript-II SK(+) (32Kawamura N. Singer L. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (from which the EcoRI site in the 3′ polylinker was deleted) was used as PCR template for the CAT sequence and as vector for subcloning. Strain-specific 5′ sequences of the murine Bf gene, extending from −728 to +105, the positions preceding the first in-frame ATG (numbering refers to the nucleotide positions relative to the DIS), were linked 5′ to the first 214 bp of the CAT open reading frame by overlap extension PCR (33Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). The chimeric PCR products, containing an engineered XbaI 5′ cloning site and the internal EcoRI site of the CAT gene at the 3′ end were then ligated with the corresponding sites of pCAT.0, yielding the Bf-CAT constructs pBfPL-CAT (high expressor) and PBfM-CAT (low expressor). A mutant pBf-CAT.M1 was generated (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) by substituting T to C at −299 in pBfPL-CAT. Upstream constructs pUBfPL-CAT, pUBfM-CAT, and pUBf-CAT.M1 were derived from pBfPL-CAT, PBfM-CAT, and pBf-CAT.M1, respectively, by deleting the DNA segment between the NcoI site at the first ATG 3′ to the UIS and the NcoI site created by the Bf-CAT fusion at the CAT initiation codon. pUPBf-CAT was generated by deleting pUBfPL-CAT from the XbaI 5′ cloning site to a SmaI site at −554. pSV2-CAT was a subclone of the original SV40 promoter-driven CAT expression clone in pBluescript-II SK(+) (32Kawamura N. Singer L. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Human (HepG2) and murine (Hepa1-6) hepatoma cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD), grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were plated at 2 × 106 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. The cells were transfected the next day with the calcium phosphate method (35Segal S. Davis L.G. Dibner J. Battery F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co, New York1986: 286Crossref Google Scholar) by a 7-h incubation with 10 μg of test plasmid and 3.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The CAT activity was determined 36 h later by a modification (32Kawamura N. Singer L. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) of a previously described method (36Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) in the cell lysates normalized for β-galactosidase activity. For transcriptional activation experiments using an HNF-4 expression plasmid (see below), monkey kidney-derived, fibroblast-like CV-1 cells (ATCC) were plated at 106 cells/dish and co-transfected with 6 μg of CAT plasmid, various amounts (see “Results”) of HNF-4 plasmid, and 3.5 μg of β-gal plasmid, processed, and analyzed as above. For Northern blot analysis of CAT and β-galactosidase mRNAs, total cellular RNA was prepared by guanidinium thiocyanate lysis and CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation (37Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar), and 20 μg were separated in a 1.2% agarose denaturing gel and analyzed as described (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The CAT cDNA probe was a 516-bp NcoI fragment corresponding to the most 5′ CAT coding sequence from the pUBfM-CAT plasmid described above. The β-galactosidase cDNA probe was a 2.4-kb PvuII fragment from pCH110. RNA loading and quality were controlled by ethidium bromide stain of ribosomal RNA in the gel and on the blot. Nuclei from mouse tissues and HepG2 cells were prepared as described (38Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and lysed with NaCl and spermidine (39Miskimins W.K. Roberts M.P. McClelland A. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6741-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the nuclear lysates were dialyzed (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The soluble material was quantified for protein content using a protein assay kit (Sigma) and stored at −70°C. The binding reactions were performed essentially as described (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in the presence of 4 μg of extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), and 175 pg of 32P-end-labeled, 35-mer double-strand oligonucleotide as probe in 25 μl containing 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min at room temperature. The complexes were resolved in a 7% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The sequences of the probes are indicated under “Results” except for the CIIIB site of the rat apoCIII gene (−103/−69, coding strand: 5′-TCTGGACTGTTCAGCAGGTGACCTTTGACCAGCTC-3′) (41Reue K. Leff T. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6857-6864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 5′-UT binding site of the mouse Bf gene (+36/+70, coding strand: 5′-CAGGAGGTCAAATAGGCACCCAGAGTGACCTGGAG-3′) (12Nonaka M. Gitlin J.D. Colten H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 89: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The latter reciprocally competes with a PvuII-BglII (−18/+116) genomic probe in which the binding element of the 5′-UT region was initially detected (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and therefore contains the complete 5′-UT element (not shown). In the antibody supershift assays, 1 μl of HNF-4 specific rabbit antiserum (42Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) (or nonimmune rabbit serum as control) at the indicated dilutions (in 3% bovine serum albumin) was added to the reactions. For analysis of cell-free translated HNF-4, a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. F. M. Sladek, consisting of the rat HNF-4 cDNA sequence (42Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) subcloned in the pSG5 vector (43Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), which supports prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription, was linearized and transcribed by the bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). HNF-4 transcript was then purified in a CsCl density gradient (37Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using an unlabeled amino acid mix. Translation times and RNA input are indicated under “Results.” For binding experiments, 5 μl of translation reaction mixture were added instead of nuclear extract. To ascertain the functional consequences of the sequence differences in the 5′ region of the mouse Bf gene between strains with high and low extrahepatic Bf expression, we generated a set of CAT reporter constructs driven by the strain-specific Bf 5′ sequences (−728 to +108 from the DIS) (Fig. 1B), transfected them into HepG2 cells, and assessed the CAT activity (Fig. 1A). Higher activity was obtained with the construct bearing the high expressor strain sequence (pBfPL-CAT). In contrast, CAT activity detected when the sequence of the low expressor strains was used (pBfM-CAT) did not significantly differ from background (pCAT.0). The differences between high and low expressor sequences consists of six point substitutions and a 6-bp deletion. A mutant (pBf-CAT.M1) was also generated, in which only the nucleotide at −299 (3 bp downstream of the UIS) of the high expressor sequence was substituted (T to C). This substitution disrupts the site for nuclear protein binding at the UIS (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The CAT activity for this mutant was approximately 20% of the activity obtained with the high expressor, indicating that 80% of the difference in CAT activity between the high and low expressor sequences results from this T/C substitution. Because the differences in Bf-CAT expression in HepG2 were more comparable with extrahepatic than hepatic differences in Bf expression in vivo, the following experiments were done. Analysis of expression of several constructs extending up to 6.7 kb upstream of the DIS (26Ishikawa N. Nonaka M. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19040-19046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in HepG2 showed a correlation of CAT activity with sequences identical to that observed with the shortest constructs (see above). The longest (−6.7 kb) and shortest (−728 bp) constructs transfected into a murine hepatoma cell line (Hepa1-6), also yielded results similar to that observed in HepG2 transfected with the shortest Bf strain-specific sequences; i.e. expression was markedly reduced for the UIS substitution (72 and 78% reduction for the short and 5′-extended constructs, respectively). Differences in CAT gene expression were confirmed at the mRNA level by Northern blot analysis of the CAT mRNA in transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 1C). A CAT transcript was also detected with an upstream construct (pUBfPL-CAT) in which the CAT open reading frame was inserted at the first ATG following the UIS (22 bp downstream of the UIS) (Fig. 1C, lane 6), indicating that the sequence spanning −728 to −276 contains functional element(s) of the Bf upstream promoter. However, no significant CAT activity was detected using this construct (not shown), probably due to low translation initiation at this ATG (29Garnier G. Circolo A. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3275-3282PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of strain-specific sequences on the activity of the upstream promoter, constructs bearing the upstream sequence of the low expressor strains (pUBfM-CAT) and identical sequence substituted only at −299 (pUBf-CAT.M1) were also generated (Fig. 2A) and transfected into HepG2 cells, and the expression of the CAT transcript was assessed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Transcription driven upstream by the low expressor sequence was also markedly less than that driven by the high expressor sequence. However, in contrast to downstream initiation, the substitution at −299 (T to C) had no effect on transcription initiated at the UIS. A 5′-truncated construct (pUPBf-CAT) retained the promoter activity, which thus localizes the minimal upstream promoter within a 272-bp fragment (−553 to −276 from the DIS). The differential binding at the UIS resulting from the T/C polymorphism at −299 (28Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was further analyzed by gel shift analysis using 35-mer double-strand oligonucleotides (−323/−289) as probes (Fig. 3). Using a mouse liver nuclear extract, the high expressor sequence as probe (T at −299) and increasing amounts of competitor with or without the substitution (T to C) at −299, the gel shift analysis (Fig. 3A) shows that both sequences bind to the nuclear factor(s), but approximately 8 times more competitor was required to reach equivalent competition when T was substituted to C. Single-strand substitutions in the probe at this position (Fig. 3B) revealed that, despite the mismatch, the T to C substitution in the coding strand did not affect the interaction with the mouse liver and kidney and HepG2 nuclear protein(s). In contrast, the corresponding A to G substitution in the noncoding strand abrogated the interaction with all three extracts. The HepG2 extract showed an additional complex of faster mobility. However, this interaction was consistently decreased only by the single-strand substitution in the coding strand and equally competed by the wild-type and double-strand mutant oligonucleotides (not shown). The binding specificity at the UIS and in the 5′-untranslated region of the Bf gene was assessed by competition with a sequence of the apolipoprotein CIII gene that shows homologies with the Bf sites and is known to interact with members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (42Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 44Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 45Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double-strand oligonucleotides were generated for the UIS (−323/−289) and 5′-UT (+36/+70) sites of Bf and for the CIIIB site (−103/−69) of the rat apoCIII gene. These were used as probes and competitors in gel shift analysis with mouse liver and HepG2 nuclear extracts (Fig. 4). All three probes showed specific interactions with both extracts (Fig. 4A). With the mouse liver extract, the two Bf sites did not compete with each other, but each was competed by the CIIIB site. The CIIIB site was only partially competed by each of the two Bf sites separately but completely competed when both Bf sequences were added (Fig. 4B). The kidney nuclear extract showed identical results (not shown). With the HepG2 extract an additive effect of the Bf competitors on the CIIIB interactions was also observed (Fig. 4B). As with the liver and kidney extracts, the interaction with the UIS probe that was affected by the T/C polymorphism at −299 was competed by the CIIIB site but not by the 5′-UT site (Fig. 4A). Sequence homologies and binding specificities of the UIS and elements interacting with members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily and the tissue distribution of these factors led us to analyze the interaction of HNF-4 with the binding site at the UIS. An HNF-4 transcript synthesized in vitro from a rat cDNA clone (42Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E.

To identify proteins that may participate in the targeting or storage of this potent inhibitor, this report investigates the applicability of utilizing filamentous bacteriophages to display proteins expressed by cells containing a regulated secretory pathway and their enrichment based upon an interaction with PAI-1. For this purpose, RNA was extracted from AtT-20 cells (i.e. a classical model cell system for intracellular protein sorting), reverse transcribed, amplified using polymerase chain reaction primers containing internal restriction sites, and cloned into the phagemid pCOMB3H for expression as fusion constructs with the bacteriophage gene III protein. Escherichia coli was transformed with the phagemids and infected with VCSM13 helper phage, and the resulting AtT-20 cDNA-bacteriophage library was enriched by panning against solid- and solution-phase PAI-1. The enriched cDNA library was subcloned into a prokaryotic expression vector system that replaces the gene III protein with a decapeptide tag for immunologic quantitation. One novel cDNA clone (i.e. A-61), which preferentially recognized solution-phase PAI-1 and reacted positively with antibodies derived from a rabbit immunized with α-granules, was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHis to create a construct containing an N-terminal six-histidine purification tag. This construct was expressed in E. coli, purified by nickel-chelate chromatography followed by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and utilized for the generation of polyclonal antibodies. Immunoblotting analysis employing antibodies against the purified A-61 construct revealed a 23-kDa protein present in the regulated secretory pathway of AtT-20 cells. The 23-kDa molecule was purified from media conditioned by AtT-20 cells by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, molecular sieve chromatography on Sephacryl S-100, chromatofocusing on Polybuffer exchanger 94, and affinity chromatography on PAI-1-Sepharose. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of a 16-kDa Lys-C proteolytic fragment of the 23-kDa storage granule protein was employed to confirm its identity with the cDNA sequence of clone A-61. These data indicate that phage display of cDNA libraries fused to the C-terminal region of the gene III protein and their enrichment via an interaction with a target molecule can be utilized to define other proteins present within a particular cellular pathway.

Current information indicates that PAI-1 is synthesized in an active form, but it is rapidly converted into an inactive form at 37°C with a half-life of approximately 1 h (for a review, see Ref. 1Van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The conformation of PAI-1 resulting from inactivation at 37°C is commonly referred to as latent PAI-1 because inhibitory activity can be detected following treatment with denaturants or negatively charged phospholipids (for reviews, see Refs. 1Van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 2Reilly T.M. Mousa S.A. Seetharam R. Racanelli A.L. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In light of the observation that platelets possess low biosynthetic capabilities (19Bithell T.C. Bithell T.C. Clinical Hematology. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia1993: 511-539Google Scholar), it is not unexpected that the majority of PAI-1 is present within platelets in a latent form. Although vitronectin is known to be capable of increasing by 2-fold the half-life of PAI-1 activity in solution (37°C) (for a review, see Ref. 20Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), recent data from our group (21Lang I.M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2754-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indicate that complexes between vitronectin and PAI-1 are not present in nonactivated platelets. Therefore, little information exists on the proteins that interact and stabilize PAI-1 stored within platelets that have a mean life span of 9-12 days in the circulation (19Bithell T.C. Bithell T.C. Clinical Hematology. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia1993: 511-539Google Scholar). Two distinct pathways are known to be responsible for the secretion of proteins from eukaryotic cells (for reviews, see Refs. 22Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar and 23Rindler M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The “constitutive” pathway externalizes proteins rapidly using post-Golgi vesicles and does not require an external stimulus for release of a compound into the extracellular milieu (22Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 23Rindler M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the “regulated” pathway, proteins are stored in secretory granules until the cells are stimulated to secrete in response to the appropriate stimuli (22Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 23Rindler M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A number of tumor-derived cell lines exhibit both a constitutive and a regulated secretory pathway, and these cell lines have been used as in vitro model cell systems for analyzing the processing of proteins into these two pathways (22Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 23Rindler M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A classical system is the mouse pituitary tumor cell line, AtT-20, that has been shown to divert a majority of the endogenously synthesized adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the regulated storage pathway (24Gumbiner B. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1982; 28: 51-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25Burgess T.L. Craik C.S. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Treatment of AtT-20 cells with the appropriate secretagogue (e.g. 8-Br-cyclic AMP) results in release of the contents of the secretory granule (24Gumbiner B. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1982; 28: 51-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 26Moore H.H. Walker M.D. Lee F. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1983; 35: 531-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These cells have been shown to have the capacity, after transfection with the appropriate DNA, to package heterologous peptide hormones and enzymes into the regulated secretory pathway. For example, proinsulin (26Moore H.H. Walker M.D. Lee F. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1983; 35: 531-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), trypsinogen (25Burgess T.L. Craik C.S.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), human growth hormone (28Moore H.H. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (29Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) are transported to the regulated pathway with a similar efficiency as the endogenous hormone, ACTH. This cell line has also proven useful for investigating the packaging of two proteins stored in both endothelial cells and platelets (i.e. P-selectin (30Koedam J.A. Cramer E.M. Briend E. Furie B.

Cell. 1991; 64: 403-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, transfection experiments with full-length PAI-1 cDNA demonstrated that this inhibitor is also packaged into AtT-20 dense core storage granules (33Gombau L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3875-3880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of PAI-1 within the isolated storage granules has revealed (i) the presence of both active and latent PAI-1 in a ratio comparable with the situation in human platelets and (ii) that PAI-1 activity is stabilized within the secretory granules (33Gombau L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3875-3880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, this cell line appears to be a useful model system for identification of proteins within the regulated secretory pathway that interact with PAI-1 and potentially participate in its targeting or stabilization. The ability of filamentous bacteriophages to display proteins on their surface has been used for the generation of libraries of recombinant antibody fragments (for reviews, see Refs. 34Lerner R.A.

Antibody fragments or peptides are expressed as fusion proteins with the bacteriophage's gene III or gene VIII surface protein, and the characteristics of the surface-expressed molecule (e.g. affinity or interaction with a ligand) can be used as a means to enrich the phage (34Lerner R.A. Kang A.S. Bain J.D. Burton D.R. Barbas C.F. Science. 1992; 258: 1313-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Winter G. Griffiths A.D. Hawkins R.E. Hoogenboom H.R. Annu. Rev.

In this system, the cDNA encoding the surface-expressed protein/peptide is contained within the bacteriophage's genetic material, thus permitting the rapid identification and cloning of a molecule. This study was initiated to investigate the applicability of this system to identify proteins that potentially interact with PAI-1 within the regulated secretory pathway. In this report, we describe the construction of an AtT-20 cDNA-bacteriophage library and its enrichment based upon its interaction with PAI-1 to identify a novel 23-kDa protein that is present within the regulated secretory pathway. AtT-20 cells, DAMI cells (a cell line established from an individual with megakaryoblastic leukemia (39Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and a transformed human fibroblast cell line (SV40 WI38 VA13 2RA) were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of either a 5% C02 (DAMI cells and transformed fibroblasts) or 15% CO2 atmosphere (AtT-20 cells (33Gombau L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3875-3880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Native PAI-1 was purified from the media conditioned by transformed human lung fibroblasts as described previously (33Gombau L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3875-3880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Schleef R.R. Loskutoff D.J. Podor T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Antibodies to PAI-1 were raised in New Zealand rabbits and affinity-purified on Sepharose-PAI-1 columns as described previously (33Gombau L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3875-3880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human platelets were isolated and utilized for the preparation of α-granules as described previously (21Lang I.M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2754-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were diluted in homogenization buffer (108 mM NaCl, 38 mM KCl, 1.7 mM NaHCO3, 21.2 mM sodium citrate, 27.8 mMD-glucose, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM theophyllin, pH 6.5) to a final concentration of 109/ml and sonicated using an Astrason Ultrasonic processor XL (Heat Systems Inc., Farmingdale, NY) five times (4°C, 3 s of sonication on setting 2 followed by a 15-s pause between each sonication). Samples were centrifuged (15 min, 2,000 × g); the membrane/organelle/cytosol-containing supernatants were pooled and mixed 1:1 with 40% metrizamide solution (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co., Westbury, NY); and this mixture was layered on top of a two-step gradient consisting of 1 ml of 35% metrizamide underlayered with 0.5 ml of 38% metrizamide. Following centrifugation (1 h, 4°C, 100,000 × g), the α-granules were harvested from the 20-35% metrizamide interface. This preparation was mixed with an equal volume of 90% stock isotonic Percoll (1 ml of 1.5 M NaCl with 9 ml of Percoll; Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) and ultracentrifuged (4°C, 30 min, 20,000 × g). The α-granules were recovered as an opaque band at a density of 1.06-1.1 g/liter. Rabbit antibodies directed against α-granules were prepared by immunizing a New Zealand White rabbit with 0.5 ml of isolated α-granules (20 mg of protein/injection) dissolved in Freund's adjuvant over a period of 6 months utilizing standard techniques. The IgG fraction of the antiserum was isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity-purified utilizing CNBr-activated Sepharose beads that were coupled to α-granule proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). AtT-20 and DAMI cells (1.5 × 108 cells, 106 cells/ml) were harvested separately into guanidine thiocyanate followed by extraction of total RNA according to the procedures described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63019) Google Scholar) and as detailed previously (42Schleef R.R. Bevilacqua M.P. Sawdey M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5797-5803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AtT-20 RNA (15 μg) was reverse transcribed utilizing the commercially available First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and oligo(dt)15 primers. AtT-20 cell cDNA was amplified in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler utilizing the forward primer (5′-CAGTCGCTCGAGRNNATG-3′) that contained an internal XhoI site (underlined) and, in separate reactions, reverse primers (i.e. 5′-TGGGCAACTAGTGTANNNNNN-3′; 5′-TGGGCAACTAGTCCANNNNNN-3′) that contained an internal SpeI site (underlined). The following protocol, known as “touchdown” PCR, was utilized to derive specific PCR products: 5 min at 94°C, 20 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 53°C (lowering temperature 0.5°C each cycle), 3 min at 70°C, followed by 5 cycles utilizing 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 43°C, and 3 min at 70°C. PCR products from each library were pooled and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the region between 3000 and 200 base pairs was electrophoretically eluted from the agarose gel. This material was digested with an excess amount of restriction enzymes SpeI and XhoI (50 and 200 units/μg DNA, respectively) and ligated into the vector pCOMB3H, a variant of the phagemid pComb3 (43Barbas C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The final library consisted of 1.5 × 106 clones. Phagemids were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells and grown in super broth medium (SB; 30 g/liter tryptone, 20 g/liter yeast extract, and 10 g/liter Mops, pH 7) at 37°C supplemented with tetracyclin (10 μg/ml) and carbenicillin (50 μg/ml). Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.8, infected with VCSM13 helper phage (4 × 1011 plaque-forming units/ml), and grown 2 additional h. Kanamycin was added (70 μg/ml), and the culture was incubated overnight. Phage were isolated from liquid culture by polyethylene glycol 8000 and NaCl precipitation (43Barbas C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Phage pellets were suspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Enrichment of phages was performed on microtiter plates (Costar 3690) under the following conditions. Wells were precoated with 1 μg of PAI-1 or 2 μg of affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to PAI-1. Wells were washed twice with water and blocked for 1 h with 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS. Wells coated with PAI-1 were directly incubated (2 h, 37°C) with 50 μl of mixed phage (typically 1011 to 1012 colony-forming units). Alternatively, 50 μl of phage (>108 phage) were incubated (30 min, 37°C) with 20 ng of PAI-1 (final concentration) followed by incubation (2 h, 37°C) on polyclonal anti-PAI-1-coated wells. Following incubation, the wells were washed once (first round of panning), 5 times (second round of panning), or 10 times (third to sixth round of panning) with TBS, 0.05% Tween solution. After a final rinse in distilled water, the adherent phage were eluted by incubation (10 min, 22°C) with 50 μl of elution buffer (0.1 M HCl, adjusted to pH 2.2 with glycine) containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The eluant was removed and neutralized with 3 μl of 2 M Tris base. The initial phage input was determined by titering on selective plates. The final phage output was determined by infecting 1 ml of logarithmic phase XLI-Blue cells with the neutralized eluant for 15 min at room temperature and plating equal aliquots on carbenicillin plates. Phagemid DNA from the panned library was isolated, digested with SfiI, and ligated into the arabinose-inducible expression vector pAraHA (43Barbas C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 44Lang I.M. Barbas III, C.F. Schleef R.R. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli DH12S cells and grown overnight in SB containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Single colonies of AtT-20 cDNA/pAraHA in E. coli were picked, grown for 8 h, and induced by incubation (30°C, 16 h) with 1% arabinose. The bacteria were harvested, lysed into TBS containing 4 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration; Sigma) by four freeze/thawing cycles, and centrifuged, and the cell-free supernatants were incubated (1.5 h, 37°C) in microtiter wells coated with PAI-1 (1 μg/well) or affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against α-granules (1 μg/well). Alternatively, the bacterial lysates were incubated (0.5 h, 37°C) with 20 ng of soluble PAI-1 followed by incubation (1 h, 37°C) of the mixture in wells coated with affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against PAI-1. Controls included wells coated with 1 μg/ml of BSA or normal rabbit IgG. After washing, bound protein was detected by incubating the washed wells with alkaline phosphatase-labeled antidecapeptide (mouse monoclonal anti-YPYDVPDYAS (45Huse W.D. Sastry L. Iverson S.A.

Science. 1989; 246: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), 1:500 dilution, 50 μl/well, 2 h, 37°C) followed by kinetic measurement of the resulting color change at 405 nm after the addition of the substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate. The cDNA inserts were sequenced from both strands using the dideoxytermination method (46Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) coupled with primers synthesized according to the sequences that are either 5′ or 3′ of the SfiI site in the vector pAraHA (43Barbas C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg/lane) from AtT-20 and DAMI cells was separated by denaturing electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (42Schleef R.R. Bevilacqua M.P. Sawdey M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5797-5803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence encoding clone A-61 was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming using the DECAprime II DNA labeling kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) as described by the manufacturer. The labeled probe was purified using Sephadex G-50 minispin columns (Worthington) resulting in a specific activity of 109 cpm/μg. Hybridization of the labeled probe to the nylon membrane was performed in 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 50 μg/ml fresh denatured salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 h at 65°C followed by washing in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C. Hybridization to a 32P-labeled 2.0-kilobase pair human β-actin probe (Clontech) was used to confirm approximate equal loading in all lanes. The blot was exposed for 3 days to Kodak XAR autoradiographic film. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the procedures described by Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206276) Google Scholar). Gels were processed either by silver staining as described previously (48Lang I.M. Marsh J.J. Moser K.M. Schleef R.R. Blood. 1992; 80: 2269-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (42Schleef R.R. Bevilacqua M.P. Sawdey M.

Blood. 1987; 70: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose was blocked by incubation (1 h, 22°C) with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The washed blots were incubated (1 h, 22°C) with a primary antibody (i.e. monoclonal anti-decapeptide, 1 μg/ml (45Huse W.D. Sastry L. Iverson S.A. Kang A.S. Alting-Mees M. Burton D.R. Benkovic S.J.
