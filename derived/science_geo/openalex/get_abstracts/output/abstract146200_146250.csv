https://openalex.org/W2060446375,"The establishment of DNA methylation patterns requires de novo methylation that occurs predominantly during early development and gametogenesis in mice. Here we demonstrate that two recently identified DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, are essential for de novo methylation and for mouse development. Inactivation of both genes by gene targeting blocks de novo methylation in ES cells and early embryos, but it has no effect on maintenance of imprinted methylation patterns. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b also exhibit nonoverlapping functions in development, with Dnmt3b specifically required for methylation of centromeric minor satellite repeats. Mutations of human DNMT3B are found in ICF syndrome, a developmental defect characterized by hypomethylation of pericentromeric repeats. Our results indicate that both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b function as de novo methyltransferases that play important roles in normal development and disease."

https://openalex.org/W1979201752,"PPARB was identified as a target of APC through the analysis of global gene expression profiles in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. PPARdelta expression was elevated in CRCs and repressed by APC in CRC cells. This repression was mediated by beta-catenin/Tcf-4-responsive elements in the PPARdelta promotor. The ability of PPARs to bind eicosanoids suggested that PPARdelta might be a target of chemopreventive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Reporters containing PPARdelta-responsive elements were repressed by the NSAID sulindac. Furthermore, sulindac was able to disrupt the ability of PPARdelta to bind its recognition sequences. These findings suggest that NSAIDs inhibit tumorigenesis through inhibition of PPARdelta, the gene for which is normally regulated by APC."
https://openalex.org/W1939083266,"The PTEN tumor suppressor is mutated in diverse human cancers and in hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. PTEN is a phosphatase that can act on both polypeptide and phosphoinositide substrates in vitro. The PTEN structure reveals a phosphatase domain that is similar to protein phosphatases but has an enlarged active site important for the accommodation of the phosphoinositide substrate. The structure also reveals that PTEN has a C2 domain. The PTEN C2 domain binds phospholipid membranes in vitro, and mutation of basic residues that could mediate this reduces PTEN's membrane affinity and its ability to suppress the growth of glioblastoma tumor cells. The phosphatase and C2 domains associate across an extensive interface, suggesting that the C2 domain may serve to productively position the catalytic domain on the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2043112660,"Vascular endothelial cells undergo morphogenesis into capillary networks in response to angiogenic factors. We show here that sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), a platelet-derived bioactive lipid, activates the EDG-1 and -3 subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors on endothelial cells to regulate angiogenesis. SPP induces the Gi/mitogen-activated protein kinase/cell survival pathway and the small GTPase Rho- and Raccoupled adherens junction assembly. Both EDG-1-and EDG-3-regulated signaling pathways are required for endothelial cell morphogenesis into capillary-like networks. Indeed, SPP synergized with polypeptide angiogenic growth factors in the formation of mature neovessels in vivo. These data define SPP as a novel regulator of angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2048867275,"Dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage heart failure result in multiple defects in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Via complementation of a genetically based mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy, we now provide evidence that progressive chamber dilation and heart failure are dependent on a Ca2+ cycling defect in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. The ablation of a muscle-specific sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor, phospholamban, rescued the spectrum of phenotypes that resemble human heart failure. Inhibition of phospholamban-SERCA2a interaction via in vivo expression of a phospholamban point mutant dominantly activated the contractility of ventricular muscle cells. Thus, interfering with phospholamban-SERCA2a interaction may provide a novel therapeutic approach for preventing the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2005318857,"The genome of Escherichia coli is composed of a single molecule of circular DNA with the length of about 47,000 kilobase pairs, which is associated with about 10 major DNA-binding proteins, altogether forming the nucleoid. We expressed and purified 12 species of the DNA-binding protein, i.e. CbpA (curved DNA-binding protein A), CbpB or Rob (curved DNA-binding protein B or right arm of the replication origin binding protein), DnaA (DNA-binding protein A), Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells), Fis (factor for inversion stimulation), Hfq (host factor for phage Qβ), H-NS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein), HU (heat-unstable nucleoid protein), IciA (inhibitor of chromosome initiation A), IHF (integration host factor), Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein), and StpA (suppressor oftd− phenotype A). The sequence specificity of DNA binding was determined for all the purified nucleoid proteins using gel-mobility shift assays. Five proteins (CbpB, DnaA, Fis, IHF, and Lrp) were found to bind to specific DNA sequences, while the remaining seven proteins (CbpA, Dps, Hfq, H-NS, HU, IciA, and StpA) showed apparently sequence-nonspecific DNA binding activities. Four proteins, CbpA, Hfq, H-NS, and IciA, showed the binding preference for the curved DNA. From the apparent dissociation constant (K d ) determined using the sequence-specific or nonspecific DNA probes, the order of DNA binding affinity were determined to be: HU > IHF > Lrp > CbpB(Rob) > Fis > H-NS > StpA > CbpA > IciA > Hfq/Dps, ranging from 25 nm (HU binding to the non-curved DNA) to 250 nm (Hfq binding to the non-curved DNA), under the assay conditions employed.

Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM, Washington, D. C.1996: 158-166Google Scholar). These nucleoid-associated proteins, hereafter referred to as the “nucleoid proteins” in this paper, have long been considered to be structural proteins setting the overall DNA conformation, not only by wrapping or packaging of DNA but also by introducing bending or coiling (for example, see Ref. 2Drlica K. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of these nucleoid proteins, however, influences not only the conformation but also the functions of DNA such as replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. For instance, the template activity of DNA for transcription is either activated or repressed by the association of these nucleoid proteins to various extents depending on the gene (for example, see Ref. 3Pruss G.J. Drlica K. Cell. 1989; 56: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The overall activities of the genome are considered to vary depending on cell growth conditions, because the composition of nucleoid proteins changes depending on cell growth conditions or growth phases (4Almirón M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). These observations taken together suggest the pleiotropic regulatory roles for the nucleoid proteins in global regulation of gene transcription. In addition to these nucleoid proteins, a total of about 100 transcription factors interact with specific sequences near gene promoters and act as either activators or repressors of transcription of a gene or a set of genes (5Ishihama A. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.G. Nucleic Acids & Molecular Biology: Mechanism of Transcription. 11. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 53-70Google Scholar). Recently, the molecular events leading to transcription regulation by at least some sequence-specific and mostly gene-specific transcription factors have been characterized in detail (for instance, see Ref. 5Ishihama A. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.G. Nucleic Acids & Molecular Biology: Mechanism of Transcription. 11. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 53-70Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little is known about transcription regulation by the nucleoid proteins. These group proteins have been thought to have the activities of sequence-nonspecific DNA-binding, but no systematic and comparative studies have been performed of the specificity and affinity of DNA binding for the nucleoid proteins. In order to understand the overall configuration and physiological activities of the E. coli genome under various growth conditions and the role(s) of each nucleoid protein, we performed for the first time a systematic comparison of the recognition sequence specificity and the DNA-binding affinities among 12 species of the nucleoid protein from E. coli, including the abundant nucleoid proteins in growing E. coli cells, i.e.factor for inversion stimulation (Fis),1 H-NS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein), HU (heat-unstable nucleoid protein), IHF (integration host factor), and Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein), and a set of curved DNA-binding proteins, i.e.CbpA (curved DNA-binding protein A), CbpB (curved DNA-binding protein B; or Rob, right origin binding protein), and StpA (suppressor ofTd− phenotype A) (6Finkel S.E.

In addition, we extended our analysis to include two DNA-associated proteins, DnaA (DNA-binding protein A) and IciA (inhibitor of chromosome initiation A) with the regulatory activity of DNA replication (16Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 17Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. Cell. 1990; 63: 325-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a protein, called Hfq (host factor for phage Qβ replication), with the binding activity to both nucleoid and ribosomes (18Kajitani M. Kato A. Wada A. Inokuchi Y. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 531-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a novel DNA-binding protein, Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells), which is synthesized only in the stationary phase of cell growth and plays a role in growth-dependent transformation of the nucleoid configuration (4Almirón M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Among these 12 proteins, the specificity of DNA recognition has not been reported for Dps, Hfq, IciA, and StpA. Here the affinity and sequence specificity of DNA binding were examined in parallel for all these 12 species of DNA-binding proteins under the same conditions by gel-mobility shift assays using various DNA probes. E. colistrains and plasmids used for expression of the DNA-binding proteins are shown in Table I.

All 12 DNA-binding proteins were purified from overexpressed E. coli. The plasmids and the conditions used for expression of the DNA-binding proteins are summarized in Table I. The steps of protein purification and the yield of proteins are summarized in TableII. The purity of proteins was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining of gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Kodak).

Open table in a new tab Six different kinds of short DNA duplexes (see Fig. 2 for the sequence) were prepared by annealing two single-stranded oligonucleotides which were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Model 394 DNA/RNA Synthesizer). For duplex formation, oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA were heated at 85 °C for 15 min and cooled slowly to room temperature. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol. For radiolabeling, the duplex DNAs were gel-purified and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo, Japan). Gel mobility shift assays was carried out for the detection of complex formation between DNA-binding proteins and DNA probes. The procedure was essentially the same for 12 DNA-binding proteins. Mixtures of 32P-labeled (0.5–2.0 nm) or unlabeled probe DNA (5.0 nm) and various amounts of the test protein were incubated in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 25 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixtures were directly subjected to electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 38:2) in 0.5% TBE buffer consisting of 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 60 V at 25 °C (the same temperature as that used for DNA-protein complex formation). Gels were exposed to x-ray films or imaging plates. The amounts of unbound free and protein-bound DNA probes were determined by measuring the exposed films or plates with a NIH Image Software (version 1.61) or a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The apparent dissociation constant (K d ) was determined by measuring the protein concentrations which gave 50% binding of the input probe (27Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were also carried out using a mixture ofHaeIII-treated pUC19. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and the amounts of unbound free and protein-bound DNA were determined by staining DNA with ethidium bromide. As an initial effort for the systematic comparison of DNA binding properties among the nucleoid proteins in E. coli, we analyzed in this study 12 species of DNA-binding proteins,i.e. CbpA, CbpB (or Rob), DnaA, Dps, Fis, Hfq, H-NS, HU, IciA, IHF, Lrp, and StpA. The molecular properties so far identified for these proteins are summarized in TableIII. For protein purification, the genes for these nucleoid proteins were transiently expressed at high levels under control of strong and inducible promoters (Table I). In the case of HU and IHF, both consisting of two different subunits with similar sequences, the genes for two subunits are expressed simultaneously in the same cells, and thus the main components of HU and IHF proteins used in this study were both heterodimers.Table IIIMolecular properties of E. coli DNA-binding proteinsProteinNumber of amino acidsMolecular massNative protomerkDaCbpA29733.4HomodimerCbpB (Rob)28933.0MonomerDnaA46753.0MonomerDps16719.0Monomer/dodecamerFis9811.2HomodimerHfq10211.2Monomer/hexamerH-NS13715.4HomodimerHU HU-1909.2Heterodimer HU-2909.5IciA29733.5HomodimerIHF IHFα9911.2Heterodimer IHFβ9410.7Lrp16719.0HomodimerStpA13315.3Homodimer (?) Open table in a new tab The overexpressed proteins were mostly recovered in soluble fractions of the respective cell lysates except Dps which was solubilized from inclusion bodies with a buffer containing 6 m urea and then renatured. Thus, the native conformation must have been retained for most of the proteins examined, suggesting that the specificities and activities herewith described represent those of native proteins. All the test proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity in two or three steps of chromatography essentially according to the published procedures (Table II; for details see “Experimental Procedures”). A total of 0.5–15 mg of proteins were obtained from 1 liter of the induced cultures. Fig. 1 shows the patterns of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for each step of the purification for all these 12 proteins. The purity at the final step was more than 95% for all these proteins except for DnaA. To measure the DNA binding activities for all 12 DNA-binding proteins by the gel shift assay, six different types of synthetic oligonucleotide (SO) probe were synthesized, each carrying a unique sequence as described in Fig. 2. For simultaneous and quantitative comparison of the DNA binding properties for many proteins under the same conditions, the size of the DNA probes were adjusted to be within the range of 40–64 bp. Two types of DNA probe were prepared for the assay of nonspecific DNA-binding proteins. SOA contains six consecutive (dA)6 stretches, each being connected by a 4-bp (CGGC) interval, in a total length of 60 bp. This type DNA is known to form a curved configuration and has been used for binding assays of the curved DNA-binding proteins such as CbpA and H-NS (11Yamada H. Muramatsu S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Zuber F. Kotlarz D. Rimsky S. Buc H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SOB of 64 bp in length, consisting of equal amounts of GC and AT, contains two tandem repeats of the 26-bp long CbpB-binding site (13Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) connected by a 6-bp spacer with CCCGGG sequence (for the sequence see Fig. 2). This set of curved SOA and non-curved SOB was used for the gel mobility shift assay of the sequence nonspecific DNA-binding proteins (HU, IciA, and StpA) or those with no known specificity (CbpA, Dps, Hfq, and H-NS). For the DNA binding assays of other proteins with sequence-specific recognition activities, probes SOC (60 bp), SOD (54 bp), SOE (40 bp), and SOF (62 bp) were synthesized, which contained three repeats of the DnaA box on the same DNA surface (29Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), three repeats of the 15-bp long Fis-binding site (6Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), a single 15-bp long IHF-binding site (30Craig N.L. Nash H.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and three repeats of the 15-bp long Lrp-binding site (31Cui Y. Wang Q. Stormo G.D. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4872-4880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Gel mobility shift assays were performed for all 12 nucleoid proteins using both specific and nonspecific DNA probes with the chain length of 40–64 bp (for the probe sequences see Fig. 2). Mixtures of 0.5–3.0 nm32P-labeled probe DNA and various amounts of one of the nucleoid proteins were incubated in 10 μl of the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and then subjected to electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels. Typical patterns of the gel shift assays using 2.0 nm32P-labeled probes are shown in Fig. 3. The amounts of unbound free and protein-bound DNA probes were determined by measuring the intensity of autoradiograms. The apparent dissociation constant (K d ) of each DNA probe for the test proteins was determined by measuring the protein concentrations which gave 50% binding of the input probe (27Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In most cases, the combinations of bound and unbound probes stayed constant, but in some cases, the protein-bound probes formed diffuse bands. In the latter cases, the measurement of protein-bound probes was relied only on the amount of unbound free DNA. The results of gel shift assays using 2 nm radiolabeled probes are shown in Fig. 4. The measurements were repeated at least three times for each combination, and the values shown in Fig. 4 represent the averages, together with the fluctuation levels of the measurements. The apparent dissociation constants thus obtained are summarized in Fig.5. The order of binding affinity among the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was: IHF > Lrp > CbpB > Fis > DnaA, and the dissociation constant ranged from 37 nm for IHF to 213 nm for DnaA.Figure 5The dissociation constants of synthetic DNA probes for the DNA-binding proteins. The apparent dissociation constants for each DNA-binding protein were measured according to the method of Carey (27Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) as described in the legend to Fig. 4.A, specific DNA-binding proteins. B, nonspecific DNA-binding proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the other hand, the affinity order among sequence-nonspecific DNA-binding proteins was: HU > H-NS > StpA > CbpA > IciA > Hfq > Dps using a curved DNA (SOA) probe, with the dissociation constant ranging from 51 nmfor HU to 172 nm for Dps (Figs. 4 and 5 B); and HU > StpA > H-NS > CbpA > Dps > IciA > Hfq using a non-curved DNA (SOB) probe, with the dissociation constant ranging from 25 (HU) to 250 (Hfq) nm (Figs. 4 and5 B). The affinity ratio between the curved and non-curved DNA ranged from 0.49 (HU), 1.03 (Dps), 1.08 (StpA), 1.43 (CbpA), 1.43 (H-NS), 1.43 (IciA) to 1.95 (Hfq). One unexpected finding was that HU had a higher affinity to the non-curved DNA while Hfq had a higher affinity to the curved DNA. We carried out the same type of measurements using both decreasing concentrations of the labeled probes and increasing concentrations of unlabeled DNA probes. Essentially the same specificities of DNA binding were observed for all the proteins examined (data not shown). The order of DNA binding affinity was also essentially the same when measured using decreasing or increasing concentrations of both labeled and unlabeled DNA probes (data not shown). In order to confirm the binding specificity of the 12 species ofE. coli DNA-binding protein, we also investigated the complex formation in vitro using a mixture of 11 DNA fragments generated by HaeIII digestion of pUC19 DNA. When nonspecific DNA-binding proteins were analyzed using such DNA fragment mixtures, the longer DNA fragments tend to shift at lower protein concentrations than the shorter fragments (32Takada A. Wachi M. Kaidow A. Takamura M. Nagai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The order of DNA binding affinity measured in this system was essentially the same at least among the nonspecific DNA-binding proteins (data not shown). Five proteins, CbpB (Rob), DnaA, Fis, IHF, and Lrp, were confirmed to be the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins in the assay system employed. No significant cooperativity was observed for this group of proteins in DNA binding, because the test proteins bound to the probe DNAs with multiple binding sites in a stepwise fashion. The CbpB bound to the two CbpB-binding sites of SOB in a stepwise fashion, forming two retardation bands (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–12). The apparent dissociation constant (K d ) of the first site for CbpB was 67 nm (Figs. 4 and5 A), and approximately 120 nm CbpB was required for the shift of all input SOB probe (Fig. 3 A, lane 10). Above 140 nm CbpB, all the input SOB were converted to complexes with two molecules of the CbpB protein (Fig. 3 B,lane 11). When SOE without the CbpB site was used as a DNA probe, no DNA retardation was observed even at the concentration as high as 80 nm (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The apparentK d of 213 nm for DnaA measured using probe SOC with three tandem DnaA-binding sequences (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–12) was the highest among the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins tested (Figs. 4 and 5 A), but this was partly attributed to aggregation of the purified DnaA protein, in particular at high protein concentrations. DnaA did not form complexes with a control probe (SOB) without the DnaA-binding sequence (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2). Fis also showed the stepwise formation of three types of complexes with SOD containing three repeats of the Fis-binding core sequence in protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3–12). The apparent K d of SOD for the Fis dimer was estimated to be about 114 nm (Figs. 4 and5 A). At 240 nm Fis, almost all the input probe was shifted to the complexes (Fig. 3 B, lane 7). No retarded band was detected when SOB lacking the Fis site was used as probe (Fig.3 C, lanes 1 and 2). IHF showed dose-dependent formation of a single complex with SOE containing a single IHF-binding sequence (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3–11), giving the complete retardation at 80 nm (Fig.3 D, lane 6). The apparent K d of IHF for SOE was 37 nm (Figs. 4 and 5 A). At high IHF concentrations, the IHF-SOE complex formed further aggregates, which migrated to discrete bands with slower migration rates (Fig. 3 D, lanes 7–11), through protein-protein contacts between IHF molecules. IHF did not form complexes with SOB without the IHF site at least within the protein concentration range examined (Fig. 3 D, lanes 1 and 2). Lrp also formed three discrete bands with SOF containing three repeats of the Lrp-binding site in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 E). At 140 nm Lrp, virtually all the input DNA was converted into Lrp complexes (Fig. 3 E, lane 7). The apparentK d of SOF for Lrp was 60 nm (Figs. 4 and5 A). In contrast, the probe SOB without the Lrp-binding sequence did not form any complexes with Lrp (Fig. 3 E, lanes 1 and 2). The DNA-binding properties of the sequence nonspecific DNA-binding proteins were examined using a pair of curved SOA and non-curved SOB probes. Four proteins, CbpA, H-NS, Hfq, and IciA, were identified as the curved DNA-binding proteins. CbpA and H-NS has been recognized as the curved DNA-binding proteins, but the specificity of DNA binding has not yet been analyzed for Hfq and IciA. CbpA showed a strong cooperativity in binding to the curved DNA. By adding small amounts of CbpA, certain fractions of SOA were shifted to big complexes which were trapped on the gel top even though some DNA probes remained unbound. All the input SOA probe was shifted to complexes by adding 280–350 nm CbpA (Fig. 3 F, lanes 5 and 6). The apparent K d for CbpA was estimated to be 122 nm (Figs. 4 and 5 B). When a non-curved probe (SOB) was used as a control, however, the affinity was found to be weaker than the curved DNA (Fig. 3 F, lanes 7–14), giving the apparent K d value of about 175 nm CbpA (Figs. 4 and 5 B). The affinity was 1.43-fold higher for the curved DNA than that for the non-curved DNA. Under the same conditions, we examined the DNA-binding properties for H-NS using the same set of DNA probes, curved SOA (Fig. 3 G, lanes 1–12) and non-curved SOB (Fig. 3 G, lanes 13–24). The apparent K d of SOA and SOB for H-NS was calculated to be 115 and 165 nm, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5 B). The affinity for the curved SOA was 1.43-fold higher than that for the non-curved SOB. Since no intermediate bands were observed, the binding of H-NS to the probe SOA was again highly cooperative. In addition to these two known curved DNA-binding proteins, we newly identified two DNA-binding proteins with the preference for curved DNA. Hfq showed dose-dependent complex formation with both SOA (Fig. 3 H, lanes 1–7) and SOB (Fig. 3H, lanes 8–14) probes. The apparent K d of SOA and SOB for Hfq was 128 and 250 nm, respectively (Figs. 4 and5 B), indicating that the Hfq protein has a binding preference (1.95-fold) for curved DNA. The DNA binding activity of Hfq to the non-curved DNA is the weakest (K d, 250 nm) among the 12 proteins examined. Complete band shift of the input DNA fragment was observed at the Hfq concentration as high as 350 nm (Fig. 3 H, lane 6). Likewise, IciA preferred the AT-rich curved SOA probe for binding (Fig.3 I). The apparent K d was 126 and 180 nm for SOA and SOB, respectively (Figs. 4 and5 B). Thus, the affinity to curved DNA was more than 1.43-fold higher than that to non-curved DNA. At high protein concentrations, complexes migrating slower than the fully saturated IciA-SOA complex were identified, which may represent aggregates of DNA-protein complexes. HU has long been recognized as a curved DNA-binding protein with no sequence preference. HU formed a ladder of complexes with both SOA and SOB probes concomitantly with the increase in HU concentration (Fig.3 K), each corresponding to the binding of increasing amounts of the HU αβ heterodimer. Since HU forms tetramers o"

Whereas all pore-forming bacterial toxins examined previously have been shown to penetrate the membrane using a single amphipathic beta hairpin per polypeptide, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and multiple independent fluorescence techniques here reveal that each PFO monomer contains a second domain involved in pore formation, and that each of the two amphipathic beta hairpins completely spans the membrane. In the soluble monomer, these transmembrane segments are folded into six alpha helices. The insertion of two transmembrane hairpins per toxin monomer and the major change in secondary structure are striking and define a novel paradigm for the mechanism of membrane insertion by a cytolytic toxin."

Here we report that VEGF treatment of bovine adrenal cortex endothelial cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in both eNOS protein and activity. Endothelial NOS expression was maximal following 2 days of constant VEGF exposure (500 pm) and declined to base-line levels by day 5. The elevated eNOS protein level was sustained over the time course if VEGF was co-incubated withl-N G-nitroarginine methyl ester, a competitive eNOS inhibitor. Addition ofS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, a nitric oxide donor, prevented VEGF-induced eNOS up-regulation. These data suggest that nitric oxide participates in a negative feedback mechanism regulating eNOS expression. Various approaches were used to investigate the role of the two high affinity VEGF receptors in eNOS up-regulation. A KDR receptor-selective mutant increased eNOS expression, whereas an Flt-1 receptor-selective mutant did not. Furthermore, VEGF treatment increased eNOS expression in a KDR but not in an Flt-1 receptor-transfected porcine aorta endothelial cell line. SU1498, a selective inhibitor of the KDR receptor tyrosine kinase, blocked eNOS up-regulation, thus providing further evidence that the KDR receptor signals for eNOS up-regulation. Finally, treatment of adrenal cortex endothelial cells with VEGF or phorbol ester resulted in protein kinase C activation and elevated eNOS expression, whereas inhibition of protein kinase C with isoform-specific inhibitors abolished VEGF-induced eNOS up-regulation.

Several VEGF isoforms including VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206 have been identified (8Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol.

All isoforms except VEGF121 have a heparin-binding domain that interacts with cell-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (10Athanassiades A. Hamilton G.S. Lala P.K. Biol.

VEGF165 is the most predominant form secreted by various cell types and some tumor cells (2Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). VEGF has two high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, the Fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt-1) and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR/Flk-1), which are predominantly expressed on endothelial cells (12Terman B.I.

This receptor binds to VEGF165 and placental growth factor-2 (PlGF-2) but not to VEGF121 (13Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M.

VEGF has been shown to induce the release of NO from rabbit, pig, bovine, and human vascular endothelial cells (15van der Zee R. Murohara T. Luo Z. Zollmann F. Passeri J. Lekutat C. Isner J.M.

Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, VEGF stimulated human EC to grow in a NO-dependent manner and promoted the NO-dependent formation of vessel-like structures in the three-dimensional collagen gel model (18Papapetropoulos A. Garcı̂a-Cardeña G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of NO production by eNOS inhibitors significantly inhibited VEGF-induced mitogenic and angiogenic effects (18Papapetropoulos A. Garcı̂a-Cardeña G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained in vivo where inactivation of eNOS expression significantly impaired VEGF-induced angiogenesis in an eNOS knockout mouse model (19Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M.

Endothelial NOS/NO has also been implicated as one of the important mediators for VEGF-induced hemodynamic changes and microvascular permeability. For example, Yang et al. (22Yang R. Thomas R. Bunting S. Ko A. Ferrara N. Keyt B.A. Jin H. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and Hariawala et al. (23Hariawala M.D. Horowitz J.R. Esakof D.

Res. 1996; 63: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) reported that pretreatment of rats with an eNOS inhibitor significantly attenuated the hypotensive effects of an intravenous bolus dose of VEGF. Wu et al. (24Wu H.M. Huang Q.B. Yuan Y. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2735-H2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that topical application of VEGF resulted in a transient and dose-dependent increase in albumin permeability in isolated coronary venules. Inhibition of NO synthesis with an eNOS inhibitor completely abolished VEGF-induced venular hyperpermeability. These observations highlight the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in VEGF regulation of eNOS. Although eNOS was originally described as a constitutive enzyme, recent studies indicated that a variety of stimuli including hypoxia, shear stress, inflammatory cytokines, high glucose, and injury could modulate eNOS expression and activity (25Sase K.

Here we provide a detailed characterization of the mechanism governing VEGF-induced eNOS up-regulation and demonstrate that activation of the KDR receptor tyrosine kinase and a downstream PKC pathway are required. Furthermore, our data indicate that NO inhibits the VEGF-induced increase in eNOS expression, suggesting a physiological role for NO in feedback inhibiting eNOS expression. These results provide important insights into our understanding of the mechanism(s) by which VEGF regulates eNOS and endothelial function. Recombinant human VEGF165(rhVEGF165) was produced in Escherichia coli(Genentech). The VEGF110 heparin-binding domain-deficient variant was made from VEGF165 by limited proteolytic digestion with plasmin as described previously (31Keyt B. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H.

Geneticin (G480) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All reagents were prepared as 1000× stock solutions unless otherwise specified. Bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells (ACE) were prepared and maintained as described previously (34Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar) and grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 2 mml-glutamate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone), 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). ACE cells were used between passages 4 and 8. Porcine aorta endothelial (PAE) cells and receptor-transfected PAE cells (PAE/KDR and PAE/Flt-1) were obtained from Dr. Napoleone Ferrara (Genentech) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (for PAE) or plus 250 μg/ml G480 (for PAE/KDR and PAE/Flt-1). For drug treatment, cells were incubated in the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with VEGF or other drugs as specified. Complete medium was replenished every 24 h. The methods for cell lysis and Western blot (WB) analysis have been previously described (35Shen B.-Q. Lee D.Y. Gerber H.-P. Keyt B.A. Ferrara N. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29979-29985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-eNOS or anti-PKC antibodies were used at the manufacturers' suggested concentration. A secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and an enhanced chemiluminescent kit was used to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Multiple exposures of films were obtained to determine the optimal exposure time. The protein bands were scanned by a densitometer, and the relative intensities were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The eNOS activity in ACE cells treated with or without rhVEGF for 2 days was determined by measuring the formation of [3H]citrulline from [3H]arginine. Briefly, ACE cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm EGTA and then subjected to microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Fifty μg of protein from the supernatants was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 1 mm NADPH, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 μm flavin adenine dinucleotide, 1 μm flavin adenine mononucleotide, 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]arginine, and other cofactors (calcium and calmodulin) provided in the assay kit. The reaction was stopped with 50 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, 5 mm EDTA. Equilibrated resin, which binds to the arginine, was added to the reactions and then pipetted into spin cups. [3H]Citrulline, which is ionically neutral at pH 5.5, flowed through the cups and was quantitated by scintillation counting. Confluent ACE cells were incubated with VEGF for 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min. The cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and homogenized by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 330 mmsucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.025% leupeptin, and aprotonin. Total PKC activity in equal amount of homogenates was determined by measuring phosphatidylserine/diacylglyceroldependent phosphorylation of exogenous PKC-specific peptide substrate (QKRPSQRSKYL) in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, compound R 24571, and [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated after 10 min at 30 °C. Endogenous phosphorylation of proteins in the sample extract was determined by substituting assay dilution buffer for substrate. PKC activity (pmol/min/mg) was calculated using the following equation: (A − B) ×F/S.A. × 10 min/mg, where A is total radioactivity (cpm), B is background protein phosphorylation (cpm), F is a dilution factor, and S.A. is [γ-32P]ATP-specific radioactivity (∼2500 CPM/pmole ATP). To determine the redistribution of PKC isoforms, cell homogenates following 10 min of VEGF treatment were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions according to the method described by Xia et al. (36Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein from both cytosolic and membrane fractions were electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, and probed with monoclonal anti-PKC-isoform peptide antibodies as described above. The results are reported as mean ± S.D. An unpaired Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To study whether VEGF regulates eNOS expression, ACE cells were incubated with rhVEGF for 0–5 days. At the end of incubation total cell lysates were prepared, and eNOS protein levels were determined by Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1 A shows the results of a time course experiment, indicating that prolonged VEGF treatment induced a transient increase in eNOS expression. The peak expression (5.5-fold) was observed 2 days post-exposure to 500 pm VEGF. The eNOS protein levels returned to baseline by day 5 (Fig. 1 B). VEGF also induced eNOS up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner with the maximal increase occurring following incubation with 500 pm VEGF (data not shown). To investigate whether VEGF treatment increases eNOS activity, an equal amount of cell lysate from cells treated with or without VEGF for 2 days was used to run a NOS activity assay. Fig. 1 C shows that NOS activity in VEGF-treated cells was ∼5-fold greater than that in untreated control cells (p < 0.05), which was proportional to the increase in eNOS protein level (5.5-fold). The total NOS activity measured likely represents eNOS activity because only Ca2+-dependent NOS activity was measured, and inducible NOS protein was not detected in ACE cells by WB (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that VEGF increases both eNOS expression and activity in cultured endothelial cells. The role of NO in VEGF-induced eNOS expression was investigated by co-incubation of VEGF with either l-NAME, an eNOS inhibitor, or SNAP, a stable NO donor. Fig.2 shows that VEGF alone induced a transient increase in eNOS expression, whereas co-incubation of VEGF with 2 mml-NAME resulted in a sustained increase in eNOS expression. Addition of 100 μm SNAP to the media blocked both transient and sustained up-regulation of eNOS induced by VEGF (Fig. 2) or VEGF/l-NAME, respectively (data not shown). Neither l-NAME nor SNAP alone had a significant effect on eNOS expression (Fig. 2). To rule-out the possibility thatl-NAME or SNAP affected VEGF stability, VEGF-containing medium was replaced every 24 h, and culture medium was assayed in a VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was no difference in VEGF levels among these groups (data not shown). These results suggest that endogenous NO produced by endothelial cells may negatively regulate VEGF-induced eNOS expression. Several approaches were used to determine which VEGF receptor(s) was involved in signaling for increasing eNOS expression. First, VEGF receptor-selective mutants, which bind preferentially to KDR or Flt-1, were incubated with ACE cells. Fig.3 A shows that VEGF165 and VEGF110, a heparin-binding domain-deficient mutant with normal binding to KDR and Flt-1, induced a similar degree (5-fold) of eNOS up-regulation. The KDR-selective mutant (KDR-sel) that binds to KDR receptor normally but with reduced binding to Flt-1 also up-regulated eNOS expression, whereas the Flt-1-selective binding mutant (Flt-sel) failed to do so. PlGF, which is known to only bind to Flt-1 receptor, had no effect on eNOS expression. These data suggest that the KDR receptor was the dominant receptor involved in VEGF-induced increases in eNOS expression. The involvement of KDR receptor in eNOS up-regulation was further confirmed by using VEGF receptor-transfected PAE cells. Fig.3 B demonstrates that PAE/KDR cells were able to increase eNOS expression in response to VEGF, whereas PAE and PAE/Flt cells were not. The base-line expression of eNOS in PAE/Flt was lower than that in PAE and PAE/KDR cells, although equal amount of protein was used for eNOS detection (Fig. 3 B). The reason for this phenomenon is presently unclear. The critical role of KDR receptor tyrosine kinase in eNOS up-regulation was further demonstrated by co-incubation of VEGF with a selective KDR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, SU-1498. Fig. 3 C reveals that co-incubation of SU-1498 with VEGF resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of eNOS expression. At high concentration (100 μm), SU-1498 completely blocked VEGF-induced eNOS up-regulation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that KDR receptor activation is required for VEGF-induced eNOS expression. Various inhibitors were also tested to investigate the role of downstream signaling molecules in VEGF-induced eNOS expression. Fig.4 shows that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity with herbimycin A, an irreversible and selective inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, blocked VEGF-induced eNOS expression. Furthermore, PP1 inhibition of PLC-γ, an upstream signaling molecule of PKC and PI3-K, also blocked eNOS expression (Fig.4). However, inhibition of PI3-K with wortmannin had no significant effect on eNOS levels (data not shown). These data indicate that PKC signaling was the predominant pathway. The role of PKC in VEGF-induced eNOS up-regulation was further characterized by examining specific PKC isoform expression, inhibition, and activation. First, WB analysis with eight PKC isoform-specific antibodies (anti-PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, -θ, -ι, and -λ) showed that ACE cells expressed multiple PKC isoforms, mainly, PKC-α, -γ, -δ, -ε, and -ι (data not shown). Inhibition of PKC with both broad (staurosporine, calphostin C, and chelerythrine chloride) and isoform-specific (GF 109203X, Go 6976, and rottlerin) inhibitors prevented eNOS up-regulation, whereas inhibition of protein kinase A or cyclic nucleotide kinases with H8 and H89, respectively, had no effect on VEGF-induced eNOS expression (Fig.4). Conversely, Fig. 5 Afurther shows that VEGF treatment only induced a rapid redistribution of PKC-α, -γ, and -ε from cytosolic to membrane fractions, indicating that VEGF specifically activated these three PKC isoforms. A PKC activity assay further showed that VEGF treatment (2.5–60 min) induced a time-dependent increase in total PKC activity (Fig. 5 B). Finally, direct activation of PKC with the phorbol ester PMA also resulted in a time- (Fig. 5 C) and dose-dependent (data not shown) increase in eNOS levels. These data imply an important role for PKC, and more specifically PKC-α, -γ, and -ε in the activation and signaling for VEGF-induced eNOS expression.Figure 5A PKC-dependent pathway is required for VEGF-induced eNOS up-regulation. A, a representative WB result showing that VEGF treatment resulted in a rapid redistribution of PKC-α, -γ, and -ε from cytosolic to membrane fractions. ACE cells were treated with VEGF for 10 min. Cytosolic (C) and membrane (M) fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.”C, cytosolic fraction; M, membrane fraction.B, VEGF increased total PKC activity. ACE cells were treated with VEGF for 2.5 to 60 min. PKC activities in cell homogenates were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data reflect the mean ± S.D., n = 3. C, the PKC activator, PMA, also increased eNOS expression. A representative WB result showing that activation of PKC with PMA time-dependently increased eNOS expression. The data are representative of 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative effect of several other angiogenic factors including FGF, HGF, EGF, and TGF-β on eNOS expression was also studied. ACE cells were treated with equimolar concentration of various growth factors for 2 days, and eNOS was detected by WB. Fig.6 shows that in addition to VEGF, HGF was also capable of increasing eNOS expression, whereas neither FGF nor EGF had a significant effect. TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 trended toward a slight reduction in eNOS expression. These data indicate that VEGF and HGF are distinct from the other angiogenic growth factors in their ability to increase eNOS expression in vitro. Exogenous NO and endothelium-derived NO have been shown to have several putative anti-atherosclerotic properties such as improved vascular homeostasis and decreased platelet aggregation.

https://openalex.org/W2025660464,"To explore the mechanism by which enhancers maintain gene expression, we have assessed the ability of an enhancer and derivative mutants to influence silencing and nuclear location of a transgene. Using site-specific recombination to place different constructs at the same integration sites, we find that disruption of core enhancer motifs impairs the enhancer's ability to suppress silencing. FISH analysis reveals that active transgenes linked to a functional enhancer localize away from centromeres. However, enhancer mutations that result in increased rates of transgene silencing fail to localize the transgene away from centromeric heterochromatin, even when the transgene is in an active state. These mutations thus dissociate transcriptional activity and subnuclear location. Together, our results suggest that the functional enhancer antagonizes gene silencing by preventing localization of a gene near centromeric heterochromatin."

Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar). An important event in the initiation of atherosclerosis is adhesion of circulating monocytes to activated endothelial cells and their subsequent transendothelial migration to the subendothelium. This process is mediated by adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin (13Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5852) Google Scholar, 14Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1216-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The inappropriate expression of these adhesion proteins in response to the “injury” are induced by various inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines and noncytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), and oxidized or native LDL (14Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R.

The ability of HDL to inhibit the cytokines-induced adhesion protein expression has been well documented. It has been reported that human HDL profoundly inhibit the expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) activated by TNF or interleukin-1 (7Cockerill G.W.

The phenotype of inhibition on adhesion molecule expression by HDL differs from their well known function in promoting cholesterol efflux and protecting against lipid peroxidation, suggesting a distinct mechanism exists. We recently demonstrated a novel signaling pathway, sphingosine kinase (SphK) pathway, through the generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which is critically involved in mediating adhesion protein expression and endothelial cell activation after TNF stimulation (24Xia P.

The SphK pathway has also emerged as a signaling pathway in mediating a variety of cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, and inflammatory reaction (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A.

In the present report we show that HDL profoundly inhibit the TNF-induced SphK activity and S1P generation, and subsequently reduce the activation of ERK and NF-κB signal cascades. We thus demonstrate that HDL interrupt a signaling cascade, the SphK pathway, which results in inhibition of endothelial activation. This could provide a new potential mechanism by which HDL protect against atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular inflammatory disease. TNF was purchased from R&D Systems. C2-Ceramide, S1P, sphingosine,N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), and dihydrosphingosine were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

In some experiments, cells were treated in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin as serum-free medium. The expression of cell-surface adhesion molecules was measured as described previously (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J.

As described previously (10Ashby D.T. Rye K.-A. Clay M.A. Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the lipoproteins were isolated from normal healthy adult donors by sequential ultracentrifugation in their appropriate density range: total HDL 1.07 < d < 1.21, HDL3 1.13 < d < 1.21, and LDL 1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml. The resulting preparations of lipoproteins were dialyzed against endotoxin-free PBS (pH 7.4) prior to use. Oxidized LDL was obtained by incubating LDL (500 μg/ml) with confluent cultures of HUVEC in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μm CuSO4 for 24 h, and the oxidation was assessed by the increase of mobility on 1% agarose gel. Discoidal reconstituted HDL containing apoA-I and 1-palmityl-2-oleylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) were prepared by the cholate dialysis method described by Matz et al. (31Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding assay was performed in confluent HUVEC after preincubation with an increasing concentration of HDL3 for 4 h. Cells were washed with M199 medium and incubated with 1 nm125I-TNF in the absence or presence of 500 nm unlabeled TNF in M199 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 4 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed three times with ice-cold M199 and then solubilized in 1 n NaOH, 1% SDS and radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. Specific binding is defined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding with excess unlabeled TNF. HUVEC were labeled with [3H]serine (10 μCi/ml) for 48 h as described previously (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc.

The cells were then washed three times and incubated for an additional 2 h in the presence or absence of HDL3. After treatment with TNF for the indicated times, cellular lipids were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in two different solvent systems: (a) chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:30:8:5, v/v) and (b) 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (3:1:1, v/v). The samples were concomitantly run with standard sphingolipids including sphingomyelin, ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P. Sphingolipid spots were visualized by fluorography, quantitated by scintillation spectrometry, and normalized by radioactivity recovered in total cellular lipids. In addition to metabolic labeling assay as described above, cellular ceramide was quantified with the diacylglycerol kinase reaction as described previously (32Kolesnick R.N. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cellular lipids were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/HCl (1 n) (100:100:1) and resuspended into a sample buffer containing 7.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 5 mmcardiolipin, and 1 mm diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid. The samples were reacted with diacylglycerol kinase and [γ-32P]ATP in enzyme buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol for 30 min at 22 °C. The product of the phosphorylation reaction, ceramide 1-phosphate, was extracted and resolved by TLC using CHCl3/CH3OH/HAc (65:15:5) as solvent, detected and quantified by the Phosphoimage system. To exclude a possible error caused by some factors in the extracts affecting diacylglycerol kinase (33Watts J.D. Gu M. Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), synthetic C2-ceramide was added in assays as an internal control. There were no changes in the phosphorylated C2-ceramide in this assay system. As described previously (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), cells were homogenized in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 15 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm4-deoxypyridoxine. After centrifugation at 13,000 × gfor 30 min, SphK activity was measured in the supernatant by incubation with 10 μm sphingosine-bovine serum albumin complex and [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 37 °C. The labeled lipids were extracted and resolved two times by TLC in the solvent of CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (65:35:8, v/v) and 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (3:1:1, v/v), respectively. The radioactive spots corresponding to authentic S1P were visualized and quantified by the Phosphoimage system. For kinetic studies, cell extracts were prepared from HUVEC treated with TNF for 5 min after preincubation with an increasing concentration of HDL3 for 4 h. The kinase assay was performed with various concentrations of sphingosine (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm). To measure the SphK activity in vivo, the formation of S1P was measured in the permeabilized cells as described previously (25Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HUVEC treated for 30 min with vehicle or the indicated agents after preincubation with or without HDL3. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used as a probe in these experiments included 5′-GGATGCCATTGGGGATTTCCTCTTTACTGGATGT-3′, which contains a consensus NF-κB binding site in the E-selectin promoter that is underlined (34Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift of a consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide was performed by incubating a 32P-labeled NF-κB probe with 4 μg of nuclear proteins. The specific DNA-protein complexes were completely abolished by addition of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled E-selectin NF-κB oligonucleotides. In order to minimize possible confounding effects of the variations between the distinct subfractions of total HDL, HDL3 (d = 1.13∼1.21 g/ml) was used in the present study. As shown in Fig. 1A, HDL3 inhibited by ∼70% the TNF-induced expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in HUVEC, which was consistent with our previous reports (7Cockerill G.W. Rye K.-A. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 10Ashby D.T. Rye K.-A. Clay M.A. Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of HDL3 was further identified by its reduction of E-selectin mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of HDL3 on TNF-induced adhesion protein expression result from alterations of TNF access to its receptors, 125I-TNF binding assay was performed. Fig. 1C shows that HDL3 at concentrations of 0.25∼1 mg/ml (apo A-I) did not significantly affect binding of TNF to HUVEC, suggesting that the effect of HDL3 is secondary to a perturbation of subsequent signaling pathways at postreceptor sites. Since we have recently identified the SphK pathway as a potent signaling pathway in mediating TNF-induced endothelial activation, the effect of HDL3 on this pathway was determined. Consistent with our previous report (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), TNF stimulation of HUVEC caused a significant increase in cytosolic SphK activity. This activity was profoundly inhibited by HDL3 preincubation at a physiological concentration (p < 0.01, Fig.2A white bars). The inhibitory effect of HDL3 was dose-dependent with half-maximal inhibition at about 0.41 mg/ml apoA-I (Fig. 2B). To characterize the inhibition of SphK by HDL3, Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed that HDL3 treatment altered the kinetics of SphK by decreasing its V max without significant changes in the K m (Fig. 2B, inset). Moreover, TNF-induced increases in S1P formation and its levels in intact cells were also markedly inhibited by HDL3 to comparable levels as obtained by N, N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), a competitive inhibitor of SphK (Fig. 2A, gray and dark bars). These data further confirm the inhibitory effect of HDL3 on activation of SphK in endothelial cells. Given the evidence that HDL3 inhibited SphK activity and S1P production, we tested the possibility that this inhibition was due to a reduction in sphingomyelin-ceramide turnover, an essential upstream event in S1P metabolic pathway. We previously reported that TNF stimulation of HUVEC rapidly reduced sphingomyelin content and consistently increased cellular ceramide levels by approximately 2 fold peaking at 30 min with return to near basal levels by 2 h (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with HDL3 did not interrupt the TNF-promoted sphingomyelinase activation, but significantly delayed the reversion of post TNF sphingomyelin levels to base line and sustained the increased ceramide levels (Fig.3A). There was a significant difference in the comparison of both sphingomyelin and ceramide levels between pretreatment with and without HDL3 after 2 h of TNF stimulation (p < 0.01, three separate experiments). The parallel delay in sphingomyelin reversion and accumulation of ceramide strongly argued against the proposition that HDL3decreased S1P production by inhibiting the response of sphingomyelin-ceramide cycle to TNF. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous cell-permeable ceramide (C2-ceramide) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-induced adhesion protein expression (Fig. 3B). Thus, the increased ceramide levels could be at least partly responsible for the inhibitory effect of HDL3. To gain an insight into which components of HDL3 are responsible for the inhibitory activity, the effect of apoA-I and lipids isolated from HDL3 was investigated. In marked contrast to intact HDL3 particles, lipid-free apoA-I, at the same concentration as HDL3, did not inhibit SphK activity. Similarly, HDL lipid constituents such as POPC in the form of small unilamellar vesicle also had no inhibitory effect (Fig. 4A). However, when apoA-I and POPC were reconstituted into discoidal HDL, the resulting complexes inhibited the TNF-induced SphK activation comparable to that seen with native HDL particles (Fig. 4A). In parallel, neither apoA-I nor POPC had any significant inhibitory activity on the TNF-induced expression of E-selectin (Fig. 4A, bottom panel), which was in agreement with our previous observations on VCAM-1 expression (10Ashby D.T. Rye K.-A. Clay M.A. Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11Baker P.W. Rye K.-A. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the cardioprotective ability of HDL in vivo appears to be dependent on the presence of LDL (3Assmann G. Schulte H. Am. J. Cardiol. 1992; 70: 733-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 5Navab M. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Hedrick C.C. Sorenson R. La Du B.N. Kobashigawa J.A. Fonarow G.C. Berliner J.A. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we tested whether the inhibitory effect of HDL on SphK is due to the interaction of LDL or other unknown factors in the serum. When cells were incubated in the serum-free conditions, the SphK activities in response to TNF in the presence or absence of HDL were to the same extent as that in the cells cultured with normal growth medium containing 20% fetal calf serum (compare Fig. 4B and 4A). The presence of LDL (250 μg/ml of apoB) in the cultures did not influence SphK activities either at the basal levels or post TNF stimulation. Further LDL had no effect on the inhibitory activity of HDL on SphK activation (Fig. 4B). Additionally, in the presence of oxLDL (250 μg/ml of apoB) HDL retained its ability to inhibit SphK activation (data not shown). Thus it is unlikely that the inhibitory effect of HDL resulted from the interaction of LDL, oxLDL or other unknown factors in the serum. Having shown that HDL inhibited SphK activity and the production of S1P, a novel identified inducer of adhesion protein expression, we further examined the linkage between the inhibition of SphK and reduction of endothelial activation. In the experiment illustrated in Fig.5A, the HDL3-induced dose-dependent inhibition of SphK activity was plotted against the reduction of E-selectin expression. There was a significant linear correlation between the inhibitory effects of HDL3on SphK activity and E-selectin expression (r = 0.953, Fig. 5A). Furthermore, when the formation of intracellular S1P was inhibited by DMS, a competitive inhibitor of SphK, the TNF-induced adhesion protein expression was also reduced (Fig. 5B). Conversely, both the HDL3 and DMS inhibitory effects on TNF action were reversed by the addition of S1P (Fig. 5B). This demonstrated that the inhibition of SphK is an important event in the HDL3-mediated reduction of endothelial activation. As a control, neither DMS nor HDL3 prevented S1P-induced adhesion protein expression (Fig. 5B), indicating a specific inhibitory effect on SphK. In addition, DMS did not change cellular ceramide levels (data not shown), suggesting the inhibition of SphK activity was not associated with altered ceramide levels. The MAP kinase, ERK, has been proposed to be a downstream target in the SphK pathway mediating a variety of cellular functions including adhesion protein expression (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 26Spiegel S.

J. 1999; 338: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig.6A showed that both TNF and S1P were approximately equipotent in stimulating ERK activities. Treatment with DMS significantly inhibited TNF-activated ERK, indicating the involvement of SphK in the TNF-activated ERK signal cascade. Preincubation of HUVEC with HDL3 also reduced TNF-stimulated ERK activation by 49 ± 6.2% (p < 0.01), consistent with its effect on reducing cellular levels of S1P. We have previously demonstrated a role of SphK pathway for TNF-promoted NF-κB activation (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) that is essential for the transcription of adhesion molecule genes (35Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Fig. 6B shows that HDL3significantly inhibited the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB by 51 ± 17% (p < 0.01), but did not inhibit that induced by S1P. This inhibition was comparable to that induced by DMS, the SphK inhibitor, suggesting that HDL3 inhibited the SphK pathway resulting in an inhibition of NF-κB which could account for the reduction of adhesion protein expression. Furthermore, HDL3 treatment did not inhibit the phorbol ester-promoted NF-κB activation (data not shown), indicating a specificity of HDL3 effect in this pathway. In this report, we show a novel mechanism of atheroprotection by HDL. In this model, HDL interrupt a signal transduction pathway, the SphK pathway, which is critically involved in endothelial cell activation and adhesion protein expression. The expression of adhesion proteins on activated endothelial cells plays an essential role for the inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (12Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar). The importance of adhesion molecules in atherogenesis is strongly supported by several lines of evidence: (i) adhesion molecules are present in atherosclerotic plaques (17Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Science. 1991; 251: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 18Poston R.N. Haskard D.O. Coucher J.R. Gall N.P. Johnson-Tidey R.R. Am. J.

Roitman-Johnson B. Stampfer M.J. Allen J. Lancet. 1998; 351: 88-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar); and (iii) a deficiency of adhesion molecules significantly reduces the formation of atherosclerotic fatty streaks in knockout mice lacking the genes of ICAM-1, P-selectin, or both ICAM-1 and P-selectin (36Johnson R.C. Chapman S.M. Dong Z.M. Ordovas J.M. Mayadas T.N. Herz J. Hynes R.O. Schaefer E.J. Wagner D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 37Nageh M.F.

The nature of the inflammatory signals and associated molecular mechanisms that activate adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells in the atherogenic lesion are unknown. Factors such as TNF and interleukin-1 that are commonly found in inflammatory atherogenic lesions induce the expression of adhesion molecules in cultured endothelial cells. Thus, TNF-stimulated adhesion molecule expression on HUVEC provides a useful model to investigate the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of endothelial cell activation. In this model we have recently identified a novel signaling pathway, the SphK pathway, in mediating TNF-induced adhesion protein expression and endothelial cell activation (24Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We found that TNF consistently stimulated SphK activity and the generation of S1P, and blockage of SphK by its inhibitor, DMS, inhibited NF-κB activation and adhesion protein expression. An inhibitory effect of HDL3 was clearly seen in this pathway: HDL3 inhibited (i) SphK activity, (ii) S1P generation, (iii) S1P levels, (iv) ERK activation and (v) nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Moreover, HDL3-induced inhibition of SphK activity is linear correlating with the reduction of adhesion protein expression, and the inhibitory effects of HDL3 were reversed by the addition of S1P (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results strongly indicated that the inhibition of SphK activation by HDL3 could account for its inhibitory effect on adhesion protein expression and endothelial activation. The finding that HDL3 not only inhibited the activity and the V max of SphK in a dose dependent manner but also the generation of S1P and its levels in intact cells (Fig. 2) indicated a primary inhibitory effect of HDL3 on the SphK pathway. On the other hand, it is possible that HDL3 may affect endothelial phenotype by an effect on the sphingomyelin-ceramide turnover since HDL3 increased the TNF-dependent ceramide generation and inhibited the reaccumulation of sphingomyelin (Fig. 3A). It is uncertain whether the ceramide accumulation is primarily due to prolonged hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase or to inefficient metabolism by downstream catalysis. The inhibition of adhesion molecule expression by exogenous ceramide (Fig. 3B) indicated a two-pronged inhibition on endothelial activation by HDL: reduction of S1P formation and increase in ceramide levels. Thus, it is assumed that HDL may reset the ‘biostat’ of ceramide and/or S1P to modulate cellular responses to TNF stimulation and to inhibit endothelial cell activation. This sphingolipid biostat has been proposed in regulating a variety of cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation and cell death (38Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 39Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). HDL may exert the protective effect against atherosclerosis by several mechanisms including (i) promoting cholesterol efflux from the peripheral tissues, (ii) reducing LDL oxidation, or (iii) protecting the vasculature against the cytotoxic effect of oxLDL (5Navab M. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Hedrick C.C. Sorenson R. La Du B.N. Kobashigawa J.A. Fonarow G.C. Berliner J.A. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. Curr. Opin.

Haberland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22975-22978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition to these effects of HDL, we now demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby HDL interrupt intracellular signaling involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The inhibitory effect of HDL on the SphK pathway is very likely independent of the above-mentioned known antiatherogenic ability of HDL, since (i) an intact conformation of HDL particle is required for the inhibition; (ii) the delipidated apoA-I is unable to mimic HDL effect; (iii) the inhibition is serum-independent; and (iv) the interaction of LDL or oxLDL is unlikely to be involved in the inhibition of SphK activation (Fig. 4). HDL may function on cells in either a receptor-dependent or -independent manner (40Hajjar D.P. Haberland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22975-22978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our preliminary data that HDL particles have no direct inhibitory effect on SphK activity in vitro(results not shown) suggested that the access of HDL to cell membrane and putative HDL-binding proteins could be necessary. However, the fact that lipid-free apoA-I is able to access putative HDL receptors such as SR-B1 (41Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 42Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) suggests that binding per se may not completely explain the inhibition of SphK pathway. It is possible that the apolipoprotein is critical to the effect but only when it is in an intact conformation that results from its association with phospholipids. Alternately, HDL induced inhibition of SphK pathway may act through other putative HDL-binding proteins in endothelial cells. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration that HDL interrupt a signaling cascade—the SphK pathway that is involved in regulation of endothelial cell activation, a key event in atherogenesis. This provides a mechanistic explanation for the well-documented ability of HDL to protect against atherosclerosis and might ultimately lead to the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of this disease.

In addition, we have used a differential display approach to isolate several cDNA clones representing previously unreported mitogen-inducible genes (9Donohue P.J. Hsu D.K.W. Winkles J.A. Liang P.

In this paper, we report that the murine Fn14 gene is a growth factor- and phorbol ester-regulated immediate-early response gene encoding a novel type Ia transmembrane protein, with an amino-terminal signal peptide, a 53-aa ectodomain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 28-aa carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Analysis of transfected NIH 3T3 cell lines that constitutively express the Fn14 protein indicate that it may be involved in the regulation of cellular adhesion, growth, and migration. Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were grown, expanded, and serum-starved as described (15Donohue P.J. Feng S.-L.Y. Alberts G.F. Guo Y. Peifley K.A. Hsu D.K.W. Winkles J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells were then either left untreated or treated with one of the following: 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF-1 (kind gift of W. Burgess, Holland Laboratory) in combination with 5 units/ml heparin (Upjohn), 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF-2 (Bachem), 10 ng/ml human recombinant PDGF-BB (Genzyme), 2 ng/ml human recombinant TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml human recombinant IGF-1 (Bachem), 10% calf serum (HyClone), or 30 ng/ml PMA (Sigma). In some experiments, NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml actinomycin D (Calbiochem) or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, and total RNA was isolated using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test) per the manufacturer's instructions. Tissues from newborn or adult FVB/N mice (Taconic Farms) were obtained, and RNA was isolated as above after the samples were initially homogenized using a Tissumizer (Tekmar). RNA concentrations were calculated by measuring UV light absorbance at 260 nm. RNA (1 μg) from quiescent or FGF-1/cycloheximide-treated NIH 3T3 cells was converted to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (16Winkles J.A. Friesel R. Alberts G.F. Janat M.F. Liau G. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 518-527PubMed Google Scholar). PCR assays were performed using a degenerate sense protein kinase domain oligonucleotide primer (12Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Guo Y. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10351-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and a degenerate antisense leucine zipper domain oligonucleotide primer (17Hsu D.K.W. Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Winkles J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An equivalent aliquot of each amplification mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel, and DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. An ∼230-bp DNA fragment was excised, recovered using the freeze-squeeze method (18Tautz D. Renz M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), reamplified, and ligated into the vector pCRII using a T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen). A mouse Balb/c 3T3 cell cDNA library (kind gift of T. Lanahan, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) was screened with the PCR-derived Fn14 cDNA fragment to obtain longer cDNA clones. The DNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Approximately 2 × 105 phage were plated at a density of 2 × 104 plaque-forming units/150-mm dish using Escherichia coli C600 Hfl as the host. Duplicate plaque lifts (Colony/Plaque screen, DuPont) were pre-hybridized, hybridized, washed and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film as described (14Hsu D.K.W. Guo Y. Alberts G.F. Copeland N.G.

Five positive phage were plaque-purified and amplified on E. coli C600 Hfl cells. Plasmids were excised from the phage clones using XL-1 Blue cells and R408 helper phage (Stratagene) as described (19Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and designated pBluescript/Fn14. A cDNA fragment representing the 5′ region of Fn14 mRNA was identified by PCR using mouse heart 5′-RACE-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) per the manufacturer's instructions. The Fn14 antisense oligonucleotide primer used in the PCR amplification step was complementary to nucleotides 361–381 of the Fn14 cDNA sequence. Amplification products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. One DNA fragment was recovered and cloned into the vector pCRII using a T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was purified using a Magic Miniprep kit (Promega), and both strands of the entire ∼950-bp Fn14 cDNA clone were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Both strands of the Fn14 cDNA fragment isolated by the 5′-RACE technique were also completely sequenced. Sequencing was done either automatically using an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer and a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) or manually using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nucleic acid and deduced protein sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank sequence data base using BLAST search programs accessed through the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. The predicted Fn14 protein sequence was analyzed using several programs (SignalP, ScanProsite, PSORT II, TMpred, etc.) accessed through the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server. Interspecific backcross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 females and C57BL/6J males as described (20Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map theFn14 locus (see text for details). DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot transfer, and hybridization were performed essentially as described (21Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All blots were prepared with Hybond-N+nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe, an ∼1.0-kbEcoRI/XhoI cDNA insert from the pBluescript/Fn14 plasmid, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.8× SSCP, 0.1% SDS, 65 °C. A fragment of ∼8.0 kb was detected in EcoRI-digested C57BL/6J DNA, and a fragment of ∼6.0 kb was detected in EcoRI-digested M. spretus DNA. The presence or absence of the ∼6.0-kb EcoRI M. spretus-specific fragment was followed in backcross mice. A description of the probes and RFLPs for the loci linked toFn14 including Mas1, E4f1, and Pim1has been reported previously (22Vaughn K.T. Mikami A. Paschal B.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Hughes S.M.

Rothammer K. Morris S.W. Higgs D.R. Copeland N.G. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 320-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recombination distances were calculated using Map Manager, version 2.6.5. Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombinant events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. RNA samples (10 μg) were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2m formaldehyde. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide to verify that each lane contained similar amounts of undegraded rRNA. RNA was transferred onto Zetabind nylon membranes (Cuno Inc.) by electroblotting and cross-linked to the membrane by UV light irradiation using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). A Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from mouse embryos at different developmental stages was purchased fromCLONTECH. Membrane pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washing conditions were as described (14Hsu D.K.W. Guo Y. Alberts G.F. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Peifley K.A. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13786-13795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The two cDNA hybridization probes were: (a) mouse Fn14, ∼1.0-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment of pBluescript/Fn14, and (b) mouse α-actin, ∼1.1-kbEcoRI fragment of pVAA (kind gift of G. Liau, Genetic Therapy Inc., Gaithersburg MD). The probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described above under cDNA library screening. A pBluescript/Fn14 plasmid containing the Fn14 cDNA sequence without the 3′-untranslated region was constructed and linearized using the appropriate enzymes, and sense or antisense riboprobes were transcribed in vitro using T3 or T7 RNA Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), [α-35S]UTP (1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and reagents included in the SureSite II in situhybridization kit (Novagen). Riboprobes were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to yield an average length of ∼100 nt, as verified by denaturing PAGE. Embryo sections (Novagen) were dewaxed, rehydrated, and deproteinized according to the hybridization kit instructions. Pre-hybridization and hybridization conditions were also per the manufacturer's instructions except that the hybridization step was performed at 65 °C. Post-hybridization washes were once with 2× SSC for 5 min at room temperature, once with 2× SSC for 30 min at 50 °C, once with 2× SSC containing 20 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, once with 2× SSC containing 50% formamide for 30 min at 50 °C, twice with 1× SSC for 30 min at 50 °C, and once with 0.1× SSC for 30 min at 65 °C. Slides were dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted. Recombinant Fn14 was produced by expression of the cDNA in E. coli as a GST fusion protein. The expression plasmid was constructed by ligation of anEcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment of pBluescript/Fn14 into the same sites located in the polylinker of pGEX-KG (kind gift of R. Friesel, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Portland ME). DNA sequence analysis was performed to confirm the construct. E. coli HB101 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) that had been transformed with this plasmid were cultured overnight at room temperature in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma). Cells were diluted 1:10 in Luria broth, grown for 5 h at room temperature, induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 h, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended by repeated pipetting in STE buffer (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and incubated for 20 min on ice. Dithiothreitol (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, the lysate was vortexed, N-laurylsarcosine (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1.5%, and again the lysate was vortexed. After mild sonication, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant at a 2% final concentration. The supernatant was then incubated with hydrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. The beads were collected by a brief centrifugation and washed five times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. To prepare antigen for rabbit immunization, GST-Fn14 was released from glutathione-Sepharose beads by the addition of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed against PBS. A New Zealand White rabbit was injected with ∼0.5 mg of the antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant (Calbiochem) and boosted five times with ∼0.3 mg of the antigen in incomplete adjuvant (Calbiochem). Crude serum was used for the Western blot experiments. The plasmid pEGFP-N3/Fn14, which encodes Fn14 with a carboxyl-terminal EGFP tag (24Haas J. Park E.-C. Seed B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), was constructed as follows. PCR was performed using pBluescript/Fn14 as the template, a sense primer containing a 5′ BamHI restriction site followed by Fn14 nucleotides −12 to +12, an antisense primer representing Fn14 nucleotides 380–399 and Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA product was isolated and then ligated into pCR2.1 using a T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen). A BamHI/EcoRI fragment representing the Fn14 coding region was isolated (18Tautz D. Renz M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the BglII and EcoRI cloning sites of the expression vector pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH). The plasmid pcDNAIneo/Fn14-HA, which encodes Fn14 with a carboxyl-terminal influenza HA epitope tag (25Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), was constructed by first subcloning an EcoRI/XhoI fragment of pBluescript/Fn14 into the EcoRI and HpaI cloning sites of the expression vector pMEXneo (26Tchorzewski M.T. Duncan M.D. Nass P. Qureshi F.G. Gearhart P.J. Winchurch R. Harmon J.W. J. Surg. Res. 1998; 77: 99-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). DNA sequence encoding the HA epitope tag was added to the Fn14 cDNA immediately upstream of the stop codon using the PCR overlap extension method withTaq polymerase (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). A NotI/ApaI fragment containing the Fn14-HA coding sequence was filled-in using T4 DNA polymerase and then cloned into the EcoRV site of the expression vector pcDNAIneo (Invitrogen). DNA sequence analysis was performed to confirm the identity of the two expression constructs described above. NIH 3T3 cells were grown to ∼60% confluence and transfected with pEGFP-N3, pEGFP-N3/Fn14, pcDNAIneo, or pcDNAIneo/Fn14-HA using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first two plasmids were used for transient transfection experiments. To generate stable cell lines, cells were transfected with either pcDNAIneo or pcDNAIneo/Fn14-HA, cultured for 24 h in standard growth medium, and split 1:10. After 24 h, cells were cultured in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual G418-resistant colonies were visible approximately 10 days later, and they were recovered with glass cloning cylinders. Clones were screened for Fn14-HA expression by Western blot analysis. Cells were washed with PBS, collected by scraping with a rubber policeman, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g. TNEN buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture; PharMingen) was added, and lysis was performed for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of each protein sample were mixed with 2× gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% bromphenol blue), heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE using either a 15% or 4–15% gradient acrylamide gel. For the FGF-2 time course experiment, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. The membrane was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to verify that equivalent amounts of protein were present in each gel lane and then blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBST (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST containing 5% BSA and a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Fn14 polyclonal serum, washed twice in TBST, and incubated for 1 h in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk and a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Ig-HRP (Bio-Rad). For analysis of transfected cells, proteins were transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 1% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST containing 1% BSA and a 1:1000 dilution of rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody clone 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membrane was then washed three times in TBST and incubated for 1 h in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% BSA, and a 1:2000 dilution of sheep anti-rat Ig-HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For all Western blots, bound secondary antibodies were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiographic signals were quantified by densitometry (VISAGE 4.6I software, BioImage Products). Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips and transfected with either pEGFP-N3 or pEGFP-N3/Fn14. One day later, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed to the coverslips with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2) for 30 min. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS and mounted on glass slides in 50% glycerol in PBS. The cells were viewed with an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope. Surface biotinylation of the pcDNAIneo V5 and pcDNAIneo/Fn14-HA 10 cell lines was carried out using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were lysed in modified 1× RIPA buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture; PharMingen) for 30 min at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation. The cellular lysate was precleared with a 50% slurry of GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in RIPA buffer by mixing on an orbital rocker for 10 min at 4 °C. The anti-HA antibody (described above) and control rat IgG (Sigma) were immobilized by mixing 50 μl of a 50% Sepharose bead slurry with 0.5 μg of anti-HA antibody or rat IgG for 2 h at 4 °C on an orbital rocker. The conjugated beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer, equivalent amounts of cellular lysate were added in a total volume of 1 ml of RIPA, and the beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C on an orbital rocker. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer, mixed with 2× gel loading buffer (see above), and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Protran membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBST containing 3% BSA and incubated in TBST containing 3% BSA and 200 ng/ml streptavidin-HRP (Pierce) for 30 min. Biotinylated proteins were detected using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL system. Adhesion assays were performed as described (28Zukowska-Grojec Z. Karwatowska-Prokopczuk E. Rose W. Rone J.

After detachment using 5 mm EDTA in PBS, cells were plated in DMEM at 5 × 104 cells/well on 96-well collagen I-, collagen IV-, fibronectin-, laminin- or vitronectin-coated CytoMatrix cell adhesion strips (Chemicon). The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed in PBS, fixed by treatment with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, rinsed again in PBS, stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 80% methanol for 30 min, and finally rinsed three times in H2O. The relative number of adherent cells in each well was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm using a Perkin-Elmer HTS 7000 BioAssay plate reader. Additional vitronectin adhesion assays were conducted as above except for the following two modifications. First, the cells were plated on wells that had been coated with various concentrations of vitronectin (Chemicon) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing the coated wells with PBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked using 1% BSA in PBS. The wells were washed again with PBS before the cells were plated. Second, the crystal violet stain was eluted with 0.1 msodium citrate (pH 4.2) in 50% ethanol prior to measuring absorbance. Cells were plated in standard growth medium at 103 cells/well in a 96-well cell culture plate. Cell growth was monitored using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per the manufacturer's instructions by measuring absorbance at 450 nm with a 650-nm reference wavelength subtracted. Migration assays were performed using 24-well Transwell inserts (Costar) with 8.0-μm pore polycarbonate membranes per the manufacturer's instructions. After detachment using 5 mm EDTA in PBS, cells were plated in DMEM in the upper compartment of the Transwell insert at 2 × 104cells/insert, and either DMEM alone or DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum was placed in the lower compartment. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, and those cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. The membranes were rinsed once with PBS, and the cells"
https://openalex.org/W2002390714,"Nfs1p is the yeast homolog of the bacterial proteins NifS and IscS, enzymes that release sulfur from cysteine for iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Here we show that the yeast mitochondrial protein Nfs1p regulates cellular and mitochondrial iron homeostasis. A strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MA14, with a missenseNFS1 allele (I191S) was isolated in a screen for altered iron-dependent gene regulation. This mutant exhibited constitutive up-regulation of the genes of the cellular iron uptake system, mediated through effects on the Aft1p iron-regulatory protein. Iron accumulating in the mutant cells was retained in the mitochondrial matrix while, at the same time, iron-sulfur proteins were deficient. In this work, the yeast protein was localized to mitochondria, and the gene was shown to be essential for viability. Furthermore, Nfs1p in the MA14 mutant was found to be markedly decreased, suggesting that this low protein level produced the observed regulatory effects. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments in which expression of wild-type Nfs1p from a regulated galactose-induced promoter was turned off, leading to recapitulation of the iron regulatory phenotypes characteristic of the MA14 mutant. These phenotypes include decreases in iron-sulfur protein activities coordinated with increases in cellular iron uptake and iron distribution to mitochondria.

Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The iron and sulfur are assembled in fixed stoichiometries (e.g. 2Fe-2S, 4Fe-4S) characteristic of the particular protein and coordinated to critical cysteines in the primary peptide backbone (2Cammack R. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 281-322Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Within cells, iron availability for synthesis of iron-sulfur proteins and other biological functions must be tightly regulated, because excess iron is toxic (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK1991Google Scholar). Excess iron leads to free radical reactions that damage membranes, proteins, and DNA (4Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Here we describe a regulatory control mechanism that coordinates iron uptake, iron distribution, and the levels of iron-sulfur cluster proteins in the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The regulator responsible for these effects is Nfs1p. Examination of the S. cerevisiae genome data base reveals that Nfs1p is the single yeast homolog of bacterial IscS (5Zheng L. Cash V. Flint D.

A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence, both biochemical and genetic, showing that the bacterial protein NifS mobilizes sulfur from cysteine and mediates Fe-S cluster assembly. Bacterial mutants of NifS were found to be deficient in the assembly of both Fe protein and MoFe protein subunits of nitrogenase (8Muchmore S.W. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Hausinger R.P. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 111-133Google Scholar, 9Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). NifS through its enzymatic activity was found to reactivate the apo form of nitrogenase in which the Fe-S cluster was removed by chelation (10Zheng L. Dean D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elegant biochemical work has elucidated this catalytic process: NifS was shown to be a pyridoxal phosphate-containing homodimer that catalyzes the formation of elemental sulfur from l-cysteine (7Zheng L. White R. Cash V. Jack R. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). A conserved lysine residue in the bacterial NifS protein (equivalent to Lys-299 in the yeast protein) is the covalent attachment site for pyridoxal phosphate. A conserved cysteine residue (equivalent to Cys-421 in the yeast protein) forms a catalytic persulfide intermediate involved in sulfur abstraction from the l-cysteine substrate (11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that the yeast homolog, Nfs1p, is an essential mitochondrial protein. We show that Nfs1p is required not only for activities of Fe-S cluster proteins, but also for regulatory effects on cellular iron metabolism. Regulatory effects resulting from decreased levels of Nfs1p include up-regulation of iron uptake to the cell and distribution of cellular iron to mitochondria. Methods for yeast manipulations and growth media have been described (12Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). For experiments with different concentrations of metals, standard defined medium was modified by addition of iron and copper. Iron was added as ferric ammonium sulfate and copper was added as copper sulfate. For some experiments, in order to avoid catabolite repression, the yeast was grown in defined medium with 2% raffinose as the carbon source. For some experiments, the yeast was grown in rich medium (2% yeast extract, 2% peptone) with 2% raffinose (YPR) or 2% lactate (YPL) as the carbon source. TheGAL1 promoter was induced by the addition of 0.5% galactose and repressed by the addition of 0.2% glucose to YPR medium. Strains 81 and 61, containing theFRE1-HIS3 integrated fusion and the parental strains CM3260 and CM3262 have been described (13Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D. Klausner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diploid CM3263 was obtained by mating CM3260 and CM3262. MA14 was derived from the strain 81 after selection on defined medium supplemented with 10 μmcopper sulfate and 20 μm ferric ammonium sulfate. Strains x316–1A-MA14 and x404-6D-MA14 were derived from MA14 by back-crossing with the wild-type strains CM3260 or YPH499, respectively. Heterozygote knock outs of NFS1 were constructed in strains CM3263 and YPH501 by transforming with the construct, nfs1KOUra. Sporulation yielded only uracil auxotrophs with 2 of 4 viable tetrad clones. Diploid wild-type strain D273-10B (ATCC 24657) was used for testing import into isolated mitochondria. AFT1 was interrupted in YPH499 and x404-6D-MA14 by transforming with theXhoI-KpnI fragment of pT20 (14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and selecting for tryptophan prototrophy, creating strains 499Δaft1 and 6DΔaft1. pA95, pA96, and pB48 contained inserts of genomic DNA in the vector YCp50 and were selected by screening a library (15Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) for complementation of MA14. pB48ΔSalI was constructed by digesting pB48 with SalI and religating, thus removing the genomic fragment between theSalI site within NFS1 and the SalI site in the vector. pB48ΔEcoRI was constructed by digesting pB48 with EcoRI and religating, thus removing the genomic EcoRI fragment. The genomic 3.4-kilobaseEcoRI fragment contained the NFS1ORF1 and 1133 base pairs of 5′-flanking region, including a portion of the adjacent YCL016c ORF. This fragment was subcloned into pRS406, creating plasmid pRS406-R1(NFS1) and into pRS416 creating plasmid pRS416(NFS1). Plasmid pRS406-R1(nfs1-fs) contained a frameshift introduced into theNFS1 open reading frame by digesting with AflII, rendering the ends blunt with Klenow polymerase, and religating. Plasmid pRS416(NFS1) linearized with SphI andPflMI was used to recover the mutant allele (nfs1–14) from the strain x404-6D-MA14, as described in the gap repair method (16Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The mutated base pair was identified by dideoxy DNA sequencing of the NFS1 ORF. The NFS1interruption/deletion constructs nfsKOUra and nfsKOHis were made by subcloning the NFS1 EcoRI fragment into pBluescript SK+ and inserting URA3 or HIS3 cassettes into theBglII sites within the coding region. For partial deletion and disruption of the gene, the modified genomic fragment was released by EcoRI digestion and used for transformation of yeast. For plasmid shuffle experiments, the NFS1 EcoRI fragment was subcloned in pRS318, which carries LEU2 and CYH2genes for selection and counterselection, respectively. For regulated expression of Nfs1p in yeast, the ORF was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and Pfu polymerase, adding XbaI andXhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into theXbaI and XhoI sites of pBluescript. The sequence was confirmed, and the XbaI-XhoI fragment was moved to the same sites of pEMBLyex4-i. In this integrating vector theNFS1 ORF was placed under control of the GAL1promoter, creating Gal-Nfs1. For integration into the genome, this plasmid was linearized at a unique StuI site and integrated into ura3–52. Site-directed mutations were introduced into the NFS1 ORF in plasmid pRS406-R1(NFS1) using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). The mutations involved changing codon 299 from AAG (Lys) to GCG (Ala), and changing codon 421 from TGT (Cys) to GCT (Ala). For plasmid shuffling, a diploid strain resistant to cycloheximide, YPH501(cyh2/cyh2), was generated as described (17Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This strain was transformed with nfs1KOHis and the heterozygous knock out (NFS1/nfs1::HIS3,cyh2/cyh2) was transformed with plasmid pR318-R1(NFS1, LEU2) and sporulated. A tetrad clone with Leu+ and His+ growth, designated x478–6C was identified and used in the experiments requiring plasmid shuffling. In this strain the chromosomal deletion ofNFS1,Δnfs1::HIS3, was covered by theNFS1 carried on the pRS318 plasmid with selectable (LEU2) and counterselectable (CYH2) markers. For ejection of the covering plasmid the strain was grown on media containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Additional constructs containingNFS1 or mutant alleles in plasmid pRS406 were integrated at the ura3–52 locus. For expression in bacteria, the NFS1 ORF was amplified with 5′BamHI and 3′ EcoRI sites. The product was cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) making an in-frame fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the sequence was confirmed. The Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the pGEX2T-NFS1 plasmid. Expression of GST-NFS1 was induced by 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–5 h at 30 °C. The GST-Nfs1p fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column and eluted with 50 mmglutathione. The eluate was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and found to contain a single major band by staining with Coomassie Blue. The band was cut from the gel and used to inject rabbits for generation of polyclonal antibodies. Other antibodies used as markers in the localization experiments were as follows: anti-Put2p was a rabbit polyclonal directed against Put2p, a mitochondrial matrix protein; anti-Por1p was a rabbit polyclonal against porin, the outer mitochondrial membrane protein; anti-Pgk1p (Molecular Probes) was a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, a soluble cytosolic protein. Cultures grown in YPAD were harvested and RNA was isolated using hot acidic phenol (65 °C, pH 5.5). The RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. The probes were labeled by random prime synthesis using fragments derived from the coding regions of the genes to be studied. The blot was washed at high stringency (65 °C, 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal antibodies and the signal was developed using a goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate and the ECL kit (Amersham). Mitochondria were isolated from yeast (18Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The cytosolic cell fraction was derived from a concentrated translation-competent yeast lysate. This lysate was centrifuged at 386,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant was designated as cytosol. Intact mitochondria were suspended in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.6 msorbitol. For releasing the soluble contents of the intermembrane space, the mitochondria were subjected to hypotonic shock by diluting the sorbitol to 0.1 m and incubating at 0 °C for 10 min (19Martin H. Eckerskorn C. Gartner F. Rassow J. Lottspeich F. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mitoplasts were separated from the outer membrane and intermembrane space components by centrifuging at 12,000 ×g. The mitoplasts were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 ×g. For tracking the 55Fe label in mitochondria, aliquots of the fractions (mitochondria, intermembrane space, mitoplasts, Triton X-100 mitoplast supernatant, and Triton X-100 insoluble mitoplast pellet) were suspended in scintillation mixture and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. The NFS1 ORF was amplified between NdeI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites and cloned into pSP64T (20Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Nfs1p preprotein was generated by transcription followed by translation in the presence of a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and the radiolabeled product was used in a mitochondrial import study (21Schulke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Gordon D.M. Saxena S. Dancis A. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions containing 100 μg of mitochondria were initiated by adding the radiolabeled preprotein. Import reaction mixtures contained 4 mm ATP and 1 mm GTP. Following import at 20 °C for 15 min, reaction mixtures were treated with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C. The protease was inactivated and the samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to film. The assay for ferric reductase was a filter lift assay (22Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), modified by the addition of 50 μm copper sulfate and 10 μm ferric ammonium sulfate to YPD agar plates for growth of the colonies to be assayed. Under these conditions the wild-type exhibited repressed activity (Red−) and the MA14 strain was strongly positive (Red+). Assays for ferric reductase and high affinity ferrous iron uptake have been described (13Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D. Klausner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aconitase was assayed by measuring the formation of cis-aconitate at 240 nm as described (23Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture of 1 ml consisted of 20 mm iso-citrate, 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purified mitochondria (150 μg) were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and added to the assay mixture. The ΔA 240 nm was measured for 2 min at room temperature. The extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate is 3.6 mm−1 and the activity was expressed as nanomoles of cis-aconitate formed per mg of mitochondria/min. Succinate dehydrogenase was assayed by following the reduction ofp-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) to the INT-formazan (24Munujos P. Coll-Canti J. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Gella F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For the assay reactions, 300 μl of 0.01 m succinate was mixed with 100 μl of 2.5 mg/ml INT solution, and the solubilized mitochondria (150 μg) in 0.5% Triton X-100 was added. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 5–8 min and stopped with ethyl acetate:ethanol:trichloroacetic acid in 5:5:1 ratio (v/v). The reaction tube was centrifuged for 1 min at 15,000 × g and the OD490 of the supernatant was measured. For control reactions, the succinate substrate was substituted with 300 μl of 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The extinction coefficient for INT-formazan is 19,310 m−1 at 500 nm and the activity of succinate dehydrogenase was expressed as nanomoles of INT-formazan formed per mg of mitochondria/min (24Munujos P. Coll-Canti J. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Gella F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were lysed with 0.6% SDS in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Iron was reduced by dithionite and the indicator bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid was added at 10 mm final concentration. The colored ferrous iron-bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid complex was measured by determining the absorption at 520 nm, and mitochondrial iron content was calculated from a standard curve. A selection for mutants involved in cellular iron homeostasis was modified from our previous method (25Dancis A. Yuan D. Haile D. Askwith C. Elde D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The FRE1 gene encodes the major cell surface reductase and is required for iron acquisition from ferric iron chelates.FRE1 is active when cells are starved for iron, and inactive when cells are replete. To isolate mutants unable to respond to environmental iron, the FRE1 promoter was fused to theHIS3 coding region, and this construct was integrated into the chromosome of a Δhis3 strain. The strain carrying the integrated FRE1-HIS3 marker on the chromosome was cultured in rich (YPAD) medium and a dilute inoculum was spread on agar plates of the same composition, allowing colonies to arise from single cells. The colonies were replicated to selective plates consisting of defined medium lacking histidine and supplemented with iron (20 μm ferric ammonium sulfate). Under these conditions, uptake of the metal could proceed by genetically distinct high and low affinity uptake systems (26Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 42: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Thus, mutations abrogating only one system were not selected, and instead, regulatory mutants and mutants affecting metal distribution were identified. Most colonies did not grow at all on the selection plates, but after 4 days, a small number of colonies emerged as papillae on a background of non-growing cells. The growing cells were transferred to rich (YPAD) plates. One of the mutants selected in this manner, MA14, was for further genetic analysis. The mutant exhibited non-repressed surface reductase, consistent with the selection scheme (Red+ for non-repressed reductase). Crossing with the parental strain of the opposite mating type revealed that the mutation was recessive, i.e. the diploid was Red−. Sporulation of this diploid revealed that a single locus was involved, because the reductase phenotype segregated as 2+:2− in 20 tetrads. Several other mutants with similar phenotypes were selected, including numerous isolates of ssq1 mutants (27Knight S. Sepuri N. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Crossing of MA14 with 191-33C which carries a mutant allele of SSQ1, yielded diploid strains with completely normal iron metabolism. Iron uptake, surface reductase, and regulation of the above diploid strain were normal, indicating that the MA14 and SSQ1 mutant loci were not allelic. Similar analyses with mutants at other loci implicated in iron homeostasis were performed. Crosses with Δatm1 (28Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 4: 188-195Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Δyfh1 (29Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) strains ruled out that MA14 was mutated at those loci. We wondered if the dysregulation of the FRE1promoter fusion in the MA14 mutant reflected a more general alteration in cellular iron homeostasis. In wild-type yeast, uptake of iron from ferric chelates in the medium requires the concerted action of several proteins (30Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The surface reductases encoded by FRE1 andFRE2 act on external ferric iron chelates, releasing ferrous iron which can then be transported by an iron transport complex. The latter consists of the FTR1 permease and FET3multicopper oxidase (31Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 32Stearman R. Yuan D. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The genes for the proteins involved in iron uptake are coordinately regulated at the level of transcription byAFT1, an iron sensor-regulator (33Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Iron deprivation induces AFT1-dependent transcription of the target genes. The mutant grown in standard rich (YPAD) medium was evaluated for up-regulation of the genes controlled by AFT1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the mRNA levels for surface reductases, FRE1 andFRE2, were increased in the MA14 mutant compared with the wild-type. FRE1 expression was present in the wild-type and increased roughly 2-fold in the mutant. FRE2 expression was undetectable in the wild-type and highly induced in the mutant. The different effects on FRE1 and FRE2 are probably due to the dual regulatory control of FRE1, which is dependent on both iron (14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and copper (34Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) levels, whereasFRE2 is dependent only on iron levels (35Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). TheFET3 and FTR1 transcripts were also increased in the mutant. The extent of up-regulation of these components was similar to that observed in an AFT1–1 up strain, M2, in which the iron sensor-regulator remains constitutively induced due to a point mutation (Fig. 1 A). To investigate the role of AFT1 in the induction of the cellular iron uptake system in the MA14 mutant, the AFT1gene was interrupted in the MA14 strain. Surface ferric reductase activity was evaluated in the double mutant. The increment in ferric reductase in MA14 was found to be partially dependent on the presence of an intact copy of AFT1 (Fig. 1 B). However, increased activity was still observed in the double mutant compared with the wild-type (compare WT AFT1 with MA14 Δaft1 in Fig.1 B). This effect could be due to regulators other thanAFT1 that are capable of inducing FRE1 orFRE2 expression. Regulation of FRE1 by theMAC1 regulator has been described (34Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 36Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and anAFT1 homologous gene present in the yeast genome (YPL202C) might also mediate the increased ferric reductase expression. By contrast, the increment in high affinity ferrous iron uptake observed in the MA14 mutant was completely dependent on AFT1 (Fig.1 B). The AFT1 sensor regulator is involved in homeostatic responses of the cell to environmental iron. Therefore, the response of the MA14 mutant to a more graded and controlled exposure to iron was tested. The wild-type and the mutant were grown in defined media with varying concentrations of iron, and high affinity ferrous iron uptake was measured. The results show that at every medium iron concentration tested, the iron uptake activity was higher in the MA14 than the wild-type (Fig. 1 C). The wild-type exhibited a progressively decreasing iron uptake rate with increasing iron exposure, as would be predicted for a homeostatically regulated process. The magnitude of this regulation was about 5-fold between lowest and highest iron exposures. By contrast the magnitude of the iron uptake regulation by the MA14 mutant was only 2-fold. Together these data suggest that in the mutant, Aft1p was not responding appropriately to iron in the environment and in the cell. Possible explanations for this are that intracellular iron was sequestered away from Aft1p or that a factor required for the Aft1p iron response was lacking. The observation that the rate of cellular iron uptake was increased in the MA14 mutant led us to wonder how the excess iron was distributed within the mutant cells. To address this question, the wild-type and MA14 strains were cultured in media containing different concentrations of iron to which radioactive55Fe was added as a tracer. After 16 h of growth during which the labeling of intracellular iron pools reached a steady state, mitochondria were isolated from the radiolabeled cells. The iron levels in mitochondria isolated from wild-type and MA14 were indistinguishable at the lowest iron medium concentration of 0.1 μm (.512 versus .541 pmol/μg, TableI). This value is comparable to previously published values for yeast (37Lesuisse E. Labbe P. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 149-178Google Scholar) and mammalian (38Tangeras A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 843: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) mitochondrial iron levels. However, when the medium iron concentration was increased, MA14 mutant mitochondria accumulated dramatically more iron. At 1 μm the iron in the MA14 mitochondria was 18.6 (pmol/μg), at 5 μm the level was 61.5, and at 50 μm the level was 75.3, whereas in the wild-type the maximum level achieved was 4.9 (pmol/μg) (Table I). The distribution of the iron within the mitochondria was also examined (Fig.2). The iron content of the intermembrane space was evaluated after hypotonic shock that disrupts the outer membrane. No differences between wild-type and mutant were observed. The mitoplasts, consisting of intact inner membrane and matrix, were evaluated. Most of the iron in the MA14 mutant mitochondria was found in the mitoplasts. The mitoplasts were then lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 and separated into a soluble supernatant fraction and an insoluble pellet fraction. Remarkably, for the mutant grown in iron concentrations of 1 μm or greater, most of the mitochondrial iron (53–60%) remained in the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet fraction. By contrast, only a small proportion of the iron (5–12%) was found in this fraction isolated from wild-type cells (Table I, Fig. 2). The mitochondrial fraction resistant to detergent solubilization would be expected to include membranes, large protein complexes and aggregates. The very marked increase of iron distributed to this fraction in the MA14 mutant suggests that the mutant phenotype alters iron trafficking"
https://openalex.org/W2025339975,"Numb is a membrane-associated, phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing protein that functions as an intrinsic determinant of cell fate during Drosophila development. We have identified four isoforms of mammalian Numb with predicted molecular masses of 65, 66, 71, and 72 kDa that are generated by alternative splicing of the Numb mRNA. The different isoforms result from the presence of two sequence inserts within the PTB domain and the central region of the protein. The endogenous expression pattern of these isoforms, examined using specific antisera, varied in different tissues and cell lines. In addition, differentiation of P19 cells with retinoic acid leads to the specific loss of expression of the 71- and 72-kDa Numb proteins, suggesting that the expression of certain forms of Numb protein is regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Expression of Numb proteins fused to green fluorescent protein revealed that the form of the PTB domain with the alternatively spliced insert constitutively associated with the plasma membrane in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In contrast, the isoform without the insert was cytoplasmic, suggesting that different PTB domain isoforms may regulate the subcellular localization of Numb proteins. The membrane localization may be due, in part, to differential affinity for acidic phospholipids. The distinct expression and localization patterns of the different mammalian Numb isoforms suggest that they have distinct functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2093182890,"Protein palmitoylation represents an important mechanism governing the dynamic subcellular localization of many signaling proteins. Palmitoylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) promotes its targeting to plasmalemmal caveolae; agonist-promoted depalmitoylation leads to eNOS translocation. Depalmitoylation and translocation of eNOS modulate the agonist response, but the pathways that regulate eNOS palmitoylation and depalmitoylation are poorly understood. We now show that the newly characterized acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) regulates eNOS depalmitoylation. Immunoblot analyses indicate that APT1 is expressed in bovine aortic endothelial cells, which express eNOS. APT1 overexpression appears to accelerate the depalmitoylation of eNOS in COS-7 cells cotransfected with eNOS and APT1 cDNAs. Additionally, purified recombinant APT1 depalmitoylates eNOS assayed in biological membranes isolated from endothelial cells biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate or COS-7 cells transfected with eNOS cDNA. More important, the APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation of palmitoyl-eNOS is potentiated by Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM), a key allosteric activator of eNOS. In contrast, APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation of the G protein Gαs is unaffected by Ca2+-CaM. Furthermore, caveolin, a palmitoylated membrane protein, does not appear to be a substrate for APT1. Taken together, these results support a role for APT1 in the regulation of eNOS depalmitoylation and suggest that Ca2+-CaM activation of eNOS renders the enzyme more susceptible to APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation. Protein palmitoylation represents an important mechanism governing the dynamic subcellular localization of many signaling proteins. Palmitoylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) promotes its targeting to plasmalemmal caveolae; agonist-promoted depalmitoylation leads to eNOS translocation. Depalmitoylation and translocation of eNOS modulate the agonist response, but the pathways that regulate eNOS palmitoylation and depalmitoylation are poorly understood. We now show that the newly characterized acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) regulates eNOS depalmitoylation. Immunoblot analyses indicate that APT1 is expressed in bovine aortic endothelial cells, which express eNOS. APT1 overexpression appears to accelerate the depalmitoylation of eNOS in COS-7 cells cotransfected with eNOS and APT1 cDNAs. Additionally, purified recombinant APT1 depalmitoylates eNOS assayed in biological membranes isolated from endothelial cells biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate or COS-7 cells transfected with eNOS cDNA. More important, the APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation of palmitoyl-eNOS is potentiated by Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM), a key allosteric activator of eNOS. In contrast, APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation of the G protein Gαs is unaffected by Ca2+-CaM. Furthermore, caveolin, a palmitoylated membrane protein, does not appear to be a substrate for APT1. Taken together, these results support a role for APT1 in the regulation of eNOS depalmitoylation and suggest that Ca2+-CaM activation of eNOS renders the enzyme more susceptible to APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation. calmodulin endothelial nitric-oxide synthase acyl-protein thioesterase 1 bovine aortic endothelial cell(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid Nitric oxide is a key intercellular messenger molecule involved in diverse biological processes and is synthesized in mammalian cells by a family of Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)1-activated nitric-oxide synthases (for review, see Ref. 1Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) plays a critical role in controlling vascular tone and platelet aggregation. Among the nitric-oxide synthase isoforms, eNOS is unique in its membrane localization. The membrane association of eNOS is conferred by N-myristoylation at Gly2 and by thiopalmitoylations at Cys15 and Cys26 (2Robinson L.J. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation involves cleavage of the N-terminal Met residue and attachment of the 14-carbon unsaturated fatty acid myristic acid to Gly2 via an acyl–amide bond. Myristoylation is a cotranslational, usually irreversible process that is catalyzed by a well characterized N-myristoyltransferase (for review, see Ref. 3Boutin J.A. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation represents a distinct type of acylation in which the 16-carbon unsaturated fatty acid palmitic acid is post-translationally attached to the thiol group of a specific Cys residue via an acyl–thioester bond (for review, see Ref. 4Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In contrast to the stable acyl–amide bond in N-myristoylation, the chemical lability of the thioester bond allows the existence of regulated cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation that may control a protein's subcellular localization. One critical function of protein palmitoylation appears to be tethering otherwise soluble proteins to the plasmalemmal membrane. Indeed, although N-myristoylated and prenylated signaling proteins are found in the cytoplasm as well as on cellular membranes, palmitoylation of signaling proteins confines them to cellular membranes (for review, see Ref. 4Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Moreover, for several signaling proteins (including Src-like tyrosine kinases (5Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the heterotrimeric G protein α subunit Gαi1 (6Song K.S. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Parenti M. Lisanti M.P. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar), and eNOS (7Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar)), palmitoylation targets the protein to specific signal transduction microdomains in the plasmalemmal membrane termed caveolae. Cycles of protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation may control a protein's distribution between membrane and cytoplasm and/or between subdomains of the plasma membrane (e.g. caveolae versusnon-caveolae) and may modulate the coupling of specific signaling proteins to either receptors or intracellular effectors. To date, four examples of agonist-regulated protein depalmitoylation have been reported: the β2-adrenergic receptor (8Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (9Hayashi M.K. Haga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the heterotrimeric G protein α subunit Gαs (10Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and eNOS (11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which activation-dependent changes in these proteins' palmitoylation state are achieved remain elusive. Numerous studies have attempted to identify protein palmitoyltransferases that palmitoylate proteins and protein palmitoylthioesterases that depalmitoylate proteins, but these efforts to date have been mostly unsuccessful. A cytosolic protein palmitoylthioesterase termed acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) has been recently purified and cloned from rat liver: APT1 catalyzes the depalmitoylation of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits and p21 ras (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). APT1 was originally isolated from rat liver as a lysophospholipase that hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine into saturated fatty acid and sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (13Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, Duncan and Gilman (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that 1) theK m of APT1 for acyl-protein substrates is 250-fold lower than the respective values observed for lysophosphatidylcholine and that 2) APT1 can act in situ to depalmitoylate Gαs when coexpressed in HEK293 cells. The evidence presented by Duncan and Gilman suggests that APT1 may represent the first authentic participant in regulated depalmitoylation of intracellular signaling proteins. This study investigates whether APT1 is also a physiological regulator of eNOS depalmitoylation. To this end, it is important to address several issues. First, is APT1 endogenously expressed in eNOS-expressing cells (e.g. endothelial cells)? Second, can coexpression of APT1 with eNOS in a heterologous mammalian system accelerate the rate of eNOS depalmitoylation in situ? Third, can purified APT1 depalmitoylate eNOS in vitro? Finally, if APT1 does appear to depalmitoylate eNOS, does APT1 have a preference for the activated form of eNOS over the nonactivated form of eNOS? For eukaryotic expression of rat APT1, APT1 cDNA (13Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pBK-CMV (Stratagene) or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vector. For purification of APT1 from a prokaryotic expression system, His6-tagged rat APT1 cDNA in the bacterial expression vector pQE60 (QIAGEN Inc.) was used as described previously (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression vector encoding eNOS (pK-ENH) has been previously described (11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs for expression of Gαs in Escherichia coli have also been described (14Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mutants of eNOS with residues 10–14 deleted (termed eNOSΔ10–14), with residues 18–25 deleted (termed eNOSGL1), and with residues 16–25 all converted into Gly (termed eNOSG10) (see Fig. 7) were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis employing oligonucleotides that encoded site-specific mutations or deletions as primary primers and pK-ENH as a template. Secondary primers were then used with the previously generated fragments as templates to create 850-base pair mutation-encoding fragments starting from −70 base pairs and ending at 780 base pairs. The purified polymerase chain reaction products of the second polymerase chain reaction were digested withBamHI and EcoRI for unidirectional ligation into reciprocally digested pK-ENH. The constructs were restriction-mapped to confirm correct insertion, and the sequences of the polymerase chain reaction fragments were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC; obtained from Cell Systems Corp.) were cultured as described previously (15Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Cells were used between passages 5 and 9. The COS-7 cell line was grown and transfected with 15–30 μg of DNA by electroporation (BTX Electro Cell Manipulator). For cotransfections, an equivalent amount of each plasmid was transfected for a total of 30 μg of DNA. The nitric-oxide synthase activities of wild-type and mutant eNOS were determined by measuring the conversion of radiolabeledl-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline and nitric oxide as described by Bredt and Schmidt (16Bredt D.S. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 249-258Google Scholar). Cultures were radiolabeled with [3H]palmitic acid (40–60 Ci/mmol) by incubation of cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 mCi/ml (∼20 μm) [3H]palmitate (NEN Life Science Products) for 2 h at 37 °C. Transfected COS-7 cells or BAEC were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in either Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg/ml each antipain, leupeptin, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) or Buffer B (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mml-arginine, 10 μmBH4, and protease inhibitors as listed for Buffer A). Cells were lysed by sonication using a Branson Model 450 sonifier; cell debris was discarded following a brief 1000 × gcentrifugation. When subcellular fractionation was required, cells were lysed in Buffer B and separated into soluble and particulate fractions by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) for 1 h. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). To examine the effects of APT1 on eNOS depalmitoylation in situ, pulse-chase experiments were performed in COS-7 cells coexpressing eNOS and APT1 or eNOS and a control plasmid (pBK-CMV). After labeling transfected COS-7 cells with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate for 2 h, cultures were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin with 100 μm unlabeled palmitate and then incubated in the same chase medium for the indicated durations. Cells were harvested in Buffer A as described above and immunoprecipitated as described below. To produce purified recombinant His6-tagged APT1, cultures of E. coli were grown; protein expression was induced; and soluble lysate was prepared as described previously (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The soluble lysate was then loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (QIAGEN Inc.). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) supplemented with 100 mmNaCl and 10 mm imidazole (Sigma). The protein was eluted from the column with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) supplemented with 100 mm imidazole. The purified protein was concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Millipore Corp.) and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant heterotrimeric Gs was prepared by combining purified Gαs (produced in E. coli) with purified Gβ1γ2 (from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells) at a 1:1 molar ratio. Heterotrimeric Gs (10 μm) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (∼1000 cpm/pmol, 100 μm) as described previously by Duncan and Gilman (17Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Incorporation of [3H]palmitate into Gαs, but not Gβ1 or Gγ2, was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Excess palmitoyl-CoA was removed from the sample by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and palmitoylated heterotrimeric Gs was concentrated to ∼1 μm (assessed by liquid scintillation spectrometry) and stored at −80 °C until used in depalmitoylation assays. To examine the ability of purified recombinant APT1 to depalmitoylate eNOS, the eNOS mutants, and caveolin in vitro, COS-7 cells transfected with eNOS- or eNOS mutant-expressing plasmids and BAEC expressing endogenous eNOS and caveolin were used. Two days post-transfection, COS-7 cells were labeled with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate and harvested in Buffer B. BAEC were labeled when confluent and harvested in Buffer B. Cell lysates were sonicated (two 10-s bursts), and the particulate fraction obtained after microcentrifugation (maximum speed for 30 min) was resuspended in Buffer B with a 27-gauge needle. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%, and protein concentration was determined with the Bradford reagent. Protein from either the soluble or particulate fraction (or purified [3H]palmitoyl-Gαs) was incubated at 30 °C with purified APT1 in APT1 reaction buffer (50 mmHepes (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmEDTA, 7.5 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mml-arginine, 10 μm BH4, 6 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 32 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 32 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) in a total volume of 1 ml. At specified time points, 100 μl of the reaction was removed and placed in 900 μl of ice-cold Buffer A supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to terminate the APT1 reaction. Samples were then immunoprecipitated (except for those assaying purified [3H]palmitoyl-Gαs) and processed as described below. The effects of Ca2+-CaM (Calbiochem) and EGTA (Sigma) were assessed by adding the reagent to the reaction immediately before adding APT1. Immunoprecipitation of eNOS was done in Buffer A using a polyclonal antiserum against eNOS as described previously (18Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of caveolin was done using 4 μg/ml polyclonal anti-caveolin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitates were eluted from protein A-Sepharose with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing either 5 mm dithiothreitol (for [3H]palmitate-labeled samples) or 5% β-mercaptoethanol (for all other samples). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm CAPSO (pH 10) and 20% methanol. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by the Cyclone Storage PhosphorImager (Packard Instrument Co.); signals were quantitated using Optiquant System software (Packard Instrument Co.). For immunoblotting of eNOS and caveolin, monoclonal antibodies directed against eNOS or caveolin (Transduction Laboratories) were used for chemiluminescent detection of proteins as described previously (19Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzick L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of Gαs was done with antiserum 584 (20Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting of APT1, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with a previously described anti-APT1 antiserum (13Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) for 1 h in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk. The anti-APT1 antiserum was titrated between 1:100 and 1:10,000 to determine optimal conditions. After three washes (5 min each), the membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at a 1:20,000 dilution in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk. After three additional washes in TBST, the membranes were incubated with a chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols, exposed to x-ray film, and quantitated by densitometry or directly quantitated using the ChemiImager 4000 (Alpha Innotech). eNOS protein abundance was quantitated in the linear range of chemiluminescence detection using ChemiImager software (Alpha Innotech) and was validated over a range of protein concentrations. Determinations of labeling half-life applied the equation for single exponential decay, and the statistical significance of the derived values was evaluated by analysis of variance using GraphPAD Prism software. Of first importance in assessing the possibility of eNOS depalmitoylation by APT1 was determining whether cells that characteristically express eNOS also express APT1. Lysates of BAEC (cells known to express eNOS robustly (15Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar)) were analyzed by immunoblots probed with a previously described polyclonal antiserum directed against APT1 (13Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In BAEC, the anti-APT1 antiserum (but not nonimmune serum) detected a major immunoreactive band (presumably APT1) at the predicted molecular mass of 25 kDa (Fig.1, fifth lane); this band is identical in molecular mass to that of pure APT1 (sixth lane; purified to homogeneity on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column following expression of His6-tagged APT1 in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures”). An additional immunoreactive protein was seen in BAEC and COS-7 cells at ∼18 kDa; this band may represent either an irrelevant immunoreactive protein or a degradation product of APT1. COS-7 cells were transfected with APT1-expressing plasmids (pBK-APT1 and pcDNA3-APT1) or a control plasmid (pBK-antisenseAPT1) or were not transfected (untransfected, as shown); cell lysates were immunoblotted with the anti-APT1 antiserum. The immunodetection of greater quantities of the 25-kDa protein in cells transfected with APT1-expressing plasmids suggests that the 25-kDa band is indeed APT1 (Fig. 1). The APT1 constructs in pBK-CMV and the pcDNA3 vectors yielded approximately equivalent amounts of recombinant APT1 expression, approximately double the endogenous APT1 level seen in control COS-7 cells. To test whether APT1 affects the turnover rate of [3H]palmitate on eNOS, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with cDNA constructs encoding eNOS plus either an APT1-expressing plasmid or a control plasmid. Two days after transfection, the cells were incubated in medium containing 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid and harvested at various times, and eNOS was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed following SDS-PAGE. The rate of biosynthetic incorporation of [3H]palmitate into eNOS was not substantively altered by coexpression of APT1 with eNOS relative to the rate observed when eNOS was coexpressed with a control plasmid (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig.2, pulse-chase experiments (n = 3) revealed a small but reproducible increase in the rate of eNOS depalmitoylation in COS-7 cells cotransfected with eNOS plus APT1 cDNAs. This modest (but consistent) effect of APT1 cotransfection on eNOS depalmitoylation may reflect the low level of APT1 overexpression achieved in transient transfection experiments using these constructs, confounded further by the fairly robust endogenous expression of APT1 in control COS-7 cells. Therefore, for more detailed characterizations, we sought to further characterize the effects of APT1 by experiments in cell-free systems using purified protein. Recombinant His6-tagged APT1 expressed in E. coli was purified to >95% purity in a single Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography step (see Fig. 1) (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and used to study the depalmitoylation of eNOS in biological membranes isolated from either BAEC or eNOS-transfected COS-7 cells that had been biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate. As shown in Fig. 3, purified APT1 significantly accelerated eNOS depalmitoylation: in the presence of APT1, there was a marked decrease in [3H]palmitate labeling of eNOS, with no substantive change in the total eNOS protein quantitated by immunoblotting. The half-life of [3H]palmitate-labeled eNOS decreased from 14.3 ± 1.6 to 3.1 ± 0.3 min when membranes were incubated in the presence of APT1 (mean ± S.E. forn = three independent experiments; p < 0.001); there was no change in the half-life of the eNOS protein itself. Boiling APT1 completely abrogated its ability to potentiate the depalmitoylation of eNOS (data not shown). Endogenous eNOS biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate in BAEC and recombinant wild-type eNOS in transfected COS-7 cells were indistinguishable with respect to their ability to be depalmitoylated by purified APT1. Duncan and Gilman (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) have provided support for activation-dependent regulation of the depalmitoylation of Gαs by demonstrating that when Gαs is used as a substrate for APT1 in vitro, the activated dissociated α subunit is depalmitoylated by APT1 more rapidly than is the inactive heterotrimer. We have previously found that agonist activation of eNOS in bovine aortic endothelial cells can promote the enzyme's depalmitoylation in situ (11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To explore whether APT1 depalmitoylation of eNOS might be affected by the activation of eNOSin vitro, we studied the effects of Ca2+-CaM, a key allosteric activator of eNOS (reviewed in Ref. 21Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of Ca2+-CaM to incubations of [3H]palmitoyl-eNOS with APT1 potentiated the depalmitoylation of eNOS relative to incubations with APT1 alone: the t 12 of [3H]palmitoyl-eNOS decreased from 3.1 ± 0.3 to 2.3 ± 0.2 min with the addition of Ca2+-CaM (mean ± S.E. for n = three independent experiments; p < 0.04). In the absence of APT1, the addition of Ca2+-CaM did not increase the rate of eNOS depalmitoylation over that occurring in buffer alone (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator, was found consistently to attenuate APT1-catalyzed eNOS depalmitoylation: the t 12 of [3H]palmitoyl-eNOS increased from 3.1 ± 0.3 to 4.6 ± 0.9 min with the addition of EGTA (mean ± S.E. forn = three independent experiments; p < 0.02). To demonstrate the specificity of the effect of Ca2+-CaM and EGTA on APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation, we explored the effects of these reagents on APT1-promoted depalmitoylation of the G protein Gαs, a signaling protein not known to directly bind Ca2+-CaM. Fig. 5 demonstrates that, in contrast to the opposing effects of Ca2+-CaM and EGTA on APT1 depalmitoylation of eNOS, neither Ca2+-CaM nor EGTA had any effect on APT1 depalmitoylation of Gαs. Thus, in marked contrast to the effects seen with eNOS, the addition of Ca2+-CaM does not significantly potentiate APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation of Gαs, nor does the Ca2+chelator EGTA inhibit APT1-promoted depalmitoylation of Gαs. To determine whether APT1 can also promote the depalmitoylation of other palmitoylated proteins, we conducted similarly designed experiments using caveolin, a 22-kDa palmitoylated integral membrane protein that interacts with and regulates eNOS (22Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and other signaling proteins (23Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Caveolin biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate did not appear to be a substrate for APT1 (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the addition of Ca2+-CaM did not trigger APT1 depalmitoylation of caveolin, and EGTA did not significantly alter the lack of depalmitoylating activity of APT1 for caveolin (Fig. 6), again suggesting the specificity of Ca2+-CaM-accelerated APT1 depalmitoylation of eNOS. To further characterize the sequences in eNOS important to its recognition by APT1, several eNOS mutants were generated with mutations in the sequence between and around Cys15 and Cys26, the two palmitoylated Cys residues of eNOS (Fig.7). As the two palmitoylated Cys residues are separated by an unusual 10-residue sequence of five tandem Gly-Leu repeats ((Gly-Leu)5), the eNOSGL1 and eNOSG10 mutants explored the effects of spacing and protein flexibility, respectively, between the two palmitoylated Cys residues (Fig. 7). Another mutant, termed eNOSΔ10–14, was used to explore whether the distance between the myristoylated Gly2and palmitoylated Cys residues affects the ability of eNOS to be depalmitoylated by APT1. All these mutants were expressed at the same level as wild-type eNOS in transfected COS-7 cells (shown by immunoblot analysis; Fig. 7) and had intact nitric-oxide synthase activity (assayed using the l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline assay described above; data not shown). The eNOSGL1 and eNOSG10 mutants, which contain alterations in the amino acid sequence between the two palmitoylated Cys residues, showed no [3H]palmitate incorporation in biosynthetic labeling experiments using COS-7 cells transiently transfected with these cDNAs that express mutant eNOS proteins. However, the deletion mutant eNOSΔ10–14 did incorporate [3H]palmitate in biosynthetic labeling experiments; furthermore, purified APT1 promoted the depalmitoylation of the [3H]palmitate-labeled eNOSΔ10–14mutant in biological membranes, as seen for the wild-type eNOS (Fig.7). Several lines of evidence in this study suggest that APT1 may be a physiological regulator of eNOS depalmitoylation. We have shown that APT1 is expressed in BAEC, cells that also express eNOS (Fig. 1,fifth lane). The presence of APT1 in BAEC suggests that, at least with respect to cellular distribution, APT1 has the possibility to interact with eNOS in a physiologically relevant manner. We have also shown that coexpression of APT1 can accelerate eNOS depalmitoylation in situ in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2) and that purified APT1 can depalmitoylate eNOS (Fig. 3). The potentiation by Ca2+-CaM of APT1-catalyzed eNOS depalmitoylation (Fig. 4) provides a potential regulatory mechanism controlling this key process and suggests that APT1 may indeed be responsible for the agonist-induced depalmitoylation of eNOS seen in BAEC. In addition to its effects on eNOS, APT1 is able to depalmitoylate heterotrimeric G protein α subunits and p21 ras (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with respect to at least eNOS and heterotrimeric G proteins, APT1 shows a preference for the activated state of the protein. Thus, the same enzyme, APT1, appears able to depalmitoylate structurally dissimilar signaling proteins. APT1 does, however, show some substrate selectivity in that APT1 does not seem to promote the depalmitoylation of caveolin (Fig. 6). Caveolin differs from heterotrimeric G protein α subunits and eNOS in that 1) it is an integral membrane protein; 2) it is palmitoylated near the C terminus rather than the N terminus; and 3) its palmitoylation is not known to be modulated by agonists (24Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). No consensus sequence has been defined for protein palmitoylation: the only common aspect of palmitoylated Cys residues appears to be that the sites are found in proximity to either other lipid-modified residues or putative transmembrane domains. The seeming promiscuity of palmitoylation is evident not only in the diversity of sequences flanking palmitoylated Cys residues (4Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), but also in the palmitoylation of both transmembrane proteins (e.g. caveolin) and otherwise soluble proteins (e.g. eNOS). It will be especially interesting to test whether integral membrane proteins such as the β2-adrenergic receptor and the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (both of which exhibit agonist-modulated depalmitoylation) are also substrates for APT1. Although a consensus sequence for protein palmitoylation has yet to be determined, there are illustrative features of the eNOS mutants in which the sequence between the palmitoylated cysteines (Cys15 and Cys26) are altered: palmitoylation is abrogated when the intervening 10-amino acid sequence (Gly-Leu)5 is shortened to Gly-Leu or replaced by Gly10 (all five Leu residues changed to Gly). By contrast, deletion of a five-amino acid sequence located immediately N-terminal to Cys15 has no effect on palmitoylation in cells or depalmitoylation by APT1. Membrane-associated eNOS likely represents the physiological substrate for APT1, and therefore, [3H]palmitoyl-eNOS in biological membranes was used as a substrate to explore the potential role for APT1 in eNOS depalmitoylation. Purified recombinant APT1 can depalmitoylate [3H]palmitoyl-eNOS derived from membranes of BAEC and eNOS-transfected COS-7 cells biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate. Although experiments under these in vitro conditions may be considered less physiological thanin situ coexpression experiments, the use of purified APT1 allowed the unambiguous identification of APT1 as the agent responsible for the ∼4-fold acceleration of eNOS depalmitoylation (Fig. 3). The fact that we observed positive effects of APT1 on eNOS depalmitoylation in biological membranes helps to validate this approach. Adding further physiological credibility to the in vitro demonstration of APT1 depalmitoylation of eNOS is our observation that APT1-catalyzed depalmitoylation of eNOS can be regulated specifically by compounds that affect the eNOS palmitoylation state in intact cells. It is known that the ability of APT1 to depalmitoylate thioacylated Gαs is regulated by activation of the G protein in that APT1 preferentially depalmitoylates Gαs when the Gα subunit is dissociated from its inhibitory interactions with its Gβγ subunits (12Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that APT1 may also prefer the activated form of eNOS as a substrate because it is known that eNOS depalmitoylation follows activation of eNOS in cells (11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+-CaM binding is thought to induce an activating conformational change in eNOS (reviewed in Ref. 21Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ca2+-CaM was included in the in vitrodepalmitoylation reaction. Fig. 4 demonstrates that the addition of Ca2+-CaM potentiates depalmitoylation of eNOS by APT1. Without exogenous APT1, Ca2+-CaM alone does not significantly increase depalmitoylation over that seen in buffer alone, suggesting that enhanced depalmitoylation of the activated form of eNOS is not simply due to possible greater accessibility of the thioester bond to nucleophiles in the buffer secondary to the conformational changes that follow Ca2+-CaM binding. Consistent with a role for Ca2+-CaM in promoting eNOS depalmitoylation is the observation that the addition of EGTA significantly attenuates APT1 acceleration of eNOS depalmitoylation (Fig. 4). The enhanced APT1 depalmitoylation of eNOS observed when eNOS is activated by Ca2+-CaM is specific in that APT1 depalmitoylation of Gαs is not accelerated by the addition of Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 5). The inability to potentiate or inhibit APT1 depalmitoylation of Gαs by Ca2+-CaM and EGTA, respectively (Fig. 5), and the lack of effect of Ca2+-CaM and EGTA on the inability of APT1 to depalmitoylate caveolin (Fig. 6) both support the specificity of activation-dependent APT1 depalmitoylation of its substrates. The high-energy thioester bond of the palmitate donor palmitoyl-CoA in conjunction with the lack of identifiable palmitoylation consensus sequences and the failure to date to isolate protein palmitoyltransferases raise the possibility that protein palmitoylation may not require a specific enzyme for catalysis. Furthermore, because protein palmitoylation can be potentially regulated in two ways (by a palmitate-adding palmitoyltransferase and/or by a palmitate-removing palmitoylthioesterase), one can envision a dynamic acylation-deacylation cycle carried out by an activation-dependent deacylating palmitoylthioesterase and constitutive nonenzymatic palmitoylation. The possibility of protein autopalmitoylation is supported by data that certain heterotrimeric G protein α subunits (17Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and several other proteins (25Bizzozero O.A. McGarry J.F. Lees M.B. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 330: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are spontaneously autopalmitoylated at the relevant Cys residues when incubated in vitro with palmitoyl-CoA. Whether APT1 is the only enzyme responsible for regulating the palmitoylation state of eNOS and other palmitoylated proteins will be ultimately studied by genetic disruption of the APT1 gene in an appropriate cell or animal model. Although it is interesting to speculate that the substrates of APT1 may consist of those signaling proteins that are dependent on palmitoylation for dynamic attachment to the membrane, additional palmitoylated peripheral membrane proteins (such as the Src family tyrosine kinases) and integral membrane proteins (such as the β2-adrenergic receptor) must be tested as potential substrates before reaching definitive conclusions about the substrate specificity of APT1. Although much remains to be explored, this study provides evidence that eNOS depalmitoylation may be enzymatically regulated in a physiologically relevant manner by the recently identified protein palmitoylthioesterase APT1. We have identified a broadened substrate specificity for APT1 that may provide a general mechanism for the concerted depalmitoylation of structurally dissimilar signaling proteins following their activation by common extracellular signals. Thomas Wei participated in the construction of the eNOS palmitoylation site mutants used in this study. We thank Alfred Gilman for helpful discussions."

https://openalex.org/W2027795688,"Prolonged exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to insulin increases GLUT1 protein content while diminishing GLUT4. These changes arise in part from changes in mRNA transcription. Here we examined whether there are also specific effects of insulin on GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA translation. Insulin enhanced association of GLUT1 mRNA with polyribosomes and decreased association with monosomes, suggesting increased translation. Conversely, insulin arrested the majority of GLUT4 transcripts in monosomes. Insulin inactivates the translational suppressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Hence, we examined the effect of rapamycin on GLUT1 mRNA translation and protein expression. Rapamycin abrogated the insulin-mediated increase in GLUT1 protein synthesis through partial inhibition of GLUT1 mRNA translation and partial inhibition of the rise in GLUT1 mRNA. 4E-BP1 inhibited GLUT1 mRNA translationin vitro. Because phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB), in concert with mTOR, inactivate 4E-BP1, we explored their role in GLUT1 protein expression. Cotransfection of cytomegalovirus promoter-driven, hemagglutinin epitope-taggedGLUT1 with dominant inhibitory mutants of PI3K or PKB inhibited the insulin-elicited increase in hemagglutinin-tagged GLUT1 protein. These results unravel the opposite effects of insulin on GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA translation. Increased GLUT1 mRNA translation appears to occur via the PI3K/PKB/mTOR/4E-BP1 cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2028633196,"It has previously been shown that germ cells in embryos derived from nos mutant mothers do not migrate to the primitive gonad and prematurely express several germline-specific markers. In the studies reported here, we have traced these defects back to the syncytial blastoderm stage. We show that pole cells in nos embryos fail to establish/maintain transcriptional quiescence; the sex determination gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) and the segmentation genes fushi tarazu and even-skipped are ectopically activated in nos- germ cells. We show that nos- germ cells are unable to attenuate the cell cycle and instead continue dividing. Unexpectedly, removal of the Sxl gene in the zygote mitigates both the migration and mitotic defects of nos- germ cells. Supporting the conclusion that Sxl is an important target for nos repression, ectopic, premature expression of Sxl protein in germ cells disrupts migration and stimulates mitotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2071440441,"Inactivation of the P16 (INK4A)/retinoblastoma (RB) or TP53 biochemical pathway is frequent event in most human cancers. Recent evidence has shown that P14ARF binds to MDM2 leading to an increased availability of wild type TP53 protein. Functional studies also support a putative tumor suppressor gene function for p14ARF suggesting that p14ARF or p53 inactivation may be functionally equivalent in tumorigenesis. To study the relative contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis, we analysed and compared alterations of the p16, p14ARF and p53 genes in 38 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (19 adenocarcinomas and 19 squamous carcinoma). The p16 tumor suppressor gene was inactivated in 22 of 38 (58%) tumors. Twelve of these samples (31%) had homozygous deletions by microsatellite analysis; eight of them (21%) had p16 promoter hypermethylation detected by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) and the remaining two (5%) harbored a point mutation in exon 2 by sequence analysis. The absence of P16 protein in every case was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Fourteen of the 22 tumors with p16 inactivation also inactivated the p14ARF gene (12 with homozygous deletions extending into INK4a/ARF and two with exon 2 mutations). Mutations of p53 were found in 18 (47%) of the tumors and nine of them (50%) harbored p14ARF inactivation. Thus, an inverse correlation was not found between p14ARF and p53 genetic alterations (P=0.18; Fisher Exact Test). Our data confirm that the p16 gene is frequently inactivated in NSCLC. Assuming that 9p deletion occurs first, the common occurrence of p53 and p14ARF alterations suggests that p14ARF inactivation is not functionally equivalent to abrogation of the TP53 pathway by p53 mutation."

However, both the biological significance and the types of DNA methylation differ greatly between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, most modified bases participate in restriction-modification, a defense mechanism that protects the host from heterologous phage infection (4Roberts R.J. Halford S.S. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). In addition,N 6-methyladenine plays a role in the initiation of DNA replication (5Noyer-Weidener M. Trautner T.A. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Significance.

The results confirm the preference of DNMT1 for pre-methylated DNA; however, the kinetics reveal a complex behavior with DNA substrates that are bound more tightly. The reaction follows a sequential mechanism whereby both substrates (DNA and AdoMet) must bind to the enzyme before any product (methylated DNA and AdoHcy) is released and is consistent with a two-step process. First, DNMT1 binds DNA at an allosteric site (probably in the N-terminal domain) and activates the catalytic center, and second, AdoMet and the DNA (which may either be the same molecule bound to the regulatory site or a new DNA molecule) occupy the catalytic site. Allosteric binding of pre-methylated CG is proposed to increase the accessibility of AdoMet to the catalytic center, which then results in an acceleration of the reaction rate.RESULTSInitial velocity experiments enable the evaluation of kinetic constants and provide insights into the mechanism of a reaction. A comprehension of the mechanism of this key enzyme, human DNMT1, is critical for understanding its role in developmental processes and in the etiology of fragile X syndrome and other diseases (7Li E.

A variety of DNA templates (Table I) were methylated to less than 5–8% of the total CG steps by purified, recombinant DNMT1 with the aim of assessing the effect of sequences flanking the substrate CG on the kinetic constants, the role of negative supercoiling, and the mechanism of the reaction. Experimental data were analyzed by graphing the extent of methylation as a function of concentration of DNA or AdoMet, as variable substrates, on double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. This report is the second of a series of three papers describing the purification and characterization of DNMT1 (45Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol.

Wells, manuscript in preparation. will describe the effect of DNA topology on the reaction rates at CG sites in random as well as CGG·CCG repeat tracts and compare the kinetic properties of DNMT1 with the bacterial M.SssI.Linear Velocity ResponsesFor bireactant enzymes (such as DNMT1), double-reciprocal plots generally give linear responses where 1/v is graphed as a function of 1/substrate. For most of the DNAs used, which included supercoiled pRW3602 as purified fromEscherichia coli (−ς̄ = 0.045), relaxed circular (−ς̄ = 0), or linear, as well as theSNRPN oligonucleotide (unmethylated or hemimethylated), (CGG·CCG)12, (m5CGG·CCG)12, and (CGG·CCG)73, the velocity curves were linear with respect to the variable substrate, whether this was the DNA or AdoMet. Fig.3 shows the data with supercoiled pRW3602. Fig. 3 A shows the concentration of [3H]CH3 groups incorporated when the DNA was the variable substrate (on the x axis) and AdoMet the fixed substrate. Conversely, Fig. 3 B shows the results with AdoMet as the variable substrate and DNA as the fixed substrate. For all of the DNA templates listed above, the velocity patterns were as in Fig.3, i.e. they converged to the left of the y axis and above or below the x axis for both substrates. Fig.4 shows the double-reciprocal plots for the triplet repeat sequences (CGG·CCG)12 (Fig. 4,A and B), (m5CGG·CCG)12 (Fig. 4, C andD), and (CGG·CCG)73 (Fig. 4, E andF). These patterns contrast with those obtained with M.HhaI (51Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and M.SssI2methylases, where the families of lines converge on the yaxis when AdoMet is the variable substrate. This result shows that AdoMet and DNA do not bind by an ordered and rapid equilibrium mechanism to DNMT1, as in the case with M.HhaI and M.SssI.Figure 4Initial forward velocities for the methylation of CGG·CCG triplet repeats.

As shown in Equations 2 and 3, four replots are possible that give the following constants: (a) 1/V max on they axis intercept (Fig. 5 A) and 1/ KmAdoMet on thex-axis intercept by replotting the intercepts of Fig.3 A as a function of 1/AdoMet (Equation 3); (b) KmCG/V maxon the y axis intercept (Fig. 5 A) and 1/K ia on the x axis intercept by replotting the slopes of Fig. 3 A as a function of 1/AdoMet; (c) 1/V max on the y axis intercept (Fig. 5 B) and 1/ KmCG on the x axis intercept by replotting the intercepts from Fig. 3 B as a function of 1/CG (Equation 2); and (d) KmAdoMet/V maxon the y axis intercept (Fig. 5 B) and KmAdoMet/K ia KmCGon the x axis intercept by replotting the slopes from Fig.3 B as a function of 1/CG. Therefore, these four replots yield the maximum velocity and the Michaelis constants for AdoMet (at DNA = ∞) and DNA (at AdoMet = ∞). As pointed out previously, the dissociation constant K ia cannot be assigned to the DNA or AdoMet because the method does not distinguish the order of addition. The experimental values for the constants are reported in the companion papers2 (45Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol.

Fig. 6 A shows that the methylation rate was linear when DNA was the variable substrate. The data also indicate that, contrary to Figs. 3 and 4, velocities were maximal at 1.74 μm AdoMet, such that further increases (up to 10.0 μm) did not result in a decrease in slope or intercept. Fig. 6 B shows that plots were not linear when AdoMet was the variable substrate. Velocities were unchanged, and plots were parallel to the x axis when AdoMet concentrations rose above ∼2 μm. The responses were still dependent on DNA concentration, since 1/V max(app) (yaxis intercepts) decreased with increasing CG content. A replot of 1/V max(app) versus 1/CG was linear (Fig. 7 A), whereas both intercept and slope replots from the data at fixed AdoMet were curved (Fig. 7 B).Figure 6Double-reciprocal plots for the methylation of (CGG·Cm5CG)12.

The plots in Figs. 6 and 7 still enable the calculation of 1/V max, 1/ KmCG, and 1/ KmAdoMet; however,K ia cannot be derived.The most significant conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that the kinetic behavior of DNMT1 may be dramatically altered by both sequence of the DNA template and its pre-methylation status. Obviously, the scheme in Fig. 2 and its velocity equations are not adequate to describe the results with (CGG·Cm5CG)12 which implies that DNMT1 is capable of complex kinetics. Overall, this combination of linear plus non-linear responses indicates a steady-state mechanism, where the DNA can act simultaneously both as a substrate and as an activator for the reaction. The activation is proposed to occur through binding of a DNA molecule at a site distinct from the catalytic center, i.e. an allosteric, or regulatory, site. The precise sequence of the chemical steps that lead to such non-linear responses, however, is unknown. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the role of the DNA bound to the allosteric site is to increase the affinity of the DNA-DNMT1 complex for AdoMet since low levels of AdoMet are sufficient to maximally drive the reaction.It is noteworthy that the complex enzymatic behavior is associated with a DNA sequence, the (CGG·CCG) n triplet repeat, whose expansion in the chromosomal FRAX locus leads to aberrant methylation and to disease in humans.In summary, these studies indicate that the methylation reaction by DNMT1 may follow complex mechanisms, and both the sequence composition as well as the methylation status of the DNA substrate contribute to this complexity.Product Inhibition with AdoHcyProduct inhibition studies of bireactant enzymes provide a means to distinguish random from ordered sequential Bi Bi mechanisms. Ordered systems give competitive patterns with the first substrate that binds to the enzyme versus the last product that leaves the enzyme (the plots converge on they axis) and non-competitive patterns with the other combinations (the lines converge to the left of the y axis). On the contrary, random mechanisms give competitive inhibition between like substrates and products (with similar chemical structures) and non-competitive patterns between unlike reactants. In our case, determining whether the reaction is ordered or random would enable the assignment of the dissociation constant K ia to the DNA, to AdoMet, or to both in the case of a random system.In the first set of experiments (AdoHcy versus CG with fixed AdoMet) (unlike product and substrate), 2.5 to 25.0 μmAdoHcy were added to reactions where the concentration of CG with supercoiled pRW3602 was varied and AdoMet kept constant. In separate studies, the fixed concentration of AdoMet ranged from 2.0 to 40.0 μm. The pattern of inhibition was non-competitive from 2.0 to 10.0 μm AdoMet, rather uncompetitive at 15.0 and 20.0 μm AdoMet, and non-competitive again from 26.0 to 40.0 μm AdoMet (not shown).In double-reciprocal plots where AdoMet was the variable substrate, AdoHcy the changing-fixed inhibitor (like substrate and product), and CG the fixed co-substrate (4.0 to 25.0 μm), velocities increased, as expected, up to 20.0 μm AdoMet; however, higher concentrations caused strong inhibition by AdoHcy, a result that was not anticipated. In fact, the expectation was that AdoMet would progressively overcome the inhibition by AdoHcy, linearly increasing the reaction rates as its concentration rose. The slopes obtained from the 1/v versus 1/CG plots (which were linear) at various AdoHcy concentrations were graphed as a function of AdoMet. Increasing AdoMet up to 50 μm progressively reduced the slopes (higher velocities) to plateau levels in the absence of AdoHcy, as expected. AdoHcy increased all of the slopes as a result of inhibition, and increasing AdoMet progressively reduced such an inhibition. However, at concentrations of AdoMet >20 μm, there was a new, strong non-competitive inhibition by AdoHcy that was then reduced by higher levels of AdoMet. This pattern found at greater than 20.0 μm AdoMet is anomalous; the reason for this behavior is uncertain. When these unusual data at >20.0 μm AdoMet were excluded, the pattern of inhibition versus AdoHcy (like substrate and product) was competitive (Fig.8 A).Figure 8Product inhibition by AdoHcy. A, nm [3H]CH3incorporated in supercoiled pRW3602 (6.02 μm CG) at varying AdoMet concentrations and changing-fixed AdoHcy as the inhibitor; AdoHcy concentrations were 2.5 μm(filled circles), 5.0 μm (open circles), 10.0 μm (filled squares), 15.0 μm (open squares), 20.0 μm (filled triangles), and 25.0 μm (open triangles).

The slopes of these last regressions are shown as a function of AdoHcy concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether there was evidence for more than one binding site for AdoMet in DNMT1, a Dixon plot (49Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics; Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 505-845Google Scholar) was constructed. Slopes1/CG were replotted as a function of 1/AdoMet for AdoMet ≤20.0 μm, at each fixed value of AdoHcy. The replots were linear, and their slopes (SlopeCG/AdoMet) were finally graphed as a function of AdoHcy (Fig. 8 B). The result was a linear, rather than a parabolic, curve indicating that only one AdoMet-binding site per DNMT1 molecule was detected.

We previously described a rapid GH-induced disulfide linkage of GHRs in human IM-9 cells. In this study, three GH-induced phenomena (GHR dimerization, GHR disulfide linkage, and enhanced GHR-JAK2 association) were examined biochemically and immunologically. By using the GH antagonist, G120K, and an antibody recognizing a dimerization-sensitive GHR epitope, we demonstrated that GH-induced GHR disulfide linkage reflects GH-induced GHR dimerization. GH, not G120K, promoted both GHR disulfide linkage and enhanced association with JAK2. Measures that diminished GH-dependent JAK2 and GHR tyrosine phosphorylation diminished neither GH-induced GHR disulfide linkage nor GH-enhanced GHR-JAK2 association. By using both transient and stable expression systems, we determined that cysteine 241 (an unpaired extracellular cysteine) was critical for GH-induced GHR disulfide linkage; however, GH-induced GHR dimerization, GHR-JAK2 interaction, and GHR, JAK2, and STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation still proceeded when this cysteine residue was mutated.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of conserved structural features in its extracellular domain, GHR is considered a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, which includes receptors for prolactin, erythropoietin, and various interleukins and colony-stimulating factors, among others (5Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Many of these receptors also share common signaling features; most notably, they couple to members of the Janus family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (JAKs) to initiate their signal cascades in response to ligand binding (6Ihle J.N. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GHR couples in particular to JAK2 (7Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The interaction of GH with the cell surface GHR is complicated but is now understood structurally with a high degree of resolution. Crystallographic and kinetic studies employing recombinant GH and GHR extracellular domain have elegantly demonstrated that GH interacts with the GHR to form a complex of 1:2 GH·GHR stoichiometry (8Cunningham B.C.

Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Although GH is a molecule composed of four antiparallel helical bundles without an axis of symmetry, two distinct sites within each molecule of the hormone engage two GHR extracellular domains at nearly identical contact points on each receptor (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Binding of GH “site 1” to one GHR facilitates interaction of “site 2” with the second receptor (10Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The GH·GHR2 complex is further stabilized by interaction between receptor dimer partners in the region of the GHR extracellular domain immediately proximal to the external face of the plasma membrane (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). In addition, by using the human IM-9 lymphoblast that homologously expresses GHRs as a model system, we have detected a GH-dependent disulfide linkage of GHRs that is rapid and quantitatively significant (11Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological role(s) of the disulfide linkage is enigmatic, a large fraction of GHRs activated by GH (as evidenced by tyrosine phosphorylation) undergo this linkage, and receptors becoming detergent-insoluble in response to GH are progressively accounted for by disulfide-linked GHRs (12Goldsmith J.F. Lee S.J. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E932-E941PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the degree to which the extracellular interaction of the GHR with GH is known, the intracellular association of the receptor with its important signal transducer, JAK2, is only partly understood. Various lines of evidence indicate that physical interaction of the GHR and JAK2 is necessary for GH-induced JAK2 tyrosine kinase activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, the GHR, and numerous signaling molecules and biological effects (Refs. 2Frank S.J. O'Shea J.J. LeRoith D. Advances in Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology. 3. JA1 Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1999: 1-42Google Scholar and 3Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev.

Binding and functional assays demonstrate that within the GHR, the proline-rich Box 1 region (residues 279–286) is necessary and the amino-terminal one-third of the cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for nearly full interaction with JAK2 (13VanderKuur J.A.

Whereas this enhanced GHR-JAK2 association likely relates to GH-induced JAK2 signaling, the structural basis for this augmentation has yet to be intensively investigated. In this communication, we biochemically and immunologically examine in several GHR-expressing cell lines the relationships between GH-induced GHR dimerization, GHR disulfide linkage, and GHR-JAK2 interaction. In so doing, we characterize several new reagents and refine the use of our existing tools and techniques to develop approaches to further study these proximal aspects of GH signaling. Our results indicate that GH-induced GHR disulfide linkage is detectable for murine and rabbit (as well as human) GHRs and can be detected in both non-adherent (IM-9) and adherent (3T3-F442A, COS-7, and CHO fibroblast) cell lines. GHR disulfide linkage as well as the loss of immunoprecipitability of GHRs with a new anti-GHR extracellular domain monoclonal antibody are shown to be useful reflectors of GH-induced GHR dimerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GH-induced enhancement of coimmunoprecipitation of JAK2 with anti-GHR serum directed at the receptor cytoplasmic domain is related to receptor dimerization, rather than receptor or JAK2 activation. Finally, by identifying an unpaired extracellular domain cysteine (residue 241) as critical to GH-induced GHR disulfide linkage, we differentiate noncovalent from disulfide-linked GHR dimerization, allowing us to compare these processes as they apply to the GHR with findings for other cytokine and growth factor receptors.

The cDNA encoding rGHRd294–498, with internal in-frame deletion of residues 294–498, was the result of BsaB1 digestion and religation of the wild-type rGHR cDNA. The cDNA encoding rGHR C241S (changing the codon for residue 241 from cysteine to serine) was generated using the unique site elimination in vitromutagenesis strategy (25Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A.

Primer sequences are available upon request. Confirmation of the desired mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations in the cDNA constructs was accomplished by dideoxy DNA sequencing. Serum starvation of 3T3-F442A, IM-9, and transfected COS-7 and CHO cells was accomplished by substitution of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for serum in their respective culture media for 16–20 h prior to experiments. Unless otherwise noted, hGH was used at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml, and stimulations were performed at 37 °C. Details of the hGH treatment protocol have been described (12Goldsmith J.F. Lee S.J. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E932-E941PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kim S.-O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.-S. Frank S.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, for IM-9 cells, cells were stimulated in suspension at 10 million cells/ml in binding buffer (BB, consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dextrose). Stimulations were terminated, and cells were collected by centrifugation (800 ×g for 1 min at 4 °C) and aspiration of the BB. 3T3-F442A cells and transfected COS-7 cells were stimulated in confluent 150 × 20-mm dishes (Falcon) in BB. Stimulations were terminated by washing the cells once with PBS and then harvesting by scraping in ice-cold PBS in the absence or presence (PBS/vanadate) of 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, as indicated in figure legends. Pelleted cells were collected by brief centrifugation. For each cell type, pelleted cells were solubilized for 15 min at 4 °C in fusion lysis buffer (FLB) (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), as indicated. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the detergent extracts were either subjected to immunoprecipitation or were directly electrophoresed under nonreducing or reducing conditions, as indicated below. In the case of CHO-rGHR and CHO-rGHR C241S, harvested cells were in some experiments solubilized directly in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, as indicated, prior to electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation, the rabbit antisera described above were used at the following volumes per precipitation: anti-JAK2AL33, 3 μl; anti-GHRcyt-AL37, 3 μl. For immunoprecipitation of the GHR with the monoclonal anti-GHRext and anti-GHRcyt-mAb antibodies, 0.6 μg of purified antibody was used per precipitation. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (or, for anti-GHRext, protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) was used to adsorb immune complexes, and after extensive washing with lysis buffer, SDS sample buffer eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated. Resolution of proteins under reducing or nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer of proteins, and blocking of Hybond-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 2% bovine serum albumin were performed as described previously (12Goldsmith J.F. Lee S.J. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E932-E941PubMed Google Scholar,26Yi W. Kim S.-O. Jiang J. Park S.-H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with antibodies 4G10 (1:2500), anti-phospho-STAT5 (1:1000), anti-GHRcyt-AL37 (1:2000), anti-GHRcyt (1:2000), or anti-JAK2AL33(1:2000), with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000) and ECL detection reagents (all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stripping and reprobing of blots were accomplished according to manufacturer's suggestions. Densitometry of ECL immunoblots was performed using a solid state video camera (Sony −77, Sony Corp.) and a 28-mm MicroNikkor lens over a light box of variable intensity (Northern Light Precision 890, Imaging Research Inc., Toronto, Canada). Quantification was performed using a Macintosh II-based image analysis program (Image 1.49, developed by W. S. Rasband, Research Services Branch, NIMH, Bethesda). In graphically displaying the fractional GH-induced loss of anti-GHRext precipitation of GHRs (Fig.7 D, comparing WT rGHR and rGHR C241S), precipitability of GHRs for each condition was estimated by normalizing the densitometric signal for the GHR abundance in anti-GHRext precipitates (detected by anti-GHRcyt blotting) by the densitometric signal for GHR abundance in the unprecipitated detergent extract resolved under reducing conditions (also detected by anti-GHRcyt blotting). This ratio for unstimulated samples was considered equal to 100% for each receptor (WT and CS mutant) in each of two separate experiments, as indicated. Specific JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in COS-7 cells transiently expressing both GHR (WT rGHR or rGHR C241S) and JAK2 (Fig. 8 B, lower panel) was estimated for each condition by normalizing the densitometric signal for tyrosine phosphorylation (APT immunoblot) of immunoprecipitated JAK2 by the abundance of JAK2 (anti-JAK2AL33 immunoblot) in that precipitate. This ratio for unstimulated samples was considered equal to one for each receptor (WT and CS mutant). The fold increase in this ratio in response to GH is graphically displayed. Specific GHR tyrosine phosphorylation in the same COS-7 cell transfectants (Fig. 8 C, upper panel) was estimated in the same fashion, except that precipitations were performed with anti-GHRcyt-AL37, and anti-GHR immunoblotting of the precipitated GHRs was accomplished with anti-GHRcyt. Graphical assessment of coimmunoprecipitation of JAK2 with anti-GHRcyt-AL37 for each condition in the same COS-7 cell transfectants (Fig. 8 C, lower panel) was accomplished by normalizing the densitometrically determined abundance of JAK2 (anti-JAK2AL33 immunoblot) in anti-GHRcyt-AL37 precipitates by both the densitometrically determined abundance of GHR (anti-GHRcyt immunoblot) in the same precipitates and the total JAK2 abundance (anti-JAK2AL33 immunoblot of anti-JAK2AL33precipitates). This ratio for unstimulated samples was considered equal to one for each receptor (WT and CS mutant), and the fold increase in this ratio in response to GH is graphically displayed. Initial experiments focused on more detailed characterization of our recently described (20Kim S.-O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.-S. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2344-2354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mouse monoclonal antibody against the rabbit GHR extracellular domain, anti-GHRext. Although it is only minimally capable of immunoblotting (data not shown), anti-GHRext, as previously reported (22Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can specifically recognize the human (h) GHR by immunoprecipitation. We noticed during this early characterization, however, that GH treatment of cells rendered the GHR less immunoprecipitable by anti-GHRext (Fig.1). IM-9 lymphoblasts were treated with GH or vehicle for 10 min at 37 °C prior to detergent lysis. Extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GHRcyt-AL37(a rabbit polyclonal serum directed at the GHR cytoplasmic domain (18Jiang J. Liang L. Kim S.-O. Zhang Y. Mandler R. Frank S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)), nonimmune rabbit serum (a negative control), anti-GHRcyt-mAb (a mouse monoclonal antibody directed at the GHR cytoplasmic domain), or anti-GHRext. Eluates of these precipitates (upper panel) as well as nonprecipitated detergent extracts (middle panel) were resolved under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, and GHRs present in each sample were immunoblotted with anti-GHRcyt (an independently derived rabbit polyclonal serum directed at the receptor cytoplasmic domain (11Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Whereas GH treatment did not affect the abundance of GHRs detectable in either the extracts (middle panel, lanes 1–8) or the specific anti-GHRcyt-AL37 or anti-GHRcyt-mAb precipitates (upper panel, lanes 3–6), notably less GHR was detected in the anti-GHRext precipitate from GH-treated cells than in the precipitate from cells not exposed to GH (upper panel, lane 8 versus lane 7). In principle, this GH-induced loss of anti-GHRextprecipitability could be accounted for by any of three potential possibilities as follows: 1) GH induces a loss of GHRs from the detergent-soluble extract such that less receptors are available for immunoprecipitation; 2) GH binding directly interferes with the epitope(s) in the extracellular domain of the GHR that are recognized by anti-GHRext; 3) GH, by promoting dimerization of GHRs, promotes interference of the interaction of anti-GHRextwith dimerization-sensitive epitope(s) in the GHR extracellular domain and thus results in less immunoprecipitation of GHRs. In our previous studies, we have observed GH-induced loss of detergent-soluble GHRs and corresponding accumulation of detergent-insoluble GHRs in IM-9 cells (12Goldsmith J.F. Lee S.J. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E932-E941PubMed Google Scholar). However, the GH-induced loss of anti-GHRextimmunoprecipitability that we now observe is not likely to be explained by such a change in detergent solubility since the abundance of GHRs detectable in both unprecipitated detergent extracts and anti-GHRcyt-AL37 precipitates does not vary with the 10-min GH treatment at 37 °C. This is consistent with our previous finding that significant loss of detergent-soluble GHRs was difficult to observe when GH stimulation was for less than 30 min at 37 °C (12Goldsmith J.F. Lee S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2049299765,"Cellular iron storage and uptake are coordinately regulated post-transcriptionally by cytoplasmic factors, iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP-1 and IRP-2). When iron in the intracellular transit pool is scarce, IRPs bind to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the 5′-untranslated region of the ferritin mRNA and 3′-untranslated region of the transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA. Such binding inhibits translation of ferritin mRNA and stabilizes the mRNA for TfR, whereas the opposite scenario develops when iron in the transit pool is plentiful. However, we (Richardson, D. R., Neumannova, V., Nagy, E., and Ponka, P. (1995) Blood 86, 3211–3219) and others reported that the binding of IRPs to IREs can also be modulated by nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we showed that a short exposure of RAW 264.7 cells (a murine macrophage cell line) to the NO+ donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), caused a significant decrease in IRP-2 binding to the IREs followed by IRP-2 degradation and that these changes occurred without affecting IRP-1 binding. The SNP-mediated degradation of IRP-2 in RAW 264.7 cells could be prevented by MG-132 or lactacystin, known inhibitors of proteasome-dependent protein degradation. A SNP-mediated decrease in IRP-2 binding and levels was associated with a dramatic decrease in TfR mRNA levels and an increase in ferritin synthesis. Importantly, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevented the SNP-mediated decrease in TfR mRNA levels.

This toxicity of iron comes from its high reactivity with hydrogen peroxide that can lead to the production of hydroxyl radicals (via the Fenton reaction), which can damage membrane lipids and other cellular components (6McCord J.M. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, organisms have evolved mechanisms to sequester free iron, both in the circulation (viatransferrin, iron transport protein) and within the cells (via ferritin, iron storage protein).Physiologically, the majority of cells in the organism acquire iron from a well characterized plasma glycoprotein, transferrin (Tf).1 Iron uptake from Tf involves the binding of Tf to the Tf receptors (TfRs), internalization of Tf within an endocytic vesicle by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the release of iron from Tf by a decrease in endosomal pH. Following iron release from Tf within endosomes, iron passes through the endosomal membrane by ill understood mechanisms and then enters the poorly characterized intracellular labile pool. Intracellular iron that exceeds the requirement for the synthesis of functional heme and nonheme iron-containing proteins is stored within ferritin (4Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys.

The binding of IRPs to the IRE in the 5′-UTR of the ferritin mRNA represses the translation of ferritin, while an association of IRPs with IREs in the 3′-UTR of TfR mRNA stabilizes the transcript. On the other hand, the expansion of the labile iron pool inactivates IRP-1 and leads to degradation of IRP-2, resulting in an efficient translation of ferritin mRNA and rapid degradation of TfR mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Klausner R.D.

The IRP-1 form with an intact [4Fe-4S] cluster exists in iron-replete cells and has aconitase activity but lacks IRE binding activity. On the other hand, in iron-depleted cells, IRP-1 lacks the [4Fe-4S] clusters as well as aconitase activity and exhibits IRE binding activity (reviewed in Refs.3Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl.

IRP-2 shares 62% amino acid sequence identity with IRP-1 but differs in a unique way, having a 73-amino acid insertion in its N-terminal region. This region contains a cysteine-rich sequence that is responsible for targeting the protein for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway when cellular iron levels are high (21Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Guo B. Yu J.D. Phillips Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, IRP-2 cannot assemble an [Fe-S] cluster and lacks aconitase activity.Nitric oxide (NO) is an important endogenous regulator, many of whose functions are mediated via its binding to iron either in the heme of guanylate cyclase or in the [Fe-S] centers of important nonheme iron proteins (3Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 4Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys.

Iron interacts primarily with NO⋅ (free radical), while its oxidized form, NO+ (nitrosonium ion) causes S-nitrosylation of thiol groups of proteins (24Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 25Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NO is well known to modulate the activity of mitochondrial aconitase (reviewed in Refs. 3Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar and 23Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Methods Neurosci. 1997; 31: 329-345Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is, as discussed above, highly homologous to IRP-1. Previously, we showed that while NO⋅increases IRP-1 binding activity, TfR mRNA, and TfR number, NO+ decreased IRP-1 activity, TfR mRNA, and Tf binding in K562 cells (27Richardson D.R. Neumannova V. Nagy E. Ponka P. Blood. 1995; 86: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have concluded (27Richardson D.R. Neumannova V. Nagy E. Ponka P. Blood. 1995; 86: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that treatment of K562 cells with the NO+ donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) resulted inS-nitrosylation of critical thiol groups, which may prevent the binding of IRP-1 to the IREs, a condition known to promote TfR mRNA degradation. On the other hand, NO⋅ derived fromS-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) may directly react with the [Fe-S] cluster that may be followed by loss of the cluster, resulting in an increase in the binding of IRP-1 to IRE, a condition known to stabilize TfR mRNA.In this study, we used RAW 264.7 cells and confirmed that two different redox forms of nitrogen monoxide, NO⋅ and NO+, have very different and, in fact, opposite effects on IRP-1 RNA binding activity. Moreover, we found that IRP-2 may be a very important and rather unexpected target for NO+. We demonstrated that before any effect of NO+ on IRP-1 could be detected, IRP-2 binding activity and protein levels were dramatically decreased in RAW 264.7 cells exposed to the NO+ generator. Since NO+-mediated degradation of IRP-2 could be prevented by MG-132 or lactacystin, it appears that IRP-2 degradation occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, a decrease in IRP-2 binding/levels following a short exposure to the NO+ donor was associated with a dramatic decrease in TfR mRNA levels that occurred hours before any effect on IRP-1 binding was detected. This finding suggests that IRP-2 alone plays an important role in controlling TfR expression.DISCUSSIONIron is uniquely suited to carry out biochemical redox reactions without which life would be impossible, but if not appropriately shielded it may become very toxic because of its catalytic action in one-electron redox reactions (1Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 4Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 6McCord J.M. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, organisms were compelled to solve one of the many paradoxes of life, i.e. to keep “free iron” at the lowest possible level and yet in concentrations allowing adequate supply of the essential element for the synthesis of hemoproteins and other iron-containing molecules. The real chemical nature of iron in the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP) is ill understood, but it is known that iron in this metabolically and kinetically active pool can be intercepted by strong chelators. Moreover, organisms are equipped with remarkable regulatory mechanisms that coordinately regulate cellular iron uptake and storage and maintain iron in the LIP at appropriate levels. The level of iron in the LIP is “sensed” by IRPs, which are responsible for coordinate regulation of ferritin and TfR expression. When iron in the LIP is scarce, IRP binding to the IREs represses ferritin mRNA translation and increases TfR mRNA stability, and the opposite scenario develops when iron in the transit pool is plentiful (1Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 2Theil E.C. Biochem.

Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar).However, iron is not the only player that can modulate IRPs, and IRP activities/levels can be affected by various forms of “oxidative stress” and NO (3Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). IRP-1 is homologous to mitochondrial aconitase, an [Fe-S] protein whose activity is modulated by NO (3Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 23Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Methods Neurosci. 1997; 31: 329-345Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that NO⋅ can activate IRP-1 RNA binding activity (Refs. 27Richardson D.R. Neumannova V. Nagy E. Ponka P. Blood. 1995; 86: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Drapier J. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Pierre K. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, and 33Weiss G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter Hentze M.W.

A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in TfR mRNA levels. However, it is controversial whether NO⋅ can directly attack the [Fe-S] cluster of IRP-1, causing its activation or whether NO⋅ acts indirectly via chelating iron in the LIP. Hentze and Kühn (3Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) favor the latter explanation and have argued that the effect of NO⋅ on IRP-1 activation is delayed, being comparable to the effect of desferrioxamine, which also activates IRP-1 with slow kinetics. In this study, we demonstrated that NO⋅ can activate IRP-1 in RAW 264.7 cells within 1 h, and maximum activation is reached in 3 h (Fig. 2). Hence, our experiments suggest that NO⋅ activates RNA binding activity of IRP-1 by directly interacting with its [Fe-S] cluster, and this conclusion is also supported by recent findings of Kennedy et al. (39Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).IRP-2 (105 kDa) is larger than IRP-1 (90 kDa), and this difference in size is caused by a 73-amino acid insertion containing a cysteine-rich element in the N terminus of IRP-2 (17Rouault T.A. Tang T.C. Kaptain S. Burgess W.J. Haile D.J. Samiengo F. McBride D.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The three cysteine residues that coordinate the [Fe-S] cluster in IRP-1 are conserved in IRP-2 (20Guo B. Brown F.M. Yu J.D. Phillips Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16529-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). IRP-2 is degraded in iron-replete cells (18Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol.

Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the specific N-terminal amino acid insertion is necessary and sufficient to render IRP-2 susceptible to proteolytic degradation in proteasomes (21Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that a 1-h exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to the NO+ generator, SNP, resulted in a significant decrease in IRP-2 binding activity to the IRE, and this binding activity was totally absent at 3 h (Fig. 2, Aand B). We also demonstrated that IRP-2 protein levels decreased in SNP-treated RAW 264.7 cells, but this decrease occurred later than the inhibition of IRP-2 binding (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, the NO+-mediated degradation of IRP-2 is sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 6), indicating that ongoing protein synthesis is required for the inactivation of IRP-2. More importantly, the SNP-mediated deactivation (in terms of IRE binding) and degradation of IRP-2 in SNP-treated RAW 264.7 cells could be prevented by MG-132 or lactacystin (Fig. 6), known proteasome inhibitors (34Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar, 35Rock J.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D.

Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). It is of interest to mention that after SNP treatment the residual IRP-2 protein can be seen on Western blot analysis in the absence of any detectable IRP-2 RNA binding activity (Figs. 2, 4, and 6). It is possible that the ubiquitination of IRP-2 prevents its RNA binding before the protein is totally degraded.Since until now the only described mechanism of IRP-2 degradation has been the one involving iron, we considered the possibility that this metal may somehow be involved in IRP-2 degradation in SNP-treated RAW 264.7 cells. Because SNP is an iron complex, it might be possible that treatment of cells with SNP could lead to the donation of iron and result in IRP-2 degradation. However, ferricyanide (structurally very similar to SNP) did not decrease IRP-2 protein levels under conditions when SNP did (Fig. 4). Hence iron donation to the cell via SNP could not explain the observed decrease in IRP-2 levels. Moreover, the addition of the iron chelators, either EDTA or desferrioxamine, to SNP did not prevent the decrease in IRP-2 protein levels (Fig. 4), further suggesting that the effect of SNP was not due to iron donation to the cell. We have also scrutinized the possibility that SNP-derived NO+ could increase iron levels in the LIP but found several arguments against this explanation. First, at early time intervals, NO+ did not decrease IRP-1 activity (Fig. 2), as would have been expected if iron levels in the LIP increased. In this connection, it is important to stress that iron-mediated deactivation of IRP-1 and IRP-2 occurs with similar kinetics (40Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Second, we found that while NO⋅ donors can effectively mobilize 59Fe from59Fe-prelabeled cells, SNP (the NO+ donor) is unable to do so, 2S. Kim and P. Ponka, unpublished observations. suggesting that NO+ is unlikely to affect intracellular iron levels and/or cause iron redistribution within the cells.Our results together with the above considerations suggest that in SNP-treated cells critical SH groups of IRP-2 areS-nitrosylated and that this modification targets this protein for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It is well established that the 73-amino acid sequence unique to IRP-2 is responsible for iron-mediated proteolytic degradation of this protein. Although the mechanisms involved are not fully understood, it appears that iron-dependent oxidation converts IRP-2 into a substrate for ubiquitination (38Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and consequent targeting for proteasomal degradation. Importantly, when three out of five cysteines in the 73-amino acid “degradation domain” of IRP-2 are mutated, the degradation of this protein is completely blocked (21Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), indicating that these residues play a critical role in controlling IRP-2 degradation. Based on our investigation with the NO+ donor, SNP, we propose that S-nitrosylation of cysteines in the “degradation domain” of IRP-2 is a distinctive feature that predisposes this protein for ubiquitination and consequent proteasomal degradation. Stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells with IFN-γ and LPS, which induces endogenous NO production, causes a dramatic decrease in IRP-2 activity and levels as well as in TfR mRNA levels (Fig. 1), and these changes are similar to those occurring in NO+-treated RAW 264.7 cells. We surmise that in IFN-γ- and LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells S-nitrosylation of IRP-2 may occur via transnitrosylation from nitrosoglutathione, whose levels are known to increase in activated macrophages (41Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fuji S. Maeda H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been amply documented that macrophages stimulated to produce nitrogen oxides are capable of inducing S-nitrosylations of proteins (42Simon D.I. Mullins M.E. Jia L. Gaston B. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 43Gobert A.P. Semballa S. Daulouede S. Lesthelle S. Taxile M. Veyret B. Vincendeau P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4068-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating whether IRP-2 is ubiquitinated in RAW 264.7 cells treated with either NO+ donors or IFN-γ and LPS.In this study, we also observed that a decrease in IRP-2 binding and levels, following a relative short exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to SNP, was associated with a dramatic decrease in TfR mRNA levels (Figs. 2 and 5). Importantly, these changes occurred at the time when IRE binding activity of IRP-1 was not yet affected by SNP treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the decrease in TfR mRNA levels correlates with a selective decrease in IRP-2 binding and degradation, although IRP-1 remains available for binding to IREs. An earlier study provided evidence that TfR exhibited the normal pattern of iron-dependent regulation in a cell line containing exclusively IRP-2 (44Schalinske K.L. Blemings K.P. Steffen D.W. Chen O.S. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10681-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our experiments corroborate this finding and, in addition, indicate that in the absence of IRP-2, IRP-1 is unable to maintain normal TfR mRNA levels. Hence, IRP-2 alone plays a crucial role in controlling TfR mRNA levels. Nevertheless, IRP-1 is at least in part involved in the regulation of TfR, and evidence for this is provided by the experiment depicted in Figs. 2 and 5. These experiments show that the selective activation of IRP-1 in SNAP-treated cells is associated with an increase in TfR mRNA levels.There is no doubt that transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of TfR expression (45Ponka P. Lok C.N. Internat. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1111-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), but it is unlikely that transcriptional inhibition can explain TfR mRNA decrease in SNP-treated RAW 264.7 cells. First, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevented the SNP-mediated decrease in TfR mRNA (Fig. 7), strongly suggesting that the decrease is related to IRP-2 degradation. Second, we exploited mouse LtK cells transfected with human TfRs devoid of the 3′-UTR containing IREs (28Owen D. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that treatment of these cells with SNP decreased mouse TfR mRNA levels without affecting human TfR mRNA, providing additional evidence for the involvement of the IRE/IRP system in the effects of NO+. We also examined ferritin mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells treated without or with SNP. We found that SNP did not affect ferritin mRNA levels (not shown) under conditions when it stimulated ferritin synthesis (Fig. 1). These results suggest that SNP enhances ferritin synthesis post-transcriptionally.In conclusion, it is now well established that cellular iron uptake and storage are coordinately regulated through a feedback control mechanism mediated at the post-transcriptional level by IRP-1 and IRP-2. It seems reasonable to conclude that the primary function of IRPs involves “sensing” iron levels in the LIP and maintaining the size of this pool via controlling TfR and ferritin expressions. However, cellular iron homeostasis appears to be regulated not only by iron levelsper se but also by other factors that manifest themselves,e.g. during inflammation, a condition associated with increased NO production.

This result is specific for p21Cip1, since SET neither bound to p27Kip1 nor reversed its inhibitory effect on cyclin E-CDK2 or cyclin A-CDK2. Thus, SET appears to be a modulator of p21Cip1 inhibitory function. These results suggest that SET can regulate G1/S transition by modulating the activity of cyclin E-CDK2. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Cip1 has a dual role in the regulation of the cell cycle; it is an activator of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes and an inhibitor of cyclins E/A-CDK2 activity. By affinity chromatography with p21Cip1-Sepharose 4B columns, we purified a 39-kDa protein, which was identified by microsequence analysis as the oncoprotein SET. Complexes containing SET and p21Cip1 were detected in vivo by immunoprecipitation of Namalwa cell extracts using specific anti-p21Cip1 antibodies. We found that SET bound directly to p21Cip1 in vitro by the carboxyl-terminal region of p21Cip1.

Takahashi Y. Matsushime H. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 361-362PubMed Google Scholar). CDKs, composed of regulatory cyclin and catalytic CDK subunits, are activated in a periodic manner during the cell cycle. Thus, cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are activated at mid G1, cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are necessary for G1/S transition, cyclin A-CDK2 complexes are necessary for progression of DNA replication and cyclin B-CDK1 complexes are necessary for mitosis entry (4Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 5Graña X. Reddy P.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of CDKs is regulated by the synthesis and degradation of cyclins at specific stages of the cycle, phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues of the CDK subunit, and binding of inhibitors (CKIs) that associate with cyclin-CDK complexes (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar, 5Graña X. Reddy P.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). The INK4 proteins (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) bind specifically to CDK4 and to its homologue CDK6 (11Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 12Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.Y. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell.

The CIP/KIP proteins (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) bind to and inhibit the activity of a wide range of cyclin-CDK complexes (14Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P.

It is generally assumed that most of the biological activities of these CKIs depend on their ability to inhibit cyclin-CDKs. However, p21Cip1 also associates with and inhibits the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which could be important to block DNA synthesis following DNA damage (17Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The levels of p21Cip1 in quiescent cells are very low, but they are up-regulated in proliferating cells and also by antimitogenic stimuli (18Jaumot M. Estañol J.M. Casanovas O. Grana X. Agell N. Bachs O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Li C.-Y. Suardet L. Little J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4971-4974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). p21Cip1 is also induced in some cell types during senescence and terminal differentiation (20Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. el-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar). It is transcriptionally induced by the tumor suppressor protein p53 and plays an important role in cell cycle arrest induced by the activation of the G1 DNA damage checkpoint (21El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar, 22Deng C.

Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that in addition to their role as cyclin-CDK inhibitors, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 may also be activators of cyclin D-dependent kinases. p21Cip1 could promote the assembly of active cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes and provide a localization signal for their nuclear import (24LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack genes encoding p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 fail to assemble detectable amounts of cyclin D-CDK complexes, express cyclin D proteins at much lower levels, and are unable to efficiently direct cyclin D proteins to the cell nucleus (25Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Restoration of CKI function reverses all three defects and thereby restores cyclin D activity to normal physiological levels. The dual role of p21Cip1 during the cell cycle suggests that its activity as inhibitor or activator must be highly regulated during the cell cycle and that other, still unknown, proteins might be involved in the modulation of p21Cip1 activity. Thus, we are searching new p21Cip1-binding proteins by using affinity chromatography with p21Cip1-Sepharose 4B columns. We report here that the oncogenic protein SET binds directly to p21Cip1 and that it reverses the inhibitory effect of p21Cip1 on cyclin E-CDK2 activity but not on cyclin A-CDK2. Lymphoblastoid cell lines Molt-4 and Namalwa were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. They were grown at 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Flow Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin as described previously (26Estañol J.M. Agell N. Bachs O. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 55-61PubMed Google Scholar). The p21Cip1 cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from a human cDNA library, sequenced, and introduced into the pGEX-KG vector at NdeI–HindIII sites. SET cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Damuni (New York). SET cDNA was introduced into the pGEX-KG vector atNcoI–HindIII sites. p27Kip1 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Massagué (New York). p27Kip1cDNA was introduced into the pGEX-KG vector atNdeI–XhoI sites. To obtain recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-p21Cip1, and GST-SET proteins, the BL21 LysE strain of E. coli was transformed with the vectors pGEX-KG, pGEX-KG-p21Cip1, and pGEX-KG-SET. A single colony was grown to saturation and activated by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h. To purify these fusion proteins, bacteria expressing these proteins were resuspended in NENT buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The samples were then sonicated for 10 s three times, centrifuged for 10 min at 27,000 × g, and finally resuspended in NENT buffer with 0.5% Sarcosyl instead of Nonidet P-40. Supernatants were mixed and applied to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After three washes, the proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 120 mm NaCl. The p21Cip1-Sepharose 4B columns were prepared by coupling 5–7 mg of purified GST-p21Cip1 protein to 3 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Control columns of purified GST were also constructed in the same way. Molt-4 cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The extracts (10 mg) were then loaded on the GST-p21Cip1-Sepharose or GST-Sepharose columns, and after washing in 50 vol of buffer A the bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer but containing 1m KCl instead of 50 mm KCl. Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) as described in Ref. 27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for 2 h at 60 V. The membranes were preincubated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% defatted milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. The specific antigens were identified by using the following antibodies: anti-p21Cip1(C19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cyclin A (C-22; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CDK2 (06-505; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-PCNA (1170406; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and anti-SET (a generous gift of Dr. Copeland, National Cancer Institute) diluted in TBS containing 0.5% defatted milk powder and 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, the strips were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase- (1:10,000 dilution; Promega) or a horseradish peroxidase- (1:2,000 dilution; Bio-Rad) coupled secondary antibody for 45 min. After washing in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and in TBS, the reaction was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega). To obtain an amino acid sequence of the 39-kDa protein eluted from GST-p21Cip1 affinity column, the eluate was first separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The band corresponding to the 39-kDa protein was then sliced from the gel and digested with trypsin. After digestion, the peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography, and a peptide was sequenced with an automatic sequencer using protocols, reagents, chemicals, and materials from Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK). To detect whether the SET protein was associated with p21Cip1, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were performed. Namalwa cells (1 × 108 cells) were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates (3 mg) were incubated with 5 μg of a monoclonal anti-p21Cip1 antibody (WAF-1 OP64; Calbiochem) overnight at 4 °C. Protein immunocomplexes were then incubated with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation, and washed three times in IP buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. For kinase assays, IPs were performed as described in Ref. 28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1988: 421-471Google Scholar. Molt-4 cells (1 × 108) were lysed in IP buffer. Lysates (1–2 mg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin E (06-459; Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-cyclin A (06-138; Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated in kinase buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 3 mg of histone H1, and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples were then electrophoresed, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. In some kinase experiments, different amounts of GST-SET, GST-p21Cip1, GST-p27Kip1, or GST were added to the incubation media as indicated. To analyze the binding of SET to p21Cip1, 2.5 μm GST-SET or GST in kinase buffer was loaded into a GST-p21Cip1-Sepharose column. After washing in 50 volumes of the same buffer, the protein bound to the column was eluted with the same buffer containing 6 murea. The eluted protein was precipitated with 10% thrichloroacetic acid and then electrophoresed. The protein was visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. Pull-down experiments were performed using three peptides corresponding to different regions of the p21Cip1 molecule. The first peptide corresponded to the amino acids 17–30 (p2117–30), which contain the cyclin-binding domain of p21Cip1. The second peptide included the amino acids 28–49 (p2128–49), a region containing an α-helix domain located in the middle of the bridge between the cyclin- and the CDK-binding domains. The third peptide corresponding to a region of the PCNA-binding domain comprises amino acids 145–164 (p21145–164). Each of these peptides was covalently bound to a Sepharose 4B matrix. GST-SET or GST (2.5 μg) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) were applied to the three different columns. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged. The unbound fraction was collected, whereas the bound proteins were washed three times in buffer B and then solubilized with sample buffer for subsequent electrophoresis and Western blotting. To analyze the effect of SET protein on the binding of p21Cip1 to cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, Molt-4 cells were lysed in IP buffer and then immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin E antibodies as described above. The immunoprecipitated complexes were resuspended in kinase buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of GST-p21Cip1, GST-SET, or GST-p21Cip1 and GST-SET (400 nm each). The complexes were then washed three times in kinase buffer, electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE gels, and subsequently subjected to Western blotting using specific antibodies against p21Cip1 or SET. To identify new p21Cip1-binding proteins, we performed affinity chromatography analysis using GST-p21Cip1-Sepharose 4B columns. For these experiments, we selected the lymphoblastoid cell line Molt-4, because it did not express p21Cip1, and thus we avoid the association of the p21Cip1-binding proteins of the cell extract with the endogenous p21Cip1. The columns were loaded with Molt-4 cell lysates and subsequently washed with loading buffer. The proteins associated with GST-p21Cip1 were then eluted with 1m KCl and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The eluates contained three major proteins of 39, 70, and 80 kDa and several minor proteins of a variety of sizes (Fig.1 A). These proteins were specifically bound to p21Cip1 and not to GST, since control GST-Sepharose 4B columns did not retain them (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis revealed that the eluates contained PCNA, cyclin A, and CDK2, indicating that the GST-p21Cip1-Sepharose column worked properly, since it retained known p21Cip1-binding proteins (Fig. 1 B). To identify the 39-kDa p21Cip1-binding protein, we prepared high amounts of eluate, which were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The 39-kDa protein was sliced from the gels and then microsequenced. A sequence of nine amino acids was obtained from this protein. This sequence matched perfectly (100% identity) with the amino acids 78–86 of the SET protein (Fig.2). SET is a protein that has been found fused to the protein CAN in acute nonlymphocytic myeloid leukemias (29von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To study whether SET and p21Cip1 form complexes in vivo, Namalwa cell extracts were subjected to IP using an anti-p21Cip1antibody. Results showed that this antibody immunoprecipitated p21Cip1 but also the SET protein, indicating the presence of SET- p21Cip1 complexes in vivo (Fig.3 A). To analyze whether SET and p21Cip1 interact directly or through other proteins, we expressed both SET and p21Cip1as GST fusion proteins and performed binding analysis. GST-SET or GST was incubated in the presence of GST-p21Cip1-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then, after extensive washing, the protein associated with GST-p21Cip1 was eluted with 6 m urea. As shown in Fig. 3 B, GST-SET but not GST associated directly with p21Cip1. To determine which domain of p21Cip1was involved in SET interaction, pull-down experiments using three peptides corresponding to different regions of the p21Cip1molecule (p2117–30), (p2128–49) and (p21145–164) were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results indicate that SET bound to the p21145–164 peptide but not to the other two p21Cip1 peptides (Fig.4). The direct interaction of SET with p21Cip1 suggested that SET could modulate the function of p21Cip1. Since p21Cip1is a strong inhibitor of the activity of cyclin-CDK2 complexes, we analyzed whether SET can modulate the inhibitory effect of p21Cip1 on cyclin E-CDK2 or cyclin A-CDK2 activities. Thus, we immunoprecipitated Molt-4 cell extracts using specific anti-cyclin E or anti-cyclin A antibodies and measured CDK2 activity in the immunoprecipitates. In both cases, CDK2 activity was inhibited by the addition of 400 nm of recombinant GST-p21Cip1(Fig. 5). We also observed that SET had no effect on cyclin E- or cyclin A-associated CDK2 activities at concentrations of 400 or 800 nm. However, when SET was added together with p21Cip1 it reversed the inhibitory effect of p21Cip1 on cyclin E-CDK2 activity but not on cyclin A-CDK2 (Fig. 5). This effect was specific, since purified GST did not reverse the p21Cip1-induced CDK2 inhibition. We also analyzed the effect of SET on the inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 or cyclin A-CDK2 by p27Kip1. Thus, IPs obtained using anti-cyclin E or anti-cyclin A antibodies were assayed for CDK2 activity in the presence of p27Kip1 or p27Kip1plus SET. CDK2 activity was inhibited by the addition of 400 nm GST-p27Kip1, but the activity was not reversed by the addition of the same amount of SET (Fig.6). Thus, SET specifically modulates the inhibitory function of p21Cip1. We also analyzed whether SET associates with cyclin E-CDK2 complexes and if this binding depends on the presence of p21Cip1. Thus, we performed IP experiments on Molt-4 cell extracts using anti-cyclin E antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with p21Cip1 alone, SET alone, or with both p21Cip1 and SET. Results showed that p21Cip1 associated with cyclin E-CDK2 complexes either in the presence or in the absence of SET (Fig.7). These results indicate that proteins of these complexes other than p21Cip1 are able to bind SET. The CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 negatively regulates cell cycle progression and enforce a cell cycle arrest when overexpressed in the cells (15Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar, 30Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). These effects are due to the binding of p21Cip1 to cyclin-CDK complexes, which leads to the inhibition of CDK activity and to the association of p21Cip1 with PCNA, which blocks DNA synthesis (31Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are necessary for certain processes that positively regulate cell cycle progression: cyclin D assembly with CDK4, its stability, and its nuclear localization (24LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 25Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that calmodulin binds to p21Cip1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that it regulates its nuclear localization but also that of cyclin D1 and CDK4 (32Taulés M. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Rius E. Estanyol J.M. Casanovas O. Sacks D.B. Perez-Paya E. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The p21Cip1 functions are performed by different domains of the protein. The NH2-terminal domain contains two regions, which specifically bind to cyclins and CDKs. The carboxyl-terminal domain has a sequence that interacts with PCNA and calmodulin and contains an NLS region and possibly a second cyclin A-binding sequence (32Taulés M. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Rius E. Estanyol J.M. Casanovas O. Sacks D.B. Perez-Paya E. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2445-2448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Cai K. Dynlacht B.D.

Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that p21Cip1 has a dual role in the regulation of cell cycle progression as activators of CDK4 and as inhibitors of CDK2 activity. To perform these different functions, the activity of p21Cip1 must be highly regulated during the cell cycle. One possible mechanism of regulation may be through additional components associated with cyclin-CDK-CKI complexes. Consistent with this idea is the observation of high molecular weight cyclin-CDK-CKI complexes in different cellular types (36Parry D. Mahony D. Wills K. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although some of the proteins associated with these complexes are known, some others still remain unidentified (37Dai K. Kobayashi R. Beach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22030-22034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We report here that the oncoprotein SET associates with p21Cip1 in vivo and in vitro. Results also indicate that SET modulates the p21Cip1 inhibitory effect on cyclin E-CDK2 but not on cyclin A-CDK2 in vitro. SET was first identified as a gene that was fused to theCAN gene in a patient with acute undifferentiated leukemia, apparently as a result of a translocation (29von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The SET-CANfusion gene generates a transcript encoding a chimeric SET-CAN protein of 155 kDa. The SET protein shows similarity with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I and is widely expressed in human and mouse tissues (29von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A.

It is phosphorylated in serine residues in vivo and it is mainly located in the nucleus. Not much is known about the cellular role of SET, although several possible functions have been proposed. SET interacts specifically with B-type cyclins but not with cyclin A, although the functional significance of this interaction has not been elucidated (41Kellogg D.R. Kikuchi A. Fujii-Nakata T. Turck C.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, SET has been found to be identical to template-activating factor I, a host protein necessary for DNA replication of the adenovirus genome (42Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A long acidic domain in the C-terminal region of SET is essential for template-activating factor I activity (42Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). SET has been also identified as a potent inhibitor of the protein phosphatase PP2A (43Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Since PP2A has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression (44Yanagida M. Kinoshita N. Stone E.M. Yamano H. CIBA Found. Symp. 1992; 170: 130-140PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that theSET-CAN gene fusion, which occurs in acute nonlymphocytic myeloid leukemia, may lead to altered regulation of PP2A activity and thus contribute to leukemogenesis (43Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The known functions of SET clearly relate it with the control of cell cycle progression, although the steps regulated by SET remain unclear. Our results support the hypothesis that SET is a cell cycle regulator because of its ability to modulate p21Cip1 function, specifically on cyclin E-CDK2 activity. It is assumed that cyclin E-CDK2 activity is essential for the triggering of DNA replication (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that SET could be involved in the control of G1/S transition. Our results can be related with the reported effect of template-activating factor I (SET) on DNA replication in the adenovirus. The stimulatory effect of template-activating factor I on DNA synthesis could be due to the inactivation of p21Cip1 inhibitory function on cyclin E-CDK2 activity needed to trigger DNA synthesis. However, this possibility remains to be demonstrated. The mechanism by which SET regulates cyclin E-CDK2 activity has not been elucidated. We showed that SET did not block the binding of p21Cip1 to cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. Moreover, we observed that SET was able to bind to cyclin E-CDK2 complexes in the absence of p21Cip1. This binding did not produce any alteration of cyclin E-CDK2 activity; thus, the SET-induced reversion of the inhibition of CDK2 activity by p21Cip1 cannot be due to an increase in CDK2 activity induced by SET. The most likely explanation for the effect of SET is that its association with the cyclin E-CDK2-p21Cip1 complexes induces a conformational change in any of these proteins that overrides the inhibition of CDK2 activity by p21Cip1. We have not identified the protein of the complex that binds SET in the absence of p21Cip1, but work in that direction is under way in our laboratory. We found that the SET-binding domain of p21Cip1 is located at the carboxyl-terminal region. This fact is consistent with the evidence we report here showing that the binding of SET to p21Cip1 did not block the association of p21Cip1 with cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, since this association is mediated by p21Cip1 regions located at the NH2 terminus. Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal domain contains a region, which binds PCNA and calmodulin (32Taulés M. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Rius E. Estanyol J.M. Casanovas O. Sacks D.B. Perez-Paya E. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2445-2448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Thus, although we still do not know the functional significance of this finding it suggest that SET could also modulate the action of p21Cip1 on PCNA and the role of calmodulin on p21Cip1-cyclin D-CDK4 complexes. Although the functional relevance of the results reported here in the cell cycle progression in vivo are unknown, we can hypothesize that SET can regulate cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition. We can also speculate that the CAN-SET chimeric protein produced in acute nonlymphocytic myeloid leukemia may impair the normal regulation of p21Cip1 by wild type SET and that this process could also contribute to leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063650770,"The UNC-51 serine/threonine kinase of C. elegans plays an essential role in axonal elongation, and unc-51 mutants exhibit uncoordinated movements. We have previously identified mouse and human cDNAs encoding UNC-51-like kinase (ULK1). Here we report the identification and characterization of the second murine member of this kinase family, ULK2. Mouse ULK2 cDNA encodes a putative polypeptide of 1033 aa which has an overall 52% and 33% amino acid identity to ULK1 and UNC-51, respectively. ULKs and UNC-51 share a typical domain structure of an amino-terminal kinase domain, a central proline/serine rich (PS) domain, and a carboxy-terminal (C) domain. Northern blot analysis showed that ULK2 mRNA is widely expressed in adult tissues. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that ULK2 mRNA is ubiquitously localized in premature as well as mature neurons in developing nervous system. ULK2 gene was mapped to mouse chromosome 11B1.3 and rat chromosome 10q23 by FISH. HA-tagged ULK2 expressed in COS7 cells had an apparent molecular size of ∼150 kDa and was autophosphorylated in vitro. Truncation mutants suggested that the autophosphorylation occurs in the PS domain. Although expression of ULK2 failed to rescue unc-51 mutant of C. elegans, a series of ULK2/UNC-51 chimeric kinases revealed that function of the kinase and PS domains are conserved among species, while the C domain acts in a species-specific manner. These results suggest that ULK2 is involved in a previously uncharacterized signaling pathway in mammalian cells."

Human MT4-MMP (i.e. MMP-17) was recently cloned from a breast carcinoma cDNA library (11Puente X.S. Pendás A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar) using primers that were directed to the conserved propeptide region and catalytic Zn2+-binding site of MMPs (1Woessner Jr., J.F.

Velasco G. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of MT4-MMP contained regions homologous to all of the domains conserved in MMPs, but two invariant aspartic acid residues that ligate structural Ca2+ ions in related MMPs were replaced by Tyr-137 and Asn-141 in MT4-MMP (11Puente X.S.

Furthermore, MMP CDs designed without a propeptide domain obviate activation steps and simplify their use. In our continuing studies of MMPs, we set out to characterize the catalytic capabilities of MT4-MMP. We cloned the MT4-MMPCD DNA from a breast carcinoma cDNA library, purified the bacterially expressed protein, and defined its catalytic competence with synthetic peptide substrates and extracellular matrix components. Consistent with the expectation that MT4-MMP is a member of the Zn2+-dependent MMP family, we show that the MT4-MMPCD can activate progelatinase A; can cleave synthetic substrates and the ECM component gelatin; and is inhibited by metal ion chelators, reference MMP inhibitors, and TIMPs.

The 5′ extensions addNheI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined) plus nucleotides used for subcloning the cloned 540-bp product into pGEMEX-1. Primer 1 begins at Gln-42 of MT4-MMP and adds anN-terminal Ala-Ser. An initiator Met is added to theN-terminus upon subcloning to form pGEMEX-1/MT4-MMPCD. Val-216, encoded in primer 2, is the final amino acid residue of the MT4-MMPCD. Approximately 5 × 104 plaque-forming units of a human breast carcinoma cDNA library served as template in a PCR with primers 1 and 2 and Pfu DNA polymerase. Reactions (30 cycles: 94 °C for 0.5 min, 58 °C for 0.5 min, 72 °C for 1 min; followed by 72 °C for 10 min) were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Thermal Cycler. To verify the sequence determined for the MT4-MMPCD, primers 3 (5′-CACGGTGCGTGCACTCATGTACTACGC-3′, nucleotides 442–468) and 4 (5′-GTCACCCACCGGGCCCTGGTAGTACG-3′, nucleotides 780–805) were used to amplify by PCR an internal 340-bp fragment of the MT4-MMPCD from human brain, ovary, and leukocyte cDNA libraries. Total RNA was isolated from ∼106 cells of each of the MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines using the TRI-REAGENT kit. The fragment was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from these RNAs using primers 3 and 4 and the SuperScript reverse transcriptase-PCR kit. The 540-bp MT4-MMPCD DNA fragment obtained by PCR amplification from the breast carcinoma cDNA library was subcloned into the NheI/HindIII sites of pGEMEX-1 and the MT4-MMPCD sequence was determined by automated fluorescent labeling DNA sequencing. The 340-bp PCR products were sequenced directly using primers 3 and 4, since only confirmatory sequence information was desired from these internal fragments. The MT4-MMPCD was expressed at 37 °C in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells transformed with pGEMEX-1/MT4-MMPCD. Four hours after induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) (buffer A), and then lysed by suspension in buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg of DNase I, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin. The inclusion body pellet resulting from centrifugation of this mixture (10,000 × g, 10 min) was washed four times by suspension in buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA plus the protease inhibitors followed by centrifugation. After the washed inclusion body pellet was solubilized by vortexing in buffer A containing 8 m urea, this mixture was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant fluid was concentrated to ∼3 ml by ultrafiltration. This soluble protein fraction was applied to a column containing Superdex 75 resin equilibrated with buffer A plus 8 m urea. The protein content of eluted fractions was estimated using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The proteolytic activity was typically assessed in a fluorimetric kinetic assay (see below) by diluting an aliquot of each fraction 20-fold into buffer A containing 0.005% Brij 35, 50 mm CaCl2, 1–5 μm ZnCl2, and 30 μm FP2. Fractions containing the MT4-MMPCD were pooled, and the protein was stored at 4 °C. Protein samples taken throughout the purification procedure were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE using a 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide Tricine gel (Novex). Because MMPs bind Ca2+ and Zn2+, the effects of these ions on refolding and activity of the MT4-MMPCD were tested. In initial tests, the MT4-MMPCD in 8 m urea was refolded by directly diluting it 20-fold into an assay mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) plus 0.005% Brij 35 (buffer B), 30 μmFP2 and 2–100 mm CaCl2 plus 0–10 μm ZnCl2. Once optimal Zn2+ and Ca2+ levels were defined, the MT4-MMPCD was thereafter refolded in buffer B containing a 1:1 molar ratio of added Zn2+/enzyme and 50 mm Ca2+. The mixture was centrifuged (16,000 × g, 10 min) to remove insoluble protein, and the soluble, active MT4-MMPCD was used. MT4-MMPCD proteolytic activity was quantified at 25 °C by monitoring the cleavage of quenched fluorigenic peptides FP1 and FP2 with a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation, 320 nm; emission, 405 nm) and by monitoring the hydrolysis of the thiopeptolide (thioester) substrate, TPL. Cleavage of TPL coupled to reaction of the thiolate product with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was monitored at 405 nm using an absorbance microplate reader (18Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Baragi V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30Weingarten H. Martin R. Feder J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6730-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, assay mixtures contained buffer B and desired levels of substrate, ZnCl2, and CaCl2. Thek cat and K m values for MT4-MMPCD with TPL were estimated by measuring the steady state initial velocity of product formation at substrate concentrations spanning itsK m value. Initial velocities for reactions with FP1 and FP2 were corrected for the fluorescence quenching due to the inner filter effect of the substrate (31Liu Y. Kati W. Chen C.-M. Tripathi R. Molla A. Kohlbrener W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of k cat/K m for MT4-MMPCD-catalyzed complete hydrolysis of FP2 was studied at 25 °C using a three-component, constant ionic strength buffer system (32Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) consisting of 100 mm MES (pK a 6.2), 50 mm Tris (pK a 8.1), and 50 mmethanolamine (pK a 9.6) buffers containing 0.005% Brij 35 and 10 mm CaCl2. The FP2 concentration used (0.7 μm) was well below its K m of 26 μm. The time course for product formation was fit using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) to the single exponential Equation 1, Ft=F0+Fmax(1−e−kobst)Equation 1 where F t is the fluorescence at timet, F 0 is the initial fluorescence,F max is the total change in fluorescence, andk obs is the first order rate constant for enzyme-catalyzed substrate hydrolysis. The catalytic efficiency,k cat/K m, was calculated from the relationship k cat/K m =k obs/[E o], where [E o] is the concentration of MT4-MMPCD (100–400 nm) used (19Ye Q.-Z. Yu L.L. Johnson A.E. Hupe D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4702-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The observedk cat/K m data were fit to Equation 2 describing three proton ionizations (pK a values) and two limitingk cat/K m values as used previously with kinetic data for human stromelysin-1 (33Harrison R.K. Chang B. Niedzwiecki L. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). (kcat/Km)obs=(kcat/Km)210(pKa3-pH)+1+10(pH-pKa2)+10(2pH-pKa1-pKa2)+(kcat/Km)110(pKa3+pKa2-2pH)+10(pKa2-pH)+1+10(pH-pKa1)Equation 2 Reference MMP inhibitors were synthesized in the Parke-Davis Chemistry Department. Stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO. Assay mixtures contained buffer B plus 5 mm CaCl2, 1% (v/v) Me2SO as test compound vehicle and either FP2 or TPL plus 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). In addition to running vehicle controls, inhibitors were evaluated at various concentrations from 1 to 1000 μm (EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline), 1–200 nm (reference MMP inhibitors), or 0.003–500 nm(TIMPs). Refolded MT4-MMPCD (2−10 nm) was added to initiate reactions, and the initial rates of product formation were assessed at 25 °C. Rates without enzyme were negligible. The percentage of control activity was calculated using Equation 3. %control activity=(inhibited rate/control rate)×100Equation 3 IC50 values were calculated using a least-squares algorithm by fitting the percent of control activity versusinhibitor concentration data to Equation 4 for a sigmoid inhibition pattern as follows, %control activity=100/[1+([I]/IC50)slope],Equation 4 where [I] is the inhibitor concentration, IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor where the reaction rate is 50% inhibited relative to the control, and slope is the slope of the curve at its inflection point. Incubations (30 μl) were carried out at 25 °C for 16 h in 100 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.005% Brij 35 and 5 mm CaCl2. Gelatin was prepared by denaturing a 1 mg/ml solution of type I collagen for 20 min at 95 °C. Each reaction contained 5 μg of ECM protein test substrate (type I collagen, type IV collagen, gelatin, fibronectin, or laminin) and either 0 or 50 nm MT4-MMPCD. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis carried out under nonreducing conditions using Tris/glycine 8−16% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex). Conditioned cell culture medium from genetically modified human HT-1080 cells was used as described previously (17Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar) as a source of 72-kDa progelatinase A. Incubations were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C in mixtures that contained 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij 35, 150 mm NaCl, a 5-fold dilution of progelatinase A-containing conditioned culture medium, and 0 or 100 nmMT4-MMPCD or MT1-MMPCD. As a positive control, progelatinase A was activated by incubation with 1 mm APMA for 30 min at 37 °C. The activation of progelatinase A in the samples was assessed by zymography carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin (Novex). Using primers 1 and 2, we amplified a 540-bp MT4-MMPCD DNA fragment from a human breast carcinoma cDNA library (data not shown). The sequence of the MT4-MMPCD coding region was determined and found to be in disagreement with the published sequence (11Puente X.S. Pendás A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar) at five positions (Fig. 1 a), including three deletions in a G/C-rich region and two single nucleotide conflicts. As highlighted in Fig. 1 b, these differences would cause several changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. In particular, two invariant aspartic acid residues, Asp-137 and Asp-141, which ligate structural Ca2+ ions in related MMPs were restored in the MT4-MMPCD clone. Another residue that is conserved in MMPs, Gly-118, was Ala-118 in the previously reported sequence but was restored to glycine in the MT4-MMPCD clone. The resultant MT4-MMPCD contains only the catalytic domain (Gln-42 to Val-216, with Met-Ala-Ser- appended to the N-terminus) but not the C-terminal hemopexin-like or transmembrane regions present in the naturally expressed protein. To verify the MT4-MMPCD DNA sequence, we amplified from human brain, ovary, and leukocyte cDNA libraries and from three human breast cancer cell lines a 340-bp fragment of MT4-MMP encompassing the region of sequence disagreement. The DNA sequence of the fragment amplified from all of these sources agreed with the sequence we obtained for the analogous region of the 540-bp MT4-MMPCD clone. The MT4-MMPCD protein was expressed in E. coli and purified from the inclusion bodies. Cells were lysed with detergent, the washed inclusion body pellet was solubilized with 8 m urea, and the soluble protein was purified in one size exclusion chromatography run. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the pure MT4-MMPCD migrated as a single protein band (Fig. 2). About 70 mg of purified MT4-MMPCD protein were obtained from a 1-liter fermentation (30 g of cell paste). When MT4-MMPCD was rapidly refolded by dilution into assay mixtures containing Ca2+, Zn2+, and substrate, maximal enzymatic activity was observed at a ratio of approximately 1 Zn2+ ion added per enzyme. Higher levels of Zn2+ reduced the catalytic activity obtained. With a 4-fold molar excess of added Zn2+, the catalytic activity was only 60% of that obtained with 1 mol eq of added Zn2+, while at a 20-fold molar excess of Zn2+ only 10% of the maximal activity remained (data not shown). On the other hand, when the MT4-MMPCD was first refolded with optimal levels of Ca2+ (50 mm) and Zn2+ (1:1), the enzymatic activity of the soluble enzyme was not inhibited by up to a 450-fold molar excess of Zn2+ (data not shown). With regard to the effect of Ca2+ under rapid refolding conditions, MT4-MMPCD activity increased hyperbolically with increasing Ca2+concentrations. At the optimal 1:1 ratio of Zn2+added/enzyme, the activation K d for Ca2+was 10 ± 1 mm (data not shown). We also assessed the ability of various detergents to assist in the refolding of the MT4-MMPCD under optimal Zn2+ and Ca2+ conditions. When no detergent was used, no enzymatic activity was recovered. Low levels of Brij 35 and Tween 20 gave high activity, whereas β-octyl glucoside was less effective. The highest enzymatic activity was obtained with 0.005% Brij 35. Because the purified MT4-MMPCD is stored in the presence of 8m urea, we probed the effect of urea on the enzymatic activity of the refolded enzyme. Urea lowered the activity of the MT4-MMPCD in a linear manner such that in 1.64 m urea only 43% of the activity detected in 0.04 m urea remains (data not shown). Nevertheless, extrapolation of the data indicated that the catalytic activity of MT4-MMPCD in 0.04 m urea (i.e. the residual urea concentration in a typical activity assay) was 99% of that expected with no urea. Finally, in preparation for screening of the MT4-MMPCD with inhibitor test compounds, we evaluated the effect of the inhibitor vehicle, Me2SO, on enzyme activity. At up to 2% Me2SO, the activity was >90% of the control level, but it decreased linearly with increasing Me2SO such that in 5% Me2SO only 65% of the activity without Me2SO remained (data not shown). The cleavage of a number of synthetic substrates as catalyzed by the MT4-MMPCD was quantified at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. When hydrolysis of FP1 or FP2 is monitored, there is strong quenching of the product's fluorescent signal by substrate. The amount of quenching is proportional to the substrate concentration up to about 40 μm substrate (Ref. 31Liu Y. Kati W. Chen C.-M. Tripathi R. Molla A. Kohlbrener W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and data not shown). Our estimates of K m are derived from hyperbolic fits of quench-corrected initial velocities versus substrate concentration for rates measured at substrate concentrations up to 40 μm. Under our typical assay conditions,K m = 8 ± 1 μm for FP1 (data not shown), whereas K m = 26 ± 2 μmfor FP2 (Fig. 3). The thioester substrate, TPL, had a K m = 650 μm(data not shown). The MT4-MMPCD did not catalyze the cleavage of any of the following peptides (tested at 5, 20, and 50 μm): acetyl-LAQA-p-nitroanilide; [N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)]-LAQAVRSK-dimethoxycoumarin-CONH2; 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-LAQAVRSK-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-NH2; and 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoyl-LAQAVRSSSR-5-[(2-aminoethyl)-amino]-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2066651153,"It is important to understand how low grade tumors recur and progress to malignant lesions since this dramatically shortens patient survival. Here, we evaluated the concept that malignant progression and poor prognosis of low grade astrocytic tumors are TP53 dependent through clonal expansion of mutated cells. TP53 status was established in primary and recurrent tumors from 36 patients with WHO grade II astrocytic tumors and two tumor types were found. Tumors from 14 patients (39%; type 1) had TP53 mutated cells, and 92% of these recurred with 57% progressing to malignancy. The evolution of TP53 mutated cells before and after progression was examined using a clonal analysis procedure in yeast. Malignant progression was accompanied by an increased percentage of mutant TP53 (red) yeast colonies resulting from monoclonal expansion of cells with mutated TP53. The presence of TP53 mutations in WHO grade II astrocytic tumors was associated with malignant progression (P=0. 034, chi2 test) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS; 47.6+/-9. 6 months for TP53-mutated tumors vs 67.8+/-8.2 months for TP53-wild type tumors, P<0.05, log-rank test). Tumors from 22 patients (61%; type 2) were without TP53 mutations, and 64% of these recurred without a change in TP53 status, although 41% progressed to malignancy. This suggests that TP53 mutation is not an initiating or progression event in the majority of low grade astrocytic tumors. Our study also indicates that irradiation for WHO grade II astrocytic tumors might be associated with poor outcome (P<0.0001) and this was independent of TP53 status. These findings have important implications in the clinical management of patients with low grade astocytoma and provide new support to the clonal evolution model for tumor progression."

The binding of NF-κB p52 to DNA-DNA, DNA-PNA, PNA-DNA, and PNA-PNA hybrid molecules carrying the NF-κB binding sites of human immunodeficiency type 1 long terminal repeat was studied by (i) biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) using surface plasmon resonance technology, (ii) electrophoretic mobility shift, (iii) DNase I footprinting, and (iv) UV cross-linking assays.

AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Several reviews reporting the nucleotide sequences of transcription signals and the relative binding proteins have been published (5Faisst S. Meyer S.

Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 321-345Google Scholar). The requirement of protein-DNA interactions for the control of gene expression is clearly sustained by the finding that double-stranded DNA molecules could be used to alter gene transcription by the decoy approach (8Morishita R. Sugimoto T. Aoki M. Kida I. Tomita N. Moriguchi A. Maeda K. Sawa Y. Kaneda Y. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). For instance, in vitro transfection of cis-element decoys against NF-κB inhibits the expression of NF-κB-regulated genes (major histocompatibility complex genes, interleukin-2 receptor α, Igk, interleukin-6, δ-opioid receptor, preprogalanin, adhesion molecule-1) (8Morishita R.

Decoy molecules against other transcription factors (HNF-1, RFX1, NFYB, E2F) were found to alter specific functions in eukaryotic cells (13Clusel C. Ugarte E. Enjolras N. Vasseur M. Blumenfeld M.

Therefore, these inhibitors have been proposed as a novel tool for the therapy of a variety of well characterized disorders (13Clusel C. Ugarte E. Enjolras N. Vasseur M. Blumenfeld M.

Therefore, large amounts of DNA must be internalized by target cells in order to obtain biological responses leading to cytotoxic effects (20Uhlmann E. Peyman A. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 543-549Crossref Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). On the other hand, modified oligonucleotides (either methylphosphonate or phosphorothioate) have been used by virtue of their resistance to DNase cleavage, but these molecules are highly toxic (20Uhlmann E. Peyman A. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 543-549Crossref Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). A further problem of the decoy approach is the recently reported nonspecific activity of these molecules (9Khaled A.R. Butfiloski E.J. Sobel E.S. Schiffenbauer J. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1998; 86: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For instance, dumbbell oligonucleotides to RFX1, in addition to a block of activation of RFX1-regulated genes, cause additional nonspecific effects, most likely via an interaction with the general transcription machinery (14Lim C.S.

Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs)1have recently been proposed as alternative reagents in experiments aimed at the control of gene expression (21Egholm M. Buchardt O. Nielsen P.E. Berg R.H. J. Am. Chem.

Science. 1992; 258: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In PNAs, the pseudopeptide backbone is composed ofN-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units (21Egholm M. Buchardt O. Nielsen P.E. Berg R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1895-1897Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). PNAs hybridize with high affinity to complementary sequences of single-stranded RNA and DNA, forming Watson-Crick double helices (22Egholm M. Buchardt O. Christiensen L. Behrens C. Freier S.M. Driver D.A. Berg R.H. Kim S.K. Norden B. Nielsen P.E. Nature. 1993; 365: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). In addition, PNAs form highly stable (PNA)2-RNA triplexes with RNA targets (23Betts L. Josey J.A. Veal J.M. Jordan S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 1838-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, antisense and antigene PNAs have been synthesized and characterized (24Larsen H.J. Nielsen P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For instance, PNA-RNA duplexes and (PNA)2-RNA triplexes are powerful inhibitors of translation when they are designed to hybridize to targets overlapping AUG start sites (25Hanvey J.C. Peffer N.J. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Cadilla R. Josey J.A. Ricca D.J. Hassman C.E. Bonham M.A. Au K.G. Carter S.G. Bruckenstem D.A. Boyd V.L. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PNA-mediated inhibition of gene transcription is caused by a process that involves strand invasion of DNA with the generation of PNA-DNA-PNA triplexes (26Peffer N.J. Hanvey J.C. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Hassman F. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10648-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). With respect to the functional effects of the substitution of the phosphate backbone of DNA with the pseudopeptide backbone of PNAs, it should be emphasized that PNA-RNA hybrids are not a suitable substrate for RNase H (27Knudsen H. Nielsen P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); in addition, PNA-PNA duplexes were found to be completely unable to interact with minor groove binding drugs, including 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and distamycin A (28Wittung P. Kim S.K. Buchardt O. Nielsen P. Norden B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5371-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PNA-DNA chimeras lacking the phosphate backbone were recently found to be suitable primers for polymerase reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerases (29Misra H.S. Pandey P.K. Modak M.J. Vinayak R. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and distamycin A were found to bind PNA-DNA duplexes by a sequence-selective interaction with the minor groove (28Wittung P. Kim S.K. Buchardt O. Nielsen P. Norden B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5371-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To date, no information is available on the possible use of PNAs as decoy molecules able to interact with DNA-binding proteins, including transcription factors (30Good L. Nielsen P.E. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this case, the biological effects of PNAs could be a significant reduction or even a block of the interactions of transcription factors with target promoter sequences. It is worth noting that PNAs should be designed to minimize difficulties in solubility (for instance, PNAs extremely rich in GC should be avoided) (31Hyrup B. Nielsen P.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar); in addition, palindromic DNA sequences (for instance, the symmetric GGGGATTCCCCT NF-κB binding site of human p-selectin, human interleukin-2 receptor α, mouse H2K, mouse major histocompatibility complex EA promoter regions) are probably not the first choice, due to the facility of single-stranded PNAs to self-hybridization or interstrand hybridization, possibly generating complexes exhibiting high stabilities (32Jensen K.K. Orum H. Nielsen P.E. Norden B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5072-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we decided to perform experiments using the nonsymmetric NF-κB binding site of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV-1). In this respect, we emphasize that the decoy approach could be of interest in the experimental therapy of AIDS, since it has been demonstrated that transcription of HIV-1 depends on interactions between cellular transcription factors (including NF-κB) and cis-acting elements present within the HIV-1 LTR (4Gaynor G. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 33Roulston A. Lin R. Beauparlant P. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 481-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The main issue of the present paper was to study the binding of the transcription factor NF-κB p52 to DNA-DNA, DNA-PNA, PNA-DNA, or PNA-PNA molecules mimicking the NF-κB binding sites present in the HIV-1 LTR. The binding of NF-κB p52 to these target molecules was studied by biospecific interaction analyses (BIA) using surface plasmon resonance and the BIAcore biosensor (35Malmqvist M. Nature. 1993; 361: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 36Nilsson P. Persson B. Uhlén M. Nygren P.-A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Vadgama P. Crump P.W. Analyst. 1992; 117: 1657-1670Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Wood S.J. Microchem. J. 1993; 47: 330-337Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and further characterized by UV cross-linking experiments (39Sagami I. Tsai S.Y. Wang H. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The effects of PNA-PNA and PNA-DNA hybrids on the molecular interactions between nuclear factors and oligonucleotides containing the NF-κB binding sites were studied also by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competitive DNase I footprinting (40Gambari R. Nastruzzi C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 559-610Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Feriotto G. Mischiati C. Gambari R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The results from these molecular analyses could have both theoretical and practical implications. For the theoretical point of view, the use of putative NF-κB target molecules lacking a DNA backbone could help in understanding the role played by the DNA backbone in influencing either affinity of NF-κB for DNA and/or stability of NF-κB·DNA complexes. From the practical point of view, if PNA-DNA and/or PNA-PNA molecules are stably recognized by NF-κB, PNAs could be proposed as potential agents for the decoy approach in gene therapy, due to their resistance to both DNases and proteinases. The synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). The PNAs were synthesized by ISOGEN Biosciences (Maarssen, The Netherlands). Comparison of the binding kinetics of human NF-κB p52 transcription factor with DNA-DNA, DNA-PNA, PNA-DNA, and PNA-PNA target molecules was performed by surface plasmon resonance analysis on BIAcore-1000TM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (35Malmqvist M. Nature. 1993; 361: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 36Nilsson P. Persson B. Uhlén M. Nygren P.-A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Vadgama P. Crump P.W. Analyst. 1992; 117: 1657-1670Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Wood S.J. Microchem. J. 1993; 47: 330-337Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sensor chip SA5 (research grade; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precoated with streptavidin was used. All procedures were performed at 25 °C and at a 5 μl/min flow rate (42Gambari R. Bianchi N. Rutigliano C. Borsetti E. Tomassetti M. Feriotto G. Zorzato F. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 11: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bianchi N. Rutigliano C. Passadore M. Tomassetti M. Pippo L. Mischiati C. Feriotto G. Gambari R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The production of SA5 sensor chips containing NF-κB target double-stranded DNA-DNA (42Gambari R. Bianchi N. Rutigliano C. Borsetti E. Tomassetti M. Feriotto G. Zorzato F. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 11: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar), DNA-PNA, and PNA-PNA molecules was achieved by (a) a 30-μl pulse (500 ng) injection of biotinylated NF-κB oligomer (5′-TGGGGACTTTCCAG-3′), either biot(NF-κB)DNA or biot(NF-κB)PNA, to two different flow cells of the sensor chip, followed by (b) a 30-μl injection (500 ng) of the complementary NF-κB oligomer (5′-CTGGAAAGTCCCCA-3′), either c(NF-κB)DNA or c(NF-κB)PNA, as required (Fig. 1 shows the location of NF-κB binding sites within the HIV-1 LTR). Generation of double-stranded NF-κB molecules was performed in HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P2) in order to minimize triple-helix formation (43Bianchi N. Rutigliano C. Passadore M. Tomassetti M. Pippo L. Mischiati C. Feriotto G. Gambari R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that BIA technology allows highly reproducible hybridization between complementary DNA and PNA molecules and SA5 sensor chips carrying single stranded biot(NF-κB)DNA or biot(NF-κB)PNA molecules. In our experiments, we produced sensor chips carrying high (600–900 resonance units (RU)) or low (100–200 RU) amounts of biot(NF-κB)DNA or biot(NF-κB)PNA. Fig. 2 Areports a representative example of the increase of RU bound to biot(NF-κB)DNA sensor chips following injection of complementary DNA. Injection of complementary DNA to sensor chips carrying high amounts of biot(NF-κB)DNA generated an increase of 492.7 ± 46.9 RU in 14 different experiments. Injection of complementary PNA to the same biot(NF-κB)DNA sensor chips generated an increase of 621.6 ± 50.4 RU in six different experiments. Injection of complementary DNA to sensor chips carrying high amounts of biot-NF-κB PNA generated an increase of 468.5 ± 87.5 RU in four different experiments. Finally, injection of complementary PNA to the same biot-NF-κB PNA sensor chips generated an increase of 890 ± 125.9 RU in five different experiments. Regeneration of the sensor chips is obtained after a pulse with 5–10 μl of 50 mm NaOH without significant decrease in the capacity to bind either complementary PNA or complementary DNA. It should be pointed out that the obtained amounts of bound c(NF-κB)DNA correspond to about 105 fmol/mm2 of target DNA. Despite the fact that this amount of target NF-κB DNA elements is similar to those used in a number of recent reports by research groups studying transcription factor/DNA interactions using BIAcore (44Bondeson K. Frostell-Karlsson A. Fagerstam L. Magnusson G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 45Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 46Galio L. Briquet S. Cot S. Guillet J-G. Vaquero C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 47Galio L. Pereira S.D. Vaquero C. BIA J. 1996; 3: 31Google Scholar), we first determined whether these experimental conditions allow efficient binding of NF-κB p52. The binding of human NF-κB p52 transcription factor to double-stranded NF-κB DNA target molecules was monitored after a 30-μl injection of purified NF-κB (human p49; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) to SA5 sensor chips carrying high and low amounts of target DNA-DNA, DNA-PNA, PNA-DNA, and PNA-PNA hybrid molecules. Injection was performed in binding buffer (buffer TF: 50 mm KCl, 20 mmTris pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100) and subsequent washing in the same buffer. Promega NF-κB p49 is expressed in bacteria from a full-length cDNA encoding 447 amino acids (48Schmid R.M. Perkins D.N. Duckett C.S. Andrews P.C. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The concentration of NF-κB p49 in the used stock solution was 300 ng/μl (3.4 gel shift units/μl). All buffers were filtered and degassed before the use. Sensorgrams analysis was performed by the BIA-evaluation software version 2.1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Suitable blank control injections with running and/or binding buffers, including control injections of p49 to blank sensor chips were performed, and, when appropriate, the resulting sensorgrams were subtracted from the experimental sensorgrams. The comparison of binding and dissociation curves in the sensorgram allows the determination of the stability of DNA-protein complexes (36Nilsson P. Persson B. Uhlén M. Nygren P.-A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (41Feriotto G. Mischiati C. Gambari R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was performed by using the double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides mimicking the NF-κB (the nucleotide sequences are given under “BIA Technology” and in Fig. 1) or the Sp1 (the plus strand sequence was 5′-GAGGCGTGGC-3′) binding sites. The synthetic oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas, Milan, Italy). Binding reactions were set up as described elsewhere (41Feriotto G. Mischiati C. Gambari R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 25 μl containing buffer TF plus 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 ng of human NF-κB p52 protein, or 10 ng of human purified Sp1 protein (Promega) and 0.25 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. When 2 μg of crude nuclear extracts isolated from human lymphoid Raji and Jurkat cells were used instead of purified NF-κB or Sp1 factors, the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of 1 μg of the nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (41Feriotto G. Mischiati C. Gambari R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After 5 min of binding at room temperature, the samples were electrophoresed at constant voltage (200 V) under low ionic strength conditions (0.25× TBE buffer: 22 mm Tris borate, 0.4 mm EDTA) on 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and subjected to standard autoradiographic procedures (49Feriotto G. Ciucci A. Mischiati C. Animati F. Lombardi P. Giacomini P. Arcamone F. Gambari R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In competition experiments, the competitor molecules (DNA-DNA, DNA-PNA, PNA-DNA, and PNA-PNA) were preincubated for 20 min with purified NF-κB p52 protein, purified Sp1 factor, or nuclear extracts, before the addition of labeled target DNA. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al.(50Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of competitor target DNAs used as control were 5′-TAATATGTAAAAACATT-3′ (sense strand, NFIL2A), 5′-AGCATGAGTCAGACAC-3′ (sense strand, AP1), and 5′-GAACATGTCCCAACATGTTG-3′ (sense strand, p53). UV cross-linking (39Sagami I. Tsai S.Y. Wang H. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was performed by using 32P-labeled DNA-DNA or DNA-PNA molecules containing the NF-κB binding site. In this case, the synthetic oligonucleotides of the hybrid molecules were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas, Italy). Binding conditions were similar to those described above for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Briefly, 10 ng of human NF-κB p52 protein were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 100 ng of DNA-DNA or DNA-PNA molecules for 20 min at room temperature in a total volume of 25 μl containing buffer TF plus 5% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and, after this time, 2 ng of labeled probe (about 200,000 cpm) were added. After a further 5 min of binding at room temperature, the mixture was irradiated for 30 min using a UV transilluminator (254 nm; 7000 milliwatts/cm2) at a distance of 2 cm from the UV light source. The UV cross-linking reaction was blocked by the addition of 5 μl of 6× Laemmli gel loading buffer and electrophoresed at constant voltage (200 V) on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel (10% running gel, 4% stacking gel) (39Sagami I. Tsai S.Y. Wang H. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One lane was for the prestained protein molecular weight marker (broad range, 6–175 kDa, New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed and dried under vacuum, and the proteins directly involved in the DNA interaction were identified by autoradiography. 150 ng of the reverse HIV-1-R primer (5′-GGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCT-3′) were 5′-end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, purified by Sephadex G50 chromatography, precipitated, resuspended, and used together with the HIV-1-F primer (5′-ATTTCATCACATGGCCCGAG-3′) to amplify a polymerase chain reaction fragment of 259 base pairs mimicking the region of the HIV-1 LTR depicted in Fig. 1. The32P-labeled polymerase chain reaction fragment was resuspended to have 100,000 cpm/footprinting reaction. Before incubation with the 32P-labeled HIV-1 LTR polymerase chain reaction fragment, 1 footprinting unit of purified p52 NF-κB (Promega) was incubated in 50 μl of buffer TF plus 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, for 20 min in the absence or in the presence of 200 ng of cold NF-κB DNA-DNA, DNA-PNA, or PNA-PNA molecules. After this step, the binding reactions were carried out for an additional 5 min in the presence of 5′-end-labeled DNA. Fifty μl of 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2 were added 1 min before the addition of DNase I (Promega) diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, to working concentrations immediately before use. After a 2-min reaction with DNase I, the footprinting reactions were blocked at room temperature by adding 95 μl of 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA. Reactions were phenol-extracted and precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The pellets were washed in 70% ethanol, air-dried, resuspended in 5 μl of loading dye (96% formamide, 6 mg/ml bromphenol blue), denatured for 2 min at 90 °C, ice-cooled for 1 min, and layered onto a 6% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 19:1), 7 m urea sequencing gel. Control footprinting experiments were performed in the absence of NF-κB p52 factor. Molecular weight markers were obtained by G + A sequencing reactions of the footprinting probes (49Feriotto G. Ciucci A. Mischiati C. Animati F. Lombardi P. Giacomini P. Arcamone F. Gambari R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence corresponding to a single asymmetric NF-κB binding site of the HIV-1 LTR (14 base pairs) was chosen in order to maximize solubility of synthesized PNAs. In addition, unlike symmetric NF-κB binding sites, possible problems related to self-hybridization and/or interstrand hybridization are expected to be minimal in the case of asymmetric NF-κB binding site. For these reasons, the experiments were performed with two oligonucleotides and two PNAs carrying the HIV-1 LTR asymmetric NF-κB binding site in both sense and antisense orientations (see Fig. 1). In addition to unmodified molecules, the sense strand PNA and the corresponding oligonucleotide were biotinylated, in order to prepare SA5 sensor chips suitable for generation of target DNA-DNA, DNA-PNA, PNA-DNA, and PNA-PNA molecules for BIA studies employing surface plasmon resonance and biosensor technologies. A typical sensorgram of NF-κB p52 binding to a DNA-DNA target hybrid is depicted in Fig.2 B. Injection of 200 ng of purified p52 protein determined a sharp and easily detectable increase of resonance units (Fig. 2 B, b), due (i) to a bulk contribution (374 RU) caused by the protein itself and the solution in which it was stored (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and (ii) to its binding to immobilized double-stranded DNA. From the sensorgram depicted in Fig. 2 B (step c) it could be concluded that p52·DNA-DNA complexes are stable. These data are in agreement with observations by Galio et al. (47Galio L. Pereira S.D. Vaquero C. BIA J. 1996; 3: 31Google Scholar) demonst"

Myotendinous junctions show adaptations to modified muscle loading which suggest that these are transcriptionally distinct domains in muscle fibers that may experience local regulation of expression of structural proteins that are concentrated at these sites. Vinculin and talin are cytoskeletal proteins that are highly enriched at myotendinous junctions that we hypothesize to be subject to local transcriptional regulation. Our findings show that mechanical stimulation of muscle cells in vivo and in vitro causes an increase in the expression of vinculin and talin that is mediated by nitric oxide. Furthermore, nitric oxide-stimulated increases in vinculin and talin expression occur through a protein kinase G-dependent pathway and therefore differ from other mechanisms through which nitric oxide has been shown previously to modulate transcription. Analysis of vinculin mRNA distribution in mechanically stimulated muscle fibers shows that the mRNA is highly concentrated at myotendinous junctions, which supports the hypothesis that myotendinous junctions are distinct domains in which the expression of cytoskeletal proteins is modulated by mechanical stimuli through a nitric oxide and protein kinase G-dependent pathway.

The best understood mechanisms through which environmental signals produce changes in gene expression occur in systems in which the stimulus produces a change in the chemical environment surrounding the cell, for example through signaling information mediated by hormones, growth factors, or cytokines (e.g. Refs. 1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar and 2Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, cells also respond to changes in their mechanical environment (3Watson P.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2013-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), so systems must exist for the transduction of mechanical information to chemical signals in the cell that in turn regulate the expression of specific genes. Skeletal muscle cells, perhaps more than any other cell type, are profoundly responsive to their mechanical environment. For example, removal of normal mechanical stimuli from muscle cells in vivo can result in rapid changes in gene expression, enzyme activity, and protein synthesis and stability (4Templeton G.H. Padalino M. Manton J. Glasberg M. Silver C.J. Lilver P. DeMartino G. Leconey T. Klug G. Hagler H. Sutko J.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1984; 56: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Fitts R.H.

Science. 1979; 203: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J.

Although little is known of the mechanisms of mechanical signal transduction in muscle, previous investigations have provided evidence that soluble factors released by muscle cells experiencing loads in vitro may contribute to signaling an increase in protein synthesis (12Vandenburgh H.H. Shansky J. Karlisch P. Solerssi R.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, stretch-activated ion channels (14Sachs F. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 12-16PubMed Google Scholar) could provide increases in the concentration of specific cytosolic ions that are capable of activating signaling pathways that can influence gene expression. However, the extent to which these systems of mechanical signal transduction may contribute to modifying the expression of specific proteins in muscle is unknown. Myotendinous junctions (MTJs),1 which are highly specialized sites of force transmission across the muscle cell membrane (15Tidball J.G. J. Biomech. 1991; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), are responsive to changes in their mechanical environment (16Tidball J.G. Quan D.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 73: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Increased mechanical stimulation in vivo or in vitro causes an increased expression of structural proteins that are concentrated at these sites (13Frenette J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C818-C825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased concentration at MTJs of the mRNA encoding proteins whose expression is increased at MTJs suggests that muscle cell nuclei near the MTJ preferentially transcribe those mRNAs. The local regulation of mRNA and protein synthesis at MTJs that are experiencing modified loading suggests that mechanical signal transduction that regulates the expression of these molecules occurs at MTJs. Recently, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) was shown to be concentrated at MTJs (17Chang W.J. Iannaccone S.T. Lau K.S. Masters B.S.S. McCabe T.J. McMillan K. Padre R.C. Spencer M.J. Tidball J.G.

Commun. 1998; 242: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it is feasible, but untested, that increased [NO] that is generated during increased muscle loading could affect the expression of structural proteins. Furthermore, nitric oxide that is generated during increased muscle use has a short half-life (26Lowenstein C.J. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 124: 227-237Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar), so its effects in muscle would be local and consistent with the expectation that gene expression in nuclei located near the MTJ would be most affected. In this investigation, we test the hypothesis that NOS is a mechanical signal transducer in muscle that positively regulates the expression of structural proteins enriched at MTJs. We assay the effects of mechanical stimulation that are mediated by the NOS signaling pathway on the expression of talin and vinculin, which are cytoskeletal proteins that are highly enriched at MTJs and are links in a chain of proteins that couple thin filaments to integrin. Talin was selected for study because its expression is up-regulated by mechanical stimulation of muscle (13Frenette J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C818-C825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vinculin was selected because previous investigations have shown that it plays an important role in mechanical coupling in transmembrane assemblies of structural proteins (27Ezzell R.M. Goldmann W.H. Wang N. Parasharama N. Ingber D. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). C2C12 muscle cells were subjected to cyclic strains using a mechanical cell stimulator (Cell Kinetics, Providence, RI), which consists of a stainless steel plate containing wells in which the floor is a silastic membrane. Culture conditions were identical to those used previously (20Tidball J.G. Lavergne E. Lau K.S. Spencer M.J. Stull J.T. Wehling M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C260-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myotubes were cyclically strained using a 6.7% mean deformation of the membrane and adherent cells. Five cycles of strain during a 20-s period followed by 10 s of no strain were applied to the cells, and then the strain cycle was repeated two more times, followed by a 30-min period of no strain. Mean strain rate was 3.4%·s−1. The sequence was repeated 47 times, over the course of 24 h. Cultures were then inspected with an inverted microscope to confirm that the myotubes remained attached to the substratum. Control cultures were grown under identical conditions, but they were not subjected to loading. NO concentration in vitro was modulated by the addition of NO donor or NOS inhibitors to cultures. In addition, potential NO-mediated events in target cells were blocked downstream of NO stimulation by inhibition of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) with KT5823. Cultures in which NOS activity was inhibited received 100 μm N w-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) in 10% FBS in DMEM containing no phenol red immediately prior to the beginning of experimental loading protocols. Cultures not subjected to experimental inhibition of NOS activity were subjected to a media exchange at the same time as cultures receivingl-NAME. Cultures that were stimulated with exogenous NO donor received 100 μm S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 2 h prior to collection for analysis. PKG was inhibited in cultured myotubes by incubation in 2 μm KT5823 for 2 h before analysis. Cells treated with both SNAP and KT5823 were incubated for 30 min with KT5823 only, followed by 2 h in SNAP and KT5823. NO concentration in culture media at the end of the experimental treatments was measured using previously described procedures (20Tidball J.G. Lavergne E. Lau K.S. Spencer M.J. Stull J.T. Wehling M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C260-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modified loading of rat hindlimb musculature in vivo was achieved using previously described procedures in which the hindlimb musculature experienced 10 days of unloading followed by 2 days of reloading by normal body weight (13Frenette J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C818-C825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morey-Holton E. Wronski J. Physiologist. 1981; 24: 45-48Google Scholar). At the end of the period of unloading or reloading, animals were euthanized, and plantaris muscles were collected for analysis. Animals experiencing NOS inhibition during muscle reloading following unloading received water containing the NOS inhibitor l-NAME at 0.5 mg·ml−1 that was provided ad libitum starting 1 day prior to reloading. Control animals received untreated drinking water. RNA was isolated from whole plantaris muscles according to the technique of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and hybridizations were performed as described previously (20Tidball J.G. Lavergne E. Lau K.S. Spencer M.J. Stull J.T. Wehling M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C260-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer efficiency and uniformity of loading were checked by staining the membrane with methylene blue. Blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes generated by random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following hybridization at 65 °C, blots were washed with 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.75 m sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS for 1 h and exposed to autoradiographic film. The following probes were used to hybridize Northern blots: 1) mouse talin cDNA (generous gift from Dr. D. J. G. Rees; University of Oxford, UK); 2) 28 S ribosomal subunit cDNA (30Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3317-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); 3) rat GAPDH cDNA (31Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Dani D. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar); or 4) rat vinculin cDNA. Rat vinculin cDNA probe was synthesized by PCR of rat cDNA using the following primers: 1) 5′ CTG GTG GAC GAG GCT AT 3′ (upstream) and 2) 5′ ATG TTT CCA GCC ACA GC 3′ (downstream) which produce a 290-base pair product. The sequence of the primers was derived from the mouse cDNA sequence. 2J.-L. C. Coll, EMBL accession numberL18880. Briefly, RNA was isolated (21Peng H.-B. Rajavashisth T.B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and 1 μg was used to make cDNA using random primers (10 ng/μl) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 μl at 42 °C for 30 min. Following cDNA synthesis, 2 μl of the reaction was used to perform PCR using TAQ polymerase (Promega), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 4% Me2SO, and 0.2 μm dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cycling conditions were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles. Fifteen microliters of the PCR reaction was run to a 1% agarose gel, and the presence of the 290-base pair product was verified. The remaining 35 μl of the reaction was placed on a G-50 microspin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove nucleotides and primers. The concentration of the purified reaction was determined, and 60 ng was used in a ligation reaction to pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Plantaris muscles were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for at least 2 days at 6 °C. Muscles were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and single muscle fibers were dissected from surrounding tissue, while keeping the MTJ region of the fibers intact. Fibers were treated with 2 mg/ml of trypsin at 37 °C for 20 min before washing in sterile water followed by 1 min in 100% ethanol and air drying. Fibers were then incubated with DNase I for 4 h at 37 °C, rinsed in water followed by 1 min in 100% ethanol and air-dried. The RT reaction was performed using SuperScriptTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR mixture contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 4.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.1 unit/mlTaq, 16 μmdigoxigenin-11–2′-deoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate, 0.08% bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 μm primers. The same primers were used for vinculin RT-PCR as were used for generating vinculin cDNA for Northern analysis. Primer specificity for rat muscle vinculin was confirmed by RT-PCR of rat muscle RNA using the same RT-PCR conditions as those used for in situ RT-PCR. PCR on isolated fibers was performed for 35 cycles (1 min 94 °C, 1 min at 54 °C, 1.5 min at 72 °C; Ericomp Twinblock thermocycler). After completion of the PCR, the fibers were rinsed in ethanol and then in two changes of TBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) for 10 min and then incubated in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin diluted 1:700 diluted in TBS. After 3 washes in TBS, the sections were immersed in TBS at pH 9.5 and containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium reagents to produce a precipitate at the reaction sites. Positive controls consisted of omitting DNase treatment so that myonuclei containing the targeted sequence would stain after performing a successful PCR reaction. Reverse transcriptase was omitted from negative controls. Vinculin mRNA distribution was compared with the distribution of β-actin mRNA by in situ RT-PCR on single rat plantaris fibers using methods similar to those used for vinculin mRNA localization. The primers used to generate a β-actin 296-base pair product were 5′ CGT TGA CAT CCG TAA AGA CCT CTA 3′ (upper primer) and 5′ TAA AAC GCA GCT CAG TAA CAG TCC G 3′ (lower primer) (33Adams J.W. Yu D.S. Migita M.K. Young R. Hellickson M.S. Castro-Vargas F.E. Domingo J.D. Lee P.H. Bui J.S. Henderson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, PCR on fibers used for β-actin localization used 30 cycles of PCR (94 °C for 1 min followed by 58 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min). The possibility that SNAP treatments may reduce the rate of mRNA degradation rather than increasing transcription was tested by assaying for the rate of decline in concentration of vinculin and talin mRNA in cells treated with an inhibitor of transcription. C2C12 myotube cultures were incubated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D in 10% FBS in DMEM for 0, 2, 8, or 24 h. The cells were then collected for RNA isolation and Northern analysis for changes in vinculin and talin mRNA concentrations. Relative mRNA concentrations were determined by scanning densitometry (Alpha Innotec) and expressed in arbitrary units. Comparisons were made only between those experimental and control samples that were run in the same gel and probed in the same autoradiograph. The significance of differences between the concentration of any given protein or mRNA in loaded and control samples was tested by the Mann-Whitney test, with confidence limit set at p < 0.05. C2C12 myotubes subjected to mechanical stimulation by periodic cyclic loading in vitro for 24 h showed large increases in the concentration of both talin and vinculin mRNA by approximately 3- and 2.5-fold, respectively, compared with control myotubes not subjected to stimulation (Fig. 1). The presence of the NOS inhibitor l-NAME prevented the increases in talin and vinculin mRNA concentrations caused by mechanical stimulation of myotubes in vitro (Fig. 1). Measurement of NO concentration in the culture media of mechanically stimulated myotubes and unstimulated controls showed that stimulation nearly doubled NO production by myotubes, from 0.5 to 0.9 pmol NO/mg/min (±0.04;n = 4). Addition of 100 μm SNAP produced 30 nm NO/mg/min (± 0.01;n = 3) over the 2-h incubation period. The increased NO concentration was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of vinculin mRNA to 170% of control values and an increase in the concentration of talin mRNA to approximately 260% of control values (Table I). Inhibition of cGMP-dependent protein kinase with KT5823 prevented the increase in vinculin or talin mRNA stimulated by SNAP (Fig. 2). PKG inhibition by KT5823 in the presence of SNAP reduced vinculin mRNA concentration below that of control cultures that were not stimulated by SNAP. Application of KT5823 alone did not significantly decrease vinculin or talin mRNA concentrations (Fig. 2) which indicates that the KT5823 inhibition of the SNAP-stimulated increase of talin and vinculin mRNA does not occur through inhibition of a NO-independent positive regulator of their expression. However, KT5823 application to myotubes in the absence of SNAP resulted in a significant increase in vinculin mRNA concentration, which indicates that there must be other NO-independent, PKG-modulated controls on vinculin expression that remain unidentified.Table IRelative density of signals in Northern analysis of vinculin and talin mRNAs for myotubes treated with NO donor or PKG inhibitor10% FBS in DMEMSNAPSNAP + KT5823KT5823[Vinculin mRNA]100 (S.E. = 23; n = 3)168 (S.E. = 9; n = 3)1-aIndicates significant difference from untreated cells at p = 0.05.60 (S.E. = 15; n = 3)1-aIndicates significant difference from untreated cells at p = 0.05.210 (S.E. = 52; n = 3)1-aIndicates significant difference from untreated cells at p = 0.05.[Talin mRNA]100 (S.E. = 16; n = 3)258 (S.E. = 42; n = 3)1-aIndicates significant difference from untreated cells at p = 0.05.104 (S.E. = 16; n = 3)162 (S.E. = 34; n = 3)The Northern blot used for densitometry is shown in Fig. 2, which is representative of the results from three experiments.

Stability of talin and vinculin mRNAs were measured by assaying for changes in their concentration over time in the presence of actinomycin D, used to inhibit transcription. These assays showed that the half-life for talin mRNA stability in C2C12 myotubes is approximately 12.1 h, and the half-life for vinculin mRNA is approximately 27.3 h (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5).Figure 4Linear regression of densitometry of autoradiograph of Northern analysis for vinculin mRNA collected from myotubes cultured in media containing actinomycin D. r = −0.73; p = 0.007.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Linear regression of densitometry of autoradiograph of Northern analysis for talin mRNA collected from myotubes cultured in media containing actinomycin D. r = −0.96; p < 0.0001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Increased loading of plantaris muscles by 2 days of normal weight-bearing following a 10-day period of unloading produced an increase in vinculin mRNA concentration to 2.6 times control and in talin mRNA to 1.8 times control concentrations (Fig.6; Table II). The increased concentrations of both talin and vinculin mRNA during increased muscle loading was greatly attenuated in animals that receivedl-NAME in their drinking water during the reloading period (Fig. 6). GAPDH mRNA concentration as a fraction of total mRNA decreased during muscle reloading, but l-NAME had no detectable influence on the effect of reloading on GAPDH mRNA concentration. Thus, NOS inhibition does not affect the changes in concentration of all mRNAs that are caused by muscle reloading.Table IIRelative density of signals in Northern analysis of select mRNAs in plantaris muscles of animals experiencing modified muscle loadingUnloaded muscleReloaded + waterReloaded + l-NAME[Vinculin mRNA]100 (±13)255 (±26)145 (±33)[Talin mRNA]100 (±3)183 (±13)130 (±5)[28 S]100 (±6)100 (±0)99 (±5)[GAPDH mRNA]100 (±4)72 (±2)71 (±5)The Northern blot used for densitometry is shown in Fig. 6 and is representative of the results from three experiments.

Mean value obtained by densitometry for unloaded muscle samples was set at 100 and used to normalize other samples in each data set. Vinculin mRNA was primarily concentrated at MTJs in muscles experiencing increased loading (Fig. 7), as has been shown previously for talin mRNA (13Frenette J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C818-C825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Negative control fibers showed no labeling at the MTJ following the in situ RT-PCR procedure. Positive control fibers showed strong labeling of nuclei following the in situ RT-PCR procedure (Fig. 7).In situ RT-PCR of β-actin mRNA showed no detectable differences in the concentration of that mRNA at MTJ and non-MTJ regions of the fibers on reloaded muscles (Fig.8). Thus, the relatively high concentration of vinculin and talin mRNA at MTJs does not occur for all mRNA. RT-PCR showed that the primers and RT-PCR conditions used for in situ RT-PCR yielded products only of the predicted size for vinculin or β-actin (Fig. 9), indicating that the reaction products seen by in situ RT-PCR were specific for vinculin or β-actin mRNA.Figure 8Muscle fibers from rat plantaris muscle collected after 10 days of hindlimb unloading and 2 days of reloading and then subjected to in situ RT-PCR for β-actin mRNA.

Thus, NOS acts as a mechanical signal transducer in muscle cells and may couple modifications in the mechanical environment to changes in gene expression. Several previous investigations have reported that increased expression of structural proteins in skeletal muscle occurs when muscle is subjected to increased mechanical stimulation (9Caiozzo V.J. Haddad F. Baker M.J. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 80: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Frenette J. Tidball J.G. Am. J.

Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but little is known of the mechanisms by which those stimuli from the mechanical environment are transduced into chemical information that can influence gene expression. Although NO synthesis has been shown to be positively regulated by mechanical stimulation of cells in bone (36Pitsillides A.A. Rawlinson S.C.F. Suswillo R.F.L. Rourrin S. Azman G. Lanyon L.E.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C260-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NO is a famously pleuripotent signaling molecule (26Lowenstein C.J. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 124: 227-237Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 39Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the present findings are the first to show that it functions in modifying muscle gene expression in response to modified use. The hypothesis that NOS could function as a mechanical signal transducer in skeletal muscle was supported by several previous investigations. First, nNOS is highly concentrated at MTJs (17Chang W.J. Iannaccone S.T. Lau K.S. Masters B.S.S. McCabe T.J. McMillan K. Padre R.C. Spencer M.J. Tidball J.G. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9142-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which are specialized for force transduction across the muscle cell membrane (15Tidball J.G. J. Biomech. 1991; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This localization would place nNOS at an optimal site for sensing changes in the mechanical environment. Furthermore, increased skeletal muscle loading causes an increase both in nNOS expression (20Tidball J.G. Lavergne E. Lau K.S. Spencer M.J. Stull J.T. Wehling M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C260-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activity (18Balon T.W. Nadler J.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 77: 2519-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 20Tidball J.G. Lavergne E. Lau K.S. Spencer M.J. Stull J.T. Wehling M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C260-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NO has been shown to function as a signaling molecule in several cell types (39Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the short half-life of NO (26Lowenstein C.J. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 124: 227-237Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar) suggests that it would locally regulate changes in transcriptional activity. This local regulatory effect may have particular functional significance in skeletal muscle where the transcriptional activities of individual nuclei located in a single muscle fiber can function independently. This independent regulation of transcriptional activity of individual myonuclei in a single cell has been best demonstrated for myonuclei located near the neuromuscular junction in which the increased expression of acetylcholine receptor subunits can be regulated independently of non-neuromuscular junction nuclei in the same cell (40Simon M.S. Hoppe P. Burden S.J. Development. 1992; 114: 545-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ahn Jo S. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The finding reported here that NO transduces mechanical signals to influence the expression of talin and vinculin and that NOS, NO, and the mRNAs of talin and vinculin are most concentrated at MTJs indicates that MTJs may also be a distinct nuclear domain in muscle cells in which NO plays a role in the local modulation of transcription. Other evidence indicating that MTJs may be distinct nuclear domains in muscle includes the findings that the mRNA for myosin heavy chain (34Dix D.J. Eisenberg B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1885-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and talin (13Frenette J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C818-C825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) increase in concentration at the MTJ during modified muscle use. The observations reported here indicate that NO-mediated modulation of talin and vinculin mRNA concentrations occurs primarily by influencing the rate of transcription, although the possibility that there is some NO-mediated influence on talin and vinculin mRNA stability cannot be excluded entirely. This conclusion is supported by the finding that NO stimulation of myotubes for 24 h caused an approximately 170% increase in vinculin mRNA and 260% increase in talin mRNA, although the half-lives of those mRNAs were approximately 27 and 12 h, respectively. If NO were causing the observed increases in mRNA concentrations reported here solely through RNA stabilization, the maximum increase that would be observed in 24 h stimulation would be approximately 44% for vinculin and 93% for talin, which would be insufficient to explain the majority of the NO-mediated increase in mRNA concentrations. Although there are several mechanisms through which NO can function as a signaling molecule, to our knowledge the only previously identified mechanism through which it has been shown to influence transcription is through structural modification of transcription factors (23Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 24DelaTorre A. Schroeder R.A. Kuo P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The present findings show that NO modulation of talin and vinculin expression is blocked by inhibition of PKG and therefore NO is not influencing transcription of talin and vinculin through direct interaction with transcription factors but rather through a cGMP- and PKG-dependent pathway. NO modulation of talin and vinculin expression also differs from the mechanisms through which it modulates the expression of genes regulated by AP-1 or NF-κB (21Peng H.-B. Rajavashisth T.B. Libby P.

Other mechanisms may also exist at MTJs for mechanical signal transduction that may influence the expression of genes for cytoskeletal proteins. The integrin-associated complex of proteins is highly concentrated at MTJs (15Tidball J.G. J. Biomech. 1991; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and provides a prominent candidate system for this function because integrins have also been shown to function in signal transduction.

To isolate potential signaling molecules in the FGF signaling pathway, we have initiated a yeast two-hybrid screening using the cytosolic domain of FGF receptor-1 (Flg). Here we report the identification of BNIP-2, a previously cloned Bcl-2- and adenovirus E1B-associated protein, as a putative substrate of the receptor. When cotransfected in 293T cells, BNIP-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated via Flg, but their interaction was transient and could only be seen by “capture” experiments with catalytically inert kinase mutants. When responsive cells were challenged with basic FGF, endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated BNIP-2 could be precipitated with a BNIP-2 antibody. In addition, the recombinant BNIP-2 expressed in bacteria could be phosphorylated by active Flg in vitro. BNIP-2 shares a region of homology with the noncatalytic domain of Cdc42GAP, a GTPase-activating protein for the small GTP-binding molecule, Cdc42. We show here that BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP could directly bind to each other and they also compete for the binding to the same target, Cdc42. Unexpectedly, BNIP-2, either produced as a bacterial recombinant protein or expressed in 293T cells, could stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42. In all cases, tyrosine phosphorylation of BNIP-2 severely impaired its association with Cdc42GAP and its induced GTPase-activating protein-like activity toward Cdc42. These findings should allow us to further characterize the integration of signaling between receptor tyrosine kinases, GTP-binding molecules, and apoptotic pathways.

Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). FGFs induce their biological responses by binding to and activating a family of cell surface receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (2Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Dimerization of FGF receptors is essential for kinase activation and for receptor autophosphorylation and requires the concerted action of FGF together with soluble or cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (3Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Upon activation, FGF receptor tyrosine kinases undergo rapid autophosphorylation on various tyrosine residues. Autophosphorylation sites located within the catalytic domain are crucial for stimulation of kinase activity, while autophosphorylation sites located in other regions are usually involved in the recruitment of cellular target proteins (4Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). FGFR-1, or Flg, contains at least seven autophosphorylation sites. Two of these are located in the catalytic domain (Tyr653 and Tyr654) and are essential for kinase activation (5Mohammadi M. Dikic J. Sorokin A. Burgess A.W. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). One phosphotyrosine in the C-terminal tail (Tyr766) functions as a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of phospholipase C-γ (6Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Spivak T. Honneger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr766 is essential for phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis but not for FGF-induced DNA synthesis in myoblasts or differentiation of PC12 cells. The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway plays an important role in FGF-signaling (7Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 8Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Liu D. Amana T. Takano T. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1985; 310: 73-75Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein Grb2 links receptor tyrosine kinases with the Ras signaling pathway in conjunction with the guanine nucleotide-releasing protein Sos (9Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.C. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolniik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 10Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Grb2 does not bind directly to the FGF receptors but binds to a recently cloned and characterized docker protein termed FRS-2 (11Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 69: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (724) Google Scholar). FRS-2 is specifically and rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated when responsive cells are treated with FGF or NGF but not significantly phosphorylated in response to other growth factors or cytokines (11Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 69: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 12Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). FGF induces a unique pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation when the lysates of cultured cells are immunoblotted and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation (13Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Ong S.H. Siak C.B. Cao X.M. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5832-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Like NGF, FGF also induces the differentiation of PC12 cells, whereas epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor induce proliferation, unless overexpressed (14Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Traverse S.K. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The cellular signaling pathways of all growth factors and cytokines are initiated at the activated receptors, and the resultant signals depend on the combinations of proteins that interact at the receptor or that are substrates of the intrinsic or associated kinases. The unique nature of FGF signaling pathways raises the possibility that novel cellular proteins are either substrates of, or become associated with, the FGF receptor after ligand stimulation. Some of these proteins may be responsible for initiating signaling pathways that are separate from the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In an attempt to identify novel proteins that interact with the cytosolic domain of Flg, we used the two-hybrid protein interaction cloning system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4852) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of the protein BNIP-2 as a putative substrate of Flg. BNIP-2 was first cloned as a protein that interacted with the adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein that protects against cell death induced by viral infection and other proapoptotic stimuli (17Boyd J.M.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 protein and related antiapoptotic proteins can functionally substitute for the E1B 19-kDa protein, and they too bind BNIP-2 (17Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramaniam T. Venkatesh L.K.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2403-2409PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of BNIP-2 is not known, and few clues can be derived from the amino acid sequence of the protein, since it does not display significant homology to any protein in the data banks except for a region away from the catalytic domain on the 50-kDa RhoGAP (Cdc42GAP) protein (17Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramaniam T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Cdc42GAP is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that has highest activity for Cdc42 and low activity to Rac but negligible activity toward small molecular weight G proteins outside the Rho family (23Barfod E.T.

Brill B. van Erp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that BNIP-2 binds directly to Cdc42GAP and Cdc42. BNIP-2 augments Cdc42 GTPase activity when analyzed in in vitroassays. Tyrosine phosphorylation of BNIP-2, however, inhibits its binding to each partner protein, which also results in the abrogation of its GAP-like activity. It is possible that BNIP-2 plays a role in modulating the GTPase activity of Cdc42, by acting directly on Cdc42 or indirectly on Cdc42GAP, and that tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein can act as a “switch” to reverse the associations and possible downstream effects. Full-length cDNA of BNIP-2 was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from human 293T cells according to the published sequence (6Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Spivak T. Honneger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and cloned into a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged expression vector, pXJ40 (Dr. E. Manser, IMCB, Singapore) or into pGEX4T-1 vector for producing the GST recombinant protein. Human full-length FGF receptor-1, Flg (from Dr. L. Claesson-Welsh, Biomedical Center, Sweden) was used to amplify its cytosolic domain, Flg(cyto) (amino acids 397–822) and cloned into pAS2 vector of the GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system or into pXJ40-FLAG. pGEX-Cdc42GAP and pGEX-Cdc42 (from Dr. A. Hall, University College London) were used in making GST fusion proteins and also as templates to generate pXJ40 constructs or pACT2 constructs used in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. Mutants of Flg(cyto) (K514R, D623E, D623N, Y653F/Y654F) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-Change Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length FRS2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from Swiss 3T3 cells based on cDNA sequence provided by Dr. J. Schlessinger (New York University Medical Center; Ref. 11Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 69: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (724) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified using a Wizard miniprep kit (Promega) or Wizard Maxi/Mega-prep kit followed by ethanol reprecipitation for use in transfection experiments. Clones were confirmed correct by thermal cycle sequencing using the SequiThermal EXCEL II DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies) or mapping analyses using restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs).Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used as host for propagation of the clones. Reagents used were of analytical grade, and standard protocols for molecular manipulations and media preparations were from Ref. 53Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.53-1.85Google Scholar. Flg(cyto) was fused to the yeast DNA binding domain of GAL4 in a pAS2 vector and screened for interacting clones in a human T-lymphocyte library fused with the GAL4 DNA activation domain in the pACT vector according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Putative clones were reconstituted and tested against unrelated proteins such as human lamin C and SV40 large T-antigen to eliminate false positive results. Full-length human GST-BNIP-2 protein (1 mg) was eluted from Sepharose beads by boiling in 1% (w/v) SDS. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, and mixed with complete adjuvant (Life Technologies, Inc.) until miscelles were formed and injected subcutaneously into female New Zealand White rabbits. Every 2 weeks, two more boosters were administered in incomplete adjuvant followed by another injection 1 month later. Ten days after the final injection, sera were collected for purification. The sera were first incubated with GST proteins immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in order to remove anti-GST antibodies. The supernatant, containing mostly anti-BNIP-2 antibodies, was then incubated with GST-BNIP-2 immobilized on another polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to capture anti-BNIP-2 antibodies. The bound antibodies were eluted by incubating in glycine (pH 2) and vortexed several times, and the solution was neutralized in Tris (pH 8). The antibody detected a doublet at 52 kDa in untransfected and BNIP-2-transfected lysates, and it was deemed specific by virtue of its binding inhibition by immunizing peptide. Cells were grown in either RPMI 1640 medium (human 293T cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (human MRC-5 primary lung fibroblasts) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma) and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. 293T cells at 90% confluency in 100-mm plates were transfected for 1 h with 10 μg of the indicated plasmid using Tfx-50 cationic lipids according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Trition X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and directly analyzed as whole cell lysates (25 μg), or their aliquots (500 μg) were used in immunoprecipitation with antibodies (1–2 μg) or in affinity precipitation/pull-down experiments with GST fusion proteins (5 μg). GST-Cdc42 was preloaded with GDP or GTPγS (Sigma) as described (25Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Samples were run in SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting with purified anti-BNIP-2, anti-HA (gift from Dr N. Jain, IMCB, Singapore), anti-Flg, PY20, or anti-Cdc42GAP (all from Transduction Laboratories). Flg(cyto) was cloned into pXJ40GST and expressed in 293T cells, purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads, washed extensively, and then eluted. An aliquot was used to phosphorylate GST-BNIP-2 (1 μg; conjugated to agarose beads) for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm magnesium chloride, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreithol with 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP; 5 μCi). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, gel-dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 30 min on double intensifying screens. The GAP activity toward Cdc42 was examined by determining the release of 32Pi from the [γ-32P]GTP prebound to the molecule. GST-Cdc42 (5 μg) still conjugated to the Sepharose beads, were washed twice in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) and resuspended in a final volume of 10 μl of the same buffer with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 mm magnesium chloride. Excessive unincorporated radioactive GTP was removed by washing the beads five times in 1 ml of cold buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, a mixture of proteases inhibitors, and 5 mm sodium orthovanadate), and beads were finally resuspended in 10 μl of the same buffer. For in vitro GAP assays using proteins expressed in bacteria, eluted recombinants of BNIP-2 or Cdc42GAP (1 μg in 100 μl of buffer B) were then added to the beads suspension and mixed well. The suspension was quickly centrifuged to collect the beads and incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and aliquots of the supernatant (10 μl) were then taken for counting in a scintillation counter. For GAP assays involving 293T lysates, cells transfected with BNIP-2 and/or Flg(cyto) were lysed in buffer B, and 20 μl of this (approximately 40 μg of total protein contents) was diluted in 100 μl of buffer B before it was added to the GST-Cdc42 beads preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP and assayed as described above. The cytosolic domain of the FGF receptor-1 (Flg) was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel interacting proteins. One of the putative clones was identified as a nearly full-length cDNA encoding BNIP-2 protein, previously known to interact with the Bcl-2 and adenovirus E1B proteins (17Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramaniam T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To characterize the nature of the binding between BNIP-2 and Flg, the full-length BNIP-2 cDNA was isolated and transfected into 293T with the full-length receptor. Experiments were performed to see if BNIP-2 could be tyrosine-phosphorylated by Flg in these cells. The cell lysates were precipitated with Flg or HA antibodies, and the resultant Western blots were probed with PY20 antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1). The Flg was active as indicated by the positive PY20 signal in the Flg immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A), while HA immunoprecipitation results revealed a tyrosine-phosphorylated BNIP-2 doublet at 52 kDa (Fig. 1 B). However, there was no sign of phosphorylated BNIP-2 in the Flg immunoprecipitate (possible location indicated by unlabeled arrow), suggesting that their binding in vivo may be transient in nature. To investigate this hypothesis, various “kinase-dead” mutants of the cytosolic domain of Flg, Flg(cyto), were constructed (see “Materials and Methods”) and used to investigate the possible association by trapping BNIP-2 with these mutants (Fig. 1 C). Previous studies had demonstrated that the mutated amino acids are necessary for the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates by Flg(cyto) (26Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). 293T lysates expressing HA-BNIP-2 with either the wild type Flg(cyto) or the various Flg(cyto) mutants were precipitated with HA antibody, and the resultant Western blot was probed with PY20 antibody (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation of BNIP-2 was observed only in the presence of wild type Flg(cyto). The PY20 blot was then stripped and reprobed with Flg antibody. It is apparent in Fig.1 C, middle panel, that indeed only kinase-dead Flg(cyto) were co-immunoprecipitated with BNIP-2. In order to demonstrate that equivalent amounts of BNIP-2 were precipitated, the blot was again stripped and reprobed with HA antibody (Fig.1 C, lower panel). To verify that endogenous BNIP-2 could also be phosphorylated by exogenous FGF, primary human MRC-5 fibroblasts were treated with FGF (10 ng/ml) for 10 min, and the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the BNIP-2 antibody, prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resultant Western blot was then probed with PY20 antibody. In the lysates from stimulated cells, there was a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein at 52 kDa (indicated byarrowheads) that was precipitated by the BNIP-2 antibody (Fig. 1 D). Compared with the transfection studies in 293T, only the slower migrating form of tyrosine-phopshorylated BNIP-2 was detected here. The nature of this difference is currently unknown, although these two cell types express both isoforms (data not shown). To further confirm that BNIP-2 is a substrate of Flg(cyto), an in vitro kinase assay was performed using GST-Flg(cyto) overexpressed and purified from 293T cells as the active enzyme. The purified GST-Flg(cyto) was active as seen by its autophosphorylation (Fig.1 E, left panel), and it could phosphorylate the purified GST-BNIP-2 in vitro (Fig.1 E, right panel). Intracellular signaling involves the association and dissociation of complexes whose formation is often controlled by phosphorylation. To understand where BNIP-2 may participate in cell signaling, it was necessary to first determine which other proteins it might associate with downstream of Flg. Sequence alignments reveal a strong homology between BNIP-2 and a noncatalytic domain of Cdc42GAP (Fig. 2). This region could represent a binding or regulatory domain, whereby both are regulated by a common mechanism or they are both targeted to a third unidentified protein. A third potential function for this homology region was alluded to by Boyd et al. (17Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramaniam T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), who reasoned that Cdc42GAP and BNIP-2 may form a heterocomplex via this domain. To test the latter hypothesis, 293T cells were transfected with Cdc42GAP and HA-tagged BNIP-2, either singly or together. The lysates were precipitated with a BNIP-2 antibody, and the resultant Western blot was probed for the presence of Cdc42GAP (Fig.3 A). A strong signal, denoting the presence of Cdc42GAP, was detected in the immunoprecipitate derived from cells coexpressing HA-BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP. When cells were transfected with Cdc42GAP alone, the signal was weaker. These results indicate that there is an association between BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAPin vivo.Figure 3BNIP-2 binding to Cdc42GAP is reduced by its tyrosine phosphorylation. A, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-BNIP-2 and/or Cdc42GAP. Lysates were immunoprecipitated (I/P) with BNIP-2 antibody, separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with Cdc42GAP antibody. The band migrating below Cdc42GAP is the antibody heavy chain.B and C, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-BNIP-2 and/or Flg(cyto). Lysates were used in a pull-down (P/D) experiment by incubating with equal amounts of GST-Cdc42GAP conjugated to agarose beads. The associated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with HA antibody. Aliquots of the lysates used in Fig. 3 B were immunoprecipitated with BNIP-2 antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with PY20 antibody (C, upper panel) or HA antibody (C, lower panel) to demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation and equal expression of transfected BNIP-2, respectively. D, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-BNIP-2 alone or with Flg(cyto). Lysates were then treated with (in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors) or without Yersinia phosphotyrosine phosphatase (microunits/ml, as indicated) at 37 °C for 30 min and then subjected to GST-Cdc42GAP pull-down. BNIP-2 binding was revealed by Western blotting with HA antibody and is expressed as the percentage relative to that of nonphosphorylated BNIP-2 as assessed by densitometric analyses. In all experiments involving GST pull-down experiments, blots were stripped and probed with GST antibody to assess the equality of loading (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the effect that tyrosine phosphorylation of BNIP-2 has on its binding to Cdc42GAP. Lysates from 293T expressing HA-BNIP-2 or/and Flg(cyto) were incubated with GST-Cdc42GAP, and the associated proteins were separated, Western blotted, and probed with HA antibody (Fig. 3 B). The result shows that BNIP-2 bound to Cdc42GAP, and this association decreased when BNIP-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by Flg(cyto). Aliquots of the lysates used in Fig. 3 B were immunoprecipitated with anti-BNIP-2, and the resultant Western blots were probed with PY20 antibody (Fig.3 C, upper panel) or with HA antibody (Fig. 3 C, lower panel), verifying that BNIP-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and expressed equally in these experiments. Since BNIP-2 was overexpressed in the lysates and the GST-Cdc42GAP was in great excess, the association between these two molecules is most likely to be direct, as further evidenced by their positive interaction detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). To confirm that the dissociation of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP in the presence of Flg(cyto) was due to its tyrosine phosphorylation instead of other mechanisms (e.g. serine/threonine phosphorylation induced downstream of activated FGF receptors), lysates from cells expressing HA-BNIP-2 and Flg(cyto) were first treated with or withoutYersinia phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase prior to a GST-Cdc42GAP pull-down experiment similar to those shown in Fig.3 B. The result shows that when the phosphate(s) on the BNIP-2 tyrosines was/were removed, its binding to Cdc42GAP was essentially restored (Fig. 3 D). Cdc42GAP augments the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42. One notable feature of the recognition of Cdc42 by Cdc42GAP is that it shows no greater preference for the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 than the GDP-bound form (24Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Harris P.M. Self A.J. Brill B. van Erp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to see if BNIP-2 could modulate the binding preference of Cdc42GAP to Cdc42. 293T cells were transiently transfected with Cdc42GAP with or without HA-BNIP-2. Lysates from each of these transfected cells were divided into three equal portions and subjected to a pull-down experiment with equal amounts of GST-Cdc42 that was either preloaded with GTPγS (a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP) or GDP or was not loaded with either nucleotide. The bound proteins were Western blotted to determine the presence of the GAP protein. The data in Fig.4 A demonstrate that an equal amount of Cdc42GAP bound to both the GDP-loaded and GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 and that this was significantly more than that binding to nonloaded Cdc42. When BNIP-2 was coexpressed, there was a considerable reduction in the amount of Cdc42GAP binding to Cdc42, regardless of what form of nucleotide was bound to Cdc42. These cells expressed equal amounts of Cdc42GAP regardless of whether BNIP-2 was expressed or not (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that BNIP-2 in vivo can interfere with the binding of Cdc42GAP to Cdc42. This could be due to (i) a direct inhibition on Cdc42GAP, (ii) the competition from BNIP-2 on the same target (Cdc42), or (iii) a combination of both. Since GST-Cdc42 used in the pull-down experiment was in great excess over the Cdc42GAP and BNIP-2 in the lysates, it seems most likely that the reduced binding was at least due to direct inhibition from BNIP-2 binding to Cdc42GAP. To examine the second possibility, we used GST-Cdc42GAP to precipitate BNIP-2"

https://openalex.org/W2318541555,"Six novel p53-inducible transcripts were recently cloned from Val5, a murine cell line stably expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 allele. One of the isolated clones represented a novel isoform of cytosolic adenylate kinase (AK1), a highly conserved monomeric enzyme involved in cellular homeostasis of adenine nucleotides. The corresponding protein, which we named AK1β, was specifically induced upon activation of wt p53 in Val5 cells. The AK1β protein differs from cytoplasmic AK1 by having 18 extra amino acids at the N-terminus. The extra residues in AK1β provide a consensus signal for N-terminal myristoylation; as expected, AK1β was shown to localize to the plasma membrane. The human AK1 gene contains several consensus p53 binding sites and we report that p53-dependent induction of the alternative AK1β transcript also occurs in human cells. By using antisense ablation experiments in Val5 fibroblasts we show that AK1β plays a relevant role in the establishment of reversible cell-cycle arrest as induced by p53 in these cells. These findings suggest that within a p53-dependent genetic program, a specific isoform of adenylate kinase has a previously undescribed growth-regulatory function, which might not necessarily require its best characterized biochemical activity."
https://openalex.org/W1998461424,"The transcriptional regulation of the apoCIII gene by hormonal and metabolic signals plays a significant role in determining plasma triglyceride levels. In the current work we demonstrate that the apoCIII gene is regulated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. In HepG2 cells, repression of MAP kinase activity by treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 caused a 5–8-fold increase in apoCIII transcriptional activity. Activation of MAP kinase by phorbol ester treatment caused a 3–5-fold reduction in apoCIII transcription. The region of the apoCIII promoter responsible for this regulation was mapped in transiently transfected HepG2 cells to a 6-base pair element located at −740. The major protein binding to this site was identified as the nuclear hormone receptor HNF4. An increase in HNF4 mRNA and protein levels was observed in HepG2 cells after treatment with PD98059, indicating that the MAP kinase pathway regulates the expression of the HNF4 gene. These findings demonstrate that the apoCIII gene can be regulated by signals acting through the MAP kinase pathway and that this regulation is mediated, at least in part, by changes in the amount of HNF4.

In transgenic animals, overexpression of the apoCIII gene caused hypertriglyceridemia (2Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), with as little as 30–40% excess apoCIII causing a 2-fold increase in triglyceride levels (3Aalto-Setäla K. Fisher E.A.

Likewise, mice that did not express apoCIII because of a gene knockout had abnormally low circulating triglyceride levels (4Maeda N. Li H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol.

A sequence polymorphism in the 3′-untranslated region of the apoCIII gene has been associated with elevated triglyceride levels in several populations (5Aalto-Setäla K. Kontula K. Sane T.

The apoCIII gene is transcriptionally regulated by a variety of metabolic and hormonal signals. In a previous study, we demonstrated that in a hypoinsulinemic animal model of diabetes, hepatic apoCIII transcriptional activity is regulated by insulin and that these changes correlated with changes in plasma triglyceride levels (17Chen M. Breslow J.L. Li W. Leff T. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1918-1924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence that apoCIII transcriptional activity plays a significant role in determining plasma triglyceride levels comes from the analysis of a genetic polymorphism in the human apoCIII promoter region. Two major sequence variants of the apoCIII promoter can be found in the human population. The most common (wild-type) allele differs from the less common (variant) allele by five single base pair DNA sequence differences. A haplotype of the apoCIII locus containing the variant promoter was associated with hypertriglyceridemia in a genetic study (18Dammerman M. Sandkuijl L.A. Halaas J.L. Chung W. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4562-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and was defective in its ability to be regulated by insulin in transfected HepG2 cells (19Li W.W. Dammerman M.M. Smith J.D. Metzger S. Breslow J.L. Leff T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These results confirm that the apoCIII gene is transcriptionally regulated by insulin and suggest that this regulation plays an important role in determining plasma triglyceride levels. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the rate of apoCIII gene expression is an important determinant of plasma triglyceride levels and suggest that modulation of apoCIII transcription by metabolic and/or hormonal signals is likely to have a direct effect on plasma triglyceride metabolism. Previous work has demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the apoCIII gene in the liver is dependent on the nuclear hormone receptor HNF4, which interacts with at least two sites in the apoCIII promoter (20Lavrentiadou S.N. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Taylor D.G. Haubenwallner S. Leff T.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HNF4 is abundant in liver, intestine, and kidney and regulates many genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (23Sladek F.M. Receptor. 1993; 3: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The active form of HNF4 is a homodimer, and it does not appear to heterodimerize with other members of the nuclear receptor family (25Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although HNF4 is usually classified as an orphan receptor, recent work has suggested that coenzyme A derivatives of some fatty acids activate the receptor and have been proposed to be endogenous ligands for HNF4 (26Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A crucial role for HNF4 in the regulation of metabolism was demonstrated by the recent finding that an inherited form of diabetes (MODY, maturity onset diabetes of the young) is caused by a mutation in the HNF4 gene (27Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). We report here that the transcriptional activity of the apoCIII gene is regulated by the MAP1 kinase signaling pathway. Activation of Erk1/2 signaling caused a reduction in apoCIII gene transcription. This effect was dependent on an HNF4 binding site located at −740 in the apoCIII promoter. The HNF4-dependent MAP kinase-mediated regulation of the apoCIII gene was caused, at least in part, by changes in the quantity of HNF4 after treatment with modulators of MAP kinase activity. The basic apoCIII promoter/luciferase reporter construction (pL854) contains human apoCIII promoter sequences from −854 to +22 linked to the coding sequence of the firefly luciferase gene in the vector pGL-basic (Promega Inc.). The apoCIII promoter sequences were derived from the apoCIII/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vector pM854 which contains a point mutation at −126 which generates a uniqueNdeI site (28Gruber P.J. Torres-Rosado A. Wolak M.L. Leff T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2417-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The progressive deletion mutants were generated by digestion of pL854 with SmaI, which cuts the plasmid upstream of the apoCIII promoter at −866, and with a second restriction enzyme that cuts within the apoCIII promoter. After repair with T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends, the plasmid was re-ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The enzymes used to generate the deletion series were ApaI (−782), StuI (−690), and AspI (−169). An additional series of promoter deletions was constructed by removal of specific fragments from pL854. pL169h was constructed by inserting the KpnI/StuI fragment (−862 to −694) immediately upstream of CIII sequences in pL169. pL169f was generated by inserting the KpnI/ApaI fragment (−862 to −784) immediately upstream of CIII sequences in pL169. pL169i was made by inserting the ApaI/StuI fragment (−784 to −694) immediately upstream of CIII sequences in pL169. Point mutations in the pL854 background (pL854C, pL854D, and pL854E) were generated using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega Inc.) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for generating the mutations were: 854C : −778·CAGACATGAGACCATGGCCTCCCCCAGGG. 854D : −764·GCTCCTCCCCCATGGATGTTATCAG. 854E : −716·AGCCTGGTGGAGCCATGGGCAAAGGCC. This protocol replaced six nucleotides in the CIII promoter with a unique NcoI site (underlined). Deletion of sequences between the C and E mutations (pL854C/E) and the D and Emutations (pL854D/E) was generated by digestion of the point mutation plasmids (pL854C, pL854D, and pL854E) with NcoI and a second unique enzyme (EcoRI) and recombining the appropriate fragments in vitro. The additional point mutations pL854L, pL854M, and pL854N were generated from theD/E deletion plasmid (pL854D/E). The missing NcoI fragment was replaced with a 53-base pair synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a unique NheI site at theL, M, and N regions (for exact sequences, see Fig. 5). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Total RNA was extracted using the Ultraspec RNA Isolation System (Biotecx, Inc.) from confluent HepG2 cells grown in 100-mm dishes. Total RNA was subjected to gel electrophoresis on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Human apoCIII and rat actin32P-labeled cDNA probes were prepared using the Rediprime II labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern analysis hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 16 h with 1 × 106cpm/ml labeled probe in 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed twice at room temperature for 20 min with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and for 20 min at 55 °C with 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and then subjected to autoradiography and PhosphorImage analysis. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 10 min on ice in MAP kinase lysis buffer (50 mm glycerol phosphate, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 70 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaVO4, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C. Equal amounts of lysate were run on 10% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels (Novex Inc.) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electrophoresis. Membranes were preincubated in blocking buffer, 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (1 × PBS, 0.1% Tween 20), overnight at 4 °C. The blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-p44/42 Erk or anti-phospho-p44/42 Erk antibodies (New England Biolabs Inc.) in blocking solution. After washing three times in PBST, blots were incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Life Sciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times in PBST and developed using the SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ApoCIII/luciferase constructions were transfected into HepG2 cells essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected at 50–60% confluence with 2.0 μg of DNA/well into 12-well plates using Lipofectin. The internal reference plasmid pCMVβgal was co-transfected in all experiments. Cells were transfected for 4 h in serum-free minimum Eagle's medium and allowed to recover in minimum Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. The recovery period was followed by treatment with Me2SO, PD98059, or PMA as indicated, in minimum Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured using a commercial Dual-LightTM assay system (Tropix Inc.). Luciferase values were normalized by β-galactosidase internal reference plasmid. The HNF4α promoter was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human liver genomic DNA library (CLONTECH Inc.) using primer pairs derived from the published sequence (27Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) (GenBank Accession numbers U72959 and U72960). The amplified product was cloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) and verified by sequence analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells treated with Me2SO or PD98059 essentially as described (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). Recombinant human HNF4 was produced in vitro using the Promega TNT Quick Coupled transcription/translation system. DNA binding reactions (20 μl, final volume) were carried out in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 3% Ficoll, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.06% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), with 50,000 cpm of labeled probe (approximately 0.25 ng) and either 3–5 μg of nuclear extract or 1–2 μl of TNT reaction. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then analyzed on 6.0% DNA retardation gels (Novex Inc.) in 0.5 × TBE at 125 V for 1 h at room temperature. Supershift reactions were carried out by including antibodies in the binding reactions and extending the incubation time to 45 min. After drying, gels were analyzed by autoradiography and PhosphorImage analysis. The sequences of the probes and competitors used for the gel shift experiments are shown below.

To determine if apoCIII gene expression is regulated by the MAP kinase signaling pathway, HepG2 cells were treated with PD98059, an inhibitor of the upstream activator of Erk1/2 (30Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar), and apoCIII mRNA levels were measured. The results (Fig.1 A) demonstrate that apoCIII mRNA levels increased with time after the addition of PD98059, starting at 4 h and rising to a maximum (20-fold above control) 16 h after addition of the inhibitor. Western analysis of phosphorylated Erk1/2 (the active form of the kinase) was carried out to determine the effect of PD98059 on the activity of the MAP kinase pathway in HepG2 cells. The results of this analysis (Fig.1 B) demonstrate that HepG2 cells growing in normal media contained relatively high levels of activated Erk1/2 and that PD98059 treatment rapidly reduced the amount of activated Erk1/2 to undetectable levels. To determine if MAP kinase-dependent changes in apoCIII mRNA levels are caused by activation of transcription, HepG2 cells were transfected with an apoCIII promoter/reporter construct and treated with PD98059. The results (Fig.1 C) demonstrate that inhibition of Erk1/2 caused an increase in apoCIII transcriptional activity with a time course similar to that seen with the endogenous gene. Taken together, these results indicate that a reduction in MAP kinase signaling causes an increase in apoCIII gene transcription. Because repression of MAP kinase signaling caused an increase in apoCIII transcription, we tested whether PMA-mediated MAP kinase activation would have the opposite effect on apoCIII expression. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of HepG2 cells for 24 h with PMA caused a strong activation of Erk1/2 and a 5-fold reduction of apoCIII mRNA levels. This down-regulation of apoCIII expression was blocked by PD98059, indicating that the effect of PMA on apoCIII expression was mediated by MAP kinase. The reduction of apoCIII expression by PMA was also observed with a transfected apoCIII/luciferase plasmid, indicating that the regulation was at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2 C). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that apoCIII transcriptional activity is regulated by the MAP kinase signaling pathway. To identify the region of the apoCIII promoter which mediates transcriptional regulation by MAP kinase, we tested a series of deletions for their ability to be activated by PD98059 in HepG2 cells. Deletion of sequences between −782 and −690 dramatically reduced the effect of PD98059 on apoCIII transcriptional activity (Fig.3). Sequences between −854 and −782 and between −690 and −169 did not appear to contribute to regulation by PD98059. A construction that linked the −782 to −690 region to the proximal part of the apoCIII promoter (pL169i, Fig. 3) was also responsive to PD98059 treatment. The residual 2-fold activation seen with constructions missing the −782 to −690 sequences appears to be mediated by sequences downstream of −169. The PD98059-responsive region (−782 to −690) was analyzed further by introduction of several point mutations within this region (−767, −755, and −704). Although none of these point mutations affected apoCIII transcription, deletion of sequences between −755 and −704 abolished the response to PD98059 treatment (Fig. 4).Figure 4MAP kinase response element is located between −704 and −755. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with apoCIII/luciferase reporter constructions containing the apoCIII promoter point mutants or deletion mutants shown in the upper panel.

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the specific sequences required for PD98059 regulation, three mutations were introduced between −755 and −704. These mutations, designated L, M, and N, replaced 6 base pairs in the full-length promoter with anNheI site at −746, −740, and −712, respectively. When these constructions were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, only the M mutation completely abolished the responses to PD98059 and PMA (Fig. 5), indicating that this element is required for regulation by MAP kinase. The Lmutation, which is immediately adjacent to the sequences mutated inM, partially reduced the MAP kinase response, whereas theN mutation had essentially no effect. These findings demonstrate that the activation of apoCIII transcription by PD98059 treatment in HepG2 cells requires a regulatory element located at −740 in the apoCIII promoter. We have designated this response element C3MK. We have also observed C3MK-dependent regulation of apoCIII transcription in transiently transfected Caco2 cells (results not shown). This human intestinal epithelial cell line expresses endogenous apoCIII (31Reisher S.R. Hughes T.E. Ordovas J.M. Schaefer E.J. Feinstein S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5757-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and can be transfected with the same constructions used in the HepG2 experiments. These findings suggest that the regulation of apoCIII by MAP kinase signaling is not particular to HepG2 cells. In a previous publication a binding site for the nuclear hormone receptor HNF4 was identified in the region of the apoCIII promoter which contains the C3MK element described above (20Lavrentiadou S.N. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Lavrentiadou S.N. Zannis V.I. Kardassis D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14078-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine if HNF4 interacts with the MAP kinase response element, gel mobility shift experiments were carried out with DNA probes containing wild-type and mutant versions of the C3MK element. Recombinant human HNF4 produced in an in vitro transcription/translation system bound strongly to the wild-type probe and to the probe containing theL mutation (Fig.6 A); however, the Mmutation, which abolished MAP kinase-mediated transcriptional regulation, was completely defective for HNF4 binding. When the same probes were used with HepG2 nuclear extracts, a DNA binding protein that co-migrated with recombinant HNF4 and supershifted with anti-HNF4 antibodies also failed to bind to the M mutation (Fig.6 A, right lanes). Competition experiments with excess cold oligonucleotides representing the wild-type, L, and M sequences or a known HNF4-binding element confirmed that this band was HNF4 (Fig. 6 B). Comparison of the gel shift pattern on the mutant probe with patterns seen with the competition and supershift experiments indicates that the major C3MK-binding protein in HepG2 nuclear extracts is HNF4. These results demonstrate that HNF4 binds to the C3MK element and present the possibility that it may mediate the effect of changes in MAP kinase activity. To explore the possibility that HNF4 is modified as a result of MAP kinase activity, we examined the gel shift pattern of HNF4 in nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells treated for various times with PD98059. Although no additional new bands were observed in treated extracts, there was a noticeable increase in the amount of HNF4 binding activity (Fig. 7 A). Although it is difficult to quantify bands on mobility shift gels accurately, it appeared that the amount of HNF4 DNA binding activity was increased about 2-fold over control levels. These findings suggest that either the amount of HNF4 was increased after 98059 treatment or that the inhibition of MAP kinase activity caused HNF4 to be modified in such a way that it bound to DNA with a higher affinity. To determine if treatment of HepG2 cells with PD98059 caused HNF4 levels to change, Western blot analysis with anti-HNF4 antibodies was performed on whole cell lysates prepared from 98059-treated cells. The results presented in Fig. 7 B demonstrate that the quantity of HNF4 rises during PD98059 treatment by about 2-fold relative to control values. Increased HNF4 amounts could be caused by reduced rates of protein degradation or increased rates of HNF4 gene expression. Northern analysis of mRNA isolated from HepG2 cells treated with PD98059 demonstrated that HNF4 mRNA levels increased approximately 2-fold (Fig. 7 B). The magnitude and time course of this increase were consistent with the change observed in HNF4 protein levels (Fig. 7 B, lower panels). Together, these results indicate that treatment of HepG2 cells with PD98059 caused an increase in HNF4 gene transcription leading to increased levels of HNF4 protein. To explore this possibility, the HNF4 gene promoter was isolated and linked to a luciferase reporter gene. When HepG2 cells were transfected with this construction and treated with PD98059, a 2-fold increase in HNF4 promoter activity was observed (Fig.8). These results confirm that the expression of the HNF4 gene is regulated by the MAP kinase signaling pathway. An important determinant of the plasma triglyceride level is the quantity of apoCIII in circulation. The amount of apoCIII produced is controlled to a large degree at the level of apoCIII gene transcription. This suggests that the regulation of apoCIII transcription by metabolic and hormonal signals plays a significant role in controlling plasma triglyceride levels. In the current study we have demonstrated that activation of the Erk1/2 MAP kinase pathway negatively regulates apoCIII transcriptional activity. The MAP kinase response element (C3MK) was mapped to a site located at −740 in the apoCIII promoter, and we identified the main transcription factor binding to this site as the orphan nuclear receptor HNF4. At least part of the explanation for the MAP kinase-mediated change in apoCIII expression appears to be an indirect effect on the expression of the HNF4 gene. Inhibition of the Erk1/2 MAP kinase pathway caused an approximately 2-fold increase in HNF4 mRNA and protein levels. It is difficult to predict how much of the fairly dramatic change in apoCIII transcriptional activity which was observed after PD98059 treatment (for example, see Fig. 2 C) is the result of this relatively small increase in HNF4 protein levels. Previously we have shown that co-transfected wild-type HNF4 can increase transcription of an apoCIII/luciferase reporter by about 5-fold (21Taylor D.G. Haubenwallner S. Leff T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results suggest that changes in HNF4 levels could at least contribute to the effect on apoCIII expression seen after PD98059 treatment. On the other hand, most of the transcriptional effect caused by increased HNF4 levels mapped to a proximal HNF4 site (designated C3P) at −86 which is distinct from the C3MK. This is in contrast to the results reported in the mapping experiments presented in Figs. 3 and 4, which demonstrate that deletion of the C3MK reduces the PD98059 response from 6–8-fold to about 2-fold. Taken together, these findings suggest that the two HNF4 sites differ in their responses to MAP kinase inhibition. The distal C3MK site responds to changes in MAP kinase activity, but the proximal C3P site does not. On the other hand, the C3P element seems to be more sensitive to changes in the quantity of HNF4 protein in the cell. Part of the impact on apoCIII transcription could be a direct result of the MAP kinase effect on the transcriptional activity of HNF4. An obvious possibility is that Erk1/2 phosphorylates HNF4 and reduces its transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation of HNF4 could modify its activity by changing its affinity for transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors. For example, phosphorylation of the AF1 domain of the estrogen receptor by MAP kinase increases its affinity for the co-activator SRC-1 (33Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that phosphorylation of HNF4 modifies its interaction with other transcription factors bound to the template. This could provide an explanation for the apparent differential response of the proximal and distal HNF4 elements to MAP kinase signaling. Previous studies have identified several transcription factors that interact with sequences near the C3MK element (20Lavrentiadou S.N. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Lavrentiadou S.N. Zannis V.I. Kardassis D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14078-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One of these proteins is ATF-2, which has been shown to be phosphorylated by MAP kinase family members (34Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence indicate that ATF-2 is not mediating the effect of MAP kinase on apoCIII transcription. The first is that phosphorylation of ATF-2 by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK/SAPK) or p38 subgroups of MAP kinase causes an increase in ATF-2-mediated transcriptional activity (34Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 35Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) rather than the decrease observed in our studies. Second, we have observed that purified ATF-2 can bind to the nonresponsive M mutation as well as to the wild-type sequence (results not shown). It is, however, possible that HNF4 interacts with ATF-2 in a phosphorylation-specific manner to contribute to the transcriptional effects of MAP kinase. What is the physiological role of MAP kinase in the regulation of apoCIII transcription? Although apoCIII expression is regulated by a variety of hormonal and metabolic signals, most of them do not signal through MAP kinase. For example, the regulation of apoCIII transcription by insulin is not dependent on the Erk1/2 MAP kinase pathway. 2T. Leff and S. Reddy, manuscript in preparation. On the other hand, we have observed regulation of apoCIII expression in the livers of animals treated with endotoxin. 3T. Leff, unpublished results. This response is probably mediated by inflammatory cytokines and could potentially be mediated by MAP kinase signals. Another possibility is that this pathway is relevant to apoCIII gene expression during liver development or regeneration. ApoCIII expression is a trait of fully differentiated hepatocytes. It has been reported that MAP kinase levels are low in the fully differentiated liver (36Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which would favor apoCIII expression. This might explain why apoCIII expression is elevated in terminally differentiated hepatocytes. A single null allele of HNF4 causes an inherited form of type II diabetes (maturity onset diabetes of the young) in the human population (27Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). This form of diabetes is characterized by an inability of the pancreas to secrete the proper amount of insulin in response to a glucose stimulus. This observation suggests that reduced levels or activity of HNF4 in the pancreas could contribute to the development of a pancreatic dysfunction and diabetes. It is therefore of great interest to know if the regulation of HNF4 activity by MAP kinase which we have observed in liver and intestinal cells also occurs in pancreatic β-cells. This issue is currently under investigation. We thank Nancy Simonson Leff and Jeanette Peevers for technical assistance and Dr. David Dudley for materials and advice."

Here we demonstrate that activation of the seven-transmembrane AT1 receptor by angiotensin II induces a physical association between Jak2 and Fyn, in vivo. This association requires the catalytic activity of Jak2 but not Fyn. Deletion studies indicate that the region of Jak2 that binds Fyn is located between amino acids 1 and 240. Studies of the Fyn SH2 and SH3 domains demonstrate that the SH2 domain plays the primary role in Jak2/Fyn association. Not surprisingly, this domain shows a marked preference for tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2. Surface plasmon resonance estimated the dissociation equilibrium constant (K d ) of this association to be 2.36 nm. Last, in vivostudies in vascular smooth muscle cells show that, in response to angiotensin II, Jak2 activation is required for Fyn activation and induction of the c-fos gene. The significance of these data is that Jak2, in addition to serving as a critical angiotensin II activated signal transduction kinase, also functions as a docking protein and participates in the activation of Fyn by providing phosphotyrosine residues that bind the SH2 domain of Fyn.

Each protein is approximately 130 kDa and contains seven conserved Jak homology domains (JH1 to JH7) (1Briscoe J. Kohlhuber F. Muller M. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The Jak kinases induce gene regulation through the signal transducers and activators of transcription. Unlike almost all other protein-tyrosine kinases, members of the Jak family bear no SH21 or SH3 domains. In contrast to the Jaks, members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases are approximately 55–62 kDa in mass and do possess SH2 and SH3 domains. There are nine known members of the Src kinase family. While the expression of most members is restricted to hematopoietic cells, Fyn and Src are widely expressed by many cell types. There appears to be some functional redundancy of these two proteins, since knockout mice lacking either gene are born alive, while disruption of both thefyn and src alleles results in embryonic lethality (3Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar, 4Inamoto A. Soriano P.

This redundancy is also seen in the activation of similar signaling pathways by Fyn and Src (6Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated various levels of cross-talk between Jak2 and other signaling pathways. For example, activation of gp130 by the hematopoietic cytokine, interleukin-11, induces protein complex formation between the Jak and Src family tyrosine kinases. Specifically, treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with interleukin-11 leads to a transient complex of Grb2, Jak2, and Fyn (7Wang X.Y. Fuhrer D.K. Marshall M.S. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27999-28002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by Yang et al. demonstrated an interleukin-11-dependent association of Jak2 with other signaling molecules including protein phosphatase 2A, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and the Src family kinase Yes (8Fuhrer D.K. Yang Y.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To date, the regions that mediate these interactions, as well as the hierarchy of the signal transduction cascades, have not been established. Angiotensin II is the effector molecule of the renin angiotensin system. It is vital for maintaining a wide variety of physiological responses including salt and water balance, blood pressure, and vascular tone. These effects are transduced through a seven-transmembrane surface receptor called AT1 (9Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Semeniuk D.J. Doan T.N. Bernstein K.E. Regul. Pept. 1998; 78: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with angiotensin II results in Jak2 autophosphorylation and activation (10Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The angiotensin II-dependent activation of Jak2 requires the intracellular amino acids 319–322 (YIPP) found in the AT1 receptor carboxyl terminus (11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II has also been shown to activate the kinase activity of Fyn and Src as measured by both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of synthetic substrates (12Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, neither the mechanism of activation nor the region of the AT1 receptor that mediates Fyn and Src activation is known. Here we investigate whether angiotensin II, acting through the AT1 receptor, can cause convergence of the Jak and Src tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades. This is an important question because angiotensin II acts through a seven-transmembrane receptor in contrast to the interleukins, which activate the cytokine superfamily of receptors. There are several differences between these receptor families. In the absence of ligand, an appreciable amount of Jak2 appears bound to the cytoplasmic tail of the cytokine receptor (14Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the extracellular surface of the cytokine receptor results in receptor aggregation and Jak2 activation. In contrast, little Jak2 co-precipitates with the AT1 receptor in the absence of angiotensin II; ligand binding appears to trigger Jak2 autophosphorylation and concurrent binding with the AT1 receptor (10Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Once bound to the AT1receptor, the catalytically active Jak2 activates the signal transducers and activators of transcription in a manner that is similar to the cytokine receptors and thus transduces signals to the nucleus (15Bhat G.J.

In this report, we demonstrate that treatment of VSMC with angiotensin II leads to a physical association of Jak2 and Fyn. More importantly, we have characterized the molecular interactions that mediate this association. Specifically, the binding of Jak2 and Fyn requires a catalytically active Jak2 molecule and is mediated by the association of a Jak2 phosphotyrosine and the SH2 domain of Fyn. The functional consequence of this interaction is that, in response to angiotensin II, a tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 serves as docking site not only for Fyn binding but for Fyn activation. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. VSMC were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and used between passages 7–22. COS-7 cells were cultured in the same medium. BSC-40 cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% newborn calf serum. 100-mm dishes of VSMC, at approximately 75% confluence, were growth-arrested by incubation in serum-free DMEM for 48 h before use. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. pBOSwtJk2 (Jak2 WT) and pBODJK2ΔVIII (Jak2 DN) were a generous gift from Dr. D. M. Wojchowski and were previously described (18Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T.

Construction of the pRC-Jak2-WT and pRC-Jak2-ATD plasmids was described elsewhere (19Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.F. Gilliland G. Jiang J. Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Construction of the GST/Jak2 fusion protein (amino acids 1–294) was also reported (21Zhao Y. Wagner F. Frank S.J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

In order to maintain equal protein expression, we used 20% more of the Jak2 DN plasmid when compared with Jak2 WT. For BSC-40 cell transfection, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transfected at near confluency with either 4 μg of pRC-Jak2-WT or 16 μg of pRC-Jak2-ATD in the presence of 20 μl of Lipofectin. For all negative controls, plates were transfected with an equal amount of empty vector. Passage three VSMC cells were transfected with 20 μg of pBODJK2ΔVIII (Jak2 DN) and 2 μg of pRC-CMV (neomycin cassette) in 20 μl of Lipofectin to generate the VSMC/Jak2 DN cell lines. Control cells were transfected with only pRC-CMV (VSMC/Neo). Stably transfected clones were generated by growing the cells for 3 weeks in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. Visible colonies were ring-cloned, yielding four independent VSMC/Neo cell lines and 17 VSMC/Jak2 DN cell lines. Expression of the Jak2 DN protein was confirmed by both Western and Northern blot analysis. For these studies, VSMC/Neo and VSMC/Jak2 DN cells were used from passages 7–17. 100-mm dishes of 70% confluent VSMC/Neo and VSMC/Jak2 DN cell lines were transfected with 10 μg of c-fos/luciferase in 20 μl of Lipofectin for 5 h. The cells were then trypsinized and seeded into six-well plates at 4.5 × 105 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight in serum-containing medium. The following morning, the cells were washed and placed into serum-free DMEM. Two days later, the cells were stimulated with angiotensin II, and luciferase activity was measured from detergent extracts in the presence of ATP and luciferin using the Reporter Lysis Buffer System (Promega) and a luminometer (Turner Designs model 20/20). We confirmed that both cell lines had a similar transfection efficiency (15%) by transfecting them with a cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein downstream of an SV40 promoter and counting cells under both fluorescent and phase contrast light. Starting luciferase values between the two cell lines were within 20% of one another and were always on the linear aspect of the detection curve. RNA was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method of extraction (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). The RNA was quantitated, and 25 μg of total RNA from each sample was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred and UV-cross-linked onto GeneScreen nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). The membranes were probed with radiolabeled cDNAs encoding either the mouse c-fos or human GAPDH genes. [32P]dCTP (>6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To prepare lysates, cells were washed with 2 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and lysed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold gentle lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm benzamidine, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, gently sonicated, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Samples were spun at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were normalized using the Dc Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Normalized lysates (∼400 μg/ml) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of antibody and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 6–16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitating anti-Fyn (FYN3) and anti-Jak2 (HR758) polyclonal antibodies and the anti-Fyn (15Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-p130 cas mAb (P27820) and anti-Tyr(P) mAb (PY20) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Immune complexes were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. For GST/Fyn pull down assays, COS-7 cell lysates were precleared with 7.5 μg of Sepharose-bound GST for 1 h at 4 °C. To each sample, 0.2 μg of soluble GST or GST/Fyn fusion protein was added along with 20 μl of a glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry and incubated for 15–20 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed four or five times with wash buffer containing 1 m NaCl and resuspended in sample buffer. All sample buffers containing proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (National Diagnostics) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Scheull). After blocking for 1 h in 5% dry milk/TBST (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) at 23 °C, nitrocellulose membranes were probed with primary antibody for 1–2 h at 23 °C in 5% milk/TBST. Blots were washed with TBST, and proteins were visualized with ECL following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blotting antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were anti-Fyn mAb (15Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-GST mAb (B14). Antibodies purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) were anti-Tyr(P) mAb (4G10) and anti-Jak2 pAb (758). Antibodies from Transduction Laboratories were anti-Fyn mAb (F19720), anti-Tyr(P) mAb (PY20), and anti-Stat1 mAb (S21120). All markers are kilodaltons. Jak2 was synthesized in vitro using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yields were estimated to be 200 ng of Jak2/50-μl reaction as determined by internal controls provided by the manufacturer. For binding assays, 0.2 μg of Sepharose-bound GST/Fyn fusion protein was combined with 7.5 μl of35S-labeled Jak2 (about 30 ng) in 1 ml of Gentle Lysis Buffer. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2–3 h, washed three times with wash buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed for 0.5 h in isopropyl alcohol/H2O/acetic acid (25:65:10), washed twice with H2O, and soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to film for 2–4 weeks at −80 °C. Jak2 was overexpressed using the vaccinia virus-mediated transfection/infection protocol (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.2.5Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-mm dishes of nearly confluent BSC-40 cells were transfected with 20 μg of pRC-Jak2-WT and 20 μl of Lipofectin. After 4 h, vTF7–3 (24Fuerst T.R. Moss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was added at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 and incubated for 1 h. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% NCS. At 18–20 h postinfection, lysates were prepared and loaded onto a Q Sepharose ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed extensively with 0.2 mNaCl, and Jak2 was eluted with 0.8 m NaCl. The sample was desalted, and proteins under 100 kDa in mass were removed by a Centricon 100 concentrator using a solution containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Purity and quantity were determined by Ponceau staining and immunoblotting the sample. Kinetic parameters for the interaction between GST/Fyn (GST/SH2 + SH3) and partially purified Jak2 were estimated by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcoreTM instrument (Biacore AB). In this study, an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Biacore) was covalently linked to CM5 research grade sensor chips using an amine coupling kit (Biacore). Briefly, carboxylate moieties on CM5 dextran surfaces were activated with a 30-μl injection of a 1:1 mixture ofN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Immediately following activation, 35 μl of 30 μg/ml of anti-GST in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5, was injected across each surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide esters were blocked with a 35-μl injection of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. This procedure typically yielded 4,000–5,000 resonance units of immobilized anti-GST. Either the fusion protein, GST/Fyn, or GST alone (as a control) was captured on anti-GST surfaces by injecting 5 μg/ml of protein in TBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mmEDTA, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, yielding an increase of 830–550 resonance units. Captured GST/Fyn and GST dissociated from immobilized anti-GST at a rate of <3.0 resonance units/min. Binding interactions were conducted by injecting either 60 μl of partially purified Jak2 (∼45 nm) in TBS buffer or TBS alone (as a control) over captured GST/Fyn or GST surfaces at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Following each Jak2 injection, anti-GST surfaces were regenerated with 10 μl of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2, followed by 10 μl of 0.05% SDS at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Sensograms representing the interaction between captured GST/Fyn and partially purified Jak2 were corrected by subtracting the response yielded by injecting partially purified Jak2 over a captured GST surface. Association (k a ) and dissociation (k d ) rate constants were determined from corrected sensograms using a global fitting routine provided by Biacore (BIAevaluation 3.0). COS-7 cells were transfected as described above to express either no Jak2, wild type Jak2, or dominant negative Jak2. Two days later, normalized lysates were prepared. To each lysate, 0.1 μg of Sepharose-bound GST/Jak2 (amino acids 1–294) or GST alone was added, and samples were incubated at 23 °C for 25–30 min. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation, and beads were washed four or five times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.2.5Google Scholar). Samples were placed in sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and Western blotted with anti-Tyr(P) mAbs. To determine if Jak2 was sufficient for Fyn activation, COS-7 cells were transfected to overexpress either no Jak2, wild type Jak2, or dominant negative Jak2. To determine if Jak2 was required for Fyn activation, COS-7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the wild type AT1 receptor cDNA (pZeo/WT) and either 2.0 μg of wild type Jak2 or 2.4 μg of dominant negative Jak2. Two days later, cells were treated as described in the figure legends, and normalized lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn pAb. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with wash buffer and twice with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The precipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of the same kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 4 μg of GAP p62 tyrosine kinase substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were incubated for 25 min at 30 °C, and reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and exposed to film. Angiotensin II, acting through the seven-transmembrane AT1 receptor, has been shown to activate Jak2 and Fyn as measured by autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of synthetic substrates (10Marrero M.B.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the AT1receptor might act mechanistically similar to the cytokine superfamily of receptors and cause association of the Jak and Src family kinases. To investigate this possibility, VSMC were stimulated with angiotensin II, and the resulting lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Fyn pAb (FYN3) that does not cross-react with other Src tyrosine kinases. The immunoprecipitates were then blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, angiotensin II induced the association of several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins with Fyn. Maximal protein association was seen at about 5 min after the addition of angiotensin II. Even at 1 h after the ligand addition, the level of associated proteins containing phosphotyrosine was substantially above base line. Jak2 is 130 kDa in mass and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to angiotensin II (10Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A demonstrated that several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in the 130-kDa size range, as well as the 68–72-kDa range, associated with Fyn in an angiotensin II-dependent manner. Equal loading of all lanes was verified by reprobing the blot with anti-Fyn mAbs (Fig.1 A). To specifically investigate if Jak2 associates with Fyn in an angiotensin II-dependent manner, we now blotted the anti-Fyn pAb immunoprecipitates with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–4). This study showed an increased association of Jak2 and Fyn as early as 1 min after the addition of angiotensin II. In multiple time course studies, the Jak2 signal returned to near basal levels 2 h after angiotensin II treatment (data not shown). The specificity of Jak2/Fyn association was confirmed by five separate approaches. First, Fig. 1 B,lanes 5–7, shows the result of preabsorbing the anti-Fyn pAb with the FYN3-immunizing peptide. As expected, the peptide competes with and prevents the immunoprecipitation of Fyn and the associated Jak2 protein. Second, Fig. 1 B, lanes 8–10, shows that if pooled rabbit IgG is substituted for the immunoprecipitating anti-Fyn antibody, neither Fyn nor Jak2 is immunoprecipitated. Third, blotting anti-Fyn pAb immunoprecipitates with an anti-Jak1 mAb did not produce a ligand-dependent association, indicating that the association between Jak2 and Fyn is specific for these two molecules (data not shown). Fourth, we switched our immunoprecipitating anti-Fyn pAb to an anti-Fyn mAb that was raised against a different region of Fyn. Like the polyclonal antibody, it does not cross-react with other Src family kinases. Western blotting of the anti-Fyn mAb immunoprecipitates with Jak2 gave results that were virtually identical to those seen with the polyclonal antibody (Fig.1 C). Finally, reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments (immunoprecipitating VSMC with anti-Jak2 pAb and blotting with anti-Fyn mAbs) produced results that were similar to those obtained using the inverse protocol (Fig. 1 D). Collectively, the data show that in VSMC, activation of the seven-transmembrane AT1 receptor by angiotensin II causes a specific in vivo association of Jak2 and Fyn. We wanted to determine whether the kinase activity of Jak2 and/or Fyn was required for this angiotensin II-mediated event. To determine this, quiescent VSMC were either pretreated with Me2SO (control), pretreated with the Jak2 kinase inhibitor AG-490 (25Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), or pretreated with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 (26Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). For this study, we used 100 μm of the Jak inhibitor AG-490, the lowest dose that in our hands fully inhibits Jak2 in cultured cells (27Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Safavi A. Lyles M. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After inhibitor treatment, cells were then left untreated or stimulated with 10−7m angiotensin II for either 5 min (Fig.2 A) or 60 min (Fig.2 B). The resulting lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn pAb and blotted with anti-Jak2 pAb. Association of Jak2 and Fyn was observed in the control cells and the PP1-treated cells. However, angiotensin II-dependent association was not seen after treatment with the Jak2 inhibitor AG-490. To rule out the possibility that the PP1 was not biologically active, in parallel experiments, we pretreated VSMC with PP1 and demonstrated that the dose and time of PP1 preincubation used in Fig. 2, A andB, could completely block the angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas, a known substrate of c-Src (28Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the data in Fig. 2 suggest that Jak2 kinase activity, but not Fyn kinase activity, is required for the angiotensin II-dependent association of Jak2 and Fyn. The data in Fig. 2 made use of pharmacologic enzyme inhibitors. As a complementary approach to investigate this question, we used a protocol employing a dominant negative Jak2 construct. Specifically, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells (a cell line with very little endogenous Jak2) with either a wild type Jak2"

The purpose of this study was to use fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor binding events in living cells between the type II regulatory subunit of PKA (RII) and the RII-binding domain of the human thyroid RII anchoring protein (Ht31), a peptide containing the PKA-binding domain of an A-kinase anchoring protein. RII was linked to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), Ht31 was linked to enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), and these constructs were coexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Upon excitation of the donor fluorophore, Ht31·ECFP, an increase in emission of the acceptor fluorophore, RII·EYFP, and a decrease in emission from Ht31·ECFP were observed. The emission ratio (acceptor/donor) was increased 2-fold (p < 0.05) in cells expressing Ht31·ECFP and RII·EYFP compared with cells expressing Ht31P·ECFP, the inactive form of Ht31, and RII·EYFP. These results provide the first in vivo demonstration of RII/Ht31 interaction in living cells and confirm previous in vitro findings of RII/Ht31 binding. Using surface plasmon resonance, we also showed that the green fluorescent protein tags did not significantly alter the binding of Ht31 to RII. Thus, fluorescence resonance energy transfer can be used to directly monitor protein-protein interactions of the PKA signaling pathway in living cells."

The linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes is associated with one molecule of a linker histone, usually histone H1. The nucleosome repeat length, the 146 bp of DNA associated with a histone octamer plus the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes, can vary with species, cell type, physiological state, and developmental stage, due to variability in the length of the linker DNA (1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar).Nucleosomes are nonrandomly placed with respect to DNA sequence in diverse biological systems (2Uvardy J. Schedl P. J. Mol.

Cell. 1986; 44: 697-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interactions between the nucleosome core octamer and signals in the nucleotide sequence are important determinants of nucleosome positioning (5Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Stein A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 54: 333-381Crossref Google Scholar). In vitro, nucleosomes are tightly bound to certain sequences, called chromatin organizing regions (7Jeong S. Lauderdale J.D. Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1131-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Lauderdale J. Stein A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6589-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that adjacent nucleosomes may then be aligned along the chromatin fiber in a regular array with reference to the chromatin organizing regions.The role of linker histones in nucleosome positioning and alignment, if any, is not well understood. Early chromatin reconstitution experiments suggested that linker histones were responsible for spacing of adjacent nucleosomes and for spreading of nucleosome alignment along the chromosome (7Jeong S. Lauderdale J.D. Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1131-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Stein A. Kunzler P. Nature. 1983; 302: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, in vivo experiments have failed to show direct correlation of changes in linker length with changes in linker histone type either in development or in artificial systems where the chromatin was challenged with novel histones (10Sun J.-M. Ali Lurz R. Ruiz-Carrillo A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Linder C. Thoma F. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A straightforward approach to determine whether linker histones are required for nucleosome positioning is to compare nucleosome positioning in a histone H1 knockout strain to that in cells with wild type histone H1. In most eukaryotes it is not possible to construct such strains because the protein is encoded by a family of repeated genes, which are often interspersed with the genes for the core histones.The ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena, contains two different nuclei, the germ line micronucleus and the transcriptionally active macronucleus. Micro- and macronuclear linker histones are encoded, respectively, by two unique genes, MLH (13Wu M. Allis C.D. Sweet M.T. Cook R.G. Thatcher T.H. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andHHO (14Wu M. Allis C.D. Richman R. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8674-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), both of which are transcribed in the macronucleus. Linker histone genes are nonessential in Tetrahymena. Strains in which the micronuclear and macronuclear linker histone genes have been knocked out, both individually and simultaneously, are viable and have normal fission rates (15Yu X. Shen L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the respective single knockout strains, the chromatin of the corresponding nucleus is visibly less condensed than in the parental strain with wild type linker histones.In Tetrahymena, the only documented example of specific nucleosome positioning is on the rDNA minichromosome (16Palen T.E. Cech T.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 933-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Budarf M.L. Blackburn E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 363-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, DNA reassociation experiments suggested that Tetrahymenanucleosomes may be positioned in relation to DNA sequences over the bulk of the Tetrahymena genome (18Pratt K. Hattman S. J. Protozool. 1983; 30: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).The experiments described here extend the analysis of nucleosome positioning in Tetrahymena by analysis of the chromatin structure over specific sequences other than the rDNA minichromosome. Indirect end labeling experiments demonstrated that nucleosomes are specifically positioned in three different regions of theTetrahymena macronuclear genome. Nucleosome repeat length appeared to vary with the particular nucleosome. No changes in nucleosome position or repeat length were detected in the absence of histone H1.DISCUSSIONCot analysis previously suggested that nucleosomes are specifically positioned relative to DNA sequence inTetrahymena (18Pratt K. Hattman S. J. Protozool. 1983; 30: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data described here support that hypothesis and show specific nucleosome positioning for three separate regions of the macronuclear genome.There appears to be considerable variability in the internucleosomal repeat length of adjacent nucleosomes in Tetrahymena. First, the bands of hybridization with the probes were sharper and had less lane background than the bands observed in the gels stained with ethidium bromide, suggesting that the variability in a particular region is less than the variability of nucleosome multimers over the genome as a whole (data not shown).Second, the degree of sharpening of the hybridizing bands after digestion with the restriction enzyme suggests there is more variation between the fragments within a band than can be accounted for by imprecision of cutting of the micrococcal nuclease within the linker DNA. (Compare Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4, and Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4.) This would be expected if the four different fragments within the tetramer, for example, had different linker lengths due to variability in the length of the linkers of adjacent nucleosomes.Measurements of DNA associated with individual nucleosomes support this interpretation. Although the nucleosome sizes determined in different experiments were quite repeatable, we measured internucleosomal distances ranging from 160 to 240 bp (Table I). In two cases, the internucleosomal distance appeared to be unusually large. In chromatin from both CU428.1 and ΔH1, there was about 350 bp of DNA between the fifth and sixth linker regions from the XbaI site in Tlr1.rB-B (Figs. 1 B and 4 A). Similarly, in blots of the cyd1 region, the distance between the last linker mapped and theHindIII site was 340 bp in both the presence and absence of histone H1 (Figs. 2 B and 4 B). These nucleosomes may have unusually long linkers or the regions may contain two closely packed nucleosomes such that the linker between them is relatively resistant to micrococcal nuclease. In any case, the data shown here do not support a model of equal spacing of nucleosomes between fixed boundaries. Instead, they indicate considerable variability in linker DNA length between adjacent nucleosomes. This may suggest that, in the absence of regulatory complexes that displace or reposition nucleosomes, the position of each individual nucleosome is determined by the most energetically favored position with respect to the associated DNA sequences (28Englander E.W. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10091-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The similarity of nucleosome positioning in strains with and without histone H1 suggests that macronuclear linker histones have a limited role, if any, in nucleosome spacing in vivo. One point to consider before reaching that conclusion is whether the micronuclear linker histones, encoded by the MLH gene, might substitute for histone H1, encoded by HHO. This is unlikely because for strains in which either the micro- or macronuclear linker histone genes have been knocked out, the chromatin decondenses only in the nucleus for which the corresponding linker histone gene has been deleted. Thus the two genes do not complement one another with respect to the chromatin condensation phenotype and, at least by this criterion, are not functionally redundant. The inability of the micro- and macronuclear linker histones to substitute for one another may be related to the fact that synthesis of the proteins is linked to DNA replication in the respective nuclei, which occurs at two different points in the cell cycle (29Wu M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2205-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Micro- and macronuclear chromatin of Tetrahymena have very different average internucleosomal repeat lengths of 175 and 202 bp, respectively (26Gorovsky M.A. Glover C. Johmann C.A. Keevert J.B. Mathis D.J. Samuelson M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1977; 42: 493-503Crossref Google Scholar). Prior to this study, that difference might have been ascribed to the very different structures of the micronuclear and macronuclear linker histones (13Wu M. Allis C.D. Sweet M.T. Cook R.G. Thatcher T.H. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu M. Allis C.D. Richman R. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although histone H1 apparently does not determine nucleosome positioning in the macronucleus, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the unusual structure of micronuclear linker histones may contribute to the more compact nucleosome spacing in the micronucleus. However, differences also exist between the core histones of the two nuclei. Most notable of these in relation to generalized chromatin structure is the fact that a substantial proportion of the micronuclear histone H3 undergoes proteolytic processing, which removes six amino acids from the amino terminus (31Allis C.D. Bowen J.K. Abraham G.N. Glover C.V.C. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1980; 20: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Analysis of the function of histone H1 in vivo has been limited by the fact that, in most organisms, histones are encoded by a family of repeated and interspersed genes. Thus it is impossible to construct gene knockout strains. An obvious candidate for this kind of analysis is the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the question of whether or not yeast chromatin has histone H1 has been a matter of some debate. No linker histone proteins have been detected in yeast, but the gene HHO1 has homology to histone H1 genes of higher eukaryotes (32Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 287-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although recombinant HHO1 gene product had properties expected for a linker histone in chromatin reconstitution experiments, the absence of the HHO1 yeast protein in a knockout strain had no effect on the average nucleosome repeat length of bulk chromatin (33Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that inTetrahymena, where the presence of histone H1 is well established, there is similarly no detectable change in nucleosome repeat length in the absence of histone H1. Thus, it appears that in both Tetrahymena and yeast linker histones play no part in nucleosome positioning. Native chromatin in eukaryotic cells is organized in nucleosomes consisting of 146 bp1 of DNA wrapped twice around an octamer of two each of the histone core proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes is associated with one molecule of a linker histone, usually histone H1. The nucleosome repeat length, the 146 bp of DNA associated with a histone octamer plus the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes, can vary with species, cell type, physiological state, and developmental stage, due to variability in the length of the linker DNA (1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Nucleosomes are nonrandomly placed with respect to DNA sequence in diverse biological systems (2Uvardy J. Schedl P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 385-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Almer A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Benezra R. Cantor C.R. Axel R. Cell. 1986; 44: 697-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interactions between the nucleosome core octamer and signals in the nucleotide sequence are important determinants of nucleosome positioning (5Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Stein A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 54: 333-381Crossref Google Scholar). In vitro, nucleosomes are tightly bound to certain sequences, called chromatin organizing regions (7Jeong S. Lauderdale J.D. Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1131-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Lauderdale J. Stein A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6589-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that adjacent nucleosomes may then be aligned along the chromatin fiber in a regular array with reference to the chromatin organizing regions. The role of linker histones in nucleosome positioning and alignment, if any, is not well understood. Early chromatin reconstitution experiments suggested that linker histones were responsible for spacing of adjacent nucleosomes and for spreading of nucleosome alignment along the chromosome (7Jeong S. Lauderdale J.D. Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1131-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Stein A. Kunzler P. Nature. 1983; 302: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, in vivo experiments have failed to show direct correlation of changes in linker length with changes in linker histone type either in development or in artificial systems where the chromatin was challenged with novel histones (10Sun J.-M. Ali Lurz R. Ruiz-Carrillo A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Linder C. Thoma F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2822-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A straightforward approach to determine whether linker histones are required for nucleosome positioning is to compare nucleosome positioning in a histone H1 knockout strain to that in cells with wild type histone H1. In most eukaryotes it is not possible to construct such strains because the protein is encoded by a family of repeated genes, which are often interspersed with the genes for the core histones. The ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena, contains two different nuclei, the germ line micronucleus and the transcriptionally active macronucleus. Micro- and macronuclear linker histones are encoded, respectively, by two unique genes, MLH (13Wu M. Allis C.D. Sweet M.T. Cook R.G. Thatcher T.H. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andHHO (14Wu M. Allis C.D. Richman R. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8674-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), both of which are transcribed in the macronucleus. Linker histone genes are nonessential in Tetrahymena. Strains in which the micronuclear and macronuclear linker histone genes have been knocked out, both individually and simultaneously, are viable and have normal fission rates (15Yu X. Shen L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the respective single knockout strains, the chromatin of the corresponding nucleus is visibly less condensed than in the parental strain with wild type linker histones. In Tetrahymena, the only documented example of specific nucleosome positioning is on the rDNA minichromosome (16Palen T.E. Cech T.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 933-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Budarf M.L. Blackburn E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 363-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, DNA reassociation experiments suggested that Tetrahymenanucleosomes may be positioned in relation to DNA sequences over the bulk of the Tetrahymena genome (18Pratt K. Hattman S. J. Protozool. 1983; 30: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The experiments described here extend the analysis of nucleosome positioning in Tetrahymena by analysis of the chromatin structure over specific sequences other than the rDNA minichromosome. Indirect end labeling experiments demonstrated that nucleosomes are specifically positioned in three different regions of theTetrahymena macronuclear genome. Nucleosome repeat length appeared to vary with the particular nucleosome. No changes in nucleosome position or repeat length were detected in the absence of histone H1. DISCUSSIONCot analysis previously suggested that nucleosomes are specifically positioned relative to DNA sequence inTetrahymena (18Pratt K. Hattman S. J. Protozool. 1983; 30: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data described here support that hypothesis and show specific nucleosome positioning for three separate regions of the macronuclear genome.There appears to be considerable variability in the internucleosomal repeat length of adjacent nucleosomes in Tetrahymena. First, the bands of hybridization with the probes were sharper and had less lane background than the bands observed in the gels stained with ethidium bromide, suggesting that the variability in a particular region is less than the variability of nucleosome multimers over the genome as a whole (data not shown).Second, the degree of sharpening of the hybridizing bands after digestion with the restriction enzyme suggests there is more variation between the fragments within a band than can be accounted for by imprecision of cutting of the micrococcal nuclease within the linker DNA. (Compare Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4, and Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4.) This would be expected if the four different fragments within the tetramer, for example, had different linker lengths due to variability in the length of the linkers of adjacent nucleosomes.Measurements of DNA associated with individual nucleosomes support this interpretation. Although the nucleosome sizes determined in different experiments were quite repeatable, we measured internucleosomal distances ranging from 160 to 240 bp (Table I). In two cases, the internucleosomal distance appeared to be unusually large. In chromatin from both CU428.1 and ΔH1, there was about 350 bp of DNA between the fifth and sixth linker regions from the XbaI site in Tlr1.rB-B (Figs. 1 B and 4 A). Similarly, in blots of the cyd1 region, the distance between the last linker mapped and theHindIII site was 340 bp in both the presence and absence of histone H1 (Figs. 2 B and 4 B). These nucleosomes may have unusually long linkers or the regions may contain two closely packed nucleosomes such that the linker between them is relatively resistant to micrococcal nuclease. In any case, the data shown here do not support a model of equal spacing of nucleosomes between fixed boundaries. Instead, they indicate considerable variability in linker DNA length between adjacent nucleosomes. This may suggest that, in the absence of regulatory complexes that displace or reposition nucleosomes, the position of each individual nucleosome is determined by the most energetically favored position with respect to the associated DNA sequences (28Englander E.W. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10091-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The similarity of nucleosome positioning in strains with and without histone H1 suggests that macronuclear linker histones have a limited role, if any, in nucleosome spacing in vivo. One point to consider before reaching that conclusion is whether the micronuclear linker histones, encoded by the MLH gene, might substitute for histone H1, encoded by HHO. This is unlikely because for strains in which either the micro- or macronuclear linker histone genes have been knocked out, the chromatin decondenses only in the nucleus for which the corresponding linker histone gene has been deleted. Thus the two genes do not complement one another with respect to the chromatin condensation phenotype and, at least by this criterion, are not functionally redundant. The inability of the micro- and macronuclear linker histones to substitute for one another may be related to the fact that synthesis of the proteins is linked to DNA replication in the respective nuclei, which occurs at two different points in the cell cycle (29Wu M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2205-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Micro- and macronuclear chromatin of Tetrahymena have very different average internucleosomal repeat lengths of 175 and 202 bp, respectively (26Gorovsky M.A. Glover C. Johmann C.A. Keevert J.B. Mathis D.J. Samuelson M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1977; 42: 493-503Crossref Google Scholar). Prior to this study, that difference might have been ascribed to the very different structures of the micronuclear and macronuclear linker histones (13Wu M. Allis C.D. Sweet M.T. Cook R.G. Thatcher T.H. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu M. Allis C.D. Richman R. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both receptor chains belong to the cytokine receptor family characterized by common sequence and structural motifs such as the WSXWS motif in the extracellular domain close to the cell membrane (7Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The initial events of ligand-induced cytokine receptor activation are not completely understood. For single chain receptors such as EpoR or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, ligand-induced receptor dimerization is believed to mediate activation of receptor associated tyrosine kinases of the JAK family (8Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 9Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). However, recent studies on the EpoR demonstrate a ligand-induced conformational change in preformed receptor complexes and suggest that dimerization or oligomerization may be necessary but not sufficient for the initiation of intracellular signal transduction (10Livnah O.

Both models for receptor activation, ligand-induced assembly of receptor chains and ligand-dependent conformational changes in preformed receptor complexes, may also be involved in the activation of heteromeric cytokine receptors such as GMR.

The initial event in intracellular signaling of cytokine receptors is believed to be the transphosphorylation and activation of members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family.

To analyze the contribution of individual receptor domains of human α-GMR and β-GMR, we previously cloned a chimeric α/β-GMR by fusion of the extracellular and transmembrane sequence of α-GMR to the intracellular part of β-GMR that we found capable of GM-CSF binding with low affinity, receptor internalization, induction of tyrosine kinase activity, and short and long term proliferation of transfected Ba/F3 cells in the absence of wild type human α-GMR and β-GMR (11Eder M.

This α/β-GMR contains an additional glutamate residue at the fusion region introduced for cloning purposes. In contrast to this construct, several groups reported on slightly different chimeric α/β-GMR and IL-5Rα/β-GMR constructs that were only functional as high affinity receptors in the presence of β-GMR (16Muto A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7404-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was concluded from these studies that the cytoplasmic domain of α-GMR, although indispensable for the function of the wild type GMR (18Weiss M. Yokoyama C. Shikama Y. Naugle C. Druker B.

However, some unique signaling capacities of α-GMR have been reported (21Doyle S.E. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 867-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Matsuguchi T. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S.

To further compare the functions mediated by the wild type GMR and the chimeric α/β-GMR and to identify potential defects due to the lack of α-GMR sequences, we now extend the characterization of α/β-GMR and demonstrate its capacity to signal for reorganization of the cellular cytoskeleton and morphological changes, for surface expression of α4- and β1-integrins, and for serine phosphorylation of Akt protein kinase at Ser-473 in a GM-CSF-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrate the essential function of a glutamate residue at a specific position at the transition of the transmembrane to the cytoplasmic region for ligand-induced receptor function, providing new insights into initial events of GMR activation. Restriction enzymes, DNA-modifying enzymes, and DNA molecular weight markers were purchased from MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania) or New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). All PCR primers were synthesized by MWG-BIOTECH (Ebersberg, Germany). Fine chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) and were of analytical or molecular biology grade. Agarose for gel electrophoresis was from Life Technologies, Inc. Cloning of the chimeric receptor α/β-GMR introducing a glutamate residue has been described (11Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A.

The murine cell line Ba/F3 was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with glutamic acid, antibiotics, 5% fetal calf serum (Biochrome), and 10% WEHI-conditioned medium for the supply of murine IL (mIL)-3. In initial experiments, recombinant mIL-3 (10 ng/ml; Sigma) was found to be as effective as 10% WEHI-CM to induce proliferation, morphological changes, and Akt phosphorylation. For transfection, 1–2 × 106 cells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 without any supplements and electroporated at 350 V and 950 microfarads in 800 μl of serum-free medium in the presence of 20 μg of expression vector encoding the respective GMR constructs, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. After 2 days, the cells were washed, split in half, and selected under two conditions in order to test the capacity of the transfected receptor variant to support GM-CSF-dependent proliferation: 1) in the presence of 20 ng/ml recombinant hGM-CSF but without mIL-3 or 2) in the presence of mIL-3 and the antibiotic G418 (Sigma) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. For analysis of mRNA expression of α/β-GMR variants, total cellular RNA was prepared from transfected cells using TRIZOL™ reagent (Life Technologies) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. cDNA was transcribed from 2.5 μg of total cellular RNA in a 50-μl reaction mix containing 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) in the appropriate buffer conditions (Stratagene), 40 units of RNase inhibitor (RNase Block, Stratagene), 1 μg of oligo(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and nucleotides at a concentration of 1 mm each (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Using the primers 5′-GGAGGACAGGACCAAAAGG (sense) and 5′-CCCCAGGCTTGTTGACC (antisense), a β-GMR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2078–2711 was amplified from 10 μl of the RT reaction in a volume of 50 μl containing 50 pmol of both sense and antisense primer, 4 μl of 10× PCR buffer, including 15 mmMgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Sigma) by 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C), annealing (55 °C), and extension (73 °C). As a control, tubulin was amplified under the same conditions using the primers 5′-TTCCCTGCCCAGCT(G/C)AANGCNGACCTNCGCAAG (sense) and 5′-CATGCCCTCGCCNGTGTACCAGTGNANGAAGGC (antisense) (where N represents any nucleotide). Surface expression of the α/β-GMR variants was analyzed using an antibody against an extracellular epitope of the human α-GMR subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; GM-CSRα S-20; 2 μg/106 cells). The cells were stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dianova). For analysis of integrin expression, specific antibodies and isotype controls were obtained from Pharmingen (integrin α4/mouse CD49d, 01270D; isotype control, 34491A; integrin β1/mouse CD29, 09351D; isotype control, 34481A). The cells were stained with an R-phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-rat IgG Fragment (1623/112-116-143; Dianova). All antibodies were used at 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Transfected Ba/F3 cells were starved overnight for mIL-3 and hGM-CSF, respectively, and restimulated with either hGM-CSF or mIL-3 for 5 min. Cellular lysates were prepared as described (11Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, stimulation was stopped by the addition of ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g, and the pellets were suspended in lysis buffer. After 15–25 min on ice, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C, 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were stored in aliquots at −80 °C or in Laemmli buffer at −20 °C. The protein concentrations were quantitated using Bio-Rad reagents, and equal amounts of cellular proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Akt phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 (PhosphoPlus® Akt(Ser473) Antibody Kit, New England Biolabs). As a loading control, the same lysates were processed simultaneously and probed with a phosphorylation-independent anti-Akt antibody supplied with the kit. Transfected Ba/F3 cells were studied for GM-CSF binding as described (11Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 7.5 × 105 cells were incubated for 60 min on ice with125I-labeled GM-CSF (NEN Life Science Products) at different concentrations between 0.04 and 6.42 nm in the presence or absence of unlabeled GM-CSF (1 μm). However, in repeated experiments, saturation could not be reached under the conditions tested even if undiluted 125I-GM-CSF was added to the cell samples. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged, resuspended, and layered over a cushion of 0.7 ml of fetal calf serum. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the radioactivity was measured in a Berthold MAG 315 γ-counter. Untransformed specific binding data were analyzed by Scatchard plot assuming a single class of binding sites. K D andB max represent the equilibrium dissociation constant and the density of the binding sites per cell, respectively. GM-CSF-dependent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells was assayed using the CyQUANT® Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 105 cells per 200 μl in the absence or presence of hGM-CSF ranging from 1 pg/ml to 1 μg/ml. After 48–72 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed in the buffer provided with the kit, and stained with the CyQUANT GR dye for 5 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was quantitated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (540 nm). Predictions of protein structure were done using the SEMAP program, 2C. Urbanke, personal communication. utilizing the parameters of Chou and Fasman (24Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) and Kyte and Doolittle (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) to predict averaged secondary structure and hydrophobicity in protein chains, respectively. For the analysis discussed in this paper, a range of 4 amino acids was used for the averaged prediction. In order to compare the functional capacities of the wild type α + β GMR and the chimeric α/β-GMR and to identify potential defects due to the lack of α-GMR sequences in the chimeric receptor, we expressed α-GMR together with β-GMR or α/β-GMR alone in the murine IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3. This cell line expresses the murine IL-3 receptor including the murine common β-chain but does not respond to murine GM-CSF, mIL-5, or hGM-CSF. Since human receptors for GM-CSF lack cross-reactivity to murine cytokines, their function can easily be analyzed after expression in these cells. Growth factor-induced changes in cell morphology of Ba/F3 cells were studied by phase-contrast microscopy every 10 min after starvation and restimulation with mIL-3 and hGM-CSF, respectively. When untransfected, wild type α + β-GMR- or chimeric α/β-GMR-expressing Ba/F3 cells were starved for growth factor overnight, all cells in culture were of a circular shape the next morning. However, 1 h after restimulation with mIL-3 or hGM-CSF for GMR-expressing cells, symmetric and asymmetric cylindric cells with motile protrusions and cells of unregular, biconcave shape were present, which increased in frequency to up to 50% within 6 h. In wild type α + β-GMR- and in chimeric α/β-GMR-expressing cells, the effects of GM-CSF were more modest as compared with mIL-3 in some experiments. The mIL-3- or hGM-CSF-induced changes in cell morphology could be delayed by preincubation with the PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin and severely diminished or completely blocked by the repeated addition of wortmannin every 60 min without any loss of cell viability (TableI (top) and data not shown).Table IMorphological changes of Ba/F3 cells in response to growth factorIL-3WoUntransfected Ba/F3 cells1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h−−ooooo+−(+)+++++++++++ (single dose)(+)(+)(+)++++++ (repeatedly)(+)(+)(+)(+)(+)TransfectantIL-3/GMWoTransfected Ba/F3 cells1 h2 h3 hα/β-GMRIL-3−(+)+++++α/β-GMRIL-3+ (rep.)o(+)+α/β-GMRGM−(+)(+)++α/β-GMRGM+ (rep.)o(+)(+)α-GMR + β-GMRIL-3−(+)++++α-GMR + β-GMRGM−(+)(+)+Untransfected Ba/F3 cells (top) and transfected Ba/F3 cells (bottom) were starved overnight and restimulated the next morning with either 10% WEHI supernatant as a source of murine IL-3 (mIL-3) or with hGM-CSF (GM; 20 ng/ml). Wortmannin (Wo; 20 nm final concentration) was given 45 min prior to growth factor stimulation and at the time of stimulation alone (single dose) or every hour (repeated treatment; rep.). Thereafter, each sample was evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h for the presence of cells with marked morphological alterations as indicated: o, 0%; (+), >0–5%; +, 5–10%; ++, 10–25%; +++, 25–40%; ++++, >40% of the cells deviating from round shape.

One representative experiment is documented. In previous studies, the ability of Ba/F3 cells to adhere to fibronectin has been used to monitor functional activity of these cells (26Okuda K. Smith L. Griffin J.D. Foster R. Blood. 1997; 90: 4759-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since we noted adhesion of α/β-GMR-expressing Ba/F3 cells to fibronectin, but not to collagen or gelatin, after stimulation with mIL-3 or hGM-CSF in a Ca2+-dependent manner in preliminary experiments, the surface expression of murine α4- and β1-integrin subunits was studied by FACS analysis. When untransfected Ba/F3 cells were starved and restimulated with mIL-3, a slight but reproducible up-regulation of α4- and β1-integrin subunits at the cell surface was first detectable after 1 h and increased further during a time course of 3–6 h (data not shown). Similarly, in α/β-GMR-expressing Ba/F3 cells stimulated for 4 h with either mIL-3 or hGM-CSF, a small but reproducible up-regulation of α4- and more distinct β1-integrin expression was detected in several independent clones of α/β-GMR-transfected cells (Fig. 1). hGM-CSF induced up-regulation of integrin subunits to the same extent as mIL-3. The phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt at the regulatory position, Ser-473, was analyzed in untransfected, wild type α-GMR-, wild type α + β-GMR-, or chimeric α/β-GMR-expressing Ba/F3 cells. Cells were starved overnight and restimulated the next morning with either mIL-3 or hGM-CSF. Akt phosphorylation was analyzed in cellular lysates by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody specific for Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473. Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 is undetectable in untransfected Ba/F3 cells after overnight starvation but is clearly found after 5 min of stimulation with mIL-3 (Fig.2 A). As expected, untransfected cells do not respond to hGM-CSF. In contrast, both wild type α + β-GMR- and α/β-GMR-transfected Ba/F3 cells display Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 in response to both mIL-3 and hGM-CSF. The extent of Akt phosphorylation seems to be lower after stimulation with hGM-CSF as compared with mIL-3 in these experiments. When the cells were pretreated with wortmannin, the level of Akt phosphorylation was considerably lowered (Fig. 2 B). Notably, in Ba/F3 transfectants expressing α-GMR alone, GM-CSF did not induce detectable phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. In contrast to chimeric constructs composed of sequences from α-GMR and β-GMR reported by others (16Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), α/β-GMR is capable of GM-CSF-dependent signal transduction as a low affinity GMR in the absence of β-GMR. We therefore analyzed the function of the additional glutamate residue introduced at the fusion region of the transmembrane α-GMR sequence to the cytoplasmic sequence of β-GMR by generation of the following point mutations using site-directed mutagenesis (Table II): deletion of the additional glutamate residue (α/β-GMR-ΔGlu); replacement with glutamine (α/β-GMR-Gln) or glycine (α/β-GMR-Gly), respectively; and positioning of the glutamate residue by 1 (α/β-GMR-Glu(−1)) or 14 amino acids (α/β-GMR-Glu(−14)) to the N terminus, respectively. α/β-GMR-Glu(−14) was generated in analogy to a transforming β-GMR mutant V449E (27Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea A.D. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). α/β-GMR and all variants were transfected into Ba/F3 cells, and clones were selected either in hGM-CSF or with G418 in the presence of mIL-3. Whereas Ba/F3 cells transfected with the α/β-GMR cDNA could be grown in the presence of hGM-CSF as reported earlier (11Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only drug-resistant and mIL-3-dependent clones could be selected for all α/β-GMR mutants (up to three independent experiments per mutant; data not shown). Expression of the receptor cDNA was confirmed on the mRNA level by RT-PCR, and surface expression was studied by FACS analysis (Fig. 3). While α/β-GMR and α/β-GMR-ΔGlu were expressed at comparable levels, surface expression of α/β-GMR-Gln, α/β-GMR-Gly, and α/β-GMR-Glu(−14) was more modest. Surface expression of α/β-GMR-Glu(−1) could not be detected by FACS analysis in eight independent RT-PCR positive clones. Nevertheless, the variant turned out to be functionally expressed as confirmed by cotransfection of wild type β-GMR (see below). To analyze GM-CSF binding by α/β-GMR mutants with comparable receptor expression as determined by FACS analysis, the equilibrium binding characteristics of the clones α/β-GMR and of α/β-GMR-ΔGlu were studied. The estimated values for K D were 1.5 and 1.2 nm, and the receptor numbers per cell were 4700 and 2000 for α/β-GMR- and α/β-GMR-ΔGlu-expressing cells, respectively, as derived from Scatchard plot analysis. We also performed iterative fitting by least square regression and obtained comparable values (data not s"
