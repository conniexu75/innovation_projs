https://openalex.org/W2797282777,"Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibits a broad range of metastatic phenotypes that have not been systematically studied to date. Here, we analyzed 575 primary and 335 metastatic biopsies across 100 patients with metastatic ccRCC, including two cases sampledat post-mortem. Metastatic competence was afforded by chromosome complexity, and we identify 9p loss as a highly selected event driving metastasis and ccRCC-related mortality (p = 0.0014). Distinct patterns of metastatic dissemination were observed, including rapid progression to multiple tissue sites seeded by primary tumors of monoclonal structure. By contrast, we observed attenuated progression in cases characterized by high primary tumor heterogeneity, with metastatic competence acquired gradually and initial progression to solitary metastasis. Finally, we observed early divergence of primitive ancestral clones and protracted latency of up to two decades as a feature of pancreatic metastases."

We analyzed 1,206 primary tumor regions from 101 patients recruited into the multi-center prospective study, TRACERx Renal. We observe up to 30 driver events per tumor and show that subclonal diversification is associated with known prognostic parameters. By resolving the patterns of driver event ordering, co-occurrence, and mutual exclusivity at clone level, we show the deterministic nature of clonal evolution. ccRCC can be grouped into seven evolutionary subtypes, ranging from tumors characterized by early fixation of multiple mutational and copy number drivers and rapid metastases to highly branched tumors with >10 subclonal drivers and extensive parallel evolution associated with attenuated progression. We identify genetic diversity and chromosomal complexity as determinants of patient outcome. Our insights reconcile the variable clinical behavior of ccRCC and suggest evolutionary potential as a biomarker for both intervention and surveillance.

Our insights reconcile the variable clinical behavior of ccRCC and suggest evolutionary potential as a biomarker for both intervention and surveillance. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the 7th most frequently diagnosed malignancy (Znaor et al., 2015Znaor A. Lortet-Tieulent J. Laversanne M. Jemal A. Bray F. International variations and trends in renal cell carcinoma incidence and mortality.Eur. Urol. 2015; 67: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), with a rising incidence in the developed world (Smittenaar et al., 2016Smittenaar C.R. Petersen K.A. Stewart K. Moitt N. Cancer incidence and mortality projections in the UK until 2035.Br. J. Cancer. 2016; 115: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The most common histological subtype, clear cell (ccRCC), is associated with a wide range of clinical outcomes. Around one-third of patients with localized ccRCC relapse following surgery, with tumor size, grade, and necrosis (Leibovich et al., 2003Leibovich B.C. Blute M.L. Cheville J.C. Lohse C.M. Frank I. Kwon E.D. Weaver A.L. Parker A.S. Zincke H.

Costello B.A. A novel prognostic model for patients with sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma.BJU Int. 2015; 115: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) shown to impact the risk of recurrence. While these parameters are useful for patient counselling and stratification for follow-up and adjuvant studies, their predictive accuracy is inexact. Solitary metastasis at relapse may be amenable to surgery (metastasectomy) or local therapy (e.g., ablation) on a case-by-case basis (Bex et al., 2016Bex A. Ljungberg B. van Poppel H. Powles T.

Urol. 2016; 70: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Patients relapsing with multiple but low volume, slow-growing metastases could be observed initially, but the risk of deferring systemic therapy remains unclear (Rini et al., 2016Rini B.I. Dorff T.B. Elson P. Rodriguez C.S. Shepard D. Wood L. Humbert J. Pyle L. Wong Y.N. Finke J.H. et al.Active surveillance in metastatic renal-cell carcinoma: a prospective, phase 2 trial.Lancet Oncol. 2016; 17: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Up to 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the outset. In select cases, primary surgery is still used with cytoreductive intent; while some patients will also undergo a complete metastasectomy with curative intent. Patient selection for these interventions remains under intense debate, as does the management of small renal masses (SRMs) (renal lesions <4 cm in size). Increasing use of abdominal cross-sectional imaging has led to incidental discovery of SRMs, the majority of which have favorable natural history, leading to concerns about over-treatment (Welch et al., 2017Welch H.G. Skinner J.S. Schroeck F.R. Zhou W. Black W.C. Regional variation of computed tomographic imaging in the United States and the risk of nephrectomy.JAMA Intern. Med. 2017; 178: 221-227Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At present, molecular profiling does not impact decision-making in any of these clinical scenarios. The molecular landscape of ccRCC was elucidated by a number of next-generation sequencing studies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 499: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, Dalgliesh et al., 2010Dalgliesh G.L.

Recurrent arm level or focal losses are observed on chromosomes 1p, 3p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 14q, and gains on chromosomes 1q, 2q, 5q, 7q, 8q, 12p, and 20q (Beroukhim et al., 2009Beroukhim R.

We previously reported significant mutational and somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in ten cases of advanced ccRCC (Gerlinger et al., 2014Gerlinger M. Horswell S.

To aid an evolutionary classification of RCC, we established a multi-center prospective longitudinal cohort study, Tracking Renal Cell Cancer Evolution through therapy (TRACERx Renal, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03226886), with a protocol-specified endpoint of examining the association of ITH with disease stage and clinical outcomes through multi-region genomic profiling of primary tumors (Turajlic and Swanton, 2017Turajlic S. Swanton C. TRACERx Renal: tracking renal cancer evolution through therapy.Nat. Rev. Urol. 2017; 14: 575-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The TRACERx Renal program began recruitment in July 2012, enrolling patients undergoing nephrectomy (with curative or cytoreductive intent) for suspected or confirmed renal cell carcinoma (STAR Methods), with a target accrual of 320 patients with ccRCC. We report our interim findings of the patterns of ITH, clonal evolution, and tumor progression in the first 101 patients with the diagnosis of clear cell non-familial RCC (for full inclusion criteria for this cohort see STAR Methods). Clinical annotation of the 101 patients under study is provided in Table S1. Demographic and stage distribution were consistent with the referral patterns of the participating centers. All the samples were profiled using a bespoke sequencing panel targeting ∼110 putative ccRCC driver genes (Figure S1A and STAR Methods, Driver Panel). This approach enabled us to maximize the sequencing depth, a critical factor for correctly inferring evolutionary trajectories (Noorbakhsh and Chuang, 2017Noorbakhsh J. Chuang J.H. Uncertainties in tumor allele frequencies limit power to infer evolutionary pressures.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 1288-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), dinucleotides variants (DNVs), small insertion and deletions (INDELs), and SCNAs were successfully derived from 1,206 tumor regions across 106 primary tumors (median 7 [range, 3–75] regions per tumor) from 101 patients, as five patients donated pairs of primary tumors. Within the same cohort, 107 regions from 17 tumors were profiled by whole exome sequencing (WES), 81 regions from 27 tumors by whole genome sequencing (WGS), with six further tumors from the broader TRACERx Renal cohort also profiled by WGS (Figure S1B). Median sequencing coverage across 1,206 tumor regions profiled by the Driver Panel was 612× (range, 105–1,520×). We identified a total of 740 somatic mutations including 538 SNVs (440 non-synonymous SNVs), 7 DNVs, and 195 INDELs (Table S2). We specifically considered non-silent mutations in high-confidence ccRCC driver genes (termed “driver mutations,” annotated in Figure 1A; STAR Methods). The median number of driver mutations was 3, range 0–15 per tumor (Figure 1A). VHL mutations were the only consistently clonal event, present in 77/106 tumors (Figure 1A). VHL was methylated in 17 additional tumors (Figure 1A and Data S1). One tumor harbored a clonal mutation in the TCEB1 gene, a part of the VHL complex (Hakimi et al., 2015Hakimi A.A. Tickoo S.K. Jacobsen A. Sarungbam J. Sfakianos J.P. Sato Y. Morikawa T. Kume H. Fukayama M. Homma Y. et al.TCEB1-mutated renal cell carcinoma: a distinct genomic and morphological subtype.Mod. Pathol. 2015; 28: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A), thus 90% (95/106) of the tumors harbored clonal disruption of the VHL pathway. 4/11 VHL wild type tumors (K206, K228, K427, and K446) (Figure 1A) had evidence of sarcomatoid differentiation (Table S1), a feature reported to be associated with a lower frequency of VHL mutations (Malouf et al., 2016Malouf G.G. Ali S.M. Wang K. Balasubramanian S. Ross J.S. Miller V.A. Stephens P.J. Khayat D. Pal S.K.

Cancer Res. 2017; 23: 6686-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). K255, another VHL wild-type tumor, had evidence of both clear cell and papillary histology, and we observed SCNAs specific to both subtypes, including gains of 5q and 16 (Data S2). We observed no mutations in the known ccRCC driver genes in K110 (Figure 1A), and the copy number profile, involving whole chromosome losses on 1, 6, 10, and 17, was consistent with chromophobe RCC (Davis et al., 2014Davis C.F.

Additional pathology review confirmed chromophobe histology, and K110 was removed from all subsequent analyses. The overall frequency of driver mutations was higher in our cohort compared to the published single biopsy studies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 499: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, Sato et al., 2013Sato Y.

Genet. 2013; 45: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar studies, potentially due to the higher overall number of VHL INDELs called (Figure 1B). VHL INDELS in the TRACERx Renal cohort were all confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Data S1). The higher frequency of mutations in other driver genes was due to the detection of subclonal events through multi-region profiling in our cohort (Figure 1B). An important goal of the TRACERx Renal study is to determine the contribution of SCNAs to clonal evolution. In ccRCC, recurrent SCNAs occur at a limited number of genomic sites (Beroukhim et al., 2009Beroukhim R. Brunet J.P. Di Napoli A. Mertz K.D. Seeley A. Pires M.M. Linhart D. Worrell R.A. Moch H. Rubin M.A. et al.Patterns of gene expression and copy-number alterations in von-hippel lindau disease-associated and sporadic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4674-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 499: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar), usually as whole chromosome or chromosome arm events, and the rate of genome doubling is low (Zack et al., 2013Zack T.I. Schumacher S.E. Carter S.L. Cherniack A.D. Saksena G. Tabak B. Lawrence M.S. Zhsng C.Z. Wala J. Mermel C.H. et al.Pan-cancer patterns of somatic copy number alteration.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Therefore, recurrent SCNAs can be reliably detected by the Driver Panel, as shown by the high level of concordance with WGS results (Table S2). We measured the fraction of the tumor genome affected by SCNAs using the weighted genome instability index (wGII) (Endesfelder et al., 2014Endesfelder D. Burrell R. Kanu N. McGranahan N. Howell M. Parker P.J. Downward J. Swanton C. Kschischo M. Chromosomal instability selects gene copy-number variants encoding core regulators of proliferation in ER+ breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 4853-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), taking the maximum observed wGII score across all regions per tumor. Maximum values were utilized in order to capture the potential highest risk, and hence most clinically relevant, subclones in each tumor (STAR Methods). Median wGII in the TRACERx Renal cohort was 32.8% (range, 4.7%–97.4%). All SCNAs were annotated using previously defined cytobands (Beroukhim et al., 2009Beroukhim R. Brunet J.P. Di Napoli A. Mertz K.D. Seeley A. Pires M.M. Linhart D. Worrell R.A. Moch H. Rubin M.A. et al.Patterns of gene expression and copy-number alterations in von-hippel lindau disease-associated and sporadic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4674-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) to quantify driver SCNAs (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). In total, we detected 751 driver SCNAs; median 7, range 1–14 per tumor (Figure 1A). Loss of chromosome 3p, which is pathognomonic with ccRCC and encompasses four commonly mutated genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, and BAP1), was observed in all but five tumors (K021, K375, K354, K255, K114R) (Figure 1A). Of the five, three tumors had clonal 3p copy neutral allelic imbalance (CNAI) (STAR Methods) (K021, K375, K354) (Data S3), one was a mixture of clear cell and papillary histology with no mutations in 3p genes (K255; Figure 1A), and one harbored a mutation in TCEB1 with 8q loss (K114R; Figure 1A). 3p loss was subclonal in five tumors: one harboring a VHL mutation (K252) (Figure 1A), one VHL methylation (K070) (Figure 1A), one tumor that was VHL wild-type but SETD2 muttant (K427) (Figure 1A), and two with no mutations in any of the 3p genes (K169, K446) (Figure 1A). The overall frequency of driver SCNAs was higher compared to the published single biopsy studies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 499: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, Sato et al., 2013Sato Y.

Egevad L. Jackson S.M. et al.Variation in genomic landscape of clear cell renal cell carcinoma across Europe.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) due to the detection of subclonal SCNAs in our cohort (Figure 1C). Notably, the frequency of SCNAs with reported prognostic significance, such as loss of chromosomes 14q and 9p and gain of chromosomes 8q and 12p, is markedly underestimated in single biopsy studies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 499: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). Overall ITH was measured as an index (ITH index = # subclonal drivers/# clonal drivers, where “drivers” include all driver mutations and driver SCNAs shown in Figure 1A) (STAR Methods). Median ITH index value was 1, with a high variability across the cohort (range, 0–13.5; SD = 2.16). ccRCC prognostic variables include primary tumor size, overall tumor stage (TNM), Fuhrman grade, and the presence of necrosis. Overall, the number of driver events was significantly associated with all of these parameters, with the associations specific to subclonal, and not clonal events (Data S4). Similarly, higher ITH index values were associated with advanced tumor size, stage, and grade (Data S4). Clonal ordering techniques (see STAR Methods) were used to infer clonal structures and driver phylogenetic trees (Figure 2). The median number of clones detected was 4 per tumor (range, 1–23). Clone number increased with tumor stage and grade (Data S4), but showed a non-linear association with tumor size, initially increasing in line with tumor dimensions but then plateauing at ∼10 cm beyond which clone number began to marginally reduce with increasing size (Data S4). In conclusion, known prognostic parameters are associated with an increasing repertoire of driver alterations and subclonal driver diversification in ccRCC. We profiled three patients with synchronous bilateral ccRCCs and two patients with multifocal ccRCCs, with no family history of ccRCC, or germline mutations in the known ccRCC predisposition genes (Table S1). All five tumor pairs evolved independently, but converged on the VHL pathway. K265, K352, and K334 harbored distinct mutations in VHL and 3p loss events in each of the tumors (Figure 1A and Data S3). The right-sided K097 tumor harbored a VHL mutation and VHL was methylated in the left tumor (Figures 1A and Data S1). Left K114 tumor harbored a VHL mutation and 3p loss, while in the right tumor we detected a clonal TCEB1 mutation with the loss of 8q21.11, encompassing the TCEB1 locus (Figure 1A). K150 tumor was presumed to be a contralateral renal metastasis from a previously resected left high-risk ccRCC. However, the two tumors had distinct VHL mutations (Data S1) implying a case of bilateral metachronous ccRCCs. Our findings illustrate the importance of molecular profiling of patients presenting with multiple renal tumors to guide appropriate clinical management. We and others have reported parallel evolution of mutations in the same genes or pathways within distinct tumor subclones in ccRCCs (Brastianos et al., 2015Brastianos P.K. Carter S.L. Santagata S.

In the TRACERx Renal cohort, 13% of untreated primary tumors had evidence of parallel evolution, with SETD2, BAP1, and PTEN (all p < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.1) (Figure 3) significantly enriched for parallel evolution, corrected for the number of profiled regions. Certain tumors were notable for the number of parallel events they harbored (e.g., K243 had 10 distinct SETD2 mutations) (Figure 3). In tumor K448, we observed 5 distinct BAP1 mutations and 3 SETD2 mutations, but BAP1 and SETD2 mutations never co-occurred within the same clone. We recently identified parallel evolution of SCNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017Jamal-Hanjani M. Wilson G.A. McGranahan N. Birkbak N.J. Watkins T.B.K. Veeriah S. Shafi S.

We analyzed the incidence of MSAI in a subset of TRACERx Renal patients where whole genome or exome sequencing data were available (n = 41) (STAR Methods) and observed MSAI events in 15/41 tumors (Data S3; STAR Methods), a subset of which were validated by an orthogonal method (Data S3). Parallel loss of chromosome 14q was the most common event (4 patients) (Data S3), encompassing the ccRCC tumor suppressor HIF1A locus (Shen et al., 2011Shen C. Beroukhim R. Schumacher S.E. Zhou J.

https://openalex.org/W2797702016,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by near-universal loss of the short arm of chromosome 3, deleting several tumor suppressor genes. We analyzed whole genomes from 95 biopsies across 33 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We find hotspots of point mutations in the 5' UTR of TERT, targeting a MYC-MAX-MAD1 repressor associated with telomere lengthening. The most common structural abnormality generates simultaneous 3p loss and 5q gain (36% patients), typically through chromothripsis. This event occurs in childhood or adolescence, generally as the initiating event that precedes emergence of the tumor's most recent common ancestor by years to decades. Similar genomic changes drive inherited ccRCC. Modeling differences in age incidence between inherited and sporadic cancers suggests that the number of cells with 3p loss capable of initiating sporadic tumors is no more than a few hundred. Early development of ccRCC follows well-defined evolutionary trajectories, offering opportunity for early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2798183676,"Repair of damaged DNA is essential for maintaining genome integrity and for preventing genome-instability-associated diseases, such as cancer. By combining proximity labeling with quantitative mass spectrometry, we generated high-resolution interaction neighborhood maps of the endogenously expressed DNA repair factors 53BP1, BRCA1, and MDC1. Our spatially resolved interaction maps reveal rich network intricacies, identify shared and bait-specific interaction modules, and implicate previously concealed regulators in this process. We identified a novel vertebrate-specific protein complex, shieldin, comprising REV7 plus three previously uncharacterized proteins, RINN1 (CTC-534A2.2), RINN2 (FAM35A), and RINN3 (C20ORF196). Recruitment of shieldin to DSBs, via the ATM-RNF8-RNF168-53BP1-RIF1 axis, promotes NHEJ-dependent repair of intrachromosomal breaks, immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR), and fusion of unprotected telomeres. Shieldin functions as a downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 in restraining DNA end resection and in sensitizing BRCA1-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors. These findings have implications for understanding cancer-associated PARPi resistance and the evolution of antibody CSR in higher vertebrates."

Differences in the 3′ UTRs of mRNAs can change their localization, stability, and translational regulation. Using 3′ end RNA sequencing of microdissected rat brain slices, we discovered a huge diversity in mRNA 3′ UTRs, with many transcripts showing enrichment for a particular 3′ UTR isoform in either somata or the neuropil. The 3′ UTR isoforms of localized transcripts are significantly longer than the 3′ UTRs of non-localized transcripts and often code for proteins associated with axons, dendrites, and synapses. Surprisingly, long 3′ UTRs add not only new, but also duplicate regulatory elements. The neuropil-enriched 3′ UTR isoforms have significantly longer half-lives than somata-enriched isoforms. Finally, the 3′ UTR isoforms can be significantly altered by enhanced activity. Most of the 3′ UTR plasticity is transcription dependent, but intriguing examples of changes that are consistent with altered stability, trafficking between compartments, or local “remodeling” remain."
https://openalex.org/W2415438529,"Cortical computation arises from the interaction of multiple neuronal types, including pyramidal (Pyr) cells and interneurons expressing Sst, Vip, or Pvalb. To study the circuit underlying such interactions, we imaged these four types of cells in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Our recordings in darkness were consistent with a ""disinhibitory"" model in which locomotion activates Vip cells, thus inhibiting Sst cells and disinhibiting Pyr cells. However, the disinhibitory model failed when visual stimuli were present: locomotion increased Sst cell responses to large stimuli and Vip cell responses to small stimuli. A recurrent network model successfully predicted each cell type's activity from the measured activity of other types. Capturing the effects of locomotion, however, required allowing it to increase feedforward synaptic weights and modulate recurrent weights. This network model summarizes interneuron interactions and suggests that locomotion may alter cortical computation by changing effective synaptic connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2796794885,"Background The length of stay (LOS) is an important indicator of the efficiency of hospital management. Reduction in the number of inpatient days results in decreased risk of infection and medication side effects, improvement in the quality of treatment, and increased hospital profit with more efficient bed management. The purpose of this study was to determine which factors are associated with length of hospital stay, based on electronic health records, in order to manage hospital stay more efficiently. Materials and methods Research subjects were retrieved from a database of patients admitted to a tertiary general university hospital in South Korea between January and December 2013. Patients were analyzed according to the following three categories: descriptive and exploratory analysis, process pattern analysis using process mining techniques, and statistical analysis and prediction of LOS. Results Overall, 55% (25,228) of inpatients were discharged within 4 days. The department of rehabilitation medicine (RH) had the highest average LOS at 15.9 days. Of all the conditions diagnosed over 250 times, diagnoses of I63.8 (cerebral infarction, middle cerebral artery), I63.9 (infarction of middle cerebral artery territory) and I21.9 (myocardial infarction) were associated with the longest average hospital stay and high standard deviation. Patients with these conditions were also more likely to be transferred to the RH department for rehabilitation. A range of variables, such as transfer, discharge delay time, operation frequency, frequency of diagnosis, severity, bed grade, and insurance type was significantly correlated with the LOS. Conclusions Accurate understanding of the factors associating with the LOS and progressive improvements in processing and monitoring may allow more efficient management of the LOS of inpatients."
https://openalex.org/W2896106757,"Background Most evidence of the association between maternal depression and children’s development is limited by being cross-sectional. To date, few studies have modelled trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms from pregnancy through the early postpartum years and examined their association with social emotional and behavior functioning in preschool children. The objectives of this study were to: 1) identify distinct groups of women defined by their trajectories of depressive symptoms across four time points from mid-pregnancy to one year postpartum; and 2) examine the associations between these trajectories and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Methods We analyzed data from the All Our Families (AOF) study, a large, population based pregnancy cohort of mother-child dyads in Alberta, Canada. The AOF study is an ongoing pregnancy cohort study designed to investigate relationships between the prenatal and early life period and outcomes for children and mothers. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Children’s behavioral functioning at age 3 was assessed using the Behavior Scales developed for the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. Longitudinal latent class analysis was conducted to identify trajectories of women’s depressive symptoms across four time points from pregnancy to 1 year postpartum. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms and children’s behavior, while adjusting for other significant maternal, child and psychosocial factors. Results 1983 participants met eligibility criteria. We identified four distinct trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms: low level (64.7%); early postpartum (10.9%); subclinical (18.8%); and persistent high (5.6%). In multivariable models, the proportion of children with elevated behavior symptoms was highest for children whose mothers had persistent high depressive symptoms, followed by mothers with moderate symptoms (early postpartum and subclinical trajectories) and lowest for minimal symptoms. After accounting for demographic, child and psychosocial factors, the relationships between depression trajectories and child hyperactivity/inattention, physical aggression (subclinical trajectory only) and separation anxiety symptoms remained significant. Conclusion These findings suggest both externalizing and internalizing children’s behaviors are associated with prolonged maternal depressive symptoms. There is a good case for the need to move beyond overly simplistic clinical cutoff approaches of depressed/not depressed in screening for perinatal depression. Women with elevated depressive symptoms at clinical and subclinical levels need to be identified, provided with evidence-based treatment, and monitored with repeat screening to improve maternal mental health outcomes and reduce the risk of associated negative outcomes on children’s early social-emotional and behavior development."
https://openalex.org/W2797624406,"Amino-acids positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly used in the diagnostic workup of patients with gliomas, including differential diagnosis, evaluation of tumor extension, treatment planning and follow-up. Recently, progresses of computer vision and machine learning have been translated for medical imaging. Aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET lesion detection and segmentation relying on a full 3D U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).All dynamic 18F-FET PET brain image volumes were temporally realigned to the first dynamic acquisition, coregistered and spatially normalized onto the Montreal Neurological Institute template. Ground truth segmentations were obtained using manual delineation and thresholding (1.3 x background). The volumetric CNN was implemented based on a modified Keras implementation of a U-Net library with 3 layers for the encoding and decoding paths. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as an accuracy measure of segmentation.Thirty-seven patients were included (26 [70%] in the training set and 11 [30%] in the validation set). All 11 lesions were accurately detected with no false positive, resulting in a sensitivity and a specificity for the detection at the tumor level of 100%. After 150 epochs, DSC reached 0.7924 in the training set and 0.7911 in the validation set. After morphological dilatation and fixed thresholding of the predicted U-Net mask a substantial improvement of the DSC to 0.8231 (+ 4.1%) was noted. At the voxel level, this segmentation led to a 0.88 sensitivity [95% CI, 87.1 to, 88.2%] a 0.99 specificity [99.9 to 99.9%], a 0.78 positive predictive value: [76.9 to 78.3%], and a 0.99 negative predictive value [99.9 to 99.9%].With relatively high performance, it was proposed the first full 3D automated procedure for segmentation of 18F-FET PET brain images of patients with different gliomas using a U-Net CNN architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2796531277,"CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade is clinically effective in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma. We identify a subcluster of MAGE-A cancer-germline antigens, located within a narrow 75 kb region of chromosome Xq28, that predicts resistance uniquely to blockade of CTLA-4, but not PD-1. We validate this gene expression signature in an independent anti-CTLA-4-treated cohort and show its specificity to the CTLA-4 pathway with two independent anti-PD-1-treated cohorts. Autophagy, a process critical for optimal anti-cancer immunity, has previously been shown to be suppressed by the MAGE-TRIM28 ubiquitin ligase in vitro. We now show that the expression of the key autophagosome component LC3B and other activators of autophagy are negatively associated with MAGE-A protein levels in human melanomas, including samples from patients with resistance to CTLA-4 blockade. Our findings implicate autophagy suppression in resistance to CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma, suggesting exploitation of autophagy induction for potential therapeutic synergy with CTLA-4 inhibitors."

A previous study showed that midbrain dopamine neurons exhibit distinct response patterns depending on whether reward is delivered in 100% (task 1) or 90% of trials (task 2) in a classical conditioning task. Here we found that inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) affected dopaminergic signaling in task 2, in which the hidden state must be inferred (""will reward come or not?""), but not in task 1, where the state was known with certainty. Computational modeling suggests that the effects of inactivation are best explained by a circuit in which the mPFC conveys inference over hidden states to the dopamine system. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2798010797,"Adverse event (AE)-related costs represent an important component of economic models for cancer care. However, since previous studies mostly focused on specific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currently available. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costs associated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of the most prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claims database. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one of the following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum, genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa), lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes were defined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologic therapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatment regimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from the product inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. A retrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with a certain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costs associated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation. The three most costly AEs when considering any severity were gastrointestinal perforation ($24,633), central nervous system hemorrhage ($24,322), and sepsis/septicemia ($23,510). Incremental healthcare costs associated with severe AEs ranged from $15,709 for dermatitis and rash to $48,538 for gastrointestinal fistula. The three most costly severe AEs were gastrointestinal fistula ($48,538), gastrointestinal perforation ($41,281), and central nervous system hemorrhage ($38,428). In conclusion, AEs during treatment episodes for cancer were frequent and associated with a substantial economic burden."
https://openalex.org/W2797037710,"Pearl millet is a cereal crop known for its high tolerance to drought, heat and salinity stresses as well as for its nutritional quality. The molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in pearl millet is unknown. Here we attempted to unravel the molecular basis of drought tolerance in two pearl millet inbred lines, ICMB 843 and ICMB 863 using RNA sequencing. Under greenhouse condition, ICMB 843 was found to be more tolerant to drought than ICMB 863. We sequenced the root transcriptome from both lines under control and drought conditions using an Illumina Hi-Seq platform, generating 139.1 million reads. Mapping of sequenced reads against the foxtail millet genome, which has been relatively well-annotated, led to the identification of several differentially expressed genes under drought stress. Total of 6799 and 1253 differentially expressed genes were found in ICMB 843 and ICMB 863, respectively. Pathway and gene function analysis by KEGG online tool revealed that the drought response in pearl millet is mainly regulated by pathways related to photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. The changes in expression of drought-responsive genes determined by RNA sequencing were confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR for 7 genes. These results are a first step to understanding the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in pearl millet and lay a foundation for its genetic improvement."

Excitatory neurotransmission is fundamental to the development and function of the mammalian brain and is mediated mainly by the activity-dependent release of glutamate followed by activation of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Traynelis et al., 2010Traynelis S.F.

The exon 5 sequence is conserved throughout vertebrate GluN1 subunits as far back as cartilaginous fishes and hemichordates (http://consurf.tau.ac.il), which suggests that the location and composition of exon 5 is evolutionarily advantageous for the maintenance of proper neurological functions. Despite the importance of this classical paradigm in basic neuroscience and pathology, the molecular mechanism underlying functional alteration by exon 5 has been enigmatic due to the lack of a structure of the intact NMDA receptor with exon 5. Here, we show through cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) that the presence of the exon 5 motif in GluN1 alters the local architecture of heterotetrameric GluN1-GluN2 NMDA receptors and creates interdomain contacts with the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits. These unique interactions likely influence the stability of the ATD/LBD and LBD/LBD interfaces, which are critically involved in controlling proton sensitivity and deactivation. Our results also suggest that a fundamental mechanism of alternative splicing in ion channels could serve a broad function indeed, by introducing or removing interaction networks at precise locations in the protein structure as a means to modulate function. To define the structure and location of the exon-5-encoded motif, we performed single-particle cryo-EM analysis on the intact rat GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor containing the exon 5 sequence (hereafter referred to as GluN1b-GluN2B; Figure 2). Our initial study on the GluN1b-GluN2B NMDA receptor bound to glycine and glutamate showed conformational variability in the ATD, which resulted in limited resolution (∼6.5 Å) and only weak density for the exon-5-encoded region. To improve the resolution, we minimized conformational flexibility by incorporating an inter-GluN2B ATD disulfide bond with the GluN2B S214C mutation (GluN1b-GluN2BEMX) and prepared the samples with glycine and glutamate bound in the LBDs, ifenprodil in the ATD, and MK-801 in the transmembrane domain (TMD) ion channel. This modified construct formed the GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptors that retained functional properties, including activation by glycine and glutamate, and inhibition by an allosteric modulator (ifenprodil or zinc), antagonists (5,7 dichlorokynurenic acid or D-AP5), or channel blockers (magnesium and MK-801) (Figures 2 and S1). Three-dimensional classification resulted in one reconstruction that resolves to ∼4.6 Å resolution as estimated by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) using the 0.143 cutoff (Figures 3 and S2), enabling us to visualize density for bulky aromatic residues and Asn-linked glycosylation and permitting building of molecular models with confidence (Figure S3). The cryo-EM structure unambiguously shows the heterotetrameric assembly of the GluN1b-GluN2B NMDA receptors. The bilobed structures of the GluN2B ATD, the GluN1 LBD, and the GluN2B LBD in the current cryo-EM structure are in the closed conformation, occupied by ifenprodil, glycine, and glutamate, consistent with crystal structures of the isolated domains (Jespersen et al., 2014Jespersen A.

At the TMD, the ion channel pore is blocked by MK-801, as illustrated by the cryo-EM density (Figure S3C). The cryo-EM structure shows ordered density for eight residues (GluN1b Tyr204-Lys211) encoded by exon 5 at the ATD/LBD interdomain interface, which “caps” the GluN1b-GluN2B subunit interface of the LBD through interactions between GluN1b Lys190 and GluN2B Tyr507 and between GluN1b Lys211 and GluN1b Asp786 (Figure 3B). The regions surrounding GluN1b Lys190, GluN1b Lys211, and GlwuN2B Tyr507 are devoid of missense variants in humans, suggesting they play important roles in protein function and may be under strong selection (Lek et al., 2016Lek M.

Remarkably, the region between GluN1b Glu186 and Lys190, which is not encoded by exon 5, has an altered architecture compared to that in the GluN1a-GluN2B NMDA receptor lacking exon 5 (Figure 3C) (Karakas and Furukawa, 2014Karakas E. Furukawa H. Crystal structure of a heterotetrameric NMDA receptor ion channel.Science. 2014; 344: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Specifically, those five residues are extended toward the ATD-LBD linker of the GluN2B subunit rather than turning back to GluN1 β7 as in GluN1a, thereby creating the GluN1b-specific contacts with the GluN2B subunit, including those between GluN1b Lys190 and GluN2B Tyr507, and between GluN1b Lys211 and GluN2B Tyr507 (Figure 3B). The structure of the region immediately surrounding the exon 5 motif is similar to that of the allosterically inhibited receptor (PDB: 4PE5), the non-active receptor (PDB: 5FXH and 5FXI), and the active receptor (PDB: 5FXG); therefore, the pattern of interactions between the exon 5 motif and other domains is likely independent of the functional states of the receptors (Karakas and Furukawa, 2014Karakas E.

To assess the physiological relevance of the observed intersubunit arrangement around the exon 5 motif, we engineered cysteine mutants into otherwise wild-type GluN1-4b and GluN2B NMDA receptors with no C-terminal domain (deltaCTD; STAR Methods) and tested for spontaneous disulfide bond formation at the following subunit interfaces: the beginning region of the exon 5 motif and the GluN2B ATD/LBD linker (GluN1b Ser191 or Lys192 and GluN2B Gln401) (Figure 4A, I), the beginning region of the exon 5 motif and the GluN2B LBD (GluN1b Ser191 or Lys192 and GluN2B Gly771) (Figure 4A, II), and the end region of the exon 5 motif and the GluN2B LBD (Figure 4A, III). We expressed and purified these mutant GluN1-4b-GluN2B deltaCTD NMDA receptors and conducted western blot analysis under nonreducing conditions to detect band shifts indicative of disulfide bond formation. This showed disulfide crosslinks between single cysteine mutants of the exon 5 motif and GluN2B that lead to formation of GluN1b-GluN2B deltaCTD heterodimers that can be recognized by antibodies against both GluN1 and GluN2B (Figure 4B). When only one of the subunits contains the cysteine modification or the experiment is performed in the presence of reducing agent, no bands representing heterodimers were observed, indicating that dimer formation occurs through specific disulfide formation between the engineered pairs (Figure 4B). Thus, this series of disulfide bond experiments under physiological conditions is consistent with the subunit interactions observed in the cryo-EM structure. The disulfide bond formation above had minimal effect on pH sensitivity and deactivation speed. Based on the current cryo-EM structure, we explored the underlying molecular mechanism for reduced proton sensitivity by exon 5. We conducted mutagenesis in the context of the full-length GluN1-4b-GluN2B NMDA receptor, including disrupting interactions between the exon 5 motif and the GluN1 LBD and/or between the exon 5 motif and the GluN2B LBD, charge reversal of the three negatively charged residues encoded by exon 5, and truncations of the disordered region (Figures 5A–5C). Potency of proton inhibition was measured by detecting whole-cell macroscopic currents at various pH points using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) in Xenopus laevis oocytes (Figure S4). Disrupting the interaction between the exon 5 motif and the GluN1 LBD (by mutating GluN1-4b Lys190Ala or GluN1-4b Asp786Ala) or between the exon 5 motif and the GluN2B LBD (by mutating GluN1-4b Lys211Ala or GluN2B Tyr507Ala) increased the IC50 values for proton inhibition from pH 7.04 to pH ∼7.3 and ∼7.4, respectively, but did not restore proton sensitivity to the level observed for the exon-5-lacking GluN1-4a-GluN2B NMDA receptor (IC50 = pH 7.72) (Figure 5A; Table 1). When we disrupted both of the two interdomain interactions above with the GluN1-4b-Lys190Ala/Lys211Ala mutations, and similarly with GluN1-4b-Asp786Ala/GluN2B-Tyr507Ala mutations, the IC50 values for these respective mutant combinations shifted to pH 7.65 and 7.66, which is statistically indistinguishable from the wild-type GluN1-4a-GluN2B NMDA receptor (Figure 5A). Contrary to the large effect observed by disrupting the exon 5/LBD interactions, charge reversal of negatively charged residues (Figure 5B) and truncations of the disordered region (Figure 5B; Table S1) had little or no effect on receptor proton sensitivity. The effect of truncation is observed only in the most extreme construct (Δexon5-C) together with GluN1-4b-Lys211Ala. These results imply that the exon 5 motif reduces proton sensitivity of the ion channel by affecting the subunit interface between the GluN1b LBD and the GluN2B LBD. To further test this hypothesis, we disrupted the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimer interface with the GluN2B Leu781Ala mutation and observed a significant increase in proton sensitivity (Figure 5D). Overall, these results agree with the concept that the GluN1-GluN2B LBD dimer interface is a critical region for controlling proton sensitivity and that the exon 5 motif reduces proton sensitivity by stabilizing the GluN1-GluN2B LBD dimer interface by interacting with both the GluN1 LBD and the GluN2B LBD. Disrupting the similar LBD subunit interface in the GluN1-GluN2A NMDA receptors was also shown to result in increased proton sensitivity (Gielen et al., 2008Gielen M. Le Goff A. Stroebel D.

The number of replicates for WCPC or TEVC experiments is listed as nwcpc and ntevc, respectively. Sequential numbering refers to the specific data point labeled in Figure S6. WT, wild-type. Another hallmark of exon-5-containing NMDA receptors is their faster deactivation rate compared to NMDA receptor isoforms without exon 5 (Rumbaugh et al., 2000Rumbaugh G. Prybylowski K. Wang J.F. Vicini S. Exon 5 and spermine regulate deactivation of NMDA receptor subtypes.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Vance et al., 2012Vance K.M. Hansen K.B. Traynelis S.F. GluN1 splice variant control of GluN1/GluN2D NMDA receptors.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 3857-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We first assessed if the exon 5/LBD interactions important for reducing proton-sensitivity are also involved in facilitating faster deactivation by monitoring the effects of our exon 5 mutations on deactivation rate. This was achieved by performing whole-cell patch-clamp (WCPC) experiments coupled with fast perfusion (5 ms glutamate application; Figure S5; Table 1), which matches the timescale of synaptic transmission, followed by measuring current decay as described by two exponential components (τfast and τslow). Disruption of the exon 5/LBD interactions by the point mutations at GluN1-4b Lys190, GluN1-4b Lys 211, GluN1-4b Asp786, and GluN2B Tyr507 had little or no effect in slowing down the NMDA receptor deactivation time course compared to the wild-type GluN1-4b-GluN2B NMDA receptor as monitored by a weighted average of the two time constants (τweighted) (Figure 6A). Furthermore, conversion of negatively charged residues (Figure 6B) or truncation of the flexible region of the exon 5 motif (Figure 6C; Table S1) resulted in only minimal effects. However, these minor but statistically significant effects correlate with the proton sensitivity as assessed by a linear regression analysis of time constants (τweighted, τfast, and τslow) and proportion of τfast against pH IC50 (Figure S6). Notably, as a function of pH IC50, not only do τweighted and τfast increase (Figures S6A and S6B), but also the relative contribution to deactivation by τfast decreases (Figure S6C). To completely reverse the effect of exon 5, its structure and positioning need to be sufficiently disrupted by a combination of the truncation Δexon5-C and perturbation of the exon 5/LBD interaction by the GluN1b Lys211Ala mutation (Figure 6C). Thus, the major factor controlling the deactivation rate is the proper structural arrangement and placement of the exon 5 motif within the ATD/LBD interface, which becomes difficult to achieve if the GluN1-GluN2B LBD interface is perturbed by the GluN2B Leu781Ala mutation (Figure 6D). Consequently, the effect of the exon 5 motif is nearly eliminated and the deactivation rate becomes equivalent to the exon-5-lacking GluN1-4a-GluN2B NMDA receptor (Figure 6D). Taken together, our structural and functional data show that the ATD/LBD interface is an important locus for regulating ion channel function, including proton sensitivity and deactivation rate in NMDA receptors. The exon 5 motif acts as a ligand naturally incorporated into the primary sequence in order to control the GluN1-GluN2B LBD intersubunit interface, which in turn regulates ion channel activity at the TMD. Our current and previous structures demonstrate that the interaction between the ATD and the LBD is more extensive in NMDA receptors compared to that of the non-NMDA iGluRs (Karakas and Furukawa, 2014Karakas E.

Therefore, a small structural element such as the exon 5 motif can modulate the ATD/LBD interface and alter functions of NMDA receptors while the equivalent region in non-NMDA iGluRs has too few potential interactions for the ATD to be able to modulate the LBD and vice versa. Consistently, there is little or no ATD-mediated modulation of functions such as proton sensitivity and deactivation rates in non-NMDA iGluRs. Extending the same analogy of the exon 5 motif as a tethered ligand, it stands to reason that polyamines such as spermine and spermidine bind and modulate a similar if not the identical domain interface and elicit exon-5-like effects, including reduced proton sensitivity (Mony et al., 2011Mony L. Zhu S. Carvalho S. Paoletti P. Molecular basis of positive allosteric modulation of GluN2B NMDA receptors by polyamines.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3134-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and faster deactivation rates (Rumbaugh et al., 2000Rumbaugh G. Prybylowski K. Wang J.F. Vicini S. Exon 5 and spermine regulate deactivation of NMDA receptor subtypes.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may also hold true for a set of subtype-specific compounds such as PYD-106 that are predicted to bind to the ATD/LBD interface (Khatri et al., 2014Khatri A. Burger P.B. Swanger S.A. Hansen K.B. Zimmerman S. Karakas E. Liotta D.C. Furukawa H. Snyder J.P. Traynelis S.F.

This fine-tuning capability of the ATD/LBD interface in NMDA receptors may yet be employed to develop context-dependent therapeutic compounds that will only exhibit activity in the acidified environment created by seizure and stroke.

https://openalex.org/W2798218032,"Dopamine input to the dorsal and ventral striatum originates from separate populations of midbrain neurons. Despite differences in afferent inputs and behavioral output, little is known about how dopamine release is encoded by dopamine receptors on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) across striatal subregions. Here we examined the activation of D2 receptors following the synaptic release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum (DStr) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. We found that D2 receptor-mediated synaptic currents were slower in the NAc and this difference occurred at the level of D2-receptor signaling. As a result of preferential coupling to Gαo, we also found that D2 receptors in MSNs demonstrated higher sensitivity for dopamine in the NAc. The higher sensitivity in the NAc was eliminated following cocaine exposure. These results identify differences in the sensitivity and timing of D2-receptor signaling across the striatum that influence how nigrostriatal and mesolimbic signals are encoded across these circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2797316349,"The NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) has emerged as an important regulator of chondrogenesis and cartilage homeostasis, processes that are important for physiological skeletal growth and that are dysregulated in osteoarthritis. However, the functional role and underlying mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates chondrogenesis remain unclear. Using cultured rat metatarsal bones and chondrocytes isolated from rat metatarsal rudiments, here we studied the effects of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 or of SIRT1 siRNA on chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy, and apoptosis. We show that EX527 or SIRT1 siRNA inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy and induces apoptosis. We also observed that SIRT1 inhibition mainly induces the PERK–eIF-2α–CHOP axis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in growth-plate chondrocytes. Of note, EX527- or SIRT1 siRNA–mediated inhibition of metatarsal growth and growth-plate chondrogenesis were partly neutralized by phenylbutyric acid, a chemical chaperone that attenuates ER stress. Moreover, EX527-mediated impairment of chondrocyte function (i.e. of chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy, and apoptosis) was partly reversed in CHOP−/− cells. We also present evidence that SIRT1 physically interacts with and deacetylates PERK. Collectively, our findings indicate that SIRT1 deacetylates PERK and attenuates the PERK–eIF-2α–CHOP axis of the unfolded protein response pathway and thereby promotes growth-plate chondrogenesis and longitudinal bone growth."

In the specific case of patients treated with Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support (VA-ECMO), VAP treatment failures (VAP-TF) have been incompletely investigated.To investigate the risk factors of treatment failure (VAP-TF) in a large cohort of ICU patients treated with VA-ECMO, we conducted a retrospective study in a Surgical ICU about patients assisted with VA-ECMO between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014. Diagnosis of VAP was confirmed by a positive quantitative culture of a respiratory sample. VAP-TF was defined as composite of death attributable to pneumonia and relapse within 28 days of the first episode.In total, 152 patients underwent ECMO support for > 48h. During the VA-ECMO support, 85 (55.9%) patients developed a VAP, for a rate of 60.6 per 1000 ECMO days. The main pathogens identified were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. VAP-TF occurred in 37.2% of patients and was associated with an increased 28-day mortality (Hazard Ratio 3.05 [1.66; 5.63], P<0.001), and VA-ECMO assistance duration (HR 1.47 [1.05-2.05], P = 0.025). Risk factors for VAP-TF were renal replacement therapy (HR 13.05 [1.73; 98.56], P = 0.013) and documentation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (HR 2.36 [1.04; 5.35], P = 0.04).VAP in patients treated with VA-ECMO is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. RRT and infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa appear as strong risks factors of treatment failure. Further studies seem necessary to precise the best antibiotic management in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2797904823,"Background Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, viral vaccine under advanced development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the humoral immunogenic equivalence of three consecutively manufactured MVA production lots, and to confirm the safety and tolerability of MVA focusing on cardiac readouts. Methods The trial was conducted at 34 sites in the US. Vaccinia-naïve adults aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups using a 1:1:1:1 randomization scheme. Subjects received either two MVA injections from three consecutive lots (Groups 1-3), or two placebo injections (Group 4), four weeks apart. Everyone except personnel involved in vaccine handling and administration was blinded to treatment. Safety assessment focused on cardiac monitoring throughout the trial. Vaccinia-specific antibody titers were measured using a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after two MVA vaccinations measured by PRNT at trial visit 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01144637. Results Between March 2013 and May 2014, 4005 subjects were enrolled and received at least one injection of MVA (n = 3003) or placebo (n = 1002). The three MVA lots induced equivalent antibody titers two weeks after the second vaccination, with seroconversion rates of 99·8% (PRNT) and 99·7% (ELISA). Overall, 180 (6·0%) subjects receiving MVA and 29 (2·9%) subjects in the placebo group reported at least one unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) that was considered trial-related. Vaccination was well tolerated without significant safety concerns, particularly regarding cardiac assessment. Conclusions The neutralizing and total antibody titers induced by each of the three lots were equivalent. No significant safety concerns emerged in this healthy trial population, especially regarding cardiac safety, thus confirming the excellent safety and tolerability profile of MVA.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic criteria including culture, multi-target polymerase chain reaction (PCR), anti-pertussis toxin IgG (IgG-PT) serology, and the use of a clinical case definition. An additional objective was to describe the optimal timing of specimen collection for the various tests.Clinical specimens were collected from patients with cough illness at seven locations across the United States between 2007 and 2011. Nasopharyngeal and blood specimens were collected from each patient during the enrollment visit. Patients who had been coughing for ≤ 2 weeks were asked to return in 2-4 weeks for collection of a second, convalescent blood specimen. Sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test were estimated using three methods-pertussis culture as the ""gold standard,"" composite reference standard analysis (CRS), and latent class analysis (LCA).Overall, 868 patients were enrolled and 13.6% were B. pertussis positive by at least one diagnostic test. In a sample of 545 participants with non-missing data on all four diagnostic criteria, culture was 64.0% sensitive, PCR was 90.6% sensitive, and both were 100% specific by LCA. CRS and LCA methods increased the sensitivity estimates for convalescent serology and the clinical case definition over the culture-based estimates. Culture and PCR were most sensitive when performed during the first two weeks of cough; serology was optimally sensitive after the second week of cough.Timing of specimen collection in relation to onset of illness should be considered when ordering diagnostic tests for pertussis. Consideration should be given to including IgG-PT serology as a confirmatory test in the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition for pertussis."

The specificity was determined by phage display analysis and the importance of individual amino acids in and around the cleavage site was then validated using novel recombinant substrates. To provide a broader context to this serine protease, a comparison was made to the related mast cell protease, human chymase (HC). hCG showed similar characteristics to HC including both the primary and extended specificities. As expected, Phe, Tyr, Trp and Leu were preferred in the P1 position. In addition, both proteases showed a preference for negatively charged amino acids in the P2´ position of substrates and a preference for aliphatic amino acids both upstream and downstream of the cleavage site. However, overall the catalytic activity of hCG was ~10-fold lower than HC. hCG has previously been reported to have a dual specificity consisting of chymase and tryptase-type activities. In our analysis, tryptase activity against substrates with Lys in P1 cleavage position was indeed only 2-fold less efficient as compared to optimal chymase substrates supporting strong dual-type specificity. We hope the information presented here on extended cleavage specificities of hCG and HC will assist in the search for novel in vivo substrates for these proteases as well as aid in the efforts to better understand the role of hCG in immunity and bacterial defence."
https://openalex.org/W2797602276,"Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, vector of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (CLas). CLas is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. D. citri adults were collected from orange jasmine (Murraya paniculata) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy Murraya plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested CLas-negative by qPCR were maintained on Murraya plants and considered an isofemale line. Six acquisition tests on D. citri adults that were reared as nymphs on CLas-infected citrus, from various generations of each line, were conducted to assess their acquisition rates (percentage of qPCR-positive adults). Three lines with mean acquisition rates of 28 to 32%, were classified as ‘good’ acquirers and three other lines were classified as ‘poor’ acquirers, with only 5 to 8% acquisition rates. All lines were further tested for their ability to inoculate CLas by confining CLas-exposed psyllids for one week onto healthy citrus leaves (6–10 adults/leaf/week), and testing the leaves for CLas by qPCR. Mean inoculation rates were 19 to 28% for the three good acquirer lines and 0 to 3% for the three poor acquirer lines. Statistical analyses indicated positive correlations between CLas acquisition and inoculation rates, as well as between CLas titer in the psyllids and CLas acquisition or inoculation rates. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of one of the good and one of the poor acquirer lines revealed differences between them in color morphs and hemocyanin expression, but not the composition of bacterial endosymbionts. Understanding the genetic architecture of CLas transmission will enable the development of new tools for combating this devastating citrus disease."
https://openalex.org/W2797508799,"Perhaps the most devastating decline with age is the loss of memory. Therefore, identifying mechanisms to restore memory function with age is critical. Using C. elegans associative learning and memory assays, we identified a gain-of-function Gαq signaling pathway mutant that forms a long-term (cAMP response element binding protein [CREB]-dependent) memory following one conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus (CS-US) pairing, which usually requires seven CS-US pairings. Increased CREB activity in AIM interneurons reduces the threshold for memory consolidation through transcription of a set of previously identified “long-term memory” genes. Enhanced Gαq signaling in the AWC sensory neuron is both necessary and sufficient for improved memory and increased AIM CREB activity, and activation of Gαq specifically in aged animals rescues the ability to form memory. Activation of Gαq in AWC sensory neurons non-cell autonomously induces consolidation after one CS-US pairing, enabling both cognitive function maintenance with age and restoration of memory function in animals with impaired memory performance without decreased longevity."

Owing to constant mechanical stress, striated muscle proteins are particularly prone to wear and tear and require several protein quality–control mechanisms to coordinate protein turnover and removal of damaged proteins. Kelch-like proteins, substrate adapters for the Cullin-3 (Cul3)-RING ligase (CRL3) complex, are emerging as critical regulators of striated muscle development and function, highlighting the importance of Cul3-mediated proteostasis in muscle function. To explore the role of Cul3-mediated proteostasis in striated muscle, here we deleted Cul3 specifically in either skeletal muscle (SkM-Cul3 KO) or cardiomyocytes (CM-Cul3 KO) of mice. The loss of Cul3 caused neonatal lethality and dramatic alterations in the proteome, which were unique to each striated muscle type. Many of the proteins whose expression was significantly changed in the SkM-Cul3 KO were components of the extracellular matrix and sarcomere, whereas proteins altered in the CM-Cul3 KO were involved in metabolism. These findings highlight the requirement for striated muscle–specific CRL3 activity and indicate how the CRL3 complex can control different nodes of protein interaction networks in different types of striated muscle. Further identification of Cul3 substrates, and how these substrates are targeted, may reveal therapeutic targets and treatment regimens for striated muscle diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2896620527,"Background There is limited knowledge on cost of treating malaria in children under-five years in northern Ghana which poses a challenge in determining whether interventions such as the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) have reduced the economic burden of malaria to households or not. This study examined the malaria care seeking and cost of treatment in children under-five years in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Methods The study used a cross-sectional, quantitative design and data were collected between July and August 2016 in three districts in the Upper West Region of Ghana. A total of 574 women who had under-five children were interviewed. Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, malaria seeking patterns for under-five children with malaria as well as direct medical and non-medical costs associated with treating under-five children with malaria were collected from the patient perspective. Analysis was performed using STATA 12. Results Out of 574 women visited, about 63% (360) had children who had malaria and sought treatment. Most treatment was done at formal health facilities such as the health centres (37%) and the CHPS (35%) while 3% had self-treatment at home. The main reason for choice of place of treatment outside home was nearness to home (53%). The average direct medical and non-medical costs associated with treating an under-five child with malaria were US$4.13 and US$3.04 respectively. The average cost on transportation alone was US$2.64. Overall, the average direct medical and non-medical cost associated with treating an under-five child with malaria was US$4.91(range: minimum = US$0.13 –maximum = US$46.75). Children who were enrolled into the NHIS paid an average amount of US$4.76 compared with US$5.88 for those not enrolled, though the difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.15). Conclusions The average cost to households in treating an under-five child with malaria was US$4.91. This amount is considerably high given the poverty level in the area. Children not insured paid a little over one US dollar for malaria treatment compared to those insured. Efforts to improve enrolment into the NHIS may be needed to reduce the cost of malaria treatment to households. Construction of more health facilities near to community members and at hard to reach areas will improve access to health care and reduce direct non-medical cost such as transportation costs."
https://openalex.org/W2796698156,"Recent analyses have suggested a strong heritable component to circulating fatty acid (FA) levels; however, only a limited number of genes have been identified which associate with FA levels. In order to expand upon a previous genome wide association study done on participants in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort and FA levels, we used data from 2,400 of these individuals for whom red blood cell FA profiles, dietary information and genotypes are available, and then conducted a genome-wide evaluation of potential genetic variants associated with 22 FAs and 15 FA ratios, after adjusting for relevant dietary covariates. Our analysis found nine previously identified loci associated with FA levels (FADS, ELOVL2, PCOLCE2, LPCAT3, AGPAT4, NTAN1/PDXDC1, PKD2L1, HBS1L/MYB and RAB3GAP1/MCM6), while identifying four novel loci. The latter include an association between variants in CALN1 (Chromosome 7) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), DHRS4L2 (Chromosome 14) and a FA ratio measuring delta-9-desaturase activity, as well as two loci associated with less well understood proteins. Thus, the inclusion of dietary covariates had a modest impact, helping to uncover four additional loci. While genome-wide association studies continue to uncover additional genes associated with circulating FA levels, much of the heritable risk is yet to be explained, suggesting the potential role of rare genetic variation, epistasis and gene-environment interactions on FA levels as well. Further studies are needed to continue to understand the complex genetic picture of FA metabolism and synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2798061603,"Background There is ample evidence that biotic factors, such as biotic interactions and dispersal capacity, can affect species distributions and influence species’ responses to climate change. However, little is known about how these factors affect predictions from species distribution models (SDMs) with respect to spatial grain and extent of the models. Objectives Understanding how spatial scale influences the effects of biological processes in SDMs is important because SDMs are one of the primary tools used by conservation biologists to assess biodiversity impacts of climate change. Data sources and study eligibility criteria We systematically reviewed SDM studies published from 2003–2015 using ISI Web of Science searches to: (1) determine the current state and key knowledge gaps of SDMs that incorporate biotic interactions and dispersal; and (2) understand how choice of spatial scale may alter the influence of biological processes on SDM predictions. Synthesis methods and limitations We used linear mixed effects models to examine how predictions from SDMs changed in response to the effects of spatial scale, dispersal, and biotic interactions. Results There were important biases in studies including an emphasis on terrestrial ecosystems in northern latitudes and little representation of aquatic ecosystems. Our results suggest that neither spatial extent nor grain influence projected climate-induced changes in species ranges when SDMs include dispersal or biotic interactions. Conclusions We identified several knowledge gaps and suggest that SDM studies forecasting the effects of climate change should: 1) address broader ranges of taxa and locations; and 1) report the grain size, extent, and results with and without biological complexity. The spatial scale of analysis in SDMs did not affect estimates of projected range shifts with dispersal and biotic interactions. However, the lack of reporting on results with and without biological complexity precluded many studies from our analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2797785974,"Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013-2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p<0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002). Compared with control, BrS patients exhibited larger RVOT volumes (7.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.7 mL/m2, p<0.0001) and wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) (31% vs 0%, p = 0.005); compared with ARVC cohort, the RVOT volumes were similar (7.4 ± 0.7 vs, 8.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.52) and there were less RWMA (31% vs 76%, p = 0.01). Overall 67% BrS patients had abnormal RVOT morphology. Patients with abnormal RVOT tended to be older (48 ± 12 y vs 41 ± 12y, p = 0.06). Rare genetic variants were only observed in patients with abnormal RVOT morphology (36% vs 0%, p = 0.02).Patients with BrS frequently exhibit structural abnormalities localised to the RVOT and these changes may be age- and gene-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2804405392,"Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and MMP13 in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced MMP1/13 expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of MMP1/13. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (PRKD3) depletion mirrored the observed MMP repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. PRKD3 silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following PRKD3 silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes FOS and JUN, critical for the induction of many MMPs including MMP1/13. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in MMP13 expression. Taken together, we highlight an important role for PKD3 in the pro-inflammatory signalling that promotes cartilage destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2797432683,"There is evidence that dendritic cells (DCs) undergo age-related changes that modulate their function with their key role being priming antigen-specific effector T cells. This occurs once DCs develop into antigen-presenting cells in response to stimuli/danger signals. However, the effects of aging on DC responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ and CD40 ligand (CD40L) have not yet been systematically evaluated. We examined responses of blood myeloid (m)DC1s, mDC2s, plasmacytoid (p)DCs, and monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) from young (21-40 years) and elderly (60-84 years) healthy human volunteers to LPS/IFN-γ or CD40L stimulation. All elderly DC subsets demonstrated comparable up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80 and/or CD86), intracellular pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IFN-γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6 and/or IL-12), and/or secreted cytokine levels (IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-12) to their younger counterparts. Furthermore, elderly-derived LPS/IFN-γ or CD40L-activated MoDCs induced similar or increased levels of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell proliferation, and similar T cell functional phenotypes, to their younger counterparts. However, elderly LPS/IFN-γ-activated MoDCs were unreliable in their ability to up-regulate chemokine (IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1) and IL-6 secretion, implying an inability to dependably induce an inflammatory response. A key age-related difference was that, unlike young-derived MoDCs that completely lost their ability to process antigen, elderly-derived MoDCs maintained their antigen processing ability after LPS/IFN-γ maturation, measured using the DQ-ovalbumin assay; this response implies incomplete maturation that may enable elderly DCs to continuously present antigen. These differences may impact on the efficacy of anti-pathogen and anti-tumour immune responses in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2897596009,"The relapse of nasal deformity is a challenge for modern correction of cleft lip. A comprehensive understanding in the biomechanical perspective of both the formation and correction of the cleft lip nasal deformity would lead to improved stability of the corrective outcome. In this study, a finite element model of secondary cleft lip nasal deformity was constructed, on which two critical corrective maneuvers were mimicked in the form of force-loading. The intercrural suture was simulated by a force loaded at the intermediate crus of the alar cartilage directing anteriorly and medially, and the suture suspending the alar cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage was simulated by a force loaded at the lateral crus directing superiorly and medially. The equivalent von-mises stress and the total deformation consequent to different patterns of loading were captured. Our biomechanical analyses suggested that the intercrural suture at the nasal tip might be more effective in generating widespread morphological change than the suspension suture, but left much higher level of stress within the skin envelope if placed too high. Synergistic effect was observed between the two sutures in both the resultant deformation and stress. In addition, our simulations were partially supported by clinical photogrammetry data."

We established two permanent plots within the Chinese pine forest in the Jiulong Mountains, Beijing, China. To understand the structural characteristics and dynamics of these plots, we analyzed the spatial structural characteristics within nearest-neighbor relationships using the bivariate distributions of the stand spatial structural parameters: uniform angle index, W; mingling index, M; dominance index, U; and crowding index, C. Results revealed that most trees in the forest were randomly distributed. The predominant individuals and randomly arranged trees were in very dense areas and surrounded by the same species. In addition, both plots exhibited a uniform size differentiation pattern. The two plots differed mainly in the level of species mixture and dominance. The majority of reference trees in the pure Chinese pine forest (plot 1) exhibited poor species mingling and low dominance, whereas trees in the mixed Chinese pine forest (plot 2) were evenly distributed in each mingling class and most trees were of intermediate dominance. The study results are useful for optimizing forest management activities in the studied stands, promoting tree growth, regeneration and habitat diversity, and improving forest quality at a fine scale."

Expression of mucosal IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1R1 and several antimicrobial peptides and enzymes were measured by quantitative PCR or ELISA, western blotting or immunohistochemistry. Bacterial overgrowth was determined by fluorescent in-situ hybridization and counting of jejunal luminal bacteria. Translocation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria into the intestinal wall, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen was determined by counting bacterial colonies on agar plates 48h after plating of tissue homogenates. Antimicrobial activity against E. coli and B. vulgatus was analyzed in total and cationic fractions of small bowel mucosal tissue homogenates by a flow cytometry-based bacterial depolarization assay.Jejunal bacterial overgrowth was detected 24h after surgery. At the same time point, but not in the early phase 3h after surgery, bacterial translocation into the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes was observed. Increased antimicrobial activity against E. coli was induced within early phase of POI. Basal antimicrobial peptide and enzyme gene expression was higher in the ileal compared to the jejunal mucosa. The expression of lysozyme 1, cryptdin 1, cryptdin 4 and mucin 2 were reduced 24h after surgery in the ileal mucosa and mucin 2 was also reduced in the jejunum. Postoperative IL-1α and IL-1β were increased in the postoperative mucosa. Deficiency of IL-1R1 affected the expression of antimicrobial peptides during homeostasis and POI.Small bowel antimicrobial capacity is disturbed during POI which is accompanied by bacterial overgrowth and translocation. IL-1R1 is partially involved in the gene expression of mucosal antimicrobial peptides. Altered small bowel antimicrobial activity may contribute also to POI development and manifestation in patients undergoing abdominal surgery."

Studies with dairy products have shown a potential beneficial effect against diabetes. This experiment evaluated the supplementation of milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and polyphenols in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Forty male 28-day-old Wistar rats were distributed in four experimental treatments of diabetic animals (streptozotocin induction) and a normal group (non-induced). Experimental treatments were: control (water), whole common milk (COM-M), milk enriched with PUFA (PUFA-M), milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols (PUFA/P-M) through a special diet offered to dairy cows. Milk supplementation at a dose 5 mL/kg body weight was performed for 77 days, 42 days before and 35 days after diabetes induction. The COM-M supplementation increased brown fat deposits, reduced post-induction glucose levels, reduced blood fructosamine levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Milk enriched with PUFA reduced final fasting glucose, LDL levels, and improved blood antioxidant capacity. Milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols promoted an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass, and a reduction in mesenteric fat and LDL levels. Milk intake, with an emphasis on milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols, attenuated the metabolic disorders of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats."

This investigation aimed to provide strong epidemiological data and risk factors associated with HBV infection in first-time blood donors representative of the urban adult population. The screening of HBsAg was carried out using 4th generation ELISA kits. The overall seroprevalence of HBsAg was 7.28%. The frequency of HBsAg was differential and marked by annual variations in blood donors from 2009 to 2016. Seroprevalence was 2-fold higher among males versus females (OR = 1.90 (95% CI: 1.75–2.06), P<0.001). HBsAg seroprevalence was significantly higher in donors of the age group 25–35 years old compared to donors of the age group <18 years (OR = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.03–2.60), P = 0.04). The seroprevalence of HBsAg in family/replacement donors (FRD) was significantly higher than that of voluntary non-remunerated donors (VNRD) (OR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83–0.94), P <0.001). The simultaneous comparison of HBsAg seroprevalence with blood donation type, gender and age showed that the higher prevalence in FRD was significant only in males between 18 and 45 years and in females between 25 and 34 years of age. This study confirms the high endemicity of HBV in Gabon while identifying the most infected age groups for both men and women."
https://openalex.org/W2800991831,"In the event of an incident involving the release of a hazardous chemical, first responders may decide to initiate emergency decontamination in order to remove any contaminant from affected casualties. Recent initiatives such as the UK Home Office-led Initial Operational Response Programme have introduced new evidence-based decontamination protocols that reduce the time taken to initiate the decontamination process, including an increased emphasis on rapidly removing contaminated clothing (disrobe), and the use of improvised dry decontamination methods. The current study used a series of focus groups to examine public perceptions of different decontamination interventions and responder management strategies. Results revealed that a decontamination shower was perceived to be more effective than dry decontamination methods and that a management strategy that included effective responder communication resulted in increased willingness to comply with the need for decontamination. This study demonstrates that public understanding and acceptance of novel decontamination methods such as dry decontamination may present additional challenges for first responders. Increased emphasis on effective communication during decontamination is needed. Furthermore, provision of information during the focus group study resulted in an increase in participants’ knowledge and confidence in taking recommended decontamination actions, which was maintained three months after the study. The longitudinal nature of these effects suggest that it may be possible to increase public awareness about actions to take during chemical incidents by developing pre-incident public education; however, further research is needed to examine this more fully."

Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1-3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day. Further and more detailed studies of how sleep architecture is affected by recording day is necessary to fully comprehend the first-night effect in dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W2797774423,"At the interface between scene perception and speech production, we investigated how rapidly action scenes can activate semantic and lexical information. Experiment 1 examined how complex action-scene primes, presented for 150 ms, 100 ms, or 50 ms and subsequently masked, influenced the speed with which immediately following action-picture targets are named. Prime and target actions were either identical, showed the same action with different actors and environments, or were unrelated. Relative to unrelated primes, identical and same-action primes facilitated naming the target action, even when presented for 50 ms. In Experiment 2, neutral primes assessed the direction of effects. Identical and same-action scenes induced facilitation but unrelated actions induced interference. In Experiment 3, written verbs were used as targets for naming, preceded by action primes. When target verbs denoted the prime action, clear facilitation was obtained. In contrast, interference was observed when target verbs were phonologically similar, but otherwise unrelated, to the names of prime actions. This is clear evidence for word-form activation by masked action scenes. Masked action pictures thus provide conceptual information that is detailed enough to facilitate apprehension and naming of immediately following scenes. Masked actions even activate their word-form information-as is evident when targets are words. We thus show how language production can be primed with briefly flashed masked action scenes, in answer to long-standing questions in scene processing."

Here, we report the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of cGKII. These inhibitors were imidazole-aminopyrimidines, which blocked recombinant human cGKII at submicromolar concentrations but exhibited comparatively little activity toward the phylogenetically related protein kinases cGKI and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Whereas aminopyrimidyl motifs are common in protein kinase inhibitors, molecular modeling of these imidazole-aminopyrimidines in the ATP-binding pocket of cGKII indicated an unconventional binding mode that directs their amine substituent into a narrow pocket delineated by hydrophobic residues of the hinge and the αC-helix. Crucially, this set of residues included the Leu-530 gatekeeper, which is not conserved in cGKI and PKA. In intestinal organoids, these compounds blocked cGKII-dependent phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). In mouse small intestinal tissue, cGKII inhibition significantly attenuated the anion secretory response provoked by the GCC-activating bacterial heat-stable toxin (STa), a frequent cause of infectious secretory diarrhea. In contrast, both PKA-dependent VASP phosphorylation and intestinal anion secretion were unaffected by treatment with these compounds, whereas experiments with T84 cells indicated that they weakly inhibit the activity of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases. As these protein kinase inhibitors are the first to display selective inhibition of cGKII, they may expedite research on cGMP signaling and may aid future development of therapeutics for managing diarrheal disease and other pathogenic syndromes that involve cGKII.

Crucially, this set of residues included the Leu-530 gatekeeper, which is not conserved in cGKI and PKA. In intestinal organoids, these compounds blocked cGKII-dependent phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). In mouse small intestinal tissue, cGKII inhibition significantly attenuated the anion secretory response provoked by the GCC-activating bacterial heat-stable toxin (STa), a frequent cause of infectious secretory diarrhea. In contrast, both PKA-dependent VASP phosphorylation and intestinal anion secretion were unaffected by treatment with these compounds, whereas experiments with T84 cells indicated that they weakly inhibit the activity of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases. As these protein kinase inhibitors are the first to display selective inhibition of cGKII, they may expedite research on cGMP signaling and may aid future development of therapeutics for managing diarrheal disease and other pathogenic syndromes that involve cGKII."
https://openalex.org/W2810742317,"Machine learning techniques are becoming popular in virtual screening tasks. One of the powerful machine learning algorithms is Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which has been applied to many applications and has recently been applied to virtual screening. We propose the Weighted Similarity ELM (WS-ELM) which is based on a single layer feed-forward neural network in a conjunction of 16 different similarity coefficients as activation function in the hidden layer. It is known that the performance of conventional ELM is not robust due to random weight selection in the hidden layer. Thus, we propose a Clustering-based WS-ELM (CWS-ELM) that deterministically assigns weights by utilising clustering algorithms i.e. k-means clustering and support vector clustering. The experiments were conducted on one of the most challenging datasets-Maximum Unbiased Validation Dataset-which contains 17 activity classes carefully selected from PubChem. The proposed algorithms were then compared with other machine learning techniques such as support vector machine, random forest, and similarity searching. The results show that CWS-ELM in conjunction with support vector clustering yields the best performance when utilised together with Sokal/Sneath(1) coefficient. Furthermore, ECFP_6 fingerprint presents the best results in our framework compared to the other types of fingerprints, namely ECFP_4, FCFP_4, and FCFP_6."
https://openalex.org/W2797121841,"Introduction A common quality indicator for monitoring and comparing hospitals is based on death within 30 days of admission. An important use is to determine whether a hospital has higher or lower mortality than other hospitals. Thus, the ability to identify such outliers correctly is essential. Two approaches for detection are: 1) calculating the ratio of observed to expected number of deaths (OE) per hospital and 2) including all hospitals in a logistic regression (LR) comparing each hospital to a form of average over all hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare OE and LR with respect to correctly identifying 30-day mortality outliers. Modifications of the methods, i.e., variance corrected approach of OE (OE-Faris), bias corrected LR (LR-Firth), and trimmed mean variants of LR and LR-Firth were also studied. Materials and methods To study the properties of OE and LR and their variants, we performed a simulation study by generating patient data from hospitals with known outlier status (low mortality, high mortality, non-outlier). Data from simulated scenarios with varying number of hospitals, hospital volume, and mortality outlier status, were analysed by the different methods and compared by level of significance (ability to falsely claim an outlier) and power (ability to reveal an outlier). Moreover, administrative data for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, and hip fracture from Norwegian hospitals for 2012–2014 were analysed. Results None of the methods achieved the nominal (test) level of significance for both low and high mortality outliers. For low mortality outliers, the levels of significance were increased four- to fivefold for OE and OE-Faris. For high mortality outliers, OE and OE-Faris, LR 25% trimmed and LR-Firth 10% and 25% trimmed maintained approximately the nominal level. The methods agreed with respect to outlier status for 94.1% of the AMI hospitals, 98.0% of the stroke, and 97.8% of the hip fracture hospitals. Conclusion We recommend, on the balance, LR-Firth 10% or 25% trimmed for detection of both low and high mortality outliers."

https://openalex.org/W2798130611,"A suitable irrigation method adopted to arid desert conditions, including a special soil structure and specialized plants, has been continuously studied and improved. A field study was conducted in the Awei irrigation area of Aletai in Xinjiang in 2015 and 2016 to investigate the applicability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) in an arid desert area. A completely randomized block design with three replications and three treatments for drip tape subsurface depths at 5, 10, 20 cm was established. The results indicated that the vertical distribution of the soil moisture of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI, buried depth at 20 cm) was mainly concentrated at 0-60 cm, while SSDI (buried depth at 5 and 10 cm) was concentrated at 0-30 cm. However, the roots distributions were concentrated at 0-30 cm for SDI and SSDI. The chlorophyll content and water consumption intensity for alfalfa first increased and then decreased in arid desert conditions. The dry yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of SSDI (buried depth at 10 cm) were higher than those of SDI. The SSDI was practical in arid desert conditions and the recommended buried depth was 10 cm."
https://openalex.org/W2803347424,"To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR >95th percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction <0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men. In conclusion, RHF was associated with incident proteinuria in men. Clinical studies are necessary to study whether the alleviation of RHF can prevent incident proteinuria."
https://openalex.org/W2797300230,"Heterotrophic marine nanoflagellates are important grazers on bacteria in the water column. Some marine bacteria appear more resistant to grazing than do others. Marine nanoflagellates can be grown in the laboratory in batch cultures fed specific bacterial isolates. In some cultures, the flagellates appear unable to completely deplete the bacterial prey even when the bacterial strain otherwise is an excellent prey. This may indicate that some marine bacteria are able to induce defence mechanisms if they are grazed by nanoflagellates. Four morphologically distinct marine heterotrophic nanoflagellates, of which 3 were still identified as Procryptobia sorokini (Kinetoplastea) and one as Paraphysomonas imperforata (Chrysophyceae) were isolated from a coastal location along with 3 isolates of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. Flagellate growth and grazing on bacterial prey were analysed in batch cultures. Pseudoalteromonas was a suitable prey for all 4 flagellate isolates. They grazed and grew on Pseudoalteromonas as sole prey with maximal cell-specific growth rates of 0.1–0.25 h-1 and gross growth efficiencies of 38–61%. Exposure to dense flagellate cultures or their supernatants did, however, cause a fraction of the Pseudoalteromonas cells to aggregate and the bacterium became apparently resistant to grazing. Concentrations of suspended Pseudoalteromonas cells were therefore not decreased below 1,700–7,500 cells μL-1 by any of the flagellate isolates. These results indicate that Pseudoalteromonas sp. can be an excellent prey to marine nanoflagellates but also that is in possession of inducible mechanisms that protect against flagellate grazing."
https://openalex.org/W2804072645,"Genetic variation is an important determinant affecting either drug response or susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. Several studies have highlighted the importance of ethnicity in influencing drug response variability that should be considered during drug development. Our objective is to characterize the genetic variability of some pharmacogenes involved in the response to drugs used for the treatment of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in Tunisia and to compare our results to the worldwide populations. A set of 135 Tunisians was genotyped using the Affymetrix Chip 6.0 genotyping array. Variants located in 24 Very Important Pharmacogenes (VIP) involved in MetS drug response were extracted from the genotyping data. Analysis of variant distribution in Tunisian population compared to 20 worldwide populations publicly available was performed using R software packages. Common variants between Tunisians and the 20 investigated populations were extracted from genotyping data. Multidimensional screening showed that Tunisian population is clustered with North African and European populations. The greatest divergence was observed with the African and Asian population. In addition, we performed Inter-ethnic comparison based on the genotype frequencies of five VIP biomarkers. The genotype frequencies of the biomarkers rs3846662, rs1045642, rs7294 and rs12255372 located respectively in HMGCR, ABCB1, VKORC1 and TCF7L2 are similar between Tunisian, Tuscan (TSI) and European (CEU). The genotype frequency of the variant rs776746 located in CYP3A5 gene is similar between Tunisian and African populations and different from CEU and TSI. The present study shows that the genetic make up of the Tunisian population is relatively complex in regard to pharmacogenes and reflects previous historical events. It is important to consider this ethnic difference in drug prescription in order to optimize drug response to avoid serious adverse drug reactions. Taking into account similarities with other neighboring populations, our study has an impact not only on the Tunisian population but also on North African population which are underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2950520478,"The results of our recent study on mathematical modeling of microbial genome evolution indicate that, on average, genomes of bacteria and archaea evolve in the regime of mutation-selection balance defined by positive selection coefficients associated with gene acquisition that is counter-acted by the intrinsic deletion bias. This analysis was based on the strong assumption that parameters of genome evolution are universal across the diversity of bacteria and archaea, and yielded extremely low values of the selection coefficient. Here we further refine the modeling approach by taking into account evolutionary factors specific for individual groups of microbes using two independent fitting strategies, an ad hoc hard fitting scheme and a mixture model. The resulting estimate of the mean selection coefficient of s∼10-10 associated with the gain of one gene implies that, on average, acquisition of a gene is beneficial, and that microbial genomes typically evolve under a weak selection regime that might transition to strong selection in highly abundant organisms with large effective population sizes. The apparent selective pressure towards larger genomes is balanced by the deletion bias, which is estimated to be consistently greater than unity for all analyzed groups of microbes. The estimated values of s are more realistic than the lower values obtained previously, indicating that global and group-specific evolutionary factors synergistically affect microbial genome evolution that seems to be driven primarily by adaptation to existence in diverse niches."
https://openalex.org/W2797836308,"Fitting canine cancer incidences through a conventional regression model assumes constant statistical relationships across the study area in estimating the model coefficients. However, it is often more realistic to consider that these relationships may vary over space. Such a condition, known as spatial non-stationarity, implies that the model coefficients need to be estimated locally. In these kinds of local models, the geographic scale, or spatial extent, employed for coefficient estimation may also have a pervasive influence. This is because important variations in the local model coefficients across geographic scales may impact the understanding of local relationships. In this study, we fitted canine cancer incidences across Swiss municipal units through multiple regional models. We computed diagnostic summaries across the different regional models, and contrasted them with the diagnostics of the conventional regression model, using value-by-alpha maps and scalograms. The results of this comparative assessment enabled us to identify variations in the goodness-of-fit and coefficient estimates. We detected spatially non-stationary relationships, in particular, for the variables related to biological risk factors. These variations in the model coefficients were more important at small geographic scales, making a case for the need to model canine cancer incidences locally in contrast to more conventional global approaches. However, we contend that prior to undertaking local modeling efforts, a deeper understanding of the effects of geographic scale is needed to better characterize and identify local model relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2797485905,"TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, Drosophila melanogaster is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein in vivo. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3'-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of Drosophila RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing. Our results introduce RhoGAPp190 as a novel potential mediator in the complex scenario of events resulting from in vivo tbph loss-of-function."
https://openalex.org/W2797452200,"We present a fast, robust and parsimonious approach to detecting signals in an ordered sequence of numbers. Our motivation is in seeking a suitable method to take a sequence of scores corresponding to properties of positions in virus genomes, and find outlying regions of low scores. Suitable statistical methods without using complex models or making many assumptions are surprisingly lacking. We resolve this by developing a method that detects regions of low score within sequences of real numbers. The method makes no assumptions a priori about the length of such a region; it gives the explicit location of the region and scores it statistically. It does not use detailed mechanistic models so the method is fast and will be useful in a wide range of applications. We present our approach in detail, and test it on simulated sequences. We show that it is robust to a wide range of signal morphologies, and that it is able to capture multiple signals in the same sequence. Finally we apply it to viral genomic data to identify regions of evolutionary conservation within influenza and rotavirus."
