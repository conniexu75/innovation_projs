https://openalex.org/W1996858864,The spectral reflectivity (0.30 to 1.10 microns) of several asteroids has been measured for the first time. The reflection spectrum for Vesta contains a strong absorption band centered near 0.9 micron and a weaker absorption feature between 0.5 and 0.6 micron. The reflectivity decreases strongly in the ultraviolet. The reflection spectrum for the asteroid Pallas and probably for Ceres does not contain the 0.9-micron band. Vesta shows the strongest and best-defined absorption bands yet seen in the reflection spectrum for the solid surface of an object in the solar system. The strong 0.9-micron band arises from electronic absorptions in ferrous iron on the M2 site of a magnesian pyroxene. Comparison with laboratory measurements on meteorites and Apollo 11 samples indicates that the surface of Vesta has a composition very similar to that of certain basaltic achondrites.

Octopamine injection produces sustained extension of the limbs and abdomen; serotonin injection produces sustained flexion. Neurophysiological analyses show that these postures can be accounted for by opposing, coordinated effects of these amines on patterns of motoneuron activity recorded from the ventral nerve cord."

The correlation of the largest observed anomalies (m approximately 10(16) gauss-cubic centimeters) with unusual, relatively high albedo surface features may therefore imply that solar wind ion bombardment is an important determinant of the optical properties of the lunar surface."
https://openalex.org/W2042193351,"The formamidine pesticide chlordimeform and its N-demethylated metabolites cause the light organ of the firefly Photinus pyralis L. to glow brightly. Monodemethyl chlordimeform is active at doses as low as 5 nanograms per insect when applied topically. This action is postsynaptic and probably involves membrane-bound receptors since cyproheptadine blocks the glows induced by both monodemethyl chlordimeform and octopamine, the putative neurotransmitter in the light organ. The pesticidal and pestistatic properties of the formamidines may result from actions on octopaminergic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2021531369,"Observations of 23 transits of Mercury in front of the sun between 1736 and 1973 show no indication of any significant change in the diameter of the sun. Regression analysis yields a decrease of the angular diameter, as viewed from the earth, of under 0.3 arc second per century (> 90 percent confidence limit). This limit is incompatible with the 2 arc seconds per century decrease obtained by Eddy for the equatorial diameter from direct observations made at the Greenwich Observatory and at the U.S. Naval Observatory."
https://openalex.org/W2094248183,"Angular scattering in the interstellar medium results in multipath dispersion which can amount to more than one pulse period for pulsars of short period and high dispersion measure. The dispersion, if operative, imposes on the pulsation flux a cutoff inversely proportional to the fourth power of the observing wavelength. The low-frequency pulse shape of pulsar NP0532 suggests that this pulsar is subject to such scattering and that the observed low-frequency cutoff in the apparent spectrum is not an intrinsic property of the pulsar. In fact, there is evidence that NP0532 may be identified as the compact, low-frequency source in the Crab Nebula and that the pulsar may radiate in accordance with its high-frequency spectrum down to frequencies as low as 10 megahertz, although the periodic time variations are suppressed by the scattering below 100 megahertz."

The visible light spectrum, chromatographic behavior, HCl number, infrared spectrum, and mass spectrum of one of the pigments extracted is indicative of methyl pheophorbide a. This is the oldest occurrence of fossil phorbins reported."
https://openalex.org/W2005227456,"The high-magnesian calcite fraction of a shallow-water carbonate sand was converted to low-magnesian calcite after transport to the deep sea; strontium was also leached from the carbonate. Oxygen isotopic ratios indicate that loss of magnesium and strontium took place during recrystallization of the carbonate in the deep sea; this process did not alter textures of skeletal fragments. Previously, high-magnesian, calcite was thought only to dissolve in the deep sea."

https://openalex.org/W2064337294,"A radiocarbon-dated pollen diagram from a depression near the end of the southeast arm of Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, records the vegetation sequence from the retreat of Late Wisconsin (Pinedale) ice to the present time. The tundra Picea-Abies-Pinus albicaulis (spruce-fir-whitebark pine) parkland vegetation inferred during late glacial time changed rapidly to a Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) forest shortly before 11,550 carbon-14 years ago, suggesting a warming trend at that time. The Pinus contorta forest persisted with minor modification throughout postglacial time."

The form of the shoot apex, cellular organization, andleaf arrangement (phyllotaxis) can be observed, perphaps as they have never been visualized before."

Over a 9-month period the attenuation (typically from clouds) exceeded 10, 20, and 30 decibels for 48, 43, and 34 percent of the time."
