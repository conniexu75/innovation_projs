https://openalex.org/W3127466677,"Moir\'e superlattices have recently emerged as a novel platform where correlated physics and superconductivity can be studied with unprecedented tunability. Although correlated effects have been observed in several other moir\'e systems, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) remains the only one where robust superconductivity has been reproducibly measured. Here we realize a new moir\'e superconductor, mirror symmetric magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) with dramatically richer tunability in electronic structure and superconducting properties. Hall effect and quantum oscillations measurements as a function of density and electric field allow us to determine the system's tunable phase boundaries in the normal state. Zero magnetic field resistivity measurements then reveal that the existence of superconductivity is intimately connected to the broken symmetry phase emerging from two carriers per moir\'e unit cell. Strikingly, we find that the superconducting phase gets suppressed and bounded at the van Hove singularities (vHs) partially surrounding the broken-symmetry phase, which is difficult to reconcile with weak-coupling BCS theory. Moreover, the extensive in situ tunability of our system allows us to achieve the ultra-strong coupling regime, characterized by a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length reaching the average inter-particle distance and very large $T_\mathrm{BKT}/T_{F}$ ratios in excess of 0.1, where $T_\mathrm{BKT}$ and $T_F$ are the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and Fermi temperatures, respectively. These observations suggest that MATTG can be electrically tuned close to the two-dimensional BCS-BEC crossover. Our results establish a new generation of tunable moir\'e superconductors with the potential to revolutionize our fundamental understanding and the applications of strong coupling superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W3128620467,"Fibrosis is a common pathological response to inflammation in many peripheral tissues and can prevent tissue regeneration and repair. Here, we identified persistent fibrotic scarring in the CNS following immune cell infiltration in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Using lineage tracing and single-cell sequencing in EAE, we determined that the majority of the fibrotic scar is derived from proliferative CNS fibroblasts, not pericytes or infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells. Ablating proliferating fibrotic cells using cell-specific expression of herpes thymidine kinase led to an increase in oligodendrocyte lineage cells within the inflammatory lesions and a reduction in motor disability. We further identified that interferon-gamma pathway genes are enriched in CNS fibrotic cells, and the fibrotic cell-specific deletion of Ifngr1 resulted in reduced fibrotic scarring in EAE. These data delineate a framework for understanding the CNS fibrotic response."

https://openalex.org/W3010510189,"Anxiety is a negative emotional state that is overly displayed in anxiety disorders and depression. Although anxiety is known to be controlled by distributed brain networks, key components for its initiation, maintenance and coordination with behavioral state remain poorly understood. Here, we report that anxiogenic stressors elicit acute and prolonged responses in glutamatergic neurons of the mouse medial preoptic area (mPOA). These neurons encode extremely negative valence and mediate the induction and expression of anxiety-like behaviors. Conversely, mPOA GABA-containing neurons encode positive valence and produce anxiolytic effects. Such opposing roles are mediated by competing local interactions and long-range projections of neurons to the periaqueductal gray. The two neuronal populations antagonistically regulate anxiety-like and parental behaviors: anxiety is reduced, while parenting is enhanced and vice versa. Thus, by evaluating negative and positive valences through distinct but interacting circuits, the mPOA coordinates emotional state and social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3127253642,"Background In adolescents with severe and persistent gender dysphoria (GD), gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) are used from early/middle puberty with the aim of delaying irreversible and unwanted pubertal body changes. Evidence of outcomes of pubertal suppression in GD is limited. Methods We undertook an uncontrolled prospective observational study of GnRHa as monotherapy in 44 12–15 year olds with persistent and severe GD. Prespecified analyses were limited to key outcomes: bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD); Child Behaviour CheckList (CBCL) total t-score; Youth Self-Report (YSR) total t-score; CBCL and YSR self-harm indices; at 12, 24 and 36 months. Semistructured interviews were conducted on GnRHa. Results 44 patients had data at 12 months follow-up, 24 at 24 months and 14 at 36 months. All had normal karyotype and endocrinology consistent with birth-registered sex. All achieved suppression of gonadotropins by 6 months. At the end of the study one ceased GnRHa and 43 (98%) elected to start cross-sex hormones. There was no change from baseline in spine BMD at 12 months nor in hip BMD at 24 and 36 months, but at 24 months lumbar spine BMC and BMD were higher than at baseline (BMC +6.0 (95% CI: 4.0, 7.9); BMD +0.05 (0.03, 0.07)). There were no changes from baseline to 12 or 24 months in CBCL or YSR total t-scores or for CBCL or YSR self-harm indices, nor for CBCL total t-score or self-harm index at 36 months. Most participants reported positive or a mixture of positive and negative life changes on GnRHa. Anticipated adverse events were common. Conclusions Overall patient experience of changes on GnRHa treatment was positive. We identified no changes in psychological function. Changes in BMD were consistent with suppression of growth. Larger and longer-term prospective studies using a range of designs are needed to more fully quantify the benefits and harms of pubertal suppression in GD."
https://openalex.org/W3129180813,"The experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.We conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between May 12 and August 6, 2020, we collected qualitative and quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse responses.669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since COVID-19. The most common barriers reported to affect patients were: fear of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28% of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also severely impacted. Strategies to address reduced transport needs and costs-including proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate lower cost or easier travel-were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted according to 36% and 31% of HIV and TB respondents respectively; qualitative data suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated.Patients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in accessing healthcare facilities, and non-medical support for patients was particularly impacted. Synthesising recommendations of frontline professionals should be prioritised for informing policymakers and healthcare service delivery organisations."
https://openalex.org/W3126554402,"Airborne transmission is predicted to be a prevalent route of human exposure with SARS-CoV-2. Aside from African green monkeys, nonhuman primate models that replicate airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been investigated. A comparative evaluation of COVID-19 in African green monkeys, rhesus macaques, and cynomolgus macaques following airborne exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was performed to determine critical disease parameters associated with disease progression, and establish correlations between primate and human COVID-19. Respiratory abnormalities and viral shedding were noted for all animals, indicating successful infection. Cynomolgus macaques developed fever, and thrombocytopenia was measured for African green monkeys and rhesus macaques. Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and alveolar fibrosis were more frequently observed in lung tissue from cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys. The data indicate that, in addition to African green monkeys, macaques can be successfully infected by airborne SARS-CoV-2, providing viable macaque natural transmission models for medical countermeasure evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3128022553,"Noncoding RNAs are exquisitely titrated by the cellular RNA surveillance machinery for regulating diverse biological processes. The RNA exosome, the predominant 3' RNA exoribonuclease in mammalian cells, is composed of nine core and two catalytic subunits. Here, we developed a mouse model with a conditional allele to study the RNA exosome catalytic subunit DIS3. In DIS3-deficient B cells, integrity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus in its topologically associating domain is affected, with accumulation of DNA-associated RNAs flanking CTCF-binding elements, decreased CTCF binding to CTCF-binding elements and disorganized cohesin localization. DIS3-deficient B cells also accumulate activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated asymmetric nicks, altering somatic hypermutation patterns and increasing microhomology-mediated end-joining DNA repair. Altered mutation patterns and Igh architectural defects in DIS3-deficient B cells lead to decreased class-switch recombination but increased chromosomal translocations. Our observations of DIS3-mediated architectural regulation at the Igh locus are reflected genome wide, thus providing evidence that noncoding RNA processing is an important mechanism for controlling genome organization."
https://openalex.org/W3127497789,"Splitting bioactive proteins into conditionally reconstituting fragments is a powerful strategy for building tools to study and control biological systems. However, split proteins often exhibit a high propensity to reconstitute, even without the conditional trigger, limiting their utility. Current approaches for tuning reconstitution propensity are laborious, context-specific or often ineffective. Here, we report a computational design strategy grounded in fundamental protein biophysics to guide experimental evaluation of a sparse set of mutants to identify an optimal functional window. We hypothesized that testing a limited set of mutants would direct subsequent mutagenesis efforts by predicting desirable mutant combinations from a vast mutational landscape. This strategy varies the degree of interfacial destabilization while preserving stability and catalytic activity. We validate our method by solving two distinct split protein design challenges, generating both design and mechanistic insights. This new technology will streamline the generation and use of split protein systems for diverse applications."
https://openalex.org/W3126778221,"This study aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 distress on psychological status, features of central sensitization and facial pain severity in people with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). In this prospective cohort study, 45 adults (19 chronic, 26 acute/subacute TMD) were recruited prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Baseline assessment took place before the outbreak while a follow-up was performed immediately after the lockdown period. Multiple variables were investigated including age, gender, perceived life quality, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, coping strategies, central sensitization, pain intensity, pain-related disability and oral behaviour. COVID Stress Scales (CSS) were applied at follow-up to measure the extent of COVID-related distress. CSS were significantly higher in those with chronic TMDs compared to those with acute/subacute TMDs (p&lt;0.05). In people with chronic TMD, the variation in anxiety and depression from baseline to follow-up was significantly correlated with scores on the CSS (r = 0.72; p = 0.002). Variations of the central sensitization inventory (r = 0.57; p = 0.020) and graded chronic pain scale (r = 0.59; p = 0.017) were significantly correlated with scores on the CSS. These initial findings indicate that people with chronic TMD were more susceptible to COVID-19 distress with deterioration of psychological status, worsening features of central sensitization and increased chronic facial pain severity. These findings reinforce the role of stress as a possible amplifier of central sensitization, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and pain-related disability in people with TMDs.

https://openalex.org/W3128359329,"Naive epiblast and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) give rise to all cells of adults. Such developmental plasticity is associated with genome hypomethylation. Here, we show that LIF–Stat3 signaling induces genomic hypomethylation via metabolic reconfiguration. Stat3−/− ESCs show decreased α-ketoglutarate production from glutamine, leading to increased Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression and DNA methylation. Notably, genome methylation is dynamically controlled through modulation of α-ketoglutarate availability or Stat3 activation in mitochondria. Alpha-ketoglutarate links metabolism to the epigenome by reducing the expression of Otx2 and its targets Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Genetic inactivation of Otx2 or Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b results in genomic hypomethylation even in the absence of active LIF–Stat3. Stat3−/− ESCs show increased methylation at imprinting control regions and altered expression of cognate transcripts. Single-cell analyses of Stat3−/− embryos confirmed the dysregulated expression of Otx2, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b as well as imprinted genes. Several cancers display Stat3 overactivation and abnormal DNA methylation; therefore, the molecular module that we describe might be exploited under pathological conditions. Stat3 depletion in pluripotent cells decreases α-ketoglutarate and increases the expression of Otx2 and its targets Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, leading to global DNA hypermethylation."
https://openalex.org/W3127489401,"The spike (S) protein is one of the three proteins forming the coronaviruses’ viral envelope. The S protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a spatial structure similar to the S proteins of other mammalian coronaviruses, except for a unique receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a significant inducer of host immune response. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD is widely used as a highly specific minimal antigen for serological tests. Correct exposure of antigenic determinants has a significant impact on the accuracy of such tests–the antigen has to be correctly folded, contain no potentially antigenic non-vertebrate glycans, and, preferably, should have a glycosylation pattern similar to the native S protein. Based on the previously developed p1.1 vector, containing the regulatory sequences of the Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene ( EEF1A1 ) from Chinese hamster, we created two expression constructs encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD with C-terminal c-myc and polyhistidine tags. RBDv1 contained a native viral signal peptide, RBDv2 –human tPA signal peptide. We transfected a CHO DG44 cell line, selected stably transfected cells, and performed a few rounds of methotrexate-driven amplification of the genetic cassette in the genome. For the RBDv2 variant, a high-yield clonal producer cell line was obtained. We developed a simple purification scheme that consistently yielded up to 30 mg of RBD protein per liter of the simple shake flask cell culture. Purified proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in reducing and non-reducing conditions and gel filtration; for RBDv2 protein, the monomeric form content exceeded 90% for several series. Deglycosylation with PNGase F and mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of N-glycosylation. The antigen produced by the described technique is suitable for serological tests and subunit vaccine studies."
https://openalex.org/W3128326787,"Cells achieve highly efficient and accurate communication through cellular projections such as neurites and filopodia, yet there is a lack of genetically encoded tools that can selectively manipulate their composition and dynamics. Here, we present a versatile optogenetic toolbox of artificial multi-headed myosin motors that can move bidirectionally within long cellular extensions and allow for the selective transport of GFP-tagged cargo with light. Utilizing these engineered motors, we could transport bulky transmembrane receptors and organelles as well as actin remodellers to control the dynamics of both filopodia and neurites. Using an optimized in vivo imaging scheme, we further demonstrate that, upon limb amputation in axolotls, a complex array of filopodial extensions is formed. We selectively modulated these filopodial extensions and showed that they re-establish a Sonic Hedgehog signalling gradient during regeneration. Considering the ubiquitous existence of actin-based extensions, this toolbox shows the potential to manipulate cellular communication with unprecedented accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3128204384,"Muscle wasting in cancer is associated with deficits in protein synthesis, yet, the mechanisms underlying this anabolic impairment remain poorly understood. The capacity for protein synthesis is mainly determined by the abundance of muscle ribosomes, which is in turn regulated by transcription of the ribosomal (r)RNA genes (rDNA). In this study, we investigated whether muscle loss in a preclinical model of ovarian cancer is associated with a reduction in ribosomal capacity and was a consequence of impaired rDNA transcription. Tumor bearing resulted in a significant loss in gastrocnemius muscle weight and protein synthesis capacity, and was consistent with a significant reduction in rDNA transcription and ribosomal capacity. Despite the induction of the ribophagy receptor NUFIP1 mRNA and the loss of NUFIP1 protein, in vitro studies revealed that while inhibition of autophagy rescued NUFIP1, it did not prevent the loss of rRNA. Electrophoretic analysis of rRNA fragmentation from both in vivo and in vitro models showed no evidence of endonucleolytic cleavage, suggesting that rRNA degradation may not play a major role in modulating muscle ribosome abundance. Our results indicate that in this model of ovarian cancer-induced cachexia, the ability of skeletal muscle to synthesize protein is compromised by a reduction in rDNA transcription and consequently a lower ribosomal capacity. Thus, impaired ribosomal production appears to play a key role in the anabolic deficits associated with muscle wasting in cancer cachexia."
https://openalex.org/W3128833703,"Tertiary study presents students with a number of pressures and challenges. Thus, mental resilience plays a key role in students’ well-being and performance. Resilience research has moved away from conceptualising resilience as a trait and towards studying resilience as a process by which resources protect against the negative impact of stressors to produce positive outcomes. However, there is a lack of research in the academic domain examining the mechanisms underlying this process. This study addressed this gap by examining a range of personal resilience resources and their interaction with coping responses to produce positive adaptation outcomes, in a sample of 306 undergraduate students. Firstly, individual differences in resilience were examined, whereby factor analysis resulted in self-report measures of resilience-related attributes converging onto an overarching factor. The extracted factor was then validated against markers of positive adaptation (mental well-being, university adjustment, and somatic health symptoms), and the mediating roles of coping strategies were investigated through structural equation modelling. The resilience resources factor directly predicted mental well-being and adjustment; and indirectly predicted adjustment and somatic health symptoms through support-seeking and avoidant coping, respectively. These findings have theoretical implications for how resilience is conceptualised, as well as practical implications for improving student well-being and adjustment through promoting social support and reducing disengaged and avoidant coping strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3128805173,"Introduction Anemia is a common condition at tuberculosis diagnosis, and there is evidence that its prevalence is higher in patients with tuberculosis than in those infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and healthy controls. Information about anemia during tuberculosis diagnosis is still scarce in the Brazilian population. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of anemia in patients with tuberculosis cared for at a referral center and its association with clinical forms of tuberculosis and other characteristics of these patients. Materials and methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of tuberculosis patients diagnosed from January 2015 to December 2018 at the Clinical Research Laboratory on Mycobacteria (LAPCLIN-TB) of Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI)/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz). A database of an ongoing cohort study underway at this service since 2000 provided the baseline information on tuberculosis cases extracted from a visit template. Exploratory and logistic regression analyses were performed to verify associations between anemia and demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, clinical conditions, and laboratory results. Results Of the 328 cases reviewed, 70 were excluded, with258 retained. The prevalence of anemia was 61.2% (27.5% mild, 27.5% moderate and 6.2% severe). Among patients with anemia, 60.8% had normochromic normocytic anemia, and 27.8% showed hypochromic microcytic anemia. In logistic regression analysis, anemia was associated with a history of weight loss &gt;10%, hospitalizations, coinfection with HIV, increased platelet count and microcytosis. Anemia was more frequent in the most severe clinical forms, such as meningeal and disseminated tuberculosis. Conclusions Anemia was highly prevalent in tuberculosis patients at diagnosis, predominantly as normochromic normocytic anemia and in mild and moderate forms. It was associated with baseline characteristics and conditions indicative of severe disease, suggesting that anemia could be a biomarker of tuberculosis severity."
https://openalex.org/W3128765597,"Objectives This study aimed to clarify the relationship between the white blood cell (WBC) count and hypertension in the general Japanese population. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using annual health check-up data of residents of Iki City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. A total of 2935 participants without hypertension at baseline were included in the present analysis. WBC counts were classified as tertile 1 (&lt;4700/μL), tertile 2 (4700–5999/μL), and tertile 3 (≥6000/μL). The outcome was incident hypertension (blood pressure ≥140 mmHg). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Result During an average follow-up of 4.5 years, 908 participants developed hypertension. The incidence (per 100 person-years) of hypertension increased with an elevation in the WBC count (6.3 in tertile 1, 7.0 in tertile 2, and 7.4 in tertile 3). This association was significant, even after adjustment for other risk factors, including age, sex, current smoking habits, current alcohol intake, exercise habits, obesity, elevated blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. The hazard ratios were 1.07 for tertile 2 (95% CI 0.90–1.26) and 1.27 for tertile 3 (95% CI 1.06–1.51) compared with the reference group of tertile 1 (p = 0.009). Conclusion The WBC count was associated with future development of hypertension in the general Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W3126541165,"Undocumented status is widely recognized as an important social determinant of health. While undocumented immigrants have lower levels of health care access, they do not have consistently poorer physical health than the US-born or other immigrant groups. Furthermore, heterogeneity by race/ethnicity has been largely ignored in this growing literature. This paper used the 2001, 2004, 2008 panels of the restricted Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), one of the only representative surveys equipped to adequately identify Asian undocumented immigrants, to compare health patterns between Asians and Latinos by immigration status. We examined three general measures of health/health access: self-rated health, disability, and current health insurance. Latino undocumented immigrants displayed some advantages in self-rated health and disability but had lower insurance coverage compared to US-born Latinos. In contrast, Asian undocumented immigrants did not differ from US-born Asians in any of the three outcomes. While undocumented status has been proposed as a fundamental cause of disease, we found no evidence that Latino and Asian undocumented immigrants consistently fare worse in health access or physical health outcomes than immigrants in other status categories. Different racial groups also appeared to have unique patterns between immigration status and health outcomes from one another."
https://openalex.org/W3126274844,"Pollen metabarcoding has received much attention recently for its potential to increase taxonomic resolution of the identifications of pollen grains necessary for various public health, ecological and environmental inquiry. However, methodologies implemented are widely varied across studies confounding comparisons and casting uncertainty on the reliability of results. In this study, we investigated part of the methodology, the effects of level of exine rupture and lysis incubation time, on the performance of DNA extraction and Illumina sequencing. We examined 15 species of plants from 12 families with pollen that varies in size, shape, and aperture number to evaluate effort necessary for exine rupture. Then created mock communities of 14 of the species from DNA extractions at 4 levels of exine rupture (0, 33, 67, and 100%) and two levels of increased lysis incubation time without exine rupture (2 or 24 hours). Quantities of these DNA extractions displayed a positive correlation between increased rupture and DNA yield, however increasing time of lysis incubation was associated with decreased DNA yield. Illumina sequencing was performed with these artificial community treatments with three common plant DNA barcode regions ( rbcL , ITS1, ITS2) with two different primer pairings for ITS2 and rbcL . We found decreased performance in treatments with 0% or 100% exine rupture compared to 33% and 67% rupture, based on deviation from expected proportions and species retrieval, and increased lysis incubation was found to be detrimental to results."
https://openalex.org/W3127246313,"This research paper aims to understand the effects of time spent in domestic work, including childcare, on women’s mental health in Ghana. The paper adopted a triangulation convergence mixed methods approach. The quantitative information was sourced from two waves (2009/ 2014) of the Ghana Socioeconomic Panel Survey (GSEPS) while qualitative information was obtained from in-depth interviews with couples and key informants from five (5) regions, representing diverse ethnic backgrounds, in Ghana. Employing fixed effects regressions and a multinomial logistic regression model with fixed effects, we find that domestic work contributes to poorer mental health outcomes among women. These results are consistent, even when we correct for potential self-selectivity of women into domestic work. We also examine whether the relationship is differentiated between women of higher and lower socioeconomic status. We find that women from wealthier households who spend increasing time in domestic work have higher odds of mental distress. These results are supported by the qualitative data- women indicate increasing stress levels from domestic work and while some husbands acknowledge the situation of their overburdened wives and make attempts, however minor, to help, others cite social norms and cultural expectations that act as a deterrent to men’s assistance with domestic work. Efforts should be made to lessen the effects of social and cultural norms which continue to encourage gendered distributions of domestic work. This may be done through increased education, sensitization and general re-socialization of both men and women about the need for more egalitarian divisions of household work."
https://openalex.org/W3126154687,"Introduction Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) improves outcomes for people living with HIV (PLWH) but requires adherence to daily dosing. Suboptimal adherence results in reduced treatment effectiveness, increased costs, and greater risk of resistance and onwards transmission. Treatment with long-acting (LA), injection-based ART administered by healthcare professionals (directly observed therapy (DOT)) eliminates the need for adherence to daily dosing and may improve clinical outcomes. This study reports the cost-effectiveness of the cabotegravir plus rilpivirine LA regimen (CAB+RPV LA) and models the potential impact of LA DOT therapies. Methods Parameterisation was performed using pooled data from recent CAB+RPV LA Phase III trials. The analysis was conducted using a cohort-level hybrid decision-tree and state-transition model, with states defined by viral load and CD4 cell count. The efficacy of oral cART was adjusted to reflect adherence to daily regimens from published data. A Canadian health service perspective was adopted. Results CAB+RPV LA is predicted to be the dominant intervention when compared to oral cART, generating, per 1,000 patients treated, lifetime cost-savings of $1.5 million, QALY and life-year gains of 107 and 138 respectively with three new HIV cases averted. Conclusions Economic evaluations of LA DOTs need to account for the impact of adherence and HIV transmission. This study adds to the existing literature by incorporating transmission and using clinical data from the first LA DOT regimen. Providing PLWH and healthcare providers with novel modes of ART administration, enhancing individualisation of treatment, may facilitate the achievement of UNAIDS 95-95-95 objectives."
https://openalex.org/W3127793006,"Background The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of changes of nutritional status and body composition on the results of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in inpatients of a geriatric ward. Sex differences in these relationships were also investigated. Methods A total of 212 elderly patients (&gt;65 years old) admitted to the geriatric ward at the University of Tokyo hospital between 2012 and 2019 were enrolled in this study. CGA (ADL, IADL, MMSE, GDS, Vitality Index) was performed, along with assessment of body compositions (appendicular muscle mass, abdominal muscle mass, body fat mass) and blood malnutrition biomarkers (serum albumin, pre-albumin, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, zinc, hemoglobin concentrations). Results Multiple linear regression analysis showed that upper, lower limbs and abdominal muscle masses were significantly associated with the score on ADL in men. On the other hand, abdominal muscle mass was negatively associated with the scores on GDS. Body fat mass was also negatively associated with the score on IADL. In contrast, in women, multiple linear regression analysis failed to show any significant associations between body composition parameters and scores on any domains of CGA. Unlike in men, however, blood malnutrition biomarkers were significantly associated with ADL, IADL, MMSE, and Vitality Index in women. Conclusions Our study findings revealed that the association of the nutritional status and body composition with the functional status in the elderly differs by sex. These results suggest that intensification of exercise in men and improvement of the nutritional status in women are particularly useful to maintain the functional status."
https://openalex.org/W3128178271,"In the area of mood profiling, six distinct profiles are reported in the literature, termed the iceberg, inverse iceberg, inverse Everest, shark fin, surface, and submerged profiles. We investigated if the prevalence of the six mood profiles varied by sex, age, and education among a large heterogeneous sample. The Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) was completed via the In The Mood website by 15,692 participants. A seeded k-means cluster analysis was used to confirm the six profiles, and discriminant function analysis was used to validate cluster classifications. Significant variations in the prevalence of mood profiles by sex, age, and education status were confirmed. For example, females more frequently reported negative mood profiles than males, and older and more highly educated participants had a higher prevalence of the iceberg profile than their younger and lesser educated counterparts. Findings suggest that refinement of the existing tables of normative data for the BRUMS should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3126418166,"Background Ethiopia launched the Health Extension Program (HEP) in 2004, aimed at ensuring equitable community-level healthcare services through Health Extension Workers. Despite the program’s being a flagship initiative, there is limited evidence on whether investment in the program represents good value for money. This study assessed the cost and cost-effectiveness of HEP interventions to inform policy decisions for resource allocation and priority setting in Ethiopia. Methods Twenty-one health care interventions were selected under the hygiene and sanitation, family health services, and disease prevention and control sub-domains. The ingredient bottom-up and top-down costing method was employed. Cost and cost-effectiveness were assessed from the provider perspective. Health outcomes were measured using life years gained (LYG). Incremental cost per LYG in relation to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Ethiopia (US$852.80) was used to ascertain the cost-effectiveness. All costs were collected in Ethiopian birr and converted to United States dollars (US$) using the average exchange rate for 2018 (US$1 = 27.67 birr). Both costs and health outcomes were discounted by 3%. Result The average unit cost of providing selected hygiene and sanitation, family health, and disease prevention and control services with the HEP was US$0.70, US$4.90, and US$7.40, respectively. The major cost driver was drugs and supplies, accounting for 53% and 68%, respectively, of the total cost. The average annual cost of delivering all the selected interventions was US$9,897. All interventions fall within 1 times GDP per capita per LYG, indicating that they are very cost-effective (ranges: US$22–$295 per LYG). Overall, the HEP is cost-effective by investing US$77.40 for every LYG. Conclusion The unit cost estimates of HEP interventions are crucial for priority-setting, resource mobilization, and program planning. This study found that the program is very cost-effective in delivering community health services."
https://openalex.org/W3128098087,"To study aquaporin channel expression in astrocytes of the mouse optic nerve (ON) and the response to IOP elevation in mice lacking aquaporin 4 (AQP4 null).C57BL/6 (B6) and AQP4 null mice were exposed to bead-induced IOP elevation for 3 days (3D-IOP), 1 and 6 weeks. Mouse ocular tissue sections were immunolabeled against aquaporins 1(AQP1), 4(AQP4), and 9(AQP9). Ocular tissue was imaged to identify normal AQP distribution, ON changes, and axon loss after IOP elevation. Ultrastructure examination, cell proliferation, gene expression, and transport block were also analyzed.B6 mice had abundant AQP4 expression in Müller cells, astrocytes of retina and myelinated ON (MON), but minimal AQP4in prelaminar and unmyelinated ON (UON). MON of AQP4 nulls had smaller ON area, smaller axon diameter, higher axon density, and larger proportionate axon area than B6 (all p≤0.05). Bead-injection led to comparable 3D-IOP elevation (p = 0.42) and axonal transport blockade in both strains. In B6, AQP4 distribution was unchanged after 3D-IOP. At baseline, AQP1 and AQP9 were present in retina, but not in UON and this was unaffected after IOP elevation in both strains. In 3D-IOP mice, ON astrocytes and microglia proliferated, more in B6 than AQP4 null. After 6 week IOP elevation, axon loss occurred equally in the two mouse types (24.6%, AQP4 null vs. 23.3%, B6).Lack of AQP4 was neither protective nor detrimental to the effects of IOP elevation. The minimal presence of AQP4 in UON may be a vital aspect of the regionally specific phenotype of astrocytes in the mouse optic nerve head."
https://openalex.org/W3128822428,"Background This study tested the hypothesis that sarcopenia and its constituent components, reduced lean muscle mass and impaired motor function, are associated with reduced survival and increased risk of incident disabilities. Methods 1466 community-dwelling older adults underwent assessment of muscle mass with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), grip strength, gait speed and other components of physical frailty and annual self-report assessments of disability. We used Cox proportional hazards models that controlled for age, sex, race, education and height to examine the associations of a continuous sarcopenia metric with the hazard of death and incident disabilities. Results Mean baseline age was about 80 years old and follow-up was 5.5 years. In a proportional hazards model controlling for age, sex, race, education and baseline sarcopenia, each 1-SD higher score on a continuous sarcopenia scale was associated with lower hazards of death (HR 0.70, 95%CI [0.62, 0.78]), incident IADL (HR 0.80,95%CI [0.70, 0.93]), incident ADL disability (HR 0.80 95%CI [71, 91]) and incident mobility disability (HR 0.81, 95%CI [0.70, 0.93]). Further analyses suggest that grip strength and gait speed rather than muscle mass drive the associations with all four adverse health outcomes. Similar findings were observed when controlling for additional measures used to assess physical frailty including BMI, fatigue and physical activity. Conclusions Motor function is the primary driver of the associations of sarcopenia and physical frailty with diverse adverse health outcomes. Further work is needed to identify other facets of muscle structure and motor function which together can identify adults at risk for specific adverse health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3129054690,"Guinea, like many other African countries, has been facing an unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, since March 2020. In April 2020, Guinean National agency for health security recorded 1351 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 313 recoveries and 07 deaths. To address this health crisis, some drastic measures were implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those measures might potentially cause some psychological problems among Guineans. Thus, we conducted this study to assess the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 in the Guinean population. We carried out an online cross-sectional survey among internet users in Guinea. A free e-survey platform was used, and questionnaires were sent to internet users. The study ran from May 1 through May 10 2020. Participation in the study was voluntary. Data collection was based on sociodemographic information and self-reported questionnaires: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for stress evaluation, Penn state worry questionnaire (PSWQ), and an adapted Social Psychological Measurements of COVID-19. A total of 280 participants took part in the study; responses from 5 participants were deleted because of incompleteness. The average age of participants was 28.9 [95% CI: 28.1;29.6]. Most of participants were male 65.5% [95% CI: 59.5%;71.1%]. Unemployed participants stood for 48.7% [95% CI: 42.7%;54.8%]. IES-R scale for stress evaluation yielded the following findings: 19.6% (mild), 5.23% (moderate) and 9.15% (severe); 82.8% and 17.2% of participants had respectively reported low and moderate worry. No significant statistical association was found between sociodemographic variables and traumatic events (IES-R and PSWQ). However, 82% of our participants had to cope with the negative impacts of COVID-19. Although there were few cases of traumatic events, negative impacts of COVID-19 on study participants deserve to be underlined. So, further investigations are necessary to identify and disentangle specific psychosocial problems in different Guinean socio-cultural contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3127146890,"Background Studies from high income countries report that HIV-positive people have an impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function compared to HIV-negative people. It is unclear if results can be translated directly to the Sub-Saharan Africa context. This study assesses electro- and echocardiographic characteristics in an urban African population, comparing HIV-positive people (treated and not yet treated) with HIV-negative controls. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in Johannesburg, South Africa. We enrolled HIV-positive participants from three randomized controlled trials that had recruited participants from routine HIV testing programs. HIV-negative controls were recruited from the community. Data were collected on demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, medical history and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic characteristics. Results In total, 394 HIV-positive participants and 153 controls were enrolled. The mean age of HIV-positive participants was 40±9 years (controls: 35±10 years), and 34% were male (controls: 50%). Of HIV-positive participants 36% were overweight or obese (controls: 44%), 23% had hypertension (controls: 28%) and 12% were current smoker (controls: 37%). Median time since HIV diagnosis was 6.0 years (IQR 2.3–10.0) and median treatment duration was 4.0 years (IQR 0.0–8.0), 50% had undetectable viral load. The frequency of anatomical cardiac abnormalities was low and did not differ between people with and without HIV. We observed no relation between HIV or anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and systolic or diastolic heart function. There was an association between ART use and corrected QT interval: +11.8 ms compared to HIV-negative controls (p&lt;0.01) and +18.9 ms compared to ART-naïve participants (p = 0.01). We also observed a higher left ventricular mass index in participants on ART (+7.8 g/m 2 , p&lt;0.01), but this association disappeared after adjusting for CD4 cell count, viral load and HIV-duration. Conclusion The low number of major cardiac abnormalities in this relatively young, well managed urban African HIV-positive population is reassuring. The increase in corrected QT interval and left ventricular mass may contribute to higher cardiac mortality and morbidity in people living with HIV in the long term."

https://openalex.org/W3127426185,"Introduction Intimate Partner Violence is a global public health problem. Attitude towards wife-beating is a major determinant of both intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization. However, little is known about the attitudes of Ghanaian young people towards wife-beating. The objectives of this study were to assess young people’s attitudes towards wife-beating, and identify salient factors influencing young people’s acceptance of wife-beating. Methods Data used in this study were obtained from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. The survey was nationally representative and provides estimates for population and health indicators across the former ten regions of Ghana, including rural and urban areas. Data were analyzed with Stata/SE version 16. Results We found that 32% of young women and 19% of young men accepted wife-beating. Among young women, acceptance of wife-beating was significantly influenced by younger age, wealth index, low educational status, religion, the region of residence, ethnicity, frequency of reading newspaper and frequency of listening to radio ( p &lt; 0.05). Among young men, acceptance of wife-beating was significantly influenced by wealth index, the region of residence and frequency of reading newspaper ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that a substantial proportion of young people in Ghana accept wife-beating. Young women were more likely to accept wife-beating compared to young men. Acceptance of wife-beating was influenced by socio-demographic and behavioral factors. Efforts to end violence against women and girls in Ghana should focus on promoting girl education, economic empowerment of women and public education on laws that prohibit Intimate Partner Violence."
https://openalex.org/W3128402814,"Tail adipose as one of the important functional tissues can enhance hazardous environments tolerance for sheep. The objective of this study was to gain insight into the underlying development mechanisms of this trait. A quantitative analysis of protein abundance in ovine tail/rump adipose tissue was performed between Chinese local fat- (Kazakh, Hu and Lanzhou) and thin-tailed (Alpine Merino, Tibetan) sheep in the present study by using lable-free approach. Results showed that 3400 proteins were identified in the five breeds, and 804 were differentially expressed proteins, including 638 up regulated proteins and 83 down regulated proteins in the tail adipose tissues between fat- and thin-tailed sheep, and 8 clusters were distinguished for all the DEPs’ expression patterns. The differentially expressed proteins are mainly associated with metabolism pathways and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, the proteomics results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western Blot. Our research has also suggested that the up-regulated proteins ACSL1, HSD17β4, FABP4 in the tail adipose tissue might contribute to tail fat deposition by facilitating the proliferation of adipocytes and fat accumulation in tail/rump of sheep. Particularly, FABP4 highly expressed in the fat-tail will play an important role for tail fat deposition. Our study might provide a novel view to understanding fat accumulation in special parts of the body in sheep and other animals."

A previous literature review, highlighting factors influencing prescribing, identified only papers with nursing and pharmacy participants. This investigation explored consensus on factors affecting physiotherapist and pharmacist non-medical prescribers. A three round Delphi study was conducted with pharmacist and physiotherapist prescribers. Round One comprised information gathering on facilitators and barriers to prescribing participants had experienced, and underwent content analysis. This was followed by two sequential consensus seeking rounds with participants asked to rate the importance of statements to themselves. Consensus criteria were determined a priori, including median, interquartile range, percentage agreement and Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance (W). Statements reaching consensus were ranked for importance in Round Three and analysed to produce top ten ranks for all participants and for each professional group. Participants, recruited October 2018, comprised 24 pharmacists and 18 physiotherapists. In Round One, content analysis of 172 statements regarding prescribing influences revealed 24 themes. 127 statements were included in Round Two for importance rating (barriers = 68, facilitators = 59). After Round Two, 29 statements reached consensus (barriers = 1, facilitators = 28), with no further statements reaching consensus following Round Three. The highest ranked statement in Round Three overall was: “Being able to prescribe to patients is more effective and really useful working [in my area]”. Medical support and improved patient care factors appeared the most important. Differences were noted between physiotherapist and pharmacist prescribers regarding the top ten ranked statements, for example team working which pharmacists ranked higher than physiotherapists. Differences may be explained by the variety of practice areas and relative newness of physiotherapy prescribing. Barriers appear to be post or person specific, whereas facilitators appear universal."
https://openalex.org/W3127833991,"Reasons for dying (RFD) are one of the most authentic factors illustrating the lived experience of suicidal individuals. However, the field has been criticized for inadequate evaluation of risk factors and suicidal symptoms, such as RFD, to develop more robust theoretical models and risk assessments. In this study, we aimed to critically examine RFD themes as predictors of suicidal symptoms to improve our understanding of the suicidal mind, test suicide theory validity and improve risk assessment. This cross-sectional mixed-method study included anonymous survey data (N = 713) with a subsample (n = 474; 77% female; age M = 31.48, SD = 13.53) who provided RFD. Participants were asked to write down five RFD (ranked 1 st to 5 th most important) and completed the Suicidal Affect-Behavior-Cognition Scale (SABCS). Thematic analysis revealed eight valid RFD themes—Negative Self-appraisal, Hopelessness, Desire to Escape, Escape Pain, Relationships, Loneliness, Financial Hardship, and Physical Health. Themes were quantified by rank and total endorsements of the theme. Hierarchical regression modelling, statistically controlling for demographics, showed all RFD themes, except Physical Health, were positive predictors of suicidality, accounting for 26% of variance in suicidal symptoms. Negative Self-appraisal was the strongest predictor. RFD differences were also found by gender, age and education. From these findings, we determined current suicide theories do not fully account for suicidal persons’ RFD. There is a pressing need for more critical review of current theories, as current theories only partially represent this key attribute of the suicidal mind, and none of the reviewed theories accurately reflected suicidal participants’ RFD. Clinical implications include integrating financial therapies into suicide prevention treatments and incorporating RFD into assessments and treatments. To aid research and risk assessment efforts, we propose a new RFD Index, with eight five-point response items."
https://openalex.org/W3128567999,"Sugarcane ratoon stunting disease (RSD) caused by Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli ( Lxx ) is a common destructive disease that occurs around the world. Lxx is an obligate pathogen of sugarcane, and previous studies have reported some physiological responses of RSD-affected sugarcane. However, the molecular understanding of sugarcane response to Lxx infection remains unclear. In the present study, transcriptomes of healthy and Lxx -infected sugarcane stalks and leaves were studied to gain more insights into the gene activity in sugarcane in response to Lxx infection. RNA-Seq analysis of healthy and diseased plants transcriptomes identified 107,750 unigenes. Analysis of these unigenes showed a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) occurring mostly in leaves of infected plants. Sugarcane responds to Lxx infection mainly via alteration of metabolic pathways such as photosynthesis, phytohormone biosynthesis, phytohormone action-mediated regulation, and plant-pathogen interactions. It was also found that cell wall defense pathways and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathways may play important roles in Lxx pathogeneis. In Lxx -infected plants, significant inhibition in photosynthetic processes through large number of differentially expressed genes involved in energy capture, energy metabolism and chloroplast structure. Also, Lxx infection caused down-regulation of gibberellin response through an increased activity of DELLA and down-regulation of GID1 proteins. This alteration in gibberellic acid response combined with the inhibition of photosynthetic processes may account for the majority of growth retardation occurring in RSD-affected plants. A number of genes associated with plant-pathogen interactions were also differentially expressed in Lxx -infected plants. These include those involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, cell wall biosynthesis, and phagosomes, implicating an active defense response to Lxx infection. Considering the fact that RSD occurs worldwide and a significant cause of sugarcane productivity, a better understanding of Lxx resistance-related processes may help develop tools and technologies for producing RSD-resistant sugarcane varieties through conventional and/or molecular breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3127851432,"In recent years, dating apps have changed the way people meet and communicate with potential romantic and/or sexual partners. There exists a stereotype considering that these apps are used only for casual sex, so those apps would not be an adequate resource to find a long-term relationship. The objective of this study was to analyze possible individual differences in the mating orientations (short-term vs. long-term) between users and non-users of dating apps. Participants were 902 single students from a mid-size Spanish university, of both sexes (63% female, and 37% male), aged between 18 and 26 years ( M = 20.34, SD = 2.05), who completed a battery of online questionnaires. It was found that, whereas dating apps users had a higher short-term mating orientation than non-users (more frequent behavior, higher desire, and more positive attitude), there were no differences in the long-term orientation as a function of use/non-use. Considering this, dating apps are a resource with a strong presence of people interested on hooking-up while, simultaneously, not a bad (nor good) option for finding long-term love."
https://openalex.org/W3127970591,"Various measures have been advocated for the control of Johne’s disease (caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis , MAP) in different countries. Farmers’ compliance has been reported to be variable depending on disease prevalence and incentives to participate in control programs. After the prevalence of MAP shedding and risk factors for within-herd spread of MAP were assessed in 17 Swiss cattle herds (10 dairy and 7 beef), general and herd-specific recommendations were given to the farmers to reduce MAP transmission within the herd. Participation in the study and implementation of control measures were voluntary, no financial incentives were provided for the realization of control measures. After a 3-year period of monitored observation including biannual farm visits and discussion of the situation, the implementation of the recommended control measures and their effect on prevalence of MAP shedding were evaluated. Implementation of recommended general and farm-specific control measures was only partially realized. Neither the number of animals tested positive (before or during the study) nor the farmers’ knowledge about paratuberculosis were significantly associated with their compliance for the implementation of management changes. The apparent within-herd prevalence remained constant despite limited implementation of control measures, and no particular group of control measures was found to be associated with changes in prevalence. Farmers’ compliance for the implementation of control measures to reduce the impact of Johne’s disease in infected farms was very limited under Swiss farming conditions in the frame of voluntary participation in a research project. These results indicate that the losses associated with paratuberculosis in Swiss dairy and beef operations are not estimated to be high enough by the farmers to justify important efforts for control measures, and that incentives may be necessary to achieve efficient implementation of such measures."

People who have social contacts with COVID-19 patients might be at higher risk of physical or mental health problems. This study investigated whether people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients would have poorer physical or mental outcomes, and different attitudes and behaviors. Chinese adults were recruited to fill in an online survey using snowball sampling during 21 st -26 nd February 2020. Physical symptoms, psychological outcomes, quality of life, COVID-19 related attitudes, and behaviors were measured. The differences in the outcomes between participants who had COVID-19 social contacts and those who had not were analyzed. The survey included 1,447 non-infected eligible participants. Among those, 173 (12.0%) reported at least one confirmed/suspected case in their social contacts. In the multiple regression adjusted for demographic data, the presence of confirmed/suspected infection cases in one’s social contacts was significantly associated with poorer physical and mental outcomes, lower health-related quality of life, and different COVID-19 related attitudes and behaviors ( p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients were at risk of adverse health outcomes. Future studies are needed to understand the long-term impacts.

https://openalex.org/W3128719208,"Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is widely used for bedside monitoring of lung ventilation status. Its goal is to reflect the internal conductivity changes and estimate the electrical properties of the tissues in the thorax. However, poor spatial resolution affects EIT image reconstruction to the extent that the heart and lung-related impedance images are barely distinguishable. Several studies have attempted to tackle this problem, and approaches based on decomposition of EIT images using linear transformations have been developed, and recently, U-Net has become a prominent architecture for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-Siamese U-Net specifically tailored for EIT application. It is based on the state-of-the-art U-Net, whose structure is modified and extended, forming shared encoder with parallel decoders and has multi-task weighted losses added to adapt to the individual separation tasks. The trained semi-Siamese U-Net model was evaluated with a test dataset, and the results were compared with those of the classical U-Net in terms of Dice similarity coefficient and mean absolute error. Results showed that compared with the classical U-Net, semi-Siamese U-Net exhibited performance improvements of 11.37% and 3.2% in Dice similarity coefficient, and 3.16% and 5.54% in mean absolute error, in terms of heart and lung-impedance image separation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3128794616,"This paper describes the conceptual design of a virtual reality-based stress management training tool and evaluation of the initial prototype in a pilot efficacy study. Performance Edge virtual-reality (VR) was co-developed with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to address the need for practical stress management training for ADF personnel. The VR application is biofeedback-enabled and contains key stress management techniques derived from acceptance and commitment and cognitive behavioural therapy in a modular framework. End-user-provided feedback on usability, design, and user experience was positive, and particularly complimentary of the respiratory biofeedback functionality. Training of controlled breathing delivered across 3 sessions increased participants’ self-reported use of breath control in everyday life and progressively improved controlled breathing skills (objectively assessed as a reduction in breathing rate and variability). Thus the data show that a biofeedback-enabled controlled breathing protocol delivered through Performance Edge VR can produce both behaviour change and objective improvement in breathing metrics. These results confirm the validity of Performance Edge VR platform, and its Controlled Breathing module, as a novel approach to tailoring VR-based applications to train stress management skills in a workplace setting."

Responses to emerging infectious disease outbreaks frequently occur in resource-constrained regions and under high pressure to quickly contain the outbreak prior to potential spread. As seen in the 2020 EVD outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a continued need to evaluate and address the ethical challenges that arise in the high stakes environment of an emerging infectious disease outbreak response. The research presented here provides analysis of the ethical challenges with regard to allocation of limited resources, particularly experimental therapeutics, using the 2013–2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa as a case study. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior healthcare personnel (n = 16) from international humanitarian aid organizations intimately engaged in the 2013–2016 EVD outbreak response in West Africa. Interviews were recorded in private setting, transcribed, and iteratively coded using grounded theory methodology. A majority of respondents indicated a clear propensity to adopt an ethical framework of guiding principles for international responses to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Respondents agreed that prioritization of frontline workers’ access to experimental therapeutics was warranted based on a principle of reciprocity. There was widespread acceptance of adaptive trial designs and greater trial transparency in providing access to experimental therapeutics. Many respondents also emphasized the importance of community engagement in limited resource allocation scheme design and culturally appropriate informed consent procedures. The study results inform a potential ethical framework of guiding principles based on the interview participants’ insights to be adopted by international response organizations and their healthcare workers in the face of allocating limited resources such as experimental therapeutics in future emerging infectious disease outbreaks to ease the moral burden of individual healthcare providers."

Coming from a country with different smoking policies, culture, and economic background than the U.S., Chinese smokers may change their smoking behaviors after immigrating to the U.S. Objectives This study aims to explore the trajectory of smoking behavior change among Chinese immigrant smokers migrating to the U.S. Methods This qualitative study was guided by the Grounded theory. Semi-structured intensive individual interviews were conducted among 10 eligible participants. A purposive theoretical sampling method was used to recruit participants through a website. Individual interviews were conducted online, via telephone, or in-person in Mandarin. Data were transcribed verbatim in Mandarin, translated into English, and triangulated with follow-up interviews and dialogues among authors to enhance trustworthiness and consistency of the study. Process coding and content analysis were used to analyze data. Results A total of 10 participants, 7 males and 3 females, were interviewed. Results showed the trajectory of smoking behavior change among Chinese immigrant smokers went through three phases: 1) Beginning to smoke, which included learning to smoke from others, trying to smoke and learning to smoke, and hiding their smoking behaviors from others; 2) maintaining smoking, which included setting boundary around smoking, smoking as a facilitator or barrier to social interaction, feeling pressures related to smoking behavior, and making others happy: Collective smoking and controlling smoking desire; and 3) changing smoking behaviors, which included experiencing life events that were triggers to changing smoking behavior, boredom as a reason for relapses, personal will as a key to quitting smoking, and quitting smoking for a loved one. Although some differences existed between male and female Chinese immigrant smokers’ smoking behaviors, their trajectories of smoking behavior change were generally similar. Discussion Findings from this study can help health care providers to extend their understanding toward smoking behavior change among Chinese immigrant smokers across different socio-cultural contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3128841451,"Vitrification is an economically effective method for embryo cryopreservation in human and livestock animals; however, it carries the risk of damage by the exposure to severe oxidative stress. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of leptin at different levels on the in vitro development of fresh and vitrified preimplantation embryos in a rabbit model. Normal embryos at morulae stage were randomly cultured for 2 h with 0, 10, 20 or 100 ng/mL of leptin, then were cultured for further 48 h as freshly or after vitrification. Thereafter, developed blastocysts form the best leptin level in fresh and vitrified embryos along with their controls were allocated to analyze the pro-oxidant (malondialdehyde, MDA; nitric oxide, NO), antioxidant (total antioxidant capacity, TAC; superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GPx), apoptotic (Bcl-2 associated X protein, BAX; heat shock 60kD protein member 1, HSP60; tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNFα) and developmental (sex determining region Y box protein 2, SOX2; Nanog homeobox protein, NANOG; Octamer-binding protein 4, OCT4) biomarkers. Results indicate that expanding and hatching rates of embryos were significantly higher at 20 ng/mL leptin than the other levels, while vitrification had an independent suppression effect on the in vitro development rates. The MDA and NO were significantly higher, while TAC, SOD and GPx were significantly lower in the vitrified than fresh embryos. In contrast, leptin treatment significantly decreased the pro-oxidant biomarkers and increased the antioxidant biomarkers in both fresh and vitrified embryos. Vitrification significantly increased the antiapoptotic biomarkers, and decreased the developmental biomarkers in embryos. In contrast, leptin decreased the BAX and TNFα, increased the HSP60, and moreover, ameliorated the reduction of developmental biomarkers in the vitrified embryos. These results conclude that leptin could be used as antiapoptotic and antioxidant promotor to support the in vitro embryonic development, particularly under oxidative stress emerged from cryopreservation programs."
https://openalex.org/W3127498261,"Introduction Moderate to severe acute malnutrition (SAM/MAM) and severe anaemia are important and associated co-morbidities in children aged less than five years. Independently, these two morbidities are responsible for high risk of in-hospital and post-discharge deaths and hospital readmissions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the risk of death among severely anaemic children with moderate to severe acute malnutrition compared to children with severe anaemia alone. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of data collected from a large prospective study that was investigating severe anaemia in children aged less than 5 years old. The study was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre and Chikhwawa district hospital in southern Malawi. Children aged less than five years old; with severe anaemia were screened and enrolled. Each child was followed up for eighteen months at one, three, six, twelve and eighteen months after enrolment. Data were analysed using STATA 15. Results Between July 2002 and July 2004, 382 severely anaemic children were enrolled in the main study. A total of 52 children were excluded due to missing anthropometric data. Out of the 330 included, 53 children were moderately to severely malnourished and 277 were not. At the end of the 18-month follow period, 28.3% of children with MAM/SAM died compared to 13% of children without MAM/SAM (RR 2.1, CI 0.9–4.2, p = 0.03). Similarly, children with moderate to severe malnutrition reported a significantly higher number of malaria infection cases (33.9%) compared to children with severe anaemia alone (27.9%, p = 0.02). However, the number of hospitalizations and recurrence of severe anaemia was similar and not statistically significant between the two groups (RR 0.8 (0.4–1.4), p = 0.6 and RR 1.1 (0.3–2.8), p = 0.8). Conclusion Among children with severe anaemia, those who also had moderate to severe malnutrition had a twofold higher risk of dying compared to those who did not. It is therefore crucial to investigate acute malnutrition among severely anaemic children, as this might be treatable factor associated with high mortality."

https://openalex.org/W3088657058,"Eliminating unnecessary exposure is a principle of server security. The huge IPv6 address space enhances security by making scanning infeasible, however, with recent advances of IPv6 scanning technologies, network scanning is again threatening server security. In this paper, we propose a new model named addressless server, which separates the server into an entrance module and a main service module, and assigns an IPv6 prefix instead of an IPv6 address to the main service module. The entrance module generates a legitimate IPv6 address under this prefix by encrypting the client address, so that the client can access the main server on a destination address that is different in each connection. In this way, the model provides isolation to the main server, prevents network scanning, and minimizes exposure. Moreover it provides a novel framework that supports flexible load balancing, high-availability, and other desirable features. The model is simple and does not require any modification to the client or the network. We implement a prototype and experiments show that our model can prevent the main server from being scanned at a slight performance cost."

https://openalex.org/W3126889583,"The article discusses the influence of a sample size on the credibility of a simulation model created for the estimation of material loss in the production of a middle layer of a wooden floorboard. The study was conducted in a production company operating in the wood processing industry. Geometric characteristics of input material were captured and used to derive statistical distributions, which were then included in the simulation model. The conducted experiments indicated that the quality of the simulation model was significantly affected by the quality and quantity of the sample, on the basis of which the stochastic model is estimated. It was shown that small sample for wood processing data was insufficient to capture process variability. On the other hand, excessive sample size (80 or more observations) for the material with high natural geometric variability, involves taking into account outliers, which may lower the overall prognostic quality of the simulation model. Based on the conducted simulation experiments, the recommended sample size which allows development of a reliable model for estimation of material loss in the analyzed manufacturing process, ranges from 40 to 60 measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3127680112,"Regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) expression and function alters synaptic strength and is a major mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity. Although transcription is required for some forms of synaptic plasticity, the transcription factors that regulate AMPA receptor expression and signaling are incompletely understood. Here, we identify the Snail family transcription factor ces-1 in an RNAi screen for conserved transcription factors that regulate glutamatergic behavior in C . elegans . ces-1 was originally discovered as a selective cell death regulator of neuro-secretory motor neuron (NSM) and I2 interneuron sister cells in C . elegans , and has almost exclusively been studied in the NSM cell lineage. We found that ces-1 loss-of-function mutants have defects in two glutamatergic behaviors dependent on the C . elegans AMPA receptor GLR-1, the mechanosensory nose-touch response and spontaneous locomotion reversals. In contrast, ces-1 gain-of-function mutants exhibit increased spontaneous reversals, and these are dependent on glr-1 consistent with these genes acting in the same pathway. ces-1 mutants have wild type cholinergic neuromuscular junction function, suggesting that they do not have a general defect in synaptic transmission or muscle function. The effect of ces-1 mutation on glutamatergic behaviors is not due to ectopic cell death of ASH sensory neurons or GLR-1-expressing neurons that mediate one or both of these behaviors, nor due to an indirect effect on NSM sister cell deaths. Rescue experiments suggest that ces-1 may act, in part, in GLR-1-expressing neurons to regulate glutamatergic behaviors. Interestingly, ces-1 mutants suppress the increased reversal frequencies stimulated by a constitutively-active form of GLR-1. However, expression of glr-1 mRNA or GFP-tagged GLR-1 was not decreased in ces-1 mutants suggesting that ces-1 likely promotes GLR-1 function. This study identifies a novel role for ces-1 in regulating glutamatergic behavior that appears to be independent of its canonical role in regulating cell death in the NSM cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W3128594674,"Androgens may exert cardiovascular protective actions by regulating the release and function of different vascular factors. In addition, testosterone (TES) and its 5-reduced metabolites, 5α- and 5β-dihydrotestosterone (5α- and 5β-DHT) induce vasorelaxant and hypotensive effects. Furthermore, hypertension has been reported to alter the release and function of the neurotransmitters nitric oxide (NO), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and noradrenaline (NA). Since the mesenteric arteries possess a dense perivascular innervation and significantly regulate total peripheral vascular resistance, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of TES, 5α- and 5β-DHT on the neurogenic release and vasomotor function of NO, CGRP and NA. For this purpose, the superior mesenteric artery from male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats was used to analyze: (i) the effect of androgens (10 nM, incubated for 30 min) on the neurogenic release of NO, CGRP and NA and (ii) the vasoconstrictor-response to NA and the vasodilator responses to the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and exogenous CGRP. The results showed that TES, 5α- or 5β-DHT did not modify the release of NO, CGRP or NA induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) in the arteries of SHR; however, in the arteries of WKY rats androgens only caused an increase in EFS-induced NO release. Moreover, TES, and especially 5β-DHT, increased the vasodilator response induced by SNP and CGRP in the arteries of SHR. These findings could be contributing to the hypotensive/antihypertensive efficacy of 5β-DHT previously described in conscious SHR and WKY rats, pointing to 5β- DHT as a potential drug for the treatment of hypertension."
