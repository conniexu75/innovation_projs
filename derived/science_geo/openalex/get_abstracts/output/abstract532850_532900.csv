https://openalex.org/W1663638871,"Maxwell's equations, formulated 150 years ago, ultimately describe properties of light, from classical electromagnetism to quantum and relativistic aspects. The latter ones result in remarkable geometric and topological phenomena related to the spin-1 massless nature of photons. By analyzing fundamental spin properties of Maxwell waves, we show that free-space light exhibits an intrinsic quantum spin Hall effect—surface modes with strong spin-momentum locking. These modes are evanescent waves that form, for example, surface plasmon-polaritons at vacuum-metal interfaces. Our findings illuminate the unusual transverse spin in evanescent waves and explain recent experiments that have demonstrated the transverse spin-direction locking in the excitation of surface optical modes. This deepens our understanding of Maxwell's theory, reveals analogies with topological insulators for electrons, and offers applications for robust spin-directional optical interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1788106766,"Silencing neurons using optogenetics Rhodopsin light-sensitive ion channels from green algae provide a powerful tool to control neuronal circuits. Rhodopsin cation channels effectively depolarize neurons and cause the firing of short-lived electrical membrane potentials. Govorunova et al. describe algal channels that do the opposite; that is, they hyperpolarize or silence particular neurons (see the Perspective by Berndt and Deisseroth). These cation channels provide greater light sensitivity than that of existing hyperpolarizing light-activated channels, operate rapidly, and selectively conduct only anions. This approach is an ideal complement to the widely used technique of creating light-sensitive neurons through the expression of rhodopsin cation channels.

The CRISPR-Cas system has been adapted for facile genome editing, heralding a new age in molecular biology. Jiang et al. show that the Cas9 nuclease adopts a distinct confirmation when it binds to the targeting guide RNA. The guide RNA then assumes a preordered shape. This RNA “seed region” is thus poised to initiate recognition of the DNA target sequence. Science , this issue p. 1477"
https://openalex.org/W1552780263,"As global warming continues, reef-building corals could avoid local population declines through ""genetic rescue"" involving exchange of heat-tolerant genotypes across latitudes, but only if latitudinal variation in thermal tolerance is heritable. Here, we show an up-to-10-fold increase in odds of survival of coral larvae under heat stress when their parents come from a warmer lower-latitude location. Elevated thermal tolerance was associated with heritable differences in expression of oxidative, extracellular, transport, and mitochondrial functions that indicated a lack of prior stress. Moreover, two genomic regions strongly responded to selection for thermal tolerance in interlatitudinal crosses. These results demonstrate that variation in coral thermal tolerance across latitudes has a strong genetic basis and could serve as raw material for natural selection."

https://openalex.org/W2153436178,"The fear responses to environmental threats play a fundamental role in survival. Little is known about the neural circuits specifically processing threat-relevant sensory information in the mammalian brain. We identified parvalbumin-positive (PV(+)) excitatory projection neurons in mouse superior colliculus (SC) as a key neuronal subtype for detecting looming objects and triggering fear responses. These neurons, distributed predominantly in the superficial SC, divergently projected to different brain areas, including the parabigeminal nucleus (PBGN), an intermediate station leading to the amygdala. Activation of the PV(+) SC-PBGN pathway triggered fear responses, induced conditioned aversion, and caused depression-related behaviors. Approximately 20% of mice subjected to the fear-conditioning paradigm developed a generalized fear memory."
https://openalex.org/W1637936787,"Eighty years ago, it was proposed that solid hydrogen would become metallic at sufficiently high density. Despite numerous investigations, this transition has not yet been experimentally observed. More recently, there has been much interest in the analog of this predicted metallic transition in the dense liquid, due to its relevance to planetary science. Here, we show direct observation of an abrupt insulator-to-metal transition in dense liquid deuterium. Experimental determination of the location of this transition provides a much-needed benchmark for theory and may constrain the region of hydrogen-helium immiscibility and the boundary-layer pressure in standard models of the internal structure of gas-giant planets."
https://openalex.org/W1939931704,"Algal blooms produce large amounts of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a volatile with a diverse signaling role in marine food webs that is emitted to the atmosphere, where it can affect cloud formation. The algal enzymes responsible for forming DMS from dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) remain unidentified despite their critical role in the global sulfur cycle. We identified and characterized Alma1, a DMSP lyase from the bloom-forming algae Emiliania huxleyi. Alma1 is a tetrameric, redox-sensitive enzyme of the aspartate racemase superfamily. Recombinant Alma1 exhibits biochemical features identical to the DMSP lyase in E. huxleyi, and DMS released by various E. huxleyi isolates correlates with their Alma1 levels. Sequence homology searches suggest that Alma1 represents a gene family present in major, globally distributed phytoplankton taxa and in other marine organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1930388675,"Pigment-protein and pigment-pigment interactions are of fundamental importance to the light-harvesting and photoprotective functions essential to oxygenic photosynthesis. The orange carotenoid protein (OCP) functions as both a sensor of light and effector of photoprotective energy dissipation in cyanobacteria. We report the atomic-resolution structure of an active form of the OCP consisting of the N-terminal domain and a single noncovalently bound carotenoid pigment. The crystal structure, combined with additional solution-state structural data, reveals that OCP photoactivation is accompanied by a 12 angstrom translocation of the pigment within the protein and a reconfiguration of carotenoid-protein interactions. Our results identify the origin of the photochromic changes in the OCP triggered by light and reveal the structural determinants required for interaction with the light-harvesting antenna during photoprotection."
https://openalex.org/W1773400891,"Nonlinear optical response of silica imposes a fundamental limit on the information transfer capacity in optical fibers. Communication beyond this limit requires higher signal power and suppression of nonlinear distortions to prevent irreversible information loss. The nonlinear interaction in silica is a deterministic phenomenon that can, in principle, be completely reversed. However, attempts to remove the effects of nonlinear propagation have led to only modest improvements, and the precise physical mechanism preventing nonlinear cancellation remains unknown. We demonstrate that optical carrier stability plays a critical role in canceling Kerr-induced distortions and that nonlinear wave interaction in silica can be substantially reverted if optical carriers possess a sufficient degree of mutual coherence. These measurements indicate that fiber information capacity can be notably increased over previous estimates."
https://openalex.org/W1550289833,"Organisms are adapted to the relentless cycles of day and night, because they evolved timekeeping systems called circadian clocks, which regulate biological activities with ~24-hour rhythms. The clock of cyanobacteria is driven by a three-protein oscillator composed of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together generate a circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation. We show that KaiB flips between two distinct three-dimensional folds, and its rare transition to an active state provides a time delay that is required to match the timing of the oscillator to that of Earth's rotation. Once KaiB switches folds, it binds phosphorylated KaiC and captures KaiA, which initiates a phase transition of the circadian cycle, and it regulates components of the clock-output pathway, which provides the link that joins the timekeeping and signaling functions of the oscillator."
https://openalex.org/W1541416362,"Cardiac progenitor cells are multipotent and give rise to cardiac endothelium, smooth muscle, and cardiomyocytes. Here, we define and characterize the cardiomyoblast intermediate that is committed to the cardiomyocyte fate, and we characterize the niche signals that regulate commitment. Cardiomyoblasts express Hopx, which functions to coordinate local Bmp signals to inhibit the Wnt pathway, thus promoting cardiomyogenesis. Hopx integrates Bmp and Wnt signaling by physically interacting with activated Smads and repressing Wnt genes. The identification of the committed cardiomyoblast that retains proliferative potential will inform cardiac regenerative therapeutics. In addition, Bmp signals characterize adult stem cell niches in other tissues where Hopx-mediated inhibition of Wnt is likely to contribute to stem cell quiescence and to explain the role of Hopx as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1874287518,"Morphinan alkaloids from the opium poppy are used for pain relief. The direction of metabolites to morphinan biosynthesis requires isomerization of (S)- to (R)-reticuline. Characterization of high-reticuline poppy mutants revealed a genetic locus, designated STORR [(S)- to (R)-reticuline] that encodes both cytochrome P450 and oxidoreductase modules, the latter belonging to the aldo-keto reductase family. Metabolite analysis of mutant alleles and heterologous expression demonstrate that the P450 module is responsible for the conversion of (S)-reticuline to 1,2-dehydroreticuline, whereas the oxidoreductase module converts 1,2-dehydroreticuline to (R)-reticuline rather than functioning as a P450 redox partner. Proteomic analysis confirmed that these two modules are contained on a single polypeptide in vivo. This modular assembly implies a selection pressure favoring substrate channeling. The fusion protein STORR may enable microbial-based morphinan production."
https://openalex.org/W1604956938,"Down syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy of human chromosome 21) associated with intellectual disability and affecting approximately one in 1000 live births worldwide. The overexpression of genes encoded by the extra copy of a normal chromosome in DS is believed to be sufficient to perturb normal pathways and normal responses to stimulation, causing learning and memory deficits. In this work, we have designed a strategy based on the unsupervised clustering method, Self Organizing Maps (SOM), to identify biologically important differences in protein levels in mice exposed to context fear conditioning (CFC). We analyzed expression levels of 77 proteins obtained from normal genotype control mice and from their trisomic littermates (Ts65Dn) both with and without treatment with the drug memantine. Control mice learn successfully while the trisomic mice fail, unless they are first treated with the drug, which rescues their learning ability. The SOM approach identified reduced subsets of proteins predicted to make the most critical contributions to normal learning, to failed learning and rescued learning, and provides a visual representation of the data that allows the user to extract patterns that may underlie novel biological responses to the different kinds of learning and the response to memantine. Results suggest that the application of SOM to new experimental data sets of complex protein profiles can be used to identify common critical protein responses, which in turn may aid in identifying potentially more effective drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W1889533435,"A major goal for HIV-1 vaccine development is the production of an immunogen to mimic native, functional HIV-1 envelope trimeric spikes (Env) on the virion surface. We lack a reliable description of a native, functional trimer, however, because of inherent instability and heterogeneity in most preparations. We describe here two conformationally homogeneous Envs derived from difficult-to-neutralize primary isolates. All their non-neutralizing epitopes are fully concealed and independent of their proteolytic processing. Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) recognize these native trimers. Truncation of their cytoplasmic tail has little effect on membrane fusion, but it diminishes binding to trimer-specific bnAbs while exposing non-neutralizing epitopes. These results yield a more accurate antigenic picture than hitherto possible of a genuinely untriggered and functional HIV-1 Env; they can guide effective vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2127415377,"Circadian clocks generate slow and ordered cellular dynamics but consist of fast-moving bio-macromolecules; consequently, the origins of the overall slowness remain unclear. We identified the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) catalytic region [adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)] in the amino-terminal half of the clock protein KaiC as the minimal pacemaker that controls the in vivo frequency of the cyanobacterial clock. Crystal structures of the ATPase revealed that the slowness of this ATPase arises from sequestration of a lytic water molecule in an unfavorable position and coupling of ATP hydrolysis to a peptide isomerization with high activation energy. The slow ATPase is coupled with another ATPase catalyzing autodephosphorylation in the carboxyl-terminal half of KaiC, yielding the circadian response frequency of intermolecular interactions with other clock-related proteins that influences the transcription and translation cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1539437417,"Three-dimensional (3D) mesostructured semiconductors show promising properties and applications; however, to date, few methods exist to synthesize or fabricate such materials. Metal can diffuse along semiconductor surfaces, and even trace amounts can change the surface behavior. We exploited the phenomena for 3D mesoscale lithography, by showing one example where iterated deposition-diffusion-incorporation of gold over silicon nanowires forms etchant-resistant patterns. This process is facet-selective, producing mesostructured silicon spicules with skeletonlike morphology, 3D tectonic motifs, and reduced symmetries. Atom-probe tomography, coupled with other quantitative measurements, indicates the existence and the role of individual gold atoms in forming 3D lithographic resists. Compared to other more uniform silicon structures, the anisotropic spicule requires greater force for detachment from collagen hydrogels, suggesting enhanced interfacial interactions at the mesoscale."

https://openalex.org/W1454765678,"During eukaryotic translation initiation, the small ribosomal subunit, assisted by initiation factors, locates the messenger RNA start codon by scanning from the 5' cap. This process is powered by the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a DEAD-box helicase. eIF4A has been thought to unwind structures formed in the untranslated 5' region via a nonprocessive mechanism. Using a single-molecule assay, we found that eIF4A functions instead as an adenosine triphosphate-dependent processive helicase when complexed with two accessory proteins, eIF4G and eIF4B. Translocation occurred in discrete steps of 11 ± 2 base pairs, irrespective of the accessory factor combination. Our findings support a memory-less stepwise mechanism for translation initiation and suggest that similar factor-dependent processivity may be shared by other members of the DEAD-box helicase family."
https://openalex.org/W1943943450,"The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases regulate hypoxia sensing in animals. In humans, they comprise three prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1–3 or EGLN1–3) and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). FIH is an asparaginyl hydroxylase catalyzing post-translational modification of HIF-α, resulting in reduction of HIF-mediated transcription. Like the PHDs, FIH is proposed to have a hypoxia-sensing role in cells, enabling responses to changes in cellular O2 availability. PHD2, the most important human PHD isoform, is proposed to be biochemically/kinetically suited as a hypoxia sensor due to its relatively high sensitivity to changes in O2 concentration and slow reaction with O2. To ascertain whether these parameters are conserved among the HIF hydroxylases, we compared the reactions of FIH and PHD2 with O2. Consistent with previous reports, we found lower Kmapp(O2) values for FIH than for PHD2 with all HIF-derived substrates. Under pre-steady-state conditions, the O2-initiated FIH reaction is significantly faster than that of PHD2. We then investigated the kinetics with respect to O2 of the FIH reaction with ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) substrates. FIH has lower Kmapp(O2) values for the tested ARDs than HIF-α substrates, and pre-steady-state O2-initiated reactions were faster with ARDs than with HIF-α substrates. The results correlate with cellular studies showing that FIH is active at lower O2 concentrations than the PHDs and suggest that competition between HIF-α and ARDs for FIH is likely to be biologically relevant, particularly in hypoxic conditions.

The PHDs catalyze hydroxylation of one or both of two proline residues in the O2-dependent degradation region of HIF-α (C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain (CODD) and N-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain (NODD)), resulting in its targeting to the proteasome (2Semenza G.L.

The 2OG oxygenases have a conserved double-stranded β-helix fold that supports an Fe(II)-coordinating HX(D/E)XnH catalytic triad and employ a conserved consensus oxidation mechanism (29Clifton I.J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 13041-13051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we have proposed that the apparently slow reaction of PHD2 with O2 reflects its role as an O2 sensor (38Flashman E. Hoffart L.M. Hamed R.B. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Krebs C. Schofield C.J. Evidence for the slow reaction of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 2 with oxygen.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although FIH is proposed to be an O2-sensing HIF hydroxylase, cellular and kinetic data suggest that FIH is less efficient at detecting deviations from normoxia than the PHDs. In cells, FIH is still substantially active under hypoxic conditions, whereas PHD activity drops significantly (39Tian Y.-M. Yeoh K.K. Lee M.K. Eriksson T. Kessler B.M. Kramer H.B. Edelmann M.J.

The differences are apparently reflected in the lower reported Kmapp(O2) values for FIH (∼90–200 μm for FIH compared with ∼250 μm to 1.7 mm for PHD2 (10Koivunen P. Hirsilä M. Günzler V.

Investigating the contribution of the active site environment to the slow reaction of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 with oxygen.Biochem. J. 2014; 463: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, the Kmapp(O2) for FIH has also been reported to be substrate-dependent (43Wilkins S.E. Hyvärinen J. Chicher J. Gorman J.J. Peet D.J. Bilton R.L. Koivunen P. Differences in hydroxylation and binding of Notch and HIF-1α demonstrate substrate selectivity for factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1).Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with a lower Kmapp for O2 for Notch-1 (ARD) hydroxylation than for HIF-1α hydroxylation, suggesting that FIH may be more active toward at least some ARDs than HIF-α substrates in hypoxia. Because targeting the HIF hydroxylases for the treatment of hypoxia-related diseases is of medicinal interest (PHD inhibitors are presently undergoing large scale clinical trials), a detailed understanding of the kinetics of these enzymes with respect to O2 is important to compare and rationalize the sensitivity of the HIF hydroxylases to hypoxia. Following our observation of the slow reaction of PHD2 with O2, we therefore conducted a detailed investigation of the kinetics of the reaction of FIH with O2. First, we investigated whether the slow reaction with O2 (as observed for a PHD2·HIF-1α complex (38Flashman E. Hoffart L.M. Hamed R.B. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Krebs C. Schofield C.J.

J. 2014; 463: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) was conserved among O2-sensing HIF hydroxylases. Second, we investigated the effect of different substrates on the kinetics of the reactions of PHD2 and FIH with O2, in terms of HIF-1/2α isoforms, HIF hydroxylation sites for PHD2, and FIH with HIF versus ARD substrates. We describe spectroscopic, kinetic, and mechanistic evidence revealing that the reaction of PHD2 with O2 is notably slow in the presence of all tested HIF substrates. We also report that the reaction of FIH with O2 is significantly faster than for PHD2 in the presence of all HIF-1/2α substrates and to an even greater degree in the presence of all tested ARD substrates. The results are consistent with studies indicating that FIH is more active than the PHDs under hypoxic conditions (39Tian Y.-M. Yeoh K.K. Lee M.K. Eriksson T. Kessler B.M. Kramer H.B. Edelmann M.J. Willam C. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Differential sensitivity of hypoxia inducible factor hydroxylation sites to hypoxia and hydroxylase inhibitors.J. Biol.

Although P-Rex1 is not detected in the normal breast, the PREX1 gene is amplified or mutated in primary breast tumors, with P-Rex1 positive staining in 58% of all breast cancers. Recent genome sequencing of melanoma and pancreatic cancers has also detected a high frequency of mutation in P-Rex2, a close structural and functional homologue of P-Rex1 (59% sequence identity) (19Berger M.F.

P-Rex1 contains an N-terminal DH-PH tandem domain that forms the catalytic subunit of the protein in vitro (21Hill K. Krugmann S. Andrews S.R. Coadwell W.J. Finan P. Welch H.C. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Regulation of P-Rex1 by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and Gβγ subunits.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). C-terminal to the DH-PH domain are two DEP (Disheveled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domains, two PDZ (postsynapticdensity protein, discs large, zona occludens-1) domains, and a large IP4P (inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase) homology domain with no identified phosphatase activity to date (Fig. 1A). Rho GEFs maintain a generally conserved DH-PH tandem domain architecture; however the mode of GTPase binding and activation varies between GEFs. A number of GEFs activate Rho GTPases through interactions with the DH domain alone, whereas several also require molecular contributions from the PH domain and/or regions outside the tandem DH-PH domain (22Rossman K.L.

Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The difference in contribution of the PH domain to GTPase binding observed between different GEFs is largely due to conformational variability between the relative positioning of the DH and PH domains. This conformational variability is defined primarily by the GEF-specific length and orientation of the final α-helix of the DH domain (27Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go: turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism of Rho GTPase activation is highly GEF-specific. P-Rex proteins are unique within the Rho GEF family, as they function as a key integration point for signals downstream of both receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (28Donald S.

For example, activation of P-Rex1 by the RTK epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promotes breast cancer cell migration and proliferation (10Sosa M.S. Lopez-Haber C. Yang C. Wang H.

RTK stimulation activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to phosphorylate PIP2 to PIP3, whereas GPCR activation leads to dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein into Gα and Gβγ subunits. Both the PIP3 and Gβγ subunits are thought to synergistically activate P-Rex proteins at the plasma membrane (29Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Currently, we have limited molecular insight into how Rho GTPases are activated by P-Rex1 and how P-Rex1 activity is regulated by the coordinated actions of PIP3, the Gβγ subunits, and protein phosphorylation. For instance, P-Rex1 PH domain binding to PIP3 is necessary for activation and membrane localization (21Hill K. Krugmann S. Andrews S.R. Coadwell W.J. Finan P. Welch H.C. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R.

Herein, we report the 1.95 Å x-ray crystal structure of the P-Rex1 DH-PH domain in complex with its canonical GTPase, Rac1, providing the first structural insight into P-Rex1 activity and regulation. Critically, using structure-guided mutagenesis we have dissected the central role of the P-Rex1 DH domain-Rac1 interface in promoting Rac1 activation both in vitro and downstream of GPCR and RTK signaling in cancer cell lines. Our structural data also indicate that the PIP3/Gβγ binding sites in P-Rex1 are markedly removed and on the opposite surface from the Rac1 interface. Together, these data provide insight into the future therapeutic targeting of P-Rex1 in the treatment of a number of cancers. RaichuEV-Rac1 (39Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N.

P-Rex1 siRNA was from GE Dharmacon (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool). The monoclonal antibody to P-Rex1 was generated in-house. His10-tagged P-Rex1 DH-PH (residues 1–404) was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the polyhedron multiple cloning site of pFastBacDual (Invitrogen). Rac1 (residues 1–177) was cloned into the XhoI and KpnI sites of the p10 multiple cloning site within the same vector. For bacterial expression, Rac1 G12V (residues 1–177) was cloned into pGEXTEV, a modified version of pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare) where the thrombin site is replaced with a TEV cleavage site. Full-length HA-tagged P-Rex1 was cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Mutations were introduced using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). His10-tagged P-Rex1 DH-PH (residues 1–404) was co-expressed with Rac1 (residues 1–177) in Sf9 cells for 2.5 days following baculovirus infection (pFastBacDual, Bac-to-Bac, Invitrogen). Co-expressed Rac1 was not purified with P-Rex1, as phosphorylation of P-Rex1 significantly affected the yield of the P-Rex1·Rac1 complex purified directly from insect cells. However, co-expression significantly improved P-Rex1 expression in Sf9 cells. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% (w/v) azide. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, filtered at 0.8 μm, and incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and 20 mm imidazole for 90 min at 4 °C with agitation. The resin was washed with lysis buffer, and P-Rex1 was eluted with 500 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The His10 tag was removed from P-Rex1 with overnight TEV cleavage during dialysis into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 5 mm MnCl2 and concurrent dephosphorylation with λ-phosphatase. Dephosphorylation of P-Rex1 was necessary to increase the final yield of the purified P-Rex1·Rac1 complex. P-Rex1 was further purified by cation exchange on a ResourceS (GE Healthcare) column with a gradient from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. P-Rex1-containing fractions were further purified on a HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare). GST-Rac1 G12V was expressed overnight in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus cells by IPTG induction at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, filtered at 0.8 μm, and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) for 90 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed with lysis buffer and incubated at 4 °C overnight with TEV added to cleave the GST tag. The protein was eluted from the resin and further purified on a HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare). To form the P-Rex1 DH-PH·Rac1 complex for crystallography, purified P-Rex1 and Rac1 were concentrated to 5–10 mg/ml and mixed at a 1:3 (P-Rex1·Rac1) ratio with the further addition of 5 mm EDTA. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the complex was purified on a HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Fractions containing the complex were pooled and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml for crystallography. P-Rex1 DH-PH·Rac1 crystals were formed at a 1:1 drop ratio by sitting drop vapor diffusion in 0.1 mm Na-MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 15% (w/v) PEG 8000. Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, and data were collected at the MX2 microfocus beamline at the Australian Synchrotron (43McPhillips T.M. McPhillips S.E.

This study investigated degradation of Number 6 “Bunker C” fuel oil compounds by the white-rot fungi Irpex lacteus, Trichaptum biforme, Phlebia radiata, Trametes versicolor, and Pleurotus ostreatus (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes). Averaging across all studied species, 98.1%, 48.6%, and 76.4% of the initial Bunker C C10 alkane, C14 alkane, and phenanthrene, respectively were degraded after 180 days of fungal growth on pine media. This study also investigated whether Bunker C oil induces changes in gene expression in the white-rot fungus Punctularia strigosozonata, for which a complete reference genome is available. After 20 days of growth, a monokaryon P. strigosozonata strain degraded 99% of the initial C10 alkane in both pine and aspen media but did not affect the amounts of the C14 alkane or phenanthrene. Differential gene expression analysis identified 119 genes with ≥ log2(2-fold) greater expression in one or more treatment comparisons. Six genes were significantly upregulated in media containing oil; these genes included three enzymes with potential roles in xenobiotic biotransformation. Carbohydrate metabolism genes showing differential expression significantly accumulated transcripts on aspen vs. pine substrates, perhaps reflecting white-rot adaptations to growth on hardwood substrates. The mechanisms by which P. strigosozonata may degrade complex oil compounds remain obscure, but degradation results of the 180-day cultures suggest that diverse white-rot fungi have promise for bioremediation of petroleum fuels."

https://openalex.org/W2109376459,"Nearly half of Greenland's mass loss occurs through iceberg calving, but the physical mechanisms operating during calving are poorly known and in situ observations are sparse. We show that calving at Greenland's Helheim Glacier causes a minutes-long reversal of the glacier's horizontal flow and a downward deflection of its terminus. The reverse motion results from the horizontal force caused by iceberg capsize and acceleration away from the glacier front. The downward motion results from a hydrodynamic pressure drop behind the capsizing berg, which also causes an upward force on the solid Earth. These forces are the source of glacial earthquakes, globally detectable seismic events whose proper interpretation will allow remote sensing of calving processes occurring at increasing numbers of outlet glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica."
https://openalex.org/W943095070,"Breast cancer remains a world-wide challenge, and additional anti-cancer therapies are still urgently needed. Emerging evidence has demonstrated the potent anti-tumor effect of biguanides, among which phenformin was reported to potentially be a more active anti-cancer agent than metformin. However, little attention has been given to the role of phenformin in breast cancer. In this study, we reveal the role of phenformin in cell death of the MCF7, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 breast cancer cell lines. The respective IC50 values of phenformin in MCF7, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells were 1.184±0.045 mM, 0.665±0.007 mM, 2.347±0.010 mM and 1.885±0.015 mM (mean± standard error). Phenformin induced cell cycle change and apoptosis in breast cancer cells via the AMPK/mTOR/p70s6k and MAPK/ERK pathways. Interestingly, phenformin induced MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) and decreased the migration rate in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, our results suggest that phenformin inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis after intracardiac injection into nude mice. Taken together, our study further confirms the potential benefit of phenformin in breast cancer treatment and provides novel mechanistic insight into its anti-cancer activity in breast cancer."

Judgements regarding provision of appropriate obstetric and neonatal care are dependent on accurate estimation of gestational age. We determined the accuracy of the Dubowitz Gestational Age Assessment, a population-specific symphysis-fundal height formula, and ultrasound biometry performed between 16 and 40 weeks gestation in estimating gestational age using pre-existing data from antenatal clinics of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the Thai-Myanmar border, where malaria is endemic. Two cohorts of women who gave birth to live singletons were analysed: 1) 250 women who attended antenatal care between July 2001 and May 2006 and had both ultrasound crown-rump length (reference) and a Dubowitz Gestational Age Assessment; 2) 975 women attending antenatal care between April 2007 and October 2010 who had ultrasound crown-rump length, symphysis-fundal measurements, and an additional study ultrasound (biparietal diameter and head circumference) randomly scheduled between 16 and 40 weeks gestation. Mean difference in estimated newborn gestational age between methods and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were determined from linear mixed-effects models. The Dubowitz method and the symphysis-fundal height formula performed well in term newborns, but overestimated gestational age of preterms by 2.57 weeks (95% LOA: 0.49, 4.65) and 3.94 weeks (95% LOA: 2.50, 5.38), respectively. Biparietal diameter overestimated gestational age by 0.83 weeks (95% LOA: -0.93, 2.58). Head circumference underestimated gestational age by 0.39 weeks (95% LOA: -2.60, 1.82), especially if measured after 24 weeks gestation. The results of this study can be used to quantify biases associated with alternative methods for estimating gestational age in the absence of ultrasound crown-rump length to inform critical clinical judgements in this population, and as a point of reference elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W1580703484,"The insecticidal feature of the three-domain Cry δ-endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis is generally attributed to their capability to form oligomeric pores, causing lysis of target larval midgut cells. However, the molecular description of their oligomerization process has not been clearly defined. Here a stable prepore of the 65-kDa trypsin-activated Cry4Ba mosquito-specific toxin was established through membrane-mimetic environments by forming an ∼200-kDa octyl-β-d-glucoside micelle-induced trimer. The SDS-resistant trimer caused cytolysis to Sf9 insect cells expressing Aedes-mALP (a Cry4Ba receptor) and was more effective than a toxin monomer in membrane perturbation of calcein-loaded liposomes. A three-dimensional model of toxin trimer obtained by negative-stain EM in combination with single-particle reconstruction at ∼5 nm resolution showed a propeller-shaped structure with 3-fold symmetry. Fitting the three-dimensional reconstructed EM map with a 100-ns molecular dynamics-simulated Cry4Ba structure interacting with an octyl-β-d-glucoside micelle showed relative positioning of individual domains in the context of the trimeric complex with a major protrusion from the pore-forming domain. Moreover, high-speed atomic force microscopy imaging at nanometer resolution and a subsecond frame rate demonstrated conformational transitions from a propeller-like to a globularly shaped trimer upon lipid membrane interactions, implying prepore-to-pore conversion. Real-time trimeric arrangement of monomers associated with l-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid bicelle membranes was also envisaged by successive high-speed atomic force microscopy imaging, depicting interactions among three individual subunits toward trimer formation. Together, our data provide the first pivotal insights into the structural requirement of membrane-induced conformational changes of Cry4Ba toxin monomers for the molecular assembly of a prepore trimer capable of inserting into target membranes to generate a lytic pore."

Here, we show that geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 (GGPPS), which is a branch point enzyme in the mevalonic acid pathway, promotes lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance through activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway. We have found that metabolic perturbation would increase GGPPS expression in the skeletal muscles of db/db mice and high fat diet-fed mice. To address the metabolic effects of GGPPS activity in skeletal muscle, we generated mice with specific GGPPS deletions in their skeletal muscle tissue. Heterozygous knock-out of GGPPS in the skeletal muscle improved systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in mice fed both normal chow and high fat diets. These metabolic alterations were accompanied by activated PI3K/Akt signaling and enhanced glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle. Further investigation showed that the free fatty acid-stimulated GGPPS expression in the skeletal muscle was able to enhance the geranylgeranylation of RhoA, which further induced the inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Ser-307) by increasing Rho kinase activity. These results implicate a crucial role of the GGPPS/RhoA/Rho kinase/IRS-1 pathway in skeletal muscle, in which it mediates lipid-induced systemic insulin resistance in obese mice.

Primary outcomes included 12-week change in metabolic risk factors and MetS z score. Secondary outcome was HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Short Form Survey at 12 weeks).The mean age of participants was 52.0 (SD 7.4, range 31-71) years. Analysis involving the entire study population revealed that the yoga group achieved greater decline in waist circumference (p<0.001), fasting glucose (p<0.01), triglycerides (p<0.05), and MetS z score (p<0.01). Yoga training also improved general health perceptions (p<0.01), physical component score (p<0.01), and social functioning (p<0.01) domains score of HRQoL. However, no significant differences between groups were observed in the mean change of systolic/diastolic blood pressures or high-density lipid protein cholesterol (all p>0.05).

Dehydrins are divided into five different classes, which are thought to be regulated in different manners. To better understand differences in transcriptional regulation of the five dehydrin classes, de novo motif discovery was performed on 350 dehydrin promoter sequences from a total of 51 plant genomes. Overrepresented motifs were identified in the promoters of five dehydrin classes. The Kn dehydrin promoters contain motifs linked with meristem specific expression, as well as motifs linked with cold/dehydration and abscisic acid response. KS dehydrin promoters contain a motif with a GATA core. SKn and YnSKn dehydrin promoters contain motifs that match elements connected with cold/dehydration, abscisic acid and light response. YnKn dehydrin promoters contain motifs that match abscisic acid and light response elements, but not cold/dehydration response elements. Conserved promoter motifs are present in the dehydrin classes and across different plant lineages, indicating that dehydrin gene regulation is likely also conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1542587513,"Periodontal disease is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease and is associated with complex microbial infection in the subgingival cavity. Recently, American Heart Association supported a century old association between periodontal disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease. We have recently shown that polybacterial periodontal infection led to aortic atherosclerosis and modulation of lipid profiles; however the underlying mechanism(s) has not been yet demonstrated. Altered nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor for nitric oxide synthases (NOS) has long been shown to be associated with vascular dysfunction and gastrointestinal motility disorders. We sought to examine the mechanism of periodontal infection leading to altered vascular and gastrointestinal smooth muscle relaxation, focusing on the BH4/nNOS pathways. In addition, we also have investigated how the antioxidant system (NRF2-Phase II enzyme expression) in vascular and GI specimens is altered by oral infection. Eight week old male ApoEnull mice were either sham-infected or infected orally for 16 weeks with a mixture of major periodontal bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia to induce experimental periodontitis. Serum, vascular (mesenteric), stomach, and colon specimens were collected at the end of periodontal pathogen infection. Bacterial infection induced significant (p<0.05) reductions in the levels of BH4,in ratio of BH4:BH2+B and also in nitric oxide levels compared to sham-infected controls. In addition, we identified a significant (p<0.05) reduction in eNOS dimerization, nNOS dimerization and protein expression of BH4 biosynthesis enzymes; GCH-1, DHFR and NRF2 & Phase II enzymes in infected mice versus controls in both mesenteric artery and colon tissues. However, we found no differences in nNOS/BH4 protein expression in stomach tissues of infected and sham-infected mice. This suggests that a polybacterial infection can cause significant changes in the vascular and colonic BH4/nNOS/NRF2 pathways which might lead to impaired vascular relaxation and colonic motility."

Here, we uncovered a role of the p97-Npl4-Ufd1 complex in mediating p100-to-p52 processing and therefore positively regulating the alternative NF-κB pathway. We observed an elevation of p97 mRNA levels in lymphoma patients, which positively correlates with NFKB2 expression, a downstream target gene of the alternative NF-κB pathway. Moreover, NFKB2 mRNA levels were aberrantly down-regulated in patients with inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), a disease caused by mutation of p97. Inactivation of p97 or depletion of the p97-Npl4-Ufd1 complex inhibits the processing of p100 into p52, decreasing transcription of the downstream target genes.

While HIV-1 RNA can be quantified using several commercial tests, no test has been commercialized for HIV-2 RNA quantification. We studied the relationship between plasma HIV-2 viral load (VL) and CD4 count in West African patients who were either receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) or treatment-naïve.A cross sectional survey was conducted among HIV-2-infected individuals followed in three countries in West Africa from March to December 2012. All HIV-2 infected-patients who attended one of the participating clinics were proposed a plasma HIV-2 viral load measurement. HIV-2 RNA was quantified using the new ultrasensitive in-house real-time PCR assay with a detection threshold of 10 copies/ mL (cps/mL).A total of 351 HIV-2-infected individuals participated in this study, of whom 131 (37.3%) were treatment naïve and 220 (62.7%) had initiated ART. Among treatment-naïve patients, 60 (46.5%) had undetectable plasma HIV-2 viral load (<10 cps/mL), it was detectable between 10-100 cps/mL in 35.8%, between 100-1000 cps/mL in 11.7% and >1000 cps/mL in 6.0% of the patients. Most of the treatment-naïve patients (70.2%) had CD4-T cell count ≥500 cells/mm3 and 43 (46.7%) of these patients had a detectable VL (≥10 cps/mL). Among the 220 patients receiving ART, the median CD4-T cell count rose from 231 to 393 cells/mm3 (IQR [259-561]) after a median follow-up duration of 38 months and 145 (66.0%) patients had CD4-T cell count ≤ 500 cells/mm3 with a median viral load of 10 cps/mL (IQR [10-33]). Seventy five (34.0%) patients had CD4-T cell count ≥ 500 cells/mm3, among them 14 (18.7%) had a VL between 10-100 cps/mL and 2 (2.6%) had VL >100 cps/mL.This study suggests that the combination of CD4-T cell count and ultrasensitive HIV-2 viral load quantification with a threshold of 10 cps/mL, could improve ART initiation among treatment naïve HIV-2-infected patients and the monitoring of ART response among patients receiving treatment."
https://openalex.org/W818664597,"CoREST (CoREST1, rcor1) transcriptional corepressor together with the histone demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A) and the histone deacetylases HDAC1/2 form LSD1-CoREST-HDAC (LCH) transcriptional complexes to regulate gene expression. CoREST1 belong to a family that also comprises CoREST2 (rcor2) and CoREST3 (rcor3). CoREST1 represses the expression of neuronal genes during neuronal differentiation. However, the role of paralogs CoREST2 and CoREST3 in this process is just starting to emerge. Here, we report the expression of all CoRESTs and partners LSD1 and HDAC1/2 in two models of neuronal differentiation: Nerve-Growth-Factor (NGF)-induced neuronal phenotype of PC12 cells, and in vitro maturation of embryonic rat cortical neurons. In both models, a concomitant and gradual decrease of LSD1, HDAC1, HDAC2, CoREST1, and CoREST2, but not CoREST3 was observed. As required by the study, full-length rat rcor1 gene was identified using in silico analysis of available rat genome. The work was also complemented by the analysis of rat RNA-seq databases. The analysis showed that all CoRESTs, including the identified four splicing variants of rat CoREST3, display a wide expression in adult tissues. Moreover, the analysis of RNA-seq databases showed that CoREST2 displays a higher expression than CoREST1 and CoREST3 in the mature brain. Immunofluorescent assays and immunoblots of adult rat brain showed that all CoRESTs are present in both glia and neurons. Regarding functional partnership, CoREST2 and CoREST3 interact with all LSD1 splicing variants. In conclusion, neuronal differentiation is accompanied by decreased expression of all core components of LCH complexes, but not CoREST3. The combination of the differential transcriptional repressor capacity of LCH complexes and variable protein levels of its different components should result in a finely tuned gene expression during neuronal differentiation and in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1865439939,"This study investigates morphological differences between flakes produced via ""core and flake"" technologies and those resulting from bifacial shaping strategies. We investigate systematic variation between two technological groups of flakes using experimentally produced assemblages, and then apply the experimental model to the Cutting 10 Mid -Pleistocene archaeological collection from Elandsfontein, South Africa. We argue that a specific set of independent variables--and their interactions--including external platform angle, platform depth, measures of thickness variance and flake curvature should distinguish between these two technological groups. The role of these variables in technological group separation was further investigated using the Generalized Linear Model as well as Linear Discriminant Analysis. The Discriminant model was used to classify archaeological flakes from the Cutting 10 locality in terms of their probability of association, within either experimentally developed technological group. The results indicate that the selected independent variables play a central role in separating core and flake from bifacial technologies. Thickness evenness and curvature had the greatest effect sizes in both the Generalized Linear and Discriminant models. Interestingly the interaction between thickness evenness and platform depth was significant and played an important role in influencing technological group membership. The identified interaction emphasizes the complexity in attempting to distinguish flake production strategies based on flake morphological attributes. The results of the discriminant function analysis demonstrate that the majority of flakes at the Cutting 10 locality were not associated with the production of the numerous Large Cutting Tools found at the site, which corresponds with previous suggestions regarding technological behaviors reflected in this assemblage."

In the first of two experiments, we trained infants to produce a novel multimodal effect (i.e., a drum beat) and assessed the effects of this training, relative to no training, on their later perception of the synchrony between audio and visual presentation of the drumming action. In a second experiment, we then contrasted this active experience with the observation of drumming in order to test whether observation of the audiovisual effect was as effective for sensitivity to multimodal synchrony as active experience. Our results indicated that active experience provided a unique benefit above and beyond observational experience, providing insights on the embodied roots of (early) music perception and cognition."

https://openalex.org/W1144270415,"Helicobacter pylori causes cellular vacuolation in host cells, a cytotoxic event attributed to vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and the presence of permeant weak bases such as ammonia. We report here the role of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), a constitutively expressed secretory enzyme of H. pylori, in potentiating VacA-dependent vacuolation formation in H. pylori-infected AGS and primary gastric cells. The enhancement is brought about by GGT hydrolysing glutamine present in the extracellular medium, thereby releasing ammonia which accentuates the VacA-induced vacuolation. The events of vacuolation in H. pylori wild type (WT)- and Δggt-infected AGS cells were first captured and visualized by real-time phase-contrast microscopy where WT was observed to induce more vacuoles than Δggt. By using semi-quantitative neutral red uptake assay, we next showed that Δggt induced significantly less vacuolation in AGS and primary gastric epithelial cells as compared to the parental strain (P<0.05) indicating that GGT potentiates the vacuolating effect of VacA. Notably, vacuolation induced by WT was significantly reduced in the absence of GGT substrate, glutamine (P<0.05) or in the presence of a competitive GGT inhibitor, serine-borate complex. Furthermore, the vacuolating ability of Δggt was markedly restored when co-incubated with purified recombinant GGT (rGGT), although rGGT itself did not induce vacuolation independently. Similarly, the addition of exogenous ammonium chloride as a source of ammonia also rescued the ability of Δggt to induce vacuolation. Additionally, we also show that monoclonal antibodies against GGT effectively inhibited GGT activity and successfully suppressed H. pylori-induced vacuolation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that generation of ammonia by GGT through glutamine hydrolysis is responsible for enhancing VacA-dependent vacuolation. Our findings provide a new perspective on GGT as an important virulence factor and a promising target in the management of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases."

To understand the functional effects of SNP associations, we examined the N-terminal segments of nmMLCK by 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectroscopy, a 2-D NMR technique, and by in silico molecular modeling. Both NMR analysis and molecular modeling indicated SNP localization to loops that connect the immunoglobulin-like domains of nmMLCK, consistent with minimal structural changes evoked by these SNPs. Molecular modeling analysis identified protein-protein interaction motifs adversely affected by these MYLK SNPs including binding by the scaffold protein 14-3-3, results confirmed by immunoprecipitation and western blot studies. These structure-function studies suggest novel mechanisms for nmMLCK regulation, which may confirm MYLK as a candidate gene in inflammatory lung disease and advance knowledge of the genetic underpinning of lung-related health disparities."

Ultrasound was performed using a multifrequency linear probe (6-9 MHz). The loops of CEUS were evaluated up to 5 min. The qualitative characterization of IO-SE was based on a color coding system (blue = hard, red = soft). Stiffness of all lesions was quantified by a specific scaling of 0-6 (0 = low, 6 = high) using 7 ROIs (2 central, 5 peripheral).All malignant lesions displayed a characteristic portal venous washout and could be diagnosed correctly by IO-CEUS. 3/5 benign lesions could not be characterized properly either by IO-CEUS or IO-SE prior to resection. Thus for IO-CEUS sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy were 100%, 40%, 94%, 100% and 94%. Lesion sizes were between 8 and 59 mm in diameter. Regarding the IO-SE, malignant lesions showed a marked variability. In qualitative analysis, 31 of the malignant lesions were blue colored denoting overall induration. Thirteen malignant lesions showed an inhomogenous color pattern with partial indurations. Two of the benign lesions also displayed overall induration. The other benign lesions showed an inhomogenous color mapping. Calculated sensitivity of the SE was 70.5%, specificity 60%, PPV 94%, NPV 18.75%, and accuracy 69%.IO-CEUS is useful for localization and characterization of liver lesions prior to surgical resection whereas IO-SE provided correct characterization only for a limited number of lesions."
https://openalex.org/W820598161,"Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is one of the major protein phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. It plays a key role in regulating glycogen synthesis, by dephosphorylating crucial enzymes involved in glycogen homeostasis such as glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP). To play this role, PP1 binds to specific glycogen targeting subunits that, on one hand recognize the substrates to be dephosphorylated and on the other hand recruit PP1 to glycogen particles. In this work we have analyzed the functionality of the different protein binding domains of one of these glycogen targeting subunits, namely PPP1R3D (R6) and studied how binding properties of different domains affect its glycogenic properties. We have found that the PP1 binding domain of R6 comprises a conserved RVXF motif (R102VRF) located at the N-terminus of the protein. We have also identified a region located at the C-terminus of R6 (W267DNND) that is involved in binding to the PP1 glycogenic substrates. Our results indicate that although binding to PP1 and glycogenic substrates are independent processes, impairment of any of them results in lack of glycogenic activity of R6. In addition, we have characterized a novel site of regulation in R6 that is involved in binding to 14-3-3 proteins (RARS74LP). We present evidence indicating that when binding of R6 to 14-3-3 proteins is prevented, R6 displays hyper-glycogenic activity although is rapidly degraded by the lysosomal pathway. These results define binding to 14-3-3 proteins as an additional pathway in the control of the glycogenic properties of R6."
