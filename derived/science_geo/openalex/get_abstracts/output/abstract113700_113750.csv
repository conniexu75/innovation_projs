https://openalex.org/W2080461836,"We report the cloning and characterization of a novel serotonin receptor, designated as 5-HT7, which is coupled to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. 5-HT7 mRNA is expressed discretely throughout the CNS, predominantly in the thalamus and hypothalamus. 5-HT7 has a unique pharmacological profile that redefines agonist and antagonist classification of ligands previously thought to be ""selective."" The circadian phase of spontaneous neuronal activity of the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus advances in response to serotonin ligands with a pharmacological profile consistent exclusively with that of 5-HT7. These findings suggest a physiological role in the regulation of circadian rhythms for one subtype of serotonin receptor, 5-HT7, and provide a pharmacological test to evaluate its role in other neuronal systems."
https://openalex.org/W2015963628,"Mutations in the retinal degeneration, retinal degeneration slow(/peripherin) and rhodopsin genes cause photoreceptor degeneration in humans and mice. Although the phenotypes arising from these mutations are different, suggesting different mechanisms of pathogenesis, we present evidence that apoptosis may be the final common pathway of the disease process linking genotype to phenotype. We observed internucleosomal cleavage of retinal DNA by gel electrophoresis and fragmented DNA at the single cell level by labeling the nicked DNA ends with biotinylated poly(dU). In retinal degeneration mice, DNA fragmentation occurred during the period of photoreceptor degeneration. In retinal degeneration slow mice and in transgenic mice expressing a mutant (Pro347Ser) rhodopsin gene, DNA fragmentation occurred after normal histogenetic cell death (also apoptosis) had ceased. Since DNA fragmentation by internucleosomal cleavage is a cardinal feature of apoptosis, our data suggest that all three of these genetic mutations lead to apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2091024750,"The role of the common low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75, is controversial. Studies using cell lines suggest that p75 is either essential or dispensable for neurotrophin responsiveness. To resolve this issue, we studied the survival response of developing neurons obtained from normal mouse embryos and embryos with a null mutation in the p75 gene. Embryonic cranial sensory and sympathetic neurons from mutant embryos responded normally to NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 at saturating concentrations. Dose responses of sympathetic and visceral sensory neurons from mutant embryos were also normal. In contrast, embryonic cutaneous sensory trigeminal neurons isolated from mutant embryos displayed a consistent displacement in the NGF dose response. Compared with wild-type neurons, the concentration of NGF that promoted half-maximal survival was 3- to 4-fold higher for neurons from homozygous embryos and was 2-fold higher for neurons from heterozygous embryos. These findings indicate that p75 enhances the sensitivity of NGF-dependent cutaneous sensory neurons to NGF and may explain, at least in part, the cutaneous sensory abnormalities of mice homozygous for the p75 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2029737040,"We have examined the role apoptosis plays during postnatal development of the mouse cerebellum by a new method utilizing T7 DNA polymerase for the in situ detection of DNA fragmentation associated with cell death. Granule cell loss between the third and fifth postnatal weeks, hypothesized to affect the granule cell to Purkinje cell stoichiometry, is not associated with DNA fragmentation. However, cerebellar granule cells undergo extensive nuclear DNA fragmentation between postnatal days 5 and 9. Cell death prior to synaptogenesis may help regulate granule cell number. Our results suggest that different mechanisms of cell death within the same neuronal cell population occur during development."

https://openalex.org/W2089011655,"Agrin, which induces acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the developing neuromuscular synapse, occurs in multiple forms generated by alternative splicing. Some of these isoforms are specific to the nervous system; others are expressed in both neural and nonneural tissues, including muscle. We have compared the AChR clustering activity of agrin forms varying at each of the three identified splicing sites, denoted x, y, and z. Agrin isoforms were assayed by applying either transfected COS cells, with agrin bound to their surfaces, or soluble agrin to myotubes of the C2 muscle line, or of two variant lines having defective proteoglycans. Dramatic differences in activity were seen between z site isoforms and lesser differences between y site isoforms. The most active agrin forms contained splicing inserts of 4 amino acids at the γ site and 8 amino acids at the z site. These forms are found exclusively in neural tissue. All forms were active on C2 myotubes in cell-attached assays, but muscle forms were less active than neural forms. AChR clustering activity of all agrin forms was decreased when assayed on the proteoglycan-deficient lines, suggesting that proteoglycans may help mediate the action of agrin. As neural agrin forms are more active than muscle forms, they are likely to play a primary role in synaptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2014370769,"Several 3 alpha-hydroxysteroids accumulate in the brain after local synthesis or after metabolization of steroids that are provided by the adrenals. The 3 alpha-hydroxy ring A-reduced pregnane steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone are believed not to interact with intracellular receptors, but enhance GABA-mediated chloride currents. The present study shows that these neuroactive steroids can regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor. The induction of DNA binding and transcriptional activation of the progesterone receptor requires intracellular oxidation of the neuroactive steroids into progesterone receptor active 5 alpha-pregnane steroids. Thus, at physiological concentrations, these neuroactive steroids regulate neuronal function through their effects on both transmitter-gated ion channels and steroid receptor-regulated gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2008256279,"Agrin is an extracellular matrix protein involved in clustering acetylcholine receptors during development of the neuromuscular junction. We have previously shown that alternative splicing at three sites generates multiple forms of rat agrin and that a novel 8 amino acid insert is the most important in determining biological activity. In the present study we have examined the expression of agrin during development with particular emphasis on determining the tissue distribution of the splicing variants at each site. Our principal observation is that the variants containing the sequence most responsible for biological activity are expressed exclusively in neural tissue and that their expression is highly regulated during development. We also show that muscle expresses less active forms and that agrin immunoreactivity during synaptogenesis is initially not limited to synaptic sites, but becomes progressively restricted to the synapse as development proceeds."

https://openalex.org/W1559804972,"p74raf-1, a serine/threonine kinase, is structurally related to the protein kinase C (PKC) family and contains a cysteine motif in its N-terminal domain, which is essential for its regulation. It has been shown that p74raf-1 functions upstream of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase. We have constructed a p74raf-1 mutant (N delta raf) that only contains the N-terminal regulatory domain. When transiently expressed in COS-M6 cells, N delta raf efficiently blocked the activation of the MAP extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK2), induced by either epidermal growth factor, phorbol ester, serum, or oncogenic p21ras. Similar constructs with the cysteine motifs from either PKC-alpha or diacylglycerol kinase did not inhibit activation of ERK2. Overexpression of full-length p74raf-1 rescued the inhibition of ERK2 by N delta raf in a stimulus dependent manner, indicating that N delta raf acts as a competitive inhibitor of wild-type p74raf-1. In contrast, overexpression of either PKC-alpha, -epsilon, or -zeta in N delta raf-containing cells could not rescue the inhibition of ERK2. We conclude that p74raf-1 is an essential mediator of epidermal growth factor- and phorbol ester-induced ERK2 activation and that the MAP kinase kinase activity of p74raf-1 cannot be substituted with either PKC-alpha, -epsilon or -zeta."
https://openalex.org/W1974777593,"By adapting to sustained stimuli, hair cells of the internal ear maintain their optimal sensitivity to minute displacements. Biophysical experiments have suggested that adaptation is mediated by a molecular motor, most likely a member of the myosin family. To provide direct evidence for the presence of myosin isozymes in hair bundles, we used photoaffinity labeling with vanadate-trapped uridine and adenine nucleotides to identify proteins of 120, 160, and 230 kd in a preparation of hair bundles purified from the bullfrog's sacculus. The photoaffinity labeling properties of these proteins, particularly the 120 kd protein, resembled those of other well-characterized myosins. A 120 kd hair-bundle protein was also recognized by a monoclonal antibody directed against a vertebrate myosin I isozyme. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized this protein near the beveled top edge of the hair bundle, the site of mechano-electrical transduction and adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2153909879,"M6 is a membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on central neurons and certain polarized epithelia from early developmental stage. Antibodies against M6 interfere with cerebellar neurite outgrowth in vitro. Two closely related cDNAs were obtained by expression cloning, both of which showed high homology with the major CNS myelin protein PLP/DM20. Although M6 and PLP/DM20 share many molecular characteristics, in situ hybridization revealed nonoverlapping distributions of their mRNAs in mouse CNS. The identification of a gene family including neuron-specific M6 and glia-specific PLP/DM20 in CNS suggests a broader functional role for these molecules than myelination."
https://openalex.org/W1597334704,"Addition of 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to HepG2 human hepatoma cells blocks secretion of newly made albumin and causes it to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum in the reduced state. Subsequent incubation of the cells in the absence of DTT allows the reduced albumin to form apparently normal disulfide bonds and to be secreted normally. Similarly, DTT treatment causes all newly made subunits of the H1 subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in the reduced state; following removal of DTT H1 subunits form disulfide bonds via a normal endoplasmic reticulum folding intermediate and mature to the Golgi. Thus, apparently normal formation of disulfide bonds on these two proteins can occur post-translationally, as has been shown previously for the influenza HA hemagglutinin (Braakman, I., Helenius, J., and Helenius, A. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 1717-1722; Braakman, I., Helenius, J., and Helenius, A. (1992) Nature 356, 260-262). alpha 1-Antitrypsin contains no disulfide bonds; in the continuous presence of DTT it acquires a normal complement of complex oligosaccharides and is secreted at an only slightly reduced rate. Thus, the secretory pathway functions efficiently even when it is reduced by DTT. Endoplasmic reticulum retention of albumin and H1 during treatment with DTT presumably occurs because, without disulfide bonds, these proteins cannot fold properly, not because of any defect in the overall processes of vesicular transport and protein secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2004624238,"4-Aminopyridine (4AP) blocks the intracellular mouth of voltage-gated K+ channels. We identified critical regions for 4AP binding with chimeric channels in which segments of a low affinity clone (Kv2.1, IC50 = 18 mM) were replaced with those of a high affinity clone (Kv3.1, IC50 = 0.1 mM) 4AP sensitivity was not tranferred with the S5–S6 linker (pore or P region) Instead, a chimera of the cytoplasmic half of S6 increased block 20-fold, without affecting gating.A double chimera of the cytoplasmic halves of S5 and S6 fully transferred 4AP sensitivity. Because 4AP block was inhibited by tetrapentylammonium, we conclude that determinants of 4AP binding lie in the S6 segment that forms the cytoplasmic vestibule of the pore and that this site may overlap a quaternary ammonium site."
https://openalex.org/W1491106772,"Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Bloom's syndrome (BS) patients are characterized by sensitivity to radiation, increased lymphoid malignancy, and frequent translocations to the antigen receptor loci. Because of these features, there has been a persistent question as to whether the V(D)J recombinase might be abnormal in cells from these patients. Such abnormalities might be due to inappropriate to inaccurate expression of components of the V(D)J recombinase or due to mutation in a component shared between V(D)J recombination and other cellular processes, such as DNA repair. Bloom's syndrome is associated with a ligation deficiency, and this activity may contribute in the end resolution steps of both site-specific and general DNA-processing reactions. In the current study, we have activated V(D)J recombination in normal, AT, and BS fibroblasts and in fibroblasts from a patient with mutations that largely abolish DNA ligase I activity. We find that the signal and coding joint formation of the V(D)J recombination reaction are entirely normal in AT, BS, and DNA ligase I mutant cells. In addition to ruling out abnormalities of the V(D)J recombinase in AT, BS, and DNA ligase I mutant cells, these studies suggest that DNA ligase I is unlikely to be required for signal or coding end joining in the V(D)J recombination reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1969203942,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is concentrated at the vertebrate neuromuscular synapse. To determine whether increased transcript levels could underlie this selective accumulation, we employed a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based assay to determine mRNA copy number in samples as small as single neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and a microassay to measure AChE enzyme activity at single synapses. Our results show that AChE mRNA is an intermediate transcript at NMJs, whereas in noninnervated regions of muscle fibers, AChE transcripts are either undetectable or rare. In contrast, alpha-actin transcript levels in the same samples are similar in junctional and extrajunctional regions. However, compared with AChE enzyme activity and alpha-actin mRNA levels, the levels of AChE transcripts at NMJs are highly variable. These results indicate that AChE mRNA and protein expression are compartmentalized at the vertebrate NMJ and provide a direct approach toward dissecting the molecular events leading from synaptic activation to plastic changes in gene expression at single vertebrate synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2063042652,"In the striatum, dopamine generates arachidonic acid (AA) and induces synaptic depression. Here, we report that Na+ channels are a target for AA in both cultured and acutely isolated striatal neurons. AA depressed veratrine-induced Na+ influx and neurotransmitter release. Whole-cell voltage clamp revealed that peak Na+ currents are depressed, and steady-state inactivation shifts −15 mV in the presence of AA. Furthermore, inactivation was accelerated, and recovery from inactivation was delayed. These actions of AA were not produced by AA metabolites or protein kinase C activation. In addition, AA reduced both the amplitude and frequency of action potentials and depressed spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents without affecting miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These data suggest that AA modulates presynaptic, Na+-dependent action potentials, thereby contributing to striatal synaptic depression."
https://openalex.org/W2003313169,"Bright light bleaches visual pigment and leads to a persistent desensitization of isolated rod and cone photoreceptors called bleaching adaptation. Bleaching adaptation results from the combined effects of pigment depletion and adaptational modulation of certain cellular reactions in the visual transduction cascade. Here, we present evidence that in solitary cone photoreceptors isolated from the salamander retina, the latter effect is due to the presence of free opsin in the outer segment. Also, we demonstrate that this ""opsin adaptation"" can be reversed by treating the cells with synthetic retinoids similar to 11-cis retinal but having polyene chains too short to form protonated Schiff base attachments to opsin."
https://openalex.org/W1501887512,"Retinol, a metabolic precursor of retinal and retinoic acid, is transported in plasma by the plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP). The cellular uptake of retinol from RBP is believed to involve a specific membrane receptor for RBP. In retinal pigment epithelium the RBP receptor appears to be an oligomeric protein complex, and we have previously identified a 63-kDa membrane protein as part of this receptor. The 63-kDa protein (p63) has now been isolated, and we have cloned the corresponding cDNA. In a data base search no sequences similar to p63 were identified. Hydropathy analyses of the 533 amino acids deduced from the cDNA sequence did not indicate an N-terminal signal sequence or obvious transmembrane regions. In vitro translation of synthetic mRNA encoding p63, in the presence of heterologous microsomes, verified that p63 does not become cotranslationally membrane-inserted. Transcripts for p63 are abundantly expressed in retinal pigment epithelium with no detectable expression in several other tissues. Southern blotting analysis of bovine and human genomic DNA revealed several hybridizing fragments suggesting a complex organization of the corresponding genes."
https://openalex.org/W1660255712,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type Gr (CaM kinase-Gr) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase which is enriched in the brain and thymus. In this study, we examined the expression of CaM kinase-Gr in human lymphocytes and the regulation of its catalytic activity by antigen receptor signaling. CaM kinase-Gr was found selectively expressed in T lymphocytes in a developmentally regulated manner. It was present at severalfold higher levels in immature thymocytes (CD3low, CD4+CD8+) relative to mature thymocytes (CD3high, CD4+CD8-/CD8+CD4-) or to circulating T lymphocytes. The kinase was preferentially expressed in CD4+ T lymphocytes, but was not detected in B lymphocytes or in monocytes. The impact of T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex (TCR.CD3) signaling on kinase activity was examined using Jurkat human leukemic T lymphocytes as a model. Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti TCR.CD3 monoclonal antibody induced rapid autophosphorylation of the kinase on serine residues and a dramatic, autophosphorylation-dependent enhancement of both Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent and autonomous kinase activity. Enzyme autophosphorylation and activation were dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ following receptor signaling but could not be induced by an influx of extra-cellular Ca2+ triggered by ionophores, indicating that additional signals delivered via TCR.CD3 contribute to the activation of CaM kinase-Gr. These findings suggest a role for CaM kinase-Gr in T lymphocyte development and activation and indicate the presence of stringent regulatory mechanisms governing the activity of this kinase in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1485533681,"The protease, alpha-thrombin (alpha Th), affects myocardial cell contractility, a feature common among agents that induce hypertrophy. However, it is not known whether cardiac myocytes possess alpha Th receptors (alpha Th-R), or if long term treatment with alpha Th can enhance growth and gene expression. In the present study primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes expressed a 3.6-kilobase mRNA species that hybridized with a rat alpha Th-R-specific probe. After 48 h, alpha Th induced hypertrophy, sarcomeric organization, and enhanced atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression, all of which were blocked by the alpha Th-selective protease inhibitor, D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone. The alpha Th-R agonist peptide, SFLLRNPND, was a potent activator of ANF expression, however, the non-agonist, FLLRNPND, was inactive. Transfection experiments showed the enhancement of ANF expression by alpha Th to be transcriptional. The abilities of alpha Th to induce myocyte hypertrophy and to augment ANF transcription and peptide production were inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerythrine, and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin. Thus, myocardial cell alpha Th-Rs are stimulated by the specific proteolytic actions of alpha Th, and pathways involving both protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinases are required for subsequent hypertrophy and ANF expression. Further, these findings suggest a new role for extracellular proteases as regulators of myocardial cell gene expression and growth."
https://openalex.org/W1564881569,"In order to facilitate biochemical studies of cell-surface receptors, a plasmid allowing the expression of the periplasmic domain of the aspartate receptor from Salmonella typhimurium as a soluble periplasmic protein has been constructed. This 18-kDa protein is exported to the periplasm, where it may be extracted by mild osmotic lysis. This isolated domain behaves as a normal, soluble protein and has been purified to homogeneity by standard techniques. The purified periplasmic domain binds aspartate with a kD similar to that of the full-length receptor, and the binding occurs with negative cooperativity, i.e. the binding of one molecule of aspartate induces a conformational change that interferes with the binding of the second aspartate. Unlike the full-length receptor, the periplasmic domain undergoes a protein concentration- and aspartate-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium. At low protein concentrations and in the absence of aspartate, the protein is monomeric. At higher protein concentrations or in the presence of saturating aspartate, the protein is dimeric. Two charge variants of the protein have been identified on native polyacrylamide gels. The more acidic form is blocked to Edman degradation, indicating that modification of the amino terminus of this protein can occur after cleavage of the signal peptide in the periplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1995877869,"We have used a new technique, micro-CALI (chromophore-assisted laser inactivation), to investigate the function of the neural cell adhesion molecules fasciclin I and II in the development of the grasshopper Ti1 neurons. Micro-CALI of fasciclin I results in defasciculation of the Ti1 axons similar to that achieved using large scale CALI (Jay and Keshishian,1990). The initial point of axon separation corresponds to the site of laser irradiation, and defasciculation always continues distal to this point. Micro-CALI of fasciclin II prevents the initiation of Ti1 axon outgrowth but has no effect on fasciculation. This effect is restricted to a 3 hr interval between cytokinesis and growth cone emergence."

https://openalex.org/W1907886138,"Abstract Receptors for peptide YY (PYY) were identified in the PKSV-PCT renal proximal tubule cell line, derived from transgenic mice (SV40 large T antigen under the control of the rat L-type pyruvate kinase 5'-regulatory sequence). Binding of [125I-Tyr36]monoiodo-PYY ([125I] PYY to cell was specific, saturable, and reversible. The order of potency for peptides for inhibiting [125I]PYY binding was: PYY > neuropeptide Y (NPY) = PYY (13-36) > pancreatic polypeptide. A single class of receptors was observed with a Kd of 0.37 +/- 0.05 nM and a Bmax of 103 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein. After cross-linking, electrophoresis of covalent [125I]PYY-receptor complexes revealed a single band of M(r) 50,000. PYY receptors were exclusively present at the basolateral membrane surface of polarized cells and were coupled negatively to adenylylcyclase by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. PKSV-PCT cell growth and T antigen expression could be modulated by D-glucose in the medium. PYY receptors were exclusively expressed in proliferative cells cultured in the presence of D-glucose. PYY receptors disappeared in the absence of D-glucose and were expressed again when proliferation was activated by reintroduction of D-glucose. PYY stimulated cell growth (17-26% increase) and promoted [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (64% increase; ED50 = 5 nM PYY) of cells grown in D-glucose-enriched medium. This latter effect of PYY was largely reversed by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. These findings suggest that PYY receptors play a role in epithelial cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1511007389,"Xenopus oocytes exhibit a receptor-evoked Cl- current that is mediated through the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and release of intracellular Ca2+. The identity of PLC(s) mediating this effect is unknown. We have cloned cDNAs encoding a new form of PLC-beta from a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library. The Xenopus PLC-beta has substantial (33-64%) homology with mammalian beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and beta 4 phospholipase C and is closest to PLC-beta 3, with 64% identity and 80% similarity. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides to a specific region of Xenopus PLC-beta results in degradation of its mRNA and significantly reduces Cl- currents evoked by both endogenous angiotensin receptors and expressed mammalian alpha 1b-adrenergic receptors and M1-muscarinic receptors as compared to responses in sense oligonucleotide-injected oocytes. Inhibition of the M1-muscarinic response by antisense oligonucleotides was nonadditive with pertussis toxin inhibition. PLC antisense oligonucleotide-injected oocytes show Cl- current responses to IP3 that are indistinguishable from sense oligonucleotide-injected oocytes. Since the receptor responses are pertussis toxin-sensitive, we conclude that we have isolated a new form of PLC-beta involved in the pertussis toxin-sensitive receptor stimulation of the Ca2+ activated Cl- current in Xenopus oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1546820826,"Human cyclins A and B1 were assembled with the cdk2 or cdc2 protein to reconstitute their respective kinase activities in vitro. Both cyclins complemented either cdk2 or cdc2, yielding kinase activities that supported the phosphorylation of histone H1. Activation of cdk2-catalyzed H1 kinase activity by cyclin A required a 10-min preincubation of the two components, whereas cdc2 kinase supported phosphate incorporation without a detectable time lag upon the addition of cyclin B1, suggesting a slower association rate of cdk2 with cyclin A compared with cdc2 and cyclin B1. Both cdk2 and cyclin A, as well as cdc2 and cyclin B1, formed stable complexes in the absence of ATP and substrate that could be isolated after glycerol gradient centrifugation. Incubation of the isolated complexes with ATP and histone H1 supported the phosphorylation of the substrate. Cyclin A-activated cdk2 or cdc2 phosphorylated p107, a pRB-related cellular protein, 10 times more effectively than the cyclin B1-complexed kinases. This was most likely due to a direct association of cyclin A with p107 (Ewen, M. E., Faha, B., Harlow, E., and Livingston, D. (1992) Science 255, 85-87; Faha, B., Ewen, M. E., Tsai, L.-H., Livingston, D., and Harlow, E. (1992) Science 255, 87-90). The reconstituted cdc2-cyclin B1 complex incorporated 4-5-fold more phosphate into the p34 subunit of the three-subunit (p70, p34, and p14) human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (also called RP-A), a DNA replication and DNA repair factor, than cdc2-cyclin A. No detectable phosphorylation of the p34 protein was observed with cdk2 complexed with either cyclin B1 or A. These data indicate that both cyclins as well as the catalytic subunits are important factors in controlling the rate of phosphorylation of a given substrate. The cyclin-activated cdc2 family kinases may target their cellular substrates through cyclin-mediated protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1519007363,"In a continuous line of rat thyroid cells transformed by the k-ras oncogene (KiKi), the expression of ras-p21 correlates with an increased activity of a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase A2, which leads to elevated levels of glycerophosphoinositols. In this study we have characterized the biological activities of these compounds. Growth and differentiation in thyroid cells are mainly regulated by the activation of adenylylcyclase. Therefore, we have studied the effects of glycerophosphoinositols on the activity of this enzyme using a normal thyroid cell line (FRTL5). Micromolar concentrations of glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate (GroPIns-4-P) caused a approximately 50% inhibition of the adenylylcyclase activity in FRTL5 membranes stimulated by the GTP-binding protein activator fluoroaluminate. Similar concentrations of GroPIns-4-P were detected in KiKi cells but not in the normal FRTL5 line. Micromolar GroPIns-4-P was found to be taken up by intact FRTL5 cells and to induce nearly 50% inhibition of the thyrotropin- and cholera toxin-induced increase in cAMP levels. Similar results were also observed in other cell lines (smooth muscle, pituitary cells, and pneumocytes). GroPIns-4-P inhibited cAMP-dependent cellular functions such as iodide uptake and thymidine incorporation in FRTL5 cells when stimulated by thyrotropin and cholera toxin but not when induced by forskolin. These results are consistent with GroPIns-4-P exerting an inhibitory effect on the GTP-binding protein that stimulates adenylycyclase. We propose that GroPIns-4-P might mediate a mechanism of cross-talk between adenylylcyclase and phospholipase A2 in thyroid as well as in other cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W1523989569,"Calcitonin, a peptide hormone active in calcium homeostasis, is used in the treatment of bone loss disorders because it inhibits osteoclast function. A human calcitonin receptor was cloned and expressed in baby hamster kidney cells. Three independent stable transfectants respond to calcitonin via increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and cyclic adenosine 3‘,5‘-monophosphate (cAMP). We made the interesting observation that these cells also respond to millimolar increases in extracellular calcium via a rapid and sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i, whereas three calcitonin receptor-negative baby hamster kidney cell lines, two of which express recombinant receptors related to the calcitonin receptor, show no sensitivity to changes in extracellular calcium. The increase of [Ca2+]i in response to both calcitonin and extracellular calcium is a function of the average number of calcitonin receptors per cell. These studies suggest a dual role for the calcitonin receptor as a hormone receptor and an extracellular calcium sensor."
https://openalex.org/W1577644373,"Two hyperactive mutants of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP), W51F and W51A, catalyze the enhanced oxidation of a number of substituted anilines. The reaction of CCP compound ES with mesidine is biphasic, while similar reactions using compound II give monophasic kinetics. These data, in addition to the ratio of the Fe4+ = O and free-radical species observed during steady-state turnover, indicate that reduction of the Trp-191 free radical of compound ES is more rapid than the reduction of the Fe4+ = O species. Transient kinetics were examined for the oxidation of eight mono-substituted anilines by CCP, W51F, and W51A. Each of the aniline derivatives were oxidized by the mutants at rates that exceeded that of the wild-type enzyme, and the rate constant for m-chloroaniline was 400-fold faster for W51F than for wild-type CCP. Variations in the rate constants for the different substrates follow a linear free-energy relationship using the Hammet substituent effect parameter sigma +, implicating electron transfer from the aniline ring in the transition state. For aniline oxidation, the free energy of activation is 3 kcal/mol lower for the mutants than for wild-type CCP, and this is due primarily to an increase in the activation entropy. These results indicate that the enhanced kinetics of W51F and W51A result from a generalized increase in enzyme reactivity characterized by an exo-entropic transition state such as dissociation of bound H2O from the Fe4+ = O center."

https://openalex.org/W1541911998,"The sequence-specific interactions of bulky carcinogens with purified DNA might reasonably be expected to be altered when the DNA is organized into chromatin. We have approached this subject by studying the covalent binding of a potent carcinogen, 7r,8t-dihydroxy-9t,10t-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE-I) to nucleosomal and free DNA, using a defined fragment of DNA derived from the 5'-end of the 5 S rRNA gene of Xenopus laevis, reconstituted into nucleosomes by salt exchange with unlabeled chicken mononucleosomes. Micrococcal nuclease and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments demonstrated the formation of a uniquely positioned nucleosome covering the transcriptional start point of the gene. The reconstituted nucleosomes or control DNA samples were modified with BPDE-I. DNA was repurified from the nucleosomal and control modification reactions and then irradiated with laser light at 355 nm, causing strand breaks at the positions of adducts. Nucleosomal DNA exhibited a marked decrease in the level of carcinogen binding, especially in the central 80-90 base pairs of the nucleosomal region. Interestingly, although overall binding was inhibited about 2-fold, the sequence-specific pattern of binding to deoxyguanosine residues seen with purified DNA was maintained in the nucleosomal DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1540747875,"Cellular localization of cytochrome (cyt) c550, a low potential, c-type monoheme cytochrome, in a thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus vulcanus was investigated by systematic fractionation of the cells followed by its enzymatic and immunological detection. While cyt c-553, a soluble cyt that donates an electron to P700, was detected in the supernatant of osmotic disruption of lysozyme-treated cells, cyt c550 was detected only in the thylakoid membrane fraction, being tightly bound to thylakoids, and its removal required sonication in the presence of 1 M CaCl2. Upon further fractionation of the thylakoids into photosystem (PS) I and PSII by lauryl dimethylamine N-oxide solubilization, cyt c550 was exclusively concentrated in the crude PSII fraction together with cyt f, with no significant amount being detected in any of the soluble and PSI fractions. Upon further fractionation of the crude PSII by n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside solubilization followed by column chromatography, cyt c550 was detected exclusively in the purified PSII core complex fraction but not in any other fractions. A 12-kDa protein, one of the extrinsic components of cyanobacterial PSII, exhibited completely the same behavior as that of cyt c550 during these fractionation procedures. These results, coupled with our previous results that cyt c550 binds stoichiometrically to the cyanobacterial PSII core complex and enhances O2 evolution (Shen, J.-R., and Inoue, Y. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 1825-1832), indicate that there is only one species of cyt c550 in cyanobacterial cells and that this cyt is exclusively associated with PSII as a functional component for O2 evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1604978548,"In Xenopus oocytes, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase can be activated by progesterone treatment or by microinjection of cyclin A, both of which lead to activation of the cdc2 protein kinase. The tyrosine kinase pp60v-src has previously been shown to accelerate progesterone-induced oocyte maturation and to increase the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 by pp90rsk, most likely by activating MAP kinase. In extracts of resting oocytes, MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase were activated by addition of pp60v-src or cyclin A. Activation by pp60v-src was blocked by a dominant-negative p21ras protein (RAST), but activation by cyclin A/cdc2 was unaffected. Thus these two pathways that converge at MAP kinase kinase but are clearly divergent upstream of a p21ras-dependent step can be studied in a cell-free system."

https://openalex.org/W1490624236,"The genes that encode human cdc2 and cdk2 proteins are essential for cell cycle progression. In this report, we describe the purification of cyclin-associated cdc2 and cdk2 kinases as well as cyclin-free cdc2 and cdk2 protein preparations from HeLa cells. The cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex that we have isolated, consisting of two polypeptides of p60 (cyclin B) and p34 (cdc2), phosphorylated both the p34 and p70 subunits of the three-subunit human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (also called RP-A), a DNA replication and repair factor. We also partially purified a histone H1 kinase activity that is associated with the cdk2 and cyclin A proteins. Purified human cyclins A and B1, overproduced in bacteria, complemented a cellular fraction enriched in cdc2 and cdk2 proteins to reconstitute histone H1 kinase activity. Using this complementation system, human cdc2 and cdk2 proteins were purified and separated from one another. Glycerol gradient analyses demonstrated that the purified cdk2 (p33) protein co-sedimented with a cyclin A-dependent H1 kinase activity. Thus, cdk2 and cyclin A proteins are components that assemble to yield a kinase complex that catalyzes the phosphorylation of histone H1."
https://openalex.org/W1503837019,"The dgt gene of Escherichia coli encodes a deoxyguanosine triphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dGTPase) that hydrolyzes dGTP to deoxyguanosine and tripolyphosphate. The enzyme is highly specific for dGTP which is hydrolyzed with a Km of 2-5 microM. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays demonstrate that, under physiological salt conditions, dGTPase binds with apparent cooperativity to single-stranded DNA with an association constant of 7.7 x 10(6) M-1. In the presence of NaCl, dGTPase binds weakly to double-stranded DNA. In the absence of NaCl, dGTPase binds both single- and double-stranded DNA with an association constant of 1 x 10(7) M-1. The dGTPase-double-stranded DNA complex, however, is readily dissociated with NaCl. Divalent cations such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ enhance, but are not required for DNA binding. The presence of dGTP or GTP does not effect the ability of dGTPase to bind DNA. dGTPase binds to oligonucleotides of length 17-35, but with lower affinities. The homopolymers poly(dT) and poly(rU) act as effective competitors of single-stranded DNA for binding to dGTPase. The bacteriophage T7 gene 1.2 protein, which specifically inhibits the enzymatic activity of dGTPase, also prevents dGTPase from binding to single-stranded DNA. dGTPase inhibits the activity of T7 DNA polymerase on a poly(dA)-oligo(dT) template. This inhibition is reversed by prior incubation of dGTPase with the T7 gene 1.2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1535419115,"Tetrazole-myoglobin (Tet-Mb), a site selectively modified myoglobin with tetrazole anion (-CN4-) covalently attached to the imidazole N epsilon of the distal histidine 64(E7) (see Fig. 1; Kamiya, N., Shiro, Y., Iwata, T., Iizuka, T., and Iwasaki, H. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 1826-1829), exhibited unique properties in the reduction from ferric to ferrous states and in the reaction of its deoxy form with O2. The redox potential of Tet-Mb is obtained to be -193 mV, which is much lower than that of unmodified (native) myoglobin (50 mV), possibly due to the electrostatic interaction between the heme iron and the tetrazole group. The ferrous deoxy form of Tet-Mb was rapidly oxidized to its ferric form in the reaction with O2 at room temperature through an intermediary formation of its oxy form and with the generation of O2-. The oxy form of Tet-Mb can be detected by the optical spectral measurement at -12 degrees C, the rapid scan measurement at room temperature, and the electron spin resonance measurement of its cobalt-substituted derivative (Tet-Mb(Co2+)) at 77 K. In the kinetic measurement of the O2 binding reaction to Tet-Mb, its association and dissociation rate constants in the bimolecular reaction were 6.1 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and 2200 s-1, respectively, showing that the tetrazole modification of His-64 extremely accelerates its association and dissociation rates. Taken together with the extremely fast autoxidation rate (53 h-1) obtained, these kinetic results suggested that the channel of O2 from the solvent region to the protein interior is open enough to pass the external ligand. The structure is discussed in relation to those of some genetic mutants. Taking these properties, we demonstrated that Tet-Mb can catalyze O2 consumption to generate O2-, coupled with the NADH-supported enzymatic reduction system of cytochrome P-450cam under an aerobic condition."
