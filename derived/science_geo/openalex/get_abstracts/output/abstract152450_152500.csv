https://openalex.org/W2024996523,"A critical function of tumor suppressor p53 is the induction of apoptosis in cells exposed to noxious stresses. We report a previously unidentified pro-apoptotic gene, Noxa. Expression of Noxa induction in primary mouse cells exposed to x-ray irradiation was dependent on p53. Noxa encodes a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins; this member contains the BH3 region but not other BH domains. When ectopically expressed, Noxa underwent BH3 motif-dependent localization to mitochondria and interacted with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, resulting in the activation of caspase-9. We also demonstrate that blocking the endogenous Noxa induction results in the suppression of apoptosis. Noxa may thus represent a mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis."

Analysis of Clock/Clock mutant mice, homozygous Period2(Brdm1) mutants, and Cryptochrome-deficient mice reveals substantially altered Bmal1 rhythms, consistent with a dominant role of PERIOD2 in the positive regulation of the Bmal1 loop. In vitro analysis of CRYPTOCHROME inhibition of CLOCK: BMAL1-mediated transcription shows that the inhibition is through direct protein:protein interactions, independent of the PERIOD and TIMELESS proteins. PERIOD2 is a positive regulator of the Bmal1 loop, and CRYPTOCHROMES are the negative regulators of the Period and Cryptochrome cycles."

Aerosol pollution is expected to exert a net cooling influence on the global climate through these conventional mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate an opposite mechanism through which aerosols can reduce cloud cover and thus significantly offset aerosol-induced radiative cooling at the top of the atmosphere on a regional scale. In model simulations, the daytime clearing of trade cumulus is hastened and intensified by solar heating in dark haze (as found over much of the northern Indian Ocean during the northeast monsoon)."
https://openalex.org/W1577573926,"Here we show that cells lacking focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are refractory to motility signals from platelet-derived and epidermal growth factors (PDGF and EGF respectively), and that stable re-expression of FAK rescues these defects. FAK associates with activated PDGF- and EGF-receptor (PDGFR and EGFR) signalling complexes, and expression of the band-4.1-like domain at the FAK amino terminus is sufficient to mediate an interaction with activated EGFR. However, efficient EGF-stimulated cell migration also requires FAK to be targeted, by its carboxy-terminal domain, to sites of integrin-receptor clustering. Although the kinase activity of FAK is not needed to promote PDGF- or EGF-stimulated cell motility, kinase-inactive FAK is transphosphorylated at the indispensable Src-kinase-binding site, FAK Y397, after EGF stimulation of cells. Our results establish that FAK is an important receptor-proximal link between growth-factor-receptor and integrin signalling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2112907243,"A nanofluidic channel device, consisting of many entropic traps, was designed and fabricated for the separation of long DNA molecules. The channel comprises narrow constrictions and wider regions that cause size-dependent trapping of DNA at the onset of a constriction. This process creates electrophoretic mobility differences, thus enabling efficient separation without the use of a gel matrix or pulsed electric fields. Samples of long DNA molecules (5000 to approximately 160,000 base pairs) were efficiently separated into bands in 15-millimeter-long channels. Multiple-channel devices operating in parallel were demonstrated. The efficiency, compactness, and ease of fabrication of the device suggest the possibility of more practical integrated DNA analysis systems."
https://openalex.org/W2013430677,The increase in sea level from the last glacial maximum has been derived from a siliciclastic system on the tectonically stable Sunda Shelf in Southeast Asia. The time from 21 to 14 thousand calendar years before the present has been poorly covered in other records. The record generally confirms sea-level reconstructions from coral reefs. The rise of sea level during meltwater pulse 1A was as much as 16 meters within 300 years (14.6 to 14.3 thousand years ago).

https://openalex.org/W2064002302,"The physical and chemical properties of the hydrated alpha-Al(2)O(3) (0001) surface are important for understanding the reactivity of natural and synthetic aluminum-containing oxides. The structure of this surface was determined in the presence of water vapor at 300 kelvin by crystal truncation rod diffraction at a third-generation synchrotron x-ray source. The fully hydrated surface is oxygen terminated, with a 53% contracted double Al layer directly below. The structure is an intermediate between alpha-Al(2)O(3) and gamma-Al(OH)(3), a fully hydroxylated form of alumina. A semiordered oxygen layer about 2.3 angstroms above the terminal oxygen layer is interpreted as adsorbed water. The clean alpha-Al(2)O(3) (0001) surface, in contrast, is Al terminated and significantly relaxed relative to the bulk structure. These differences explain the different reactivities of the clean and hydroxylated surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2084736894,"Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has been shown to act as an inhibitor of apoptosis. We have also observed an inhibitory effect of HSP70 on apoptotic cell death both in preheated U937 and stably transfected HSP70-overexpressing U937 (U937/HSP70) cells. However, the molecular mechanism whereby HSP70 prevents apoptosis still remains to be solved. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of HSP70 on apoptotic processes in an in vitro system. Caspase-3 cleavage and DNA fragmentation were detected in cytosolic fractions from normal cells upon addition of dATP, but not from preheated U937 or U937/hsp70 cells. Moreover, the addition of purified recombinant HSP70 to normal cytosolic fractions prevented caspase-3 cleavage and DNA fragmentation, suggesting that HSP70 prevents apoptosis upstream of caspase-3 processing. Because cytochrome c was still released from mitochondria into the cytosol by lethal heat shock despite prevention of caspase-3 activation and cell death in both preheated U937 and U937/hsp70 cells, it was evident that HSP70 acts downstream of cytochrome c release. Results obtained in vitrowith purified deletion mutants of HSP70 showed that the carboxyl one-third region (from amino acids 438 to 641) including the peptide-binding domain and the carboxyl-terminal EEVD sequence was essential to prevent caspase-3 processing. From these results, we conclude that HSP70 acts as a strong suppressor of apoptosis acting downstream of cytochrome c release and upstream of caspase-3 activation. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has been shown to act as an inhibitor of apoptosis.

Apoptosis can be induced by a variety of different signals, including activation of the Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptors, growth factor deprivation, excessive DNA damage, treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, or stresses such as heat shock, hyperosmotic shock, or UV irradiation (8Martin S.J.

Apoptosis signals such as Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor activate procaspase-8 through molecular interactions between components of the death-inducing signaling complex (12Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Salvesen1 G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid (Bcl-2 interacting protein), and the carboxyl-terminal domain translocates to mitochondria where it initiates cytochromec release (14Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome ctriggers the formation of a complex containing Apaf1, a mammalian CED-4 homologue, and procaspase-9, which is then autoprocessed and thereby capable of processing downstream effector procaspases such as procaspase-3 (15Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula M.S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). The processing of these caspases is followed by the cleavage of apoptotic substrates, leading to the disruption of important cellular processes, changes in cellular and nuclear morphology, and ultimately to cell death (16Lazebnik Y.A.

Diverse apoptotic signals for caspase activation converge at the mitochondria level, provoking the release of cytochrome c, which participates in the central control or executioner phase of the cell death cascade (19Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 20Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). However, the role of cytochrome c release in apoptosis is still confusing and contradictable, and the mechanism of cytochrome c release has not been elucidated. Because ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases may result from excessive apoptosis, it may be beneficial to limit apoptosis as a way to manage these diseases (22Gervais F.G. Xu D.G. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y.X. Huang J.Q. Smith A.L.D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J.

Cellular and viral proteins such as Bcl-2, CrmA, and IAP1 might serve as therapeutic agents to inhibit apoptosis, because Bcl-2 prevents cytochrome c release, CrmA inhibits caspase-8, and IAP blocks caspase-3 activation (13Salvesen1 G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). In addition, HSP70 has been suggested as a promising molecule for controlling apoptosis because HSP70-overexpressing transgenic mice showed reduced brain and heart ischemia (24Trost S.U. Omens J.H.

HSPs can be induced by various stresses such as ethanol, amino acid analogues, infection, inhibitors of energy metabolism, and heavy metals (26Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In addition to its chaperoning function for folding, transport, and assembly of newly synthesized polypeptides (27Hartl F.U.

HSP70 prevents caspase-3 and SAPK/JNK activation in heat shock- or ceramide-induced apoptosis (34Ahn J.H. Ko Y.G. Park W.Y. Kang Y.S. Chung H.Y. Seo J.S. Mol.

Despite recent advances, the anti-apoptotic mechanism of HSP70 is still controversial (35Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate which step in the apoptosis pathway is affected by HSP70. We used an in vitroapoptosis system as well as preheated and HSP70-overexpressing cells. The results demonstrate that HSP70 can inhibit apoptosis downstream of cytochrome c release, but upstream of caspase-3 cleavage, and that the carboxyl-terminal region containing the peptide-binding domain is sufficient to inhibit caspase-3 activation. The deoxynucleotide triphosphates' pepstatin A, leupeptin, andN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucina (ALLN) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and bovine heart cytochrome c were obtained from Sigma. The Cpp32/caspase-3 colorimetric protease assay kit was obtained from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co. (Nagoya, Japan). The secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse lgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, were obtained from Pierce. The molecular weight standards for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent for Western blotting detection was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased from the following sources. Anti-cytochrome c (7H8.2C12) and cytochrome oxidase II were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Anti-caspase-3 (CPP32) and anti-PARP were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Anti-HSP70 and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator. Culture plates containing cells were wrapped tightly with parafilm and immersed in a water bath at the desired temperature. Mild heat shock conditions to induce HSP70 synthesis was 42 °C for 30 min, and lethal heat shock conditions were 43 °C for 60 or 80 min. To establish a retrovirus-producing cell line, 10 μg of MFG.HPS70.puro and MFG.puro plasmids (37Kwak H.J. Jun C.D. Pae H.O. Yoo J.C. Park Y.C. Choi B.M. Na Y.G. Park R.K. Chung H.T. Chung H.Y.

Immunol. 1998; 187: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were transfected into the PA317 retrovirus packaging cell line (ATCC; CRL 9078) by thecalcium phosphate precipitation method (38Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were harvested, and the cells were incubated in the selective media containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. The selected cells were maintained as a population and used for retrovirus production. The viral infection was performed as described previously (39Dzierzak E.A. Papayannopoulou T. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1988; 331: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, the viral supernatant was harvested from the overnight culture of 70% confluent producer cell layers and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Corning, Corning, NY). The viral supernatant, supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma), was mixed with target cells in a conical tube and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed two times with PBS. After a 48 h incubation, puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium to select the transfected cells. The selection was continued for 10 days after which the cells were maintained as a population and the selected cells were used for the experiments. For quantitative analysis of cell viability, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and incubated with annexin V-fluorescein/PI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in calcium-containing HEPES buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then analyzed with a FACScan machine (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). Caspase-3 activity was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells (5 × 106) were lysed with 250 μl of chilled cell lysis buffer on ice for 10 min. After microcentrifugation (10,000 ×g, 1 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was used for caspase-3 colorimetric protease assay. 170 μg of protein was diluted to 50 μl of cell lysis buffer and mixed with 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer (containing 10 mm DTT) and 5 μl of 4 mmAsp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (DEVD-pNA) (200 μm final concentration). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, sample were read at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader. The S-100 fraction was prepared essentially as described (40Liu X., C. Kim N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and suspended in 3 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm DTT), supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were disrupted by douncing 15 times in a 2-ml Wheaton Dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co.). The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 105 × gfor 1 h in a table-top Beckman Ultracentrifuge. This resulting supernatant (S-100 fraction) was stored at −70 °C and used forin vitro apoptosis assays. Liver nuclei were prepared according to the method of Liu et al. (40Liu X., C. Kim N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). Livers from four FVB strain male mice were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in buffer B (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.4 msucrose, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm sodium EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.15 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by 10 strokes of a tissue-tearer. The homogenates were centrifuged through 10 ml of buffer B at 25,000 rpm for 1 h in a SW 28 rotor (Backman) at 4 °C. The nuclei pellets were resuspended in buffer C (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium EGTA, 250 mmsucrose, and 1 mm DTT) at 8.5 × 107nuclei/ml and stored at −80 °C in multiple aliquots. The full-length human HSP70 gene was cloned into pET30a (Novagen). Several deletion mutants of HSP70 were created and ligated into pET30a as follows: hsp70ΔB lacking theBglII-BglII fragment, hsp70ΔS lacking theSmaI-SmaI fragment, hsp70ΔN lacking theNcoI-NcoI fragment, and hsp70ΔC deleted nucleotides 1756–1923. All recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6, and proteins were induced at 37 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. His-tagged HSP70 and its deletion mutant proteins were purified through a nickel affinity column by passing the soluble fractions of cell lysates. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer A. To determine the degradation of chromosomal DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments in the in vitro apoptosis system, aliquots of 50 μl of cytosolic faction (S-100) and 2 × 105 nuclei were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of dATP. A 500-μl aliquot of buffer D (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2m NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C overnight. DNA was obtained by ethanol precipitation, separated on a 1.8% agarose gel, and visualized under UV light. DNA fragmentation was quantitated as described previously (41Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, exponentially growing cells (2.5 × 105 cells/ml) were labeled with 10 μCi/2.5 × 106 cells of [methyl-3H]thymidine for 5 h and washed three times with nonradioactive fresh medium. Labeled cells were exposed to lethal heat shock for different times and returned to 37 °C for 12 h. Cells were harvested in a microcentrifuge tube labeled B, and supernatants were stored in a tube labeled S. The cell pellets were suspended with TTE buffer (containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA). After 30 min on ice, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were transferred to a tube labeled T, and the pellets were resuspended in STE buffer (containing 1% SDS, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) and sonicated for 20 s. The radioactivity from each tube was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The percent DNA fragmentation was calculated as follows: % DNA fragmentation = 100 × (S +T)/(S + T + B). After a lethal heat shock treatment, cells were returned to 37 °C, and cytochrome crelease was analyzed at 12 h. Cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended with 5 volumes of buffer A containing 250 mm sucrose. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the cells were homogenized with 8 strokes of a 2-ml Wheaton Dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co.). After the homogenate was centrifuged (750 × g, 10 min at 4 °C) twice, the supernatants were centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were stored at 4 °C as cytosolic fractions. The mitochondrial pellets were washed once with PBS, lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, and after 30 min on ice were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting mitochondrial fractions and the cytosolic fractions were used for Western blot analysis with an anti-cytochrome c antibody. Detection of caspase-3 in the in vitro system was carried out as follows. Cytosolic extracts (250 μg of protein) from preheated or HSP70-overexpressing cells were mixed with 2 × 10 5mouse liver nuclei in the presence of 300 or 500 μm dATP and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, samples were centrifuged, and aliquots of supernatant (50 μg of protein) were mixed with 2× SDS-sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, samples were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (10% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature and then with anti-caspase-3 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% non-fat milk) three times and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G. Antibody detection was performed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To detect PARP cleavages in an intact cell system, whole cell lysate was prepared from cells treated with lethal heat shock, and then immunoblotted with anti-PARP antibody as mentioned above. We first examined the effect of elevated HSP expression on heat resistance in U937 cells. A mild heat shock treatment (42 °C, 30 min) that did not induce apoptosis (data not shown) was used to induce HSP70 synthesis. 12 h after the heat treatment, the level of HSP70 in the preheated cells was substantially elevated relative to that of the control cells (Fig.1 A). When DNA fragmentation was observed in cells exposed to lethal heat shock, the preheated cells, in contrast to the control cells, showed a dramatic level of resistance to DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 B). DNA fragmentation measured in preheated cells was decreased 3.6–4.0-fold when HSP70 was induced by a mild heat treatment. To elucidate which step in the apoptotic pathway is regulated by HSP70, we employed an in vitro apoptosis system based on the ability of exogenously added dATP to induce apoptosis in an S-100 fraction containing cytochrome c (40Liu X., C. Kim N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). Extracts prepared from control and preheated cells were incubated with exogenous liver nuclei and dATP. The extent of apoptosis activation was determined by monitoring the proteolytic processing of pro-caspase-3 and the intranucleosomal fragmentation of the mouse liver DNA. Processing of pro-caspase-3 into the p19 and p17 subunits (the small p12 subunit of caspase-3 was undetectable with the anti-caspase-3 antibody used for this study), which occurred in the extract from control cells, was completely inhibited in the extract from preheated cells (Fig. 1 C). Additionally, intranucleosomal fragmentation of the mouse liver DNA was almost completely blocked in the extract from preheated cells, whereas extensive DNA fragmentation occurred in the extract prepared from control cells (Fig.1 D). Because the exposure of cells to mild heat shock can induce the synthesis of several different heat shock proteins (33Samali A. Cotter T.G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 223: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), we prepared HSP70-overexpressing cells (U937/hsp70) to address the question of whether HSP70 itself inhibits apoptosis in the in vitro system. The level of HSP70 accumulation in U937/hsp70 cells was much higher than in control cells (U937/puro) and was very similar to that of preheated cells (Fig. 1 A). When the percent of DNA fragmentation was observed in U937/hsp70 cells after exposing to lethal heat shock treatments, the U937/hsp70 cells also showed a dramatic level of resistance to DNA fragmentation in contrast to the U937/puro cells (Fig. 2 A). These results are very similar to those obtained with preheated cells. Fig. 2, B and C, shows the results of thein vitro apoptosis assay using extracts from U937/hsp70 cells. In contrast to U937/puro, caspase-3 activation and intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation were also prevented in cytosolic extracts of U937/hsp70 cells as shown in preheated cells. This result suggests that HSP70 per se blocks caspase-3 cleavage in heat shock-induced apoptosis. This antiapoptotic function of HSP70 is a general phenomenon, because we have observed similar results in a different cell line, HL60. When these cells accumulated HSP70 by mild heat shock or byHSP70 transfection, they also showed an inhibition of caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in response to a lethal heat shock compared with control HL60 cells (data not shown); this supports the suggestion that HSP70 is a general inhibitor of apoptosis acting upstream of caspase-3 activation. As a further test of the ability of HSP70 to function as an inhibitor of apoptosis, the effects of recombinant HSP70 on caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation were determined. HSP70 protein was purified using a bacterial expression system. Reaction mixtures containing recombinant HSP70 and cytosolic extracts from control U937 cells were incubatedin vitro and examined for caspase-3 activation. Purified recombinant HSP70 clearly inhibited caspase-3 cleavage in comparison with bovine serum albumin (Fig.3 A). Inhibition of DNA fragmentation was also observed in extracts containing recombinant HSP70 but not in extracts containing added bovine serum albumin (Fig.3 B). These results demonstrate that HSP70 itself prevents the activation of key molecules associated with apoptosis in anin vitro system. Cytochrome c acts as an important molecule at the early stage of apoptosis pathway. Its release from mitochondria leads to the activation of caspase-9, which then converts procaspase-3 into its active form, resulting in apoptosis. To address the question of whether lethal heat shock initiates apoptosis via cytochrome c release, the effect of heat shock on cytochrome c release was determined. After U937 cells were treated with lethal heat shock, cytochrome c release was analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Cytochrome c was increased in cytosol after lethal heat shock (Fig.4 A). Because HL60 cells also showed cytochrome c release by lethal heat shock (data not shown), this indicates that cytochrome c participates in the executioner phase of apoptotic cell death cascade in response to heat shock. Since we found that HSP70 blocks apoptosis at some point upstream of caspase-3 activation, we next examined whether HSP70 affects cytochromec release, which is further upstream step in the apoptosis pathway. To address this question, the presence of cytosolic cytochromec was measured in preheated U937 and U937/hsp70 cells treated with lethal heat shock. As shown in Fig. 4 A, HSP70 had no effect on the release of cytochrome c in lethal heat shocked cells. Because cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein (20Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar), was not detected in the cytosolic extracts, it was determined that there was no contamination of intact mitochondria in the cytosolic fractions. To know exactly the extent of the caspase-3 and PARP cleavages in preheated U937 and U937/hsp70 cells detecting the cytochromec in the cytosol, we observed caspase-3 and PARP cleavages in lethal heat-shocked cells (Fig. 4 A). Despite cytochrome c release by lethal heat shock, the cleavages of procaspase-3 and PARP were protected in both preheated U937 and U937/HSP70 cells in contrast to normal U937 and U937/puro cells, respectively. At the same time, active caspase-3 capable of cleaving DEVD-pNA was analyzed in the same experiment. Caspase-3 activities in both preheated U937 and U937/HSP70 cells upon exposure to lethal heat shock were very low (Fig. 4 B). To clarify whether HSP70 protected the cells from dying when caspase-3 activity was blocked even after cytochrome c release, cell viability was also observed in the same experiment. For measurement of cell viability, annexin V binding and PI uptake were analyzed by flow cytometry in control cells and in preheated U937 cells that were exposed in lethal heat shock (Fig. 4 C). In the case of preheated cells, the percent of early or late apoptotic/necrotic cells (annexin V+/PI− or annexin V+/PI+ cells) was clearly decreased in comparison to the control. The extent of apoptotic cell death in U937/hsp70 cells was also compared with that of U937/puro cells by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 C, U937/hsp70 cells showed substantially less apoptosis than U937/puro cells. All of the parameters in Fig. 4 were measured in a single experiment with preheated U937 or U937/hsp70 cells, respectively. Taken together, regardless of the inability of HSP70"

Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 335-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCs contain 2–11 γ-Glu-Cys repeats, act as high affinity metal chelators, and facilitate the vacuolar sequestration of heavy metals, most notably Cd2+ (2Zenk M.H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). PC-deficient Arabidopsis cad1 mutants are hypersensitive to Cd2+ salts (5Howden R. Goldsbrough P.B. Andersen C.R. Cobbett C.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), Cd·PC complexes localize preferentially to the vacuole of intact plant cells (6Vogeli-Lange R. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and in plant cell lines capable of tolerating high levels of Cd2+ at least 90% of this metal is accumulated as Cd·PC complexes (2Zenk M.H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In the organism for which the molecular basis of PC-dependent metal detoxification is best understood,S. pombe, vacuolar Cd2+ sequestration is mediated by a 90.5-kDa vacuolar ATP-binding cassette transporter, heavy metal tolerance factor 1 (HMT1), that catalyzes the MgATP-energized uptake of Cd·PCs and apoPCs into the vacuoles of wild type but nothmt1 − cells (7Ortiz D.F.

HMT1 homologs have not yet been isolated from plants, but an MgATP-energized transport pathway for PCs and Cd·PCs, analogous to that identified in S. pombe, has been characterized in vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from oat roots (9Salt D.E. Rauser W.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although it is more than a decade since the first report of the partial purification of heavy metal-, primarily Cd2+-, activated enzymes (PC synthases; γ-glutamylcysteine dipeptidyltranspeptidases, EC 2.3.2.15) competent in the synthesis of PCs from GSH and related thiol tripeptides, by the net transfer of a γ-Glu-Cys unit from one thiol peptide to another or to a previously synthesized PC molecule (10Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 6838-6842Crossref Google Scholar), it is only in the last year that three groups have simultaneously and independently cloned and characterized genes encoding this enzyme. Isolated from Arabidopsis,S. pombe, and wheat, these genes, designatedAtPCS1, SpPCS, and TaPCS1, respectively, encode 40–50% sequence-similar 50–55-kDa polypeptides active in the synthesis of PCs from GSH (11Clemens S.

Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), and heterologous expression ofAtPCS1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism that lacks PCS homologs and does not otherwise synthesize appreciable amounts of PCs, confers increased heavy metal tolerance and elicits Cd2+-dependent intracellular PC accumulation (13Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). As established by the capacity of cell-free extracts from AtPCS1- or SpPCS-transformed cells ofEscherichia coli (12Ha S.-B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and of purified FLAG epitope-tagged AtPCS1 (AtPCS1-FLAG) for the Cd2+-activated synthesis of short chain PCs from GSH in vitro (13Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), each of these gene products is not only necessary but also sufficient for the elaboration of PCs. A physiologically crucial and biochemically intriguing property of PC synthase is its susceptibility to activation by heavy metals. It is by virtue of the activation of PC synthase-catalyzed PC biosynthesis by agents, heavy metal ions, that poison most enzymes that plants and fungi are able to mount a PC-based response to heavy metals. Few investigators have considered explicitly how heavy metals activate PC synthase but those that have considered it have assumed that activation is consequent on the direct binding of metal ions to the enzyme (2Zenk M.H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 4Cobbett C.S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 335-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed in the most recent model for PC synthase action, it has been proposed that the strongly conserved N-terminal half of the enzyme is responsible for catalysis and that activation arises from the binding of metal ions to residues, possibly cysteine residues, within this domain (4Cobbett C.S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 335-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of five conserved cysteine residues, two of which are vicinal, in the N-terminal halves of AtPCS1, SpPCS, and TaPCS1 is at least consistent with this notion, as is the observation that the three most extreme Arabidopsis cad1alleles have amino acid substitutions in this region (12Ha S.-B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). An extension of this model, proposed to ascribe a role to the more sequence-divergent C-terminal half of the molecule and to account for the properties of the least extreme cad1 allele,cad1–5, a nonsense mutation causing premature termination and deletion of the C-terminal segment, is the concept of a C-terminal “metal-sensing domain” whose multiple cysteine residues bind heavy metals and bring them into contact with the putative “activation” site within the N-terminal, catalytic half of the molecule. In the experiments described here we exploit the ease with which AtPCS1-FLAG can be purified to near homogeneity fromAtPCS1 ::FLAG-transformed S. cerevisiaeto yield high activity PC synthase preparations (13Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) to examine the mechanism by which this class of transpeptidase is activated by heavy metals. In so doing, we establish that although AtPCS1-FLAG confers tolerance to and is subject to posttranslational activation by a broad range of heavy metals, direct interaction of the enzyme with free metal ions is not the primary mode of activation. Instead, heavy metal ions are required for the formation of heavy metal peptide, GSH or PC, thiolates that serve as cosubstrates for catalysis via a substituted enzyme mechanism. On the basis of these findings and the efficacy ofS-alkylglutathiones as substrates for the synthesis ofS-alkyl-PCs in the complete absence of metal ions, it is inferred that AtPCS1 catalyzes the polymerization of GSH-derived thiol peptides containing blocked thiol groups, regardless of whether the substrate-active species is a heavy metal thiolate or thioether. If heavy metals do directly bind AtPCS1 in vivo it is to a limited extent and associated with only minor augmentation of synthetic activity. The ycf1Δmutant S. cerevisiae strain DTY167 (MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,-112 his-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9 ycf1::hisG), deficient in vacuolar Cd2+sequestration (14Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), was employed for the studies of heterologously expressed AtPCS1-FLAG. Arabdopsis thaliana cv Columbia was the source of the RNA used for the Northern analyses. For constitutive expression of immunoreactive protein in S. cerevisiae strain DTY167, yeast-E. coli shuttle vector pYES3 (15Lu Y.-P. Li Z.-S. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8243-8247Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), containing AtPCS1 cDNA insert engineered to encode an AtPCS1 C-terminal FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope tag fusion (pYES3-AtPCS1::FLAG), was used as described (13Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The soluble fraction from pYES3-AtPCS1::FLAG-transformed DTY167 (DTY167/pYES3-AtPCS1 ::FLAG) cells was prepared by the disruption of spheroplasts as described (13Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and AtPCS1-FLAG was purified on an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel column (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, except that the wash and elution buffers contained 10% (v/v) glycerol in addition to TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 0.1m glycine-HCl (pH 3.5), respectively (13Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). For the experiments directed at determining if tightly bound metal ions retained during its extraction and purification might influence the activity or response of the enzyme to metal ions added to the reaction media, aliquots of purified AtPCS1-FLAG (30 μg) were pretreated with 1 mm Tris-EGTA in Tris-buffered elution buffer (pH 8.0) on ice for 1 h before removal of the chelator by dialysis of the samples against 120 volumes of 10% (w/v) deionized glycerol in 50 mm HEPES-BTP buffer (pH 8.0) for 12 h at 4 °C in Slide-A-Lyzer mini dialysis tubes (molecular weight cutoff of 10,000, Pierce). Control samples were manipulated in an identical manner except that EGTA was omitted from the pretreatment medium. PC synthase activity was assayed in reaction media (200 mm HEPES-BTP buffer, pH 8.0) containing purified AtPCS1-FLAG (0.5 μg) or no protein, the indicated concentrations of GSH or its S-alkyl derivatives, and/or heavy metal salt. For RP-HPLC, 500–1000 μl volumes of the extracts were made 5% (w/v) with 5-sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged before aliquots (50–100 μl) of the supernatant were loaded onto an Econosphere C18, 150 × 4.6-mm reverse-phase column (Alltech). The column was developed with a linear gradient of water, 0.05% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 17% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.05% (v/v) phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the quantitation of PCs, thiols were estimated spectrophotometrically at 412 nm by reacting aliquots (500 μl) of the column fractions with 0.8 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (500 μl) dissolved in 250 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6 (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21368) Google Scholar). Calibration was with GSH. For the quantitation ofS-alkyl-PCs, free amino groups were estimated fluorimetrically by reacting aliquots (500 μl) of the column fractions with 0.4 m sodium borate (pH 9.7) (200 μl) and fluorescamine (20 μl of a 3 mg/ml solution dissolved in acetone) (17Udenfriend S. Stein S. Böhler P. Dairman W. Leingruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 475 nm, respectively, after quenching unreacted fluorescamine by the addition of water (to a final volume of 1 ml). Calibration was with S-methylglutathione. Where indicated, thiol peptides were exhaustively reduced before RP-HPLC by incubating aliquots (500 μl) of the reaction media with 0.4 m sodium borohydride at 37 °C for 20 min before deproteinization and RP-HPLC. The kinetics of AtPCS1-FLAG-catalyzed incorporation of GSH orS-methylglutathione into PCs or S-methyl-PCs were determined by limiting the incubation times to 180 s and 90 s, respectively, to minimize substrate depletion, end product accumulation, and the formation of PCs or S-methyl-PCs containing more than two γ-Glu-Cys or γ-Glu-(methyl-Cys) repeats. Binding of Cd2+ was determined by equilibrium dialysis of 400–800 μl (160 μg) samples of purified AtPCS1-FLAG against 80-ml volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.05–20 μm109CdCl2 (specific activity 22 Ci/mol) for 12 h at 4 °C in 2-ml mini-collodion membrane tubes (molecular weight cutoff of 25,000, Schleicher & Schuell). Protein-bound 109Cd was estimated by measuring the radioactivity of the bulk medium outside the dialysis tube and that of the solution within the dialysis tube and determining the increase in109Cd radioactivity consequent on AtPCS1-FLAG. Binding of Cu2+ and Zn2+ to AtPCS1-FLAG was estimated by measuring the decrease in equilibrium binding of a half-saturating (K L) concentration of109Cd2+ as the result of inclusion of a range of concentrations of Cu2+ or Zn2+ in the equilibrium dialysis buffer. To assess the effects of treatment with heavy metal salts on the steady state levels of AtPCS1transcripts, 21-day-old seedlings grown in Gamborg's B-5 medium were transferred into fresh medium containing 25 or 100 μmCdSO4, CuSO4, or ZnSO4 and incubated with shaking at 22 °C for an additional 6 or 24 h before RNA extraction. Control seedlings were treated in an identical manner except that CdCl2, CuSO4, and ZnSO4 were not added to the culture media. Total RNA was extracted from roots and shoots in TriZOL R Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), resolved on formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized with 32P-labeled, random-primed 1.5-kbNotI/SmaI restriction fragment corresponding to the coding sequence of AtPCS1 as described (13Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (5 min at room temperature), twice in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (15 min at 42 °C), and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (15 min at 65 °C).32P-Labeled bands were visualized and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The chain lengths of the PCs andS-alkyl-PCs synthesized from GSH orS-alkylglutathiones, respectively, were determined by estimating their Glu/Gly or Glu/S-alkyl-Cys/Gly ratios (ratio = n = number of Glu-Cys or Glu-(alkyl-Cys) repeats per Gly) after acid hydrolysis of the appropriate HPLC fractions. Aliquots of the fractions were taken to dryness in pyrolyzed glass tubes, hydrolyzed in gas-phase 6 n HCl for 20 h at 110 °C before ion-exchange chromatography, postcolumn derivatization with O-phthaldehyde, and fluorescence detection (17Udenfriend S. Stein S. Böhler P. Dairman W. Leingruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). The concentrations of free heavy metal ions and their complexes with GSH and other ligands in the reaction media were calculated from their stability constants using the computer program SOLCON (from Dr. Y. E. Goldman, Dept. of Physiology, University of Pennsylvania). The stability constants used, which were obtained from Martell and Smith (18Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar) and Smith and Martell (19Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Critical Stability Constants. 4. Plenum Press, New York1976Google Scholar), were as follows: [H·GS]/[H+][GS] = 1.95 × 109m−1; [H2·GS]/[H+]2[GS] = 5.75 × 1017m−2; [H3·GS]/[H+]3[GS] = 1.35 × 1021m−3; [H4·GS]/[H+]4[GS] = 1.41 × 1023m−4; [Cd·GS]/[Cd2+][GS] = 5.13 × 109m−1; [Cd·GS2]/[Cd2+][GS]2 = 2.24 × 1015m−2; [Cd·H·GS]/[Cd2+][H+][GS] = 2.75 × 1016m−2; [Cd·H·GS2]/[Cd2+][H+][GS]2= 5.50 × 1024m−3; [Cd·H2·GS2]/[Cd2+][H+]2[GS]2= 2.51 × 1032m−4; [Zn·GS]/[Zn2+][GS] = 3.24 × 107m−1; [Zn·GS2]/[Zn2+][GS]2 = 3.16 × 1012m−2; [Zn·H·GS]/[Zn2+][H+][GS] = 3.16 × 1013m−2; [Zn·H·GS2]/[Zn2+][H+][GS]2= 1.02 × 1021m−1; [Zn·H2·GS2]/[Zn2+][H+]2[GS]2= 1.20 × 1028m−4. Kinetic parameters, AtPCS1-FLAG heavy metal-binding constants, and stoichiometries of binding were estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis (20Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) using the Ultrafit nonlinear curve-fitting package from BioSoft (Ferguson, MO). Protein was estimated by the dye-binding method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). S-Methylglutathione,S-ethylglutathione, S-propylglutathione,S-butylglutathione, and S-hexylglutathione were purchased from Sigma. 109CdSO4 (78.4 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All of the other, general, reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Research Organics Inc., or Sigma. High stringency Northern analyses revealed a single 1.7-kb band of similar intensity after hybridization of random-primed32P-labeled AtPCS1 cDNA with total RNA extracted from roots and shoots of 21-day-old Arabidopsisseedlings, regardless of whether the seedlings had been exposed to 25 or 100 μm Cd2+ (CdSO4), the most potent activator of AtPCS1-catalyzed PC synthesis (below), Cu2+ (CuSO4), an activator of intermediate potency, or Zn2+ (ZnSO4), an activator of weak to moderate potency, for 6 h (data not shown) or for 24 h before RNA extraction (Fig. 1). From these results and those from earlier biochemical investigations, demonstrating that extractable PC synthase activity is not enhanced by the pretreatment of plant tissues or cell suspension cultures with heavy metal salts (2Zenk M.H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), modulation of AtPCS1 by heavy metals was inferred to be exerted at the enzyme level. All subsequent experiments were therefore directed at determining how metal ions interact with the enzyme to elicit PC synthetic activity and were performed on recombinant AtPCS1 (AtPCS1-FLAG). For this purpose, heterologously expressed AtPCS1-FLAG was 30- to 50-fold immunopurified from the soluble fraction of pYES3-AtPCS1::FLAG-transformed S. cerevisiae strain DTY167 to yield a single anti-FLAG antibody-reactive, M r = 58,000 polypeptide species (13Vatamaniuk O.K.

It was subject to activation by a broad range of heavy metal cations and oxyanions and was competent in the synthesis of both short chain and long chain PCs. AtPCS1-FLAG-catalyzed PC synthesis from GSH was obligatorily dependent on the provision of heavy metals. No activity was detectable when metals were omitted from the reaction medium, but the addition of Cd2+, Hg2+, As3+, AsO2−, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb+, AsO43−, Mg2+, and Ni2+ at total concentrations of 50 μmincreased the capacity of AtPCS1-FLAG for PC synthesis from GSH by 47.7, 40.3, 27.7, 27.2, 10.6, 8.3, 4.8, 3.9, and 3.6-fold, respectively, versus Co2+, the least stimulatory metal ion examined (Fig. 2). Because in no case, with the exception of Cu2+, did pretreatment of the terminated reaction media with sodium borohydride before RP-HPLC markedly change the estimated reduced thiol contents of the PCs synthesized or the apparent rank order with which the metal cations or oxyanions promoted PC synthesis (Fig. 2), it was concluded that the effects of most of the metal cations and oxyanions examined were exerted at the enzyme level, not at the level of the oxidation state and amenability of the thiol peptide reaction products to detection with DTNB. Cu2+ was an exception in that prior reduction of the reaction products with sodium borohydride doubled DTNB reactivity (Fig. 2), suggesting an approximately 1:1 ratio of oxidized:reduced thiols in the PCs synthesized in media containing this metal ion. As exemplified by the results obtained with standard reaction medium containing Cd2+, AtPCS1-FLAG was competent in the sequential synthesis of PC2–6 from GSH (Fig.3). For shorter term (0–60 min) incubations, net synthesis of PC2–4 was evident within 2, 5, and 20 min, respectively, of the addition of enzyme (Fig. 3,inset), indicating that whereas GSH, alone, was sufficient for the synthesis of PC2, the net synthesis of PC3 and PC4 required not only GSH but also PC2 and PC3, respectively. For longer term incubations, the net synthesis of not only PC2, PC3, and PC4 but also PC5 and PC6 was evident (Fig. 3). Qualitatively similar time dependences and ranges of chain length were observed when PC synthase activity was activated by Cu2+ or Zn2+ instead of Cd2+ (data not shown). As would be predicted when GSH is the prevalent thiol peptide in the reaction medium and PCn+1 is derived from PCn + GSH, the final amounts of thiol equivalents (= γ-Glu-Cys units) incorporated into PC2–6 decreased exponentially with increase in chain length (Fig. 3). All of the metals employed for the experiments summarized in Figs. 2 and 3 elicited net PC synthesis despite the presence of a 66- to 132-fold molar excess of GSH- and/or PC-associated thiols in the reaction media. Given that the complexes formed between heavy metals and thiol compounds are among the most stable known, it was decided to determine the likely concentrations of free metal ions and their complexes under conditions in which AtPCS1-FLAG-catalyzed PC synthesis was sustained. The concentrations of free metal ions and their complexes were estimated by substitution of the stability constants of the complexes formed between the metal ions concerned and GSH into the SOLCON computer program. In the first instance, Cd2+ and Zn2+ were chosen as model metal ions, because of the ready availability of comprehensive compilations of the appropriate stability constants for these and their ligands, and the calculations were based on the composition of the standard reaction medium containing 25 μm metal chloride, 3.3 mm GSH, and 200 mm HEPES-BTP buffer (pH 8.0). Two crucial insights were gained from these analyses. The first was that under the conditions in which AtPCS1-FLAG catalyzed high rates of PC synthesis from GSH, the concentrations of free Cd2+ and free Zn2+ ([Cd2+]free and [Zn2+]free) were only of the order of 10−13 and 10−9m, respectively (Table I). The second was that more than 98% of the total Cd2+ and more than 80% of the total Zn2+ added to the reaction medium were associated with GSH as their corresponding bidentate thiolates, bis(glutathionato)cadmium (Cd·GS2) and bis(glutathionato)zinc (Zn·GS2) (Table I).Table IConcentrations of heavy metal ions and their complexes with GSH in standard AtPCS1-FLAG reaction mediumCd2+Zn2+SpeciesConcentrationSpeciesConcentrationmmmmCdfree2+6.638 × 10−10Znfree2+4.585 × 10−6GSHfree3.2399GSHfree3.2444Cd · GS10−4Zn · GS0.0045Cd · GS20.0249Zn · GS20.0205Shown are estimates of the concentrations of free Cd2+ and Zn2+ (Cdfree2+ and Znfree2+) and their complexes with GSH obtained by substitution of the stability constants listed under “Experimental Procedures” into the SOLCON computer program.

We have examined the role of cross talk between the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in mediating responses to IGF-1. In COS-7 cells, IGF-1 stimulation causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R β subunit, the EGFR, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and the Shc adapter protein. Shc immunoprecipitates performed after IGF-1 stimulation contain coprecipitated EGFR, suggesting that IGF-1R activation induces the assembly of EGFR·Shc complexes. Tyrphostin AG1478, an inhibitor of the EGFR kinase, markedly attenuates IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR, Shc, and ERK1/2 but has no effect on phosphorylation of IGF-1R, IRS-1, and protein kinase B (Akt). Cross talk between IGF-1 and EGF receptors is mediated through an autocrine mechanism involving matrix metalloprotease-dependent release of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), because IGF-1-mediated ERK activation is inhibited both by [Glu<sup>52</sup>]<i>Diphtheria</i> toxin, a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, and the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. These data demonstrate that IGF-1 stimulation of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway and the EGFR/Shc/ERK1/2 pathway occurs by distinct mechanisms and suggest that IGF-1-mediated ""transactivation"" of EGFR accounts for the majority of IGF-1-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the ERK cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2023273217,"Protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase II) is a serine/threonine kinase overexpressed in many human tumors, transformed cell lines, and rapidly proliferating tissues. Recent data have shown that many cancers involve inappropriate reactivation of Wnt signaling through ectopic expression of Wnts themselves, as has been seen in a number of human breast cancers, or through mutation of intermediates in the Wnt pathway, such as adenomatous polyposis coli or β-catenin, as described in colon and other cancers. Wnts are secreted factors that are important in embryonic development, but overexpression of certain Wnts, such as Wnt-1, leads to proliferation and transformation of cells. We report that upon stable transfection of <i>Wnt-1</i> into the mouse mammary epithelial cell line C57MG, morphological changes and increased proliferation are accompanied by increased levels of CK2, as well as of β-catenin. CK2 and β-catenin co-precipitate with the Dvl proteins, which are Wnt signaling intermediates. A major phosphoprotein of the size of β-catenin appears in <i>in vitro</i> kinase reactions performed on the Dvl immunoprecipitates. <i>In vitro</i> translated β-catenin, Dvl-2, and Dvl-3 are phosphorylated by CK2. The selective CK2 inhibitor apigenin blocks proliferation of <i>Wnt-1</i>-transfected cells, abrogates phosphorylation of β-catenin, and reduces β-catenin and Dvl protein levels. These results demonstrate that endogenous CK2 is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling and growth of mammary epithelial cells."

LMP1 is considered a viral oncogene because of its ability to transform rodent fibroblasts in situ and to render them tumorigenic in nude mice. In addition, it is the only EBV gene that has a transforming effect in nonlymphoid cells (9Baichwal V.R. Sugden B. Oncogene. 1988; 4: 67-74Google Scholar, 10Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E.

LMP1 is an integral membrane protein encoded by the BNLF1 gene of EBV. It consists of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, six hydrophobic transmembrane domains, and a long, 200-amino acid C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (16Hennessy K. Fennewald S. Hummel M. Cole T. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7207-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). LMP1 is a short-lived protein with a reported half-life ranging from 1.5 to 7 h depending on the cell type used (17Baichwal V.R. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 866-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mann K.P. Thorley-Lawson D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2100-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Martin J. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3246-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is some indication that the rapid turnover of the protein has a role in its activity, based on the inability of long-lived deletion mutants to effect the phenotypic changes observed for WT LMP1 (19Martin J. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3246-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the stabilizing mutations involve deletions in the N-terminal domain (Ref. 19Martin J. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3246-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also under “Discussion”). The proteolytic machinery that is responsible for LMP1 degradation has not been identified yet. Many studies implicate the ubiquitin pathway in the degradation of various short-lived regulatory proteins. It is involved in processing and proteolysis of many cellular proteins including, for example, cell cycle regulators, oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, transcriptional activators, endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins and cell surface receptors (20Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 21Hicke L. Trends. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Formation of ubiquitin conjugates of a specific protein requires the sequential action of three enzymes: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), one of several ubiquitin-carrier proteins or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family (E3). E3 catalyzes the last step in the conjugation process, covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate, and therefore plays an essential role in specific substrate recognition. Following transfer of the first ubiquitin moiety to the target protein, a polyubiquitin chain is synthesized by repetitive transfer of additional activated ubiquitin residues. The multi-ubiquitin chain is typically anchored to an ε-NH2group of one or more internal lysine residues (20Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). There is no consensus as to the specificity of the internal Lys residues that are targeted by ubiquitin. In some cases, distinct lysines are required, whereas in others there is little or no specificity. Signal-induced degradation of IκBα involves two particular Lys residues, 21 and 22 (22Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and in Gcn4, lysine residues in the vicinity of a specific PEST degradation signal serve as ubiquitin attachment sites (23Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In a different case, that of the ξ chain of the T cell receptor, degradation of the protein is independent of any particular Lys residue and proceeds as long as one residue is present in the cytosolic tail of the molecule (24Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, ubiquitination of the transcription factor MyoD does not require any Lys residue. The protein is targeted to the proteasome following initial fusion of a ubiquitin moiety to the N-terminal α-NH2 group succeeded by synthesis of a poly-ubiquitin chain attached to this moiety (25Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutant lysine-less T cell receptor α chain is also degraded by the proteasome, a process that depends on an intact ubiquitin system. However, a role for direct ubiquitination of the substrate, as well as identification of potential ubiquitination site(s), has not been discerned (26Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly, ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and degradation of the growth hormone receptor also proceeds in the absence of any Lys residue (27Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The inability to identify ubiquitin adducts of the two receptors lead to the hypothesis that ubiquitination of another, yet to be identified, factor plays a role in the endocytic process. In most cases, ubiquitination serves as a signal, targeting the substrate protein for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (20Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It has been shown for several membrane proteins, including the yeast Ste2p (28Kölling R. Hollenberg C.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and α factor receptor (29Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), that ubiquitination leads to degradation in the vacuole/lysosome. Although most known plasma membrane substrates of the ubiquitin system are degraded in the lysosome/vacuole, a few exceptions have been reported, in which proteasome inhibitors had a significant effect on degradation. One such example is the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (30Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), another is the Met tyrosine kinase receptor (31Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Here we report that LMP1 is a substrate of the ubiquitin pathway that is targeted, following ubiquitination, to degradation by the proteasome. Attachment of the first ubiquitin moiety is not dependent on the single lysine residue at position 330 and appears to involve the α-amino group at the N-terminal residue. Materials for SDS-PAGE and Bradford reagent were from Bio-Rad. Redivue PRO-MIX (containing l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine) for metabolic labeling, as well as prestained molecular weight markers and immobilized protein A, were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Tissue culture sera and media were purchased from Biological Industries (Kibbutz Bet Hae′emek, Israel) or from Sigma. S12 monoclonal antibody against LMP1 was as described (32Mann K.P. Staunton D. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 710-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ascites fluid was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (45%) and purified over immobilized protein A. A polyclonal antibody to ubiquitin was as described (25Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin, dithiothreitol, ATP, phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase, ATPγS, 2-deoxyglucose, antimycin A, and Tris buffer were purchased from Sigma. Hexokinase and FugeneTM 6 transfection reagent were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HEPES, Carbobenzoxy-l-Leu-l-Leu-l-Leucinal (MG132), lactacystin, and protease inhibitors mixture were obtained from Calbiochem. Restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence were from Pierce. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Biotechnology General (Rehovot, Israel). All other reagents used were of high analytical grade. For expression in mammalian cells, WT LMP1 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pCI-neo vector (Promega). For expression of Myc-tagged LMP1, the cDNA was lifted using polymerase chain reaction with anEcoRI-N terminus primer on the 5′ end, and T3 commercial primer (NEB) on the 3′ end. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and ligated in frame into pCS2MT. Point mutations in LMP1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene). Deletion of the first 12 (ΔN12) or 24 (ΔN24) N-terminal amino acid residues of LMP1 was carried out using polymerase chain reaction and specific primers. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with EcoRI and ligated into pCI-neo vector. Sequences of all constructs were confirmed using either a manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or automatic (ABI 310) sequencing systems. The EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line EA-B1 stably expressing LMP1 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS 7/5 cells grown under the same conditions were transiently transfected with WT and mutant LMP1 constructs using either the DEAE-dextran method (33Guan J.L. Rose J.K. Cell. 1984; 37: 779-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or the FugeneTM 6 transfection kit and were analyzed after 40–48 h. NS0 cells were stably transfected with the WT LMP1 mutant using electroporation with Bio-Rad genepulsar. CHO-E36 and ts20 E1 mutant cells were grown at 32 °C in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described (34Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with LMP1 using the FugeneTM 6 kit. Cells were incubated in the presence of Met/Cys-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h, and 35S-labeled Met/Cys mixture (∼200 μCi/ml) was added for an additional 1 h. Proteasome and lysosome inhibitors were added during the labeling period (“pulse”; 20 μm MG132 or 10 μmlactacystin; 20 mm NH4Cl or 0.2 mmchloroquine) and were present throughout the experiment. Following incubation, the labeling amino acid was removed, and cells were further incubated for the indicated time periods in a complete medium (“chase”). Cells were harvested and lysed on ice, and the labeled protein was immunoprecipitated with S12 anti-LMP1 antibody followed by immobilization of the immune complex by protein A-Sepharose. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%), and proteins were visualized by PhosphorImager (Fuji, Japan). COS 7/5 cells were transiently transfected with either WT or K330R LMP1 and incubated with or without MG132 for 2 h. Cells were lysed under special conditions to prevent deubiquitination (35Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein, as determined by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), were immunoprecipitated using anti-LMP1 monoclonal antibody, and the samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with a rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum (Sigma). SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used to visualize proteins. When indicated, membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-LMP1. EA-B1 cells or COS7/5 cells expressing LMP1 were collected and incubated at 0 °C for 10 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and disrupted using a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were pelleted at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was layered over a 0.9 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA and used immediately for in vitroubiquitination assays. When indicated, cell were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys mixture prior to disruption. HeLa cells were lysed, and high speed supernatant was prepared as described (37Orian A. Whiteside S. Israël A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21707-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The lysate was fractionated over DEAE-cellulose to unadsorbed material (Fraction I) and high salt eluate (Fraction II), as described before (38Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugation and degradation assays in cell-free systems were performed as described elsewhere (25Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 37Orian A. Whiteside S. Israël A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21707-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures contained in a final volume of 25 μl: 150 μg of whole cell lysate protein or 50 μg of fraction II protein, 5 μg of ubiquitin, and crude membrane fraction (20 μg of protein for degradation and 60 μg of protein for conjugation assays) from LMP1 transfected cells. Reaction was carried out in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm phosphocreatine and 5 μg of phosphocreatine kinase) or ATPγS (5 mm) as indicated. For depletion of ATP, 0.5 μg of hexokinase and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose were added. Conjugation assays contained in addition 0.5 μg of the isopeptidase inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde (39Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of okadaic acid. Degradation reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h, whereas conjugation assays were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 8 μl of 4-fold sample buffer and were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%). LMP1 was detected by phosphorimaging or Western blot analysis. Cells were plated on chamber slides coated with fibronectin and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Fixation was stopped with three washes of 50 mmNH4Cl, and the cells were either permeabilized for 10 min in 0.05% Nonidet P-40 or incubated for the same amount of time in PBS. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody S12 for 1 h, washed excessively either in PBS/0.01% saponin/0.25% gelatin (permeabilized cells) or in PBS (nonpermeabilized cells), incubated with Rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratory), and washed in the same manner. Fluorescence was detected using a fluorescent microscope (Axioscope 2; Carl Zeiss). The half-life of LMP1 ranges between 1.5–7 h (17Baichwal V.R. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 866-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mann K.P. Thorley-Lawson D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2100-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Martin J. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3246-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the stability of the protein in our system, we performed a time course study in EA-B1 and COS cells. In addition, because the ubiquitin pathway is ATP-dependent, we tested the effect of ATP depletion on LMP1 degradation in cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the half-life of the protein in EA-B1 B cells is ∼120 min. A similar result was obtained in COS7/5 cells (data not shown). When Antimycin A was added to deplete ATP, degradation of LMP1 was severely impaired, and the half-life time increased to approximately 5 h, demonstrating clearly the need for ATP in the proteolytic process. Because LMP1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded in an ATP-dependent manner, we wanted to test whether, like many other short-lived proteins, it is subject to proteasomal degradation. To identify the system involved in degradation of LMP1, we monitored the effect of either the proteasomal inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin or the lysosomal inhibitors NH4Cl and chloroquine on the degradation of LMP1. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, MG132 completely blocked degradation of LMP1. A similar result was obtained with lactacystin (Fig. 2 B). In striking contrast, NH4Cl and chloroquine had a small effect on the degradation of LMP1 (Fig.2 C). We concluded that LMP1 was degraded mostly by the proteasome. All known proteasome substrates, except for one established case, that of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (see “Discussion”), must be first tagged by a polyubiquitin chain, marking them for degradation. A direct proof that LMP1 is processed via the ubiquitin pathway came from an in vivo conjugation experiment. LMP1 isolated from cells is clearly ubiquitinated, and the abundance of the conjugated species is greatly enhanced when proteasomal degradation was blocked by MG132 further corroborating the notion that the protein is targeted by the proteosome (Fig.3 A). Further evidence that an intact ubiquitination machinery is essential for degradation of LMP1 came from experiments in ts20 cells harboring a mutant temperature-sensitive E1. As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, in the parent E36 cell, LMP1 was degraded efficiently at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. In contrast, in ts20 cells, degradation proceeded at a normal rate at the permissive temperature but was essentially arrested at the nonpermissive temperature, thus demonstrating that a functional E1 is essential for degradation of LMP1. Previous reports showed that LMP1 is localized in patches on the plasma membrane of EBV immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (40Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kieff E.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4369-4376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because most known membrane proteins that are ubiquitinated are targeted to the lysosome/vacuole, the finding that LMP1 is degraded by the proteasome was unexpected. Therefore, it was important to verify the localization of LMP1 in our cells at steady state. Toward that end, we examined the localization of LMP1 in nonpermeabilized and permeabilized EA-B1 and COS7/5 cells. In nonpermeabilized cells (Fig.4 A), LMP1 can be clearly seen on the cell surface in clusters. In permeabilized cells (Fig.4 B), as expected, some of the protein is intracellular, and the staining pattern suggests endoplasmic reticulum localization. Still, it is clear that a large proportion of the protein is localized on the cell surface. To study in more detail the mechanisms involved in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of LMP1, we established a reconstituted cell-free proteolytic system. To use as native-like a protein as possible, we used as a substrate a crude-membrane fraction from LMP1-transfected COS7/5 cells. This ensured a substrate that is correctly folded and appropriately inserted into the cell membrane. As shown in Fig.5 A, when LMP1 was incubated in the presence of crude HeLa cell extract (as a source for ubiquitin system enzymes) and ATP, high molecular weight conjugates were generated. These high molecular weight species were identified as ubiquitinated forms of LMP1 by subjecting the LMP1-specific immunoprecipitates to Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin serum. To directly demonstrate ubiquitin-dependent degradation of LMP1, we incubated the substrate-containing crude membrane fraction from cells in the presence of ubiquitin-depleted HeLa cell Fraction II. Addition of ubiquitin and ATP was essential to reconstitute degradation (Fig. 5 B). In conjugation assays, ATPγS is commonly used as an energy source for the conjugation process because it can support E1-mediated ubiquitin activation but not proteasomal degradation (41Johnston N.L. Cohen R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7514-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP cannot support conjugation of substrates that must undergo phosphorylation to be recognized by the conjugation machinery. As can be clearly seen in Fig.6 A, ATPγS could not promote conjugation of LMP1, and ATP was absolutely required. Furthermore, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid was required for efficient degradation of LMP1 (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these two independent observations suggested that, as is the case for several other substrates of the ubiquitin system, phosphorylation is required for conjugation of LMP1. Replacement of Ser-313 and Thr-324, two reported C-terminal phosphorylation sites (42Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not have an effect on the stability of the protein in vivo (data not shown), suggesting that other sites may be involved in signaling the protein for degradation (see “Discussion”).Figure 6Conjugation and degradation of LMP1 in vitro probably requires phosphorylation. A, ATP but not ATPγS promotes conjugation of LMP1 in vitro. COS7/5 cells expressing LMP1 were labeled for 2 h with [35S]Met/Cys. A crude membrane fraction was prepared, and an in vitro conjugation (Conj.) assay was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” LMP1 was immunoprecipitated and visualized by phosphorimaging following SDS-PAGE. Lane 1, reaction mixture was incubated on ice.Lanes 2–4, reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C.B, efficient degradation of LMP1 in vitrorequires okadaic acid. LMP1-containing membranes were incubated with HeLa cell extract in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of ATP, and in the presence (lanes 1–3) or absence (lane 4) of okadaic acid (OKA). LMP1 was identified using Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Typically, the polyubiquitin chain is anchored to an ε-NH2 group of one or more internal lysine residues. LMP1 has a single lysine residue at position 330, and testing its role in targeting the protein for degradation was the obvious next step. We replaced this lysine residue with arginine. To our surprise, K330R-LMP1 was degraded quite efficiently, albeit at a somewhat slower rate compared with the WT protein (Fig.7 A). To study the potential role of the ubiquitin system in the degradation of K330R-LMP1, we demonstrated that it is ubiquitinated in vivo. Furthermore, conjugation was enhanced in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 7 B). When we subjected crude membranes from K330R-LMP1-expressing cells to an in vitro degradation assay, the mutant protein was efficiently degraded, and degradation was sensitive to inhibition by lactacystin (Fig. 7 C). Lastly, we tested the requirement for a functional E1 in K330R-LMP1 degradation. Similar to WT LMP1 (Fig. 3 B), K330R-LMP1 was rapidly degraded in ts20 cells at the permissive temperature. In contrast, this degradation was severely inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 7 D), demonstrating the need for an intact E1 for the proteolytic process. Taken together, these three independent observations demonstrate that, similar to the WT protein, K330R-LMP1, is degraded in a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent manner. If conjugation of K330R-LMP1 does not occur on an internal lysine, what then is the mechanism for ubiquitination of the mutant protein?"

The transmembrane domains (TMDs) of hepatitis C virus envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 have been shown to play multiple functions during the biogenesis of E1E2 heterodimer. This makes them very unique among known transmembrane sequences. In this report, we used alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis in the TMDs of E1 and E2 to examine their role in the assembly of E1E2 heterodimer. Alanine insertion within the center of the TMDs of E1 or E2 or in the N-terminal part of the TMD of E1 dramatically reduced heterodimerization, demonstrating the essential role played by these domains in the assembly of hepatitis C virus envelope glycoproteins. To better understand the alanine scanning data obtained for the TMD of E1 which contains GXXXG motifs, we analyzed by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance the three-dimensional structure of the E1-(350–370) peptide encompassing the N-terminal sequence of the TMD of E1 involved in heterodimerization.

To ensure specific assembly, these proteins must present complementary recognition regions to each other. These interacting regions may be located on the ectodomains and/or the transmembrane sequences. The importance of noncovalent interactions between transmembrane α-helices in oligomerization of membrane proteins is becoming increasingly apparent (1Cosson P. Bonifacino J. Science. 1992; 258: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 2Lemmon M.A. MacKenzie K.R. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. Springer, Heidelberg1997: 3-23Google Scholar). However, interactions of transmembrane α-helices have only been well characterized for a restricted number of proteins and mainly in the context of homo-oligomerization. Recently, we have shown that the transmembrane domains (TMDs)1 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins are required in heterodimerization (3Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Minner F. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3623-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, these proteins constitute an attractive model to study hetero-oligomerization of transmembrane domains. In addition, like other viral envelope proteins, HCV glycoproteins are supposed to play a crucial role in viral entry by binding to a receptor present on the host cell and inducing fusion between the viral envelope and a membrane of the host cell (4White J.M. Science. 1992; 258: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To ensure that fusion does not occur during protein synthesis and folding, nor during budding of the viral particle, this function has to be tightly controlled. It is well known that oligomerization plays a crucial role in regulating the fusogenic function of such proteins (4White J.M. Science. 1992; 258: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Studying the early steps of oligomerization of HCV envelope glycoproteins is essential to understand how the virus controls its fusion activity. HCV is the causal agent of hepatitis C which is a major health problem worldwide. It is a positive stranded RNA virus and is a member of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae (5Mayo M.A. Pringle C.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Its genome encodes a single polyprotein of about 3000 amino acid residues that is co- and post-translationally cleaved to generate at least 10 polypeptides (C, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (6Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 931-959Google Scholar). The lack of a cell culture system supporting efficient HCV replication and particle assembly have hampered the characterization of the envelope proteins present on the virion. However, indirect evidences, like viral neutralization by antibodies, support the idea that HCV envelope glycoproteins are present on the surface of the virion (7Flint M. McKeating J.A. Rev. Med. Virol. 2000; 10: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the assembly of HCV envelope glycoproteins is based on cell culture transient-expression assays with viral or nonviral expression vectors. E1 and E2 are obtained after cleavage of the polyprotein by host signal peptidase(s) (8Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Stud. Hematol. Blood Transfus. 1998; 62: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They are heavily modified by N-linked glycosylation and are transmembrane proteins with a large N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal hydrophobic anchor (9Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). E1 and E2 glycoproteins have been shown to assemble as a noncovalent heterodimer (10Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this process is not efficient, and misfolded heterogeneous disulfide-linked aggregates of E1 and E2 are also produced, at least when using heterologous expression systems (9Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of E1 and E2 has been shown to be necessary to ensure correct folding of E1 (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The two glycoproteins likely play separate functions in HCV entry. Indeed, E2 might be involved in receptor binding (12Flint M. Maidens C. Loomis-Price L.D. Shotton C. Dubuisson J. Monk P. Higginbottom A. Levy S. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6235-6244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar), whereas E1 has been proposed to be the fusion protein (14Flint M. Thomas J.M. Maidens C.M. Shotton C. Levy S. Barclay W.S. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the envelope proteins of HCV are translated from a single coding region implies that internal signal peptides must be used. The signal sequences of E1 and E2 are present at the C terminus of the immature form of the capsid protein and in the second half of the TMD of E1, respectively (8Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Stud. Hematol. Blood Transfus. 1998; 62: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, a hydrophobic sequence present in the second half of the TMD of E2 is the signal sequence for a polypeptide called p7. Recently, we showed that the TMDs of E1 and E2 play a major role in the subcellular localization of E1·E2 complex (15Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J.

The TMDs of E1 and E2 have also been suggested to play a major role in the assembly of the heterodimer. Indeed, deletion of the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence of E2 (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Selby M.J. Glazer E. Masiarz F. Houghton M. Virology. 1994; 204: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), or its replacement by the membrane anchor of CD4 or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety, have been shown to abolish the formation of E1·E2 complexes (15Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multiple functions played by the TMDs of E1 and E2 glycoproteins are supposed to be essential for the formation of the viral envelope, and most likely impose limitations on the amino acid variability of these domains (3Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Minner F. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3623-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These TMDs are composed of two stretches of hydrophobic residues separated by a short segment containing at least one fully conserved charged residue (Fig. 1). Replacement of these charged residues by alanine has been shown to alter all the functions of the TMDs of E1 and E2 (3Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Minner F. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J.

We used alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis (19Braun P. Persson B. Kaback R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,20Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in these domains to examine their role in the assembly of the heterodimer. This technique has been shown to be a powerful method to detect dimerization of transmembrane α-helices. Indeed, insertion of a single amino acid into a transmembrane helix displaces the residues on the N-terminal side of the insertion by 110° relative to those on the C-terminal side of the insertion, disrupting a helix-helix packing interface involving residues on both sides of the insertion. Two distinct segments of the TMD of E1 and one of the TMD of E2 were very sensitive to alanine insertion, demonstrating the essential role played by these domains in the assembly of HCV envelope glycoproteins. Neither ER retention nor signal sequence cleavage were affected by these mutations, indicating that assembly can be dissociated from other functions played by the TMDs of HCV envelope glycoproteins. In complement to the alanine scanning data obtained for the N-terminal part of TMD of E1 which contains GXXXG motifs, we used circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to analyze, in the presence of various membrane mimetic solvents (detergents and trifluoroethanol/water mixtures), the three-dimensional structure of an E1 peptide encompassing the sequence involved in heterodimerization (E1-(350–370) segment). Alanine scanning results and the three-dimensional molecular model we obtained provide the first framework for a molecular level understanding of the mechanism of E1E2 heterodimerization. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that oligomerization of viral envelope proteins can be controlled by transmembrane sequences. The HepG2, CV-1, and 143B (thymidine kinase-deficient) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. Cell monolayers were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids expressing wild type and mutated E1E2 polyproteins (signal sequence of E1, and the sequences of E1 and E2) were constructed by standard methods (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA sequences of HCV proteins were polymerase chain reaction amplified and introduced into plasmid pTM1 (22Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). HCV sequences were amplified with the appropriate oligonucleotides from H strain clones (23Fournillier-Jacob A. Cahour A. Escriou N. Girard M. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Feinstone S. Alter H.J. Dienes H.P. Shimizu Y. Popper H. Blackmore D. Sly D. London W.T. Purcell R.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1981; 144: 588-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by enzymatic inverse polymerase chain reaction as described by Stemmer and Morris (25Stemmer W.P.C. Morris S.K. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 215-220Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing the chimeric protein CD4-E1A358′ was constructed as described (16Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the sequence of the signal peptide of CD4, followed by the sequence of the ectodomain of CD4 in fusion with the sequence encoding the C-terminal 37 amino acids of E1 with an alanine inserted at position 358′. Vaccinia virus recombinants were generated by homologous recombination essentially as described (26Kieny M.-P. Lathe R. Drillien R. Spehner D. Skory S. Schmitt D. Wiktor T. Koprowski H. Lecocq J.-P. Nature. 1984; 312: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and plaque purified twice in 143B cells under bromodeoxyuridine selection (50 μg/ml). Stocks of vTF7-3 (a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase) (27Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) H53 (anti-E2; (15Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), A4 (anti-E1 (29Dubuisson J.

Cells were infected with the appropriate vaccinia virus recombinants and metabolically labeled with 35S-Protein Labeling Mix (3.7 × 106 Bq/ml; NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (29Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl). Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (31Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vivo labeling of glycan moieties, HepG2 cells were infected with the appropriate vaccinia virus recombinants and pulse-labeled for 30 min with [2-3H]mannose (3.7 × 106 Bq/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in α-minimum essential medium containing 0.5 mm glucose and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After 4 h of chase, cells were lysed in TBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated [2-3H]mannose-labeled proteins were digested overnight at room temperature with 0.2 mg ofN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9). Trypsin-treated proteins were boiled for 10 min to inactivate the trypsin, and the peptides were lyophilized and dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 50 mmEDTA and 0.2 mg of NaN3/ml in 50% glycerol. The peptides were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of peptideN-glycanase F (0.5 units; New England Biolabs). Size analysis of the glycan moieties was achieved by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an amino-derivatized column ASAHIPAK NH2P-50 (250 by 4.6 mm) (Asahi, Kawasaki-ku, Japan) with a solvent system of acetonitrile/water from 70:30 (v/v) to 50:50 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 80 min. Oligomannosides were identified as described previously (32Kmiécik D. Herman V. Stroop C.J.M. Michalski J.C. Mir A.M. Labiau O. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by their retention time. Separation of labeled oligosaccharides was monitored by continuous flow detection of radioactivity with a Flo-One β detector (Packard). E1-(350–370) synthetic peptide was purchased from G. Blomberg, School of Medical Sciences, University of Bristol (United Kingdom). The numbering of this synthetic peptide (denoted E1-(350–370)) refers to the genotype 1a and its sequence (GAHWGVLAGIAYFSMVGNWAK-NH2) is identical to that of an infectious HCV cDNA clone recently published (33Kolykhalov A.A. Agapov E.V. Blight K. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Science. 1997; 277: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) (EMBL access number: AF009606). The synthesis was performed using N-tBoc chemistry and the C terminus was blocked by an amide group. Purity of the peptide was assessed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (molecular mass 2234 Da) and appeared to be higher than 90%. Moreover, only a minor spin system due to the impurity of the sample was observed in the NMR spectra. The peptide was rather insoluble in water but readily soluble in the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE). Micellar solutions were prepared by adding concentrated aqueous solutions of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) or SDS to a solution of E1-(350–370) dissolved in 90% TFE. Some TFE was eventually added to yield a clear and homogeneous mixture. After freezing and lyophilization to remove any trace of TFE, the samples were solubilized in 10 mmphosphate (pH 7.4). Micellar solutions were routinely checked for background absorbance, from which it was noted that light scattering was insignificant at the SDS and LPC concentrations used. Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. CD spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectrometer calibrated with ammoniumd 10-camphorsulfonate. Routinely, measurements were done at 298 K in 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with peptide concentrations ranging from 30 to 50 μm. Spectra were recorded in the 190–250 nm wavelength range with 0.2-nm increments and 2-s integration time. The baseline-corrected spectra were smoothed by using a third-order least squared polynomial fit. Assuming that the residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm is exclusively due to α-helix (34Woody R.W. Udenfried S. Meienhofer J. Hruby V.J. The Peptides. 7. Academic Press, New York1985: 15-114Google Scholar), the α-helical content was estimated using the following equation: % helix = 100[θ]obsλ/[θ]Hλ, where [θ]obsλ is the observed mean residue ellipticity and [θ]Hλ is the maximum mean residue ellipticity for a helix of finite length. [θ]Hλ was calculated using the empirical equation for helix-length dependence proposed by Chen et al. (35Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar) [θ]Hλ = [θ]Hλ∞ (f H− ik/n), where [θ]Hλ∞ is the maximum mean residue ellipticity for a helix of infinite length (−39,500 for λ = 222 nm), f H is the fraction of helix, iis the number of helical segments (1 in this case), k is a wavelength dependent constant (2.57 for λ = 222 nm), andn is the number of residues. Lyophilized peptide was dissolved in an aqueous solution containing 50% TFE-d 2(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl-1,1-d 2 alcohol >99% isotopic enrichment). The final peptide concentration was 4 mm and the pH measured was 5.7 (uncorrected). Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was added as an internal reference. All NMR experiments were recorded at 500 MHz on a Varian Unity-plus spectrometer. Spectra were acquired non-spinning at temperatures of 293 and 303 K. Two-dimensional homonuclear1H experiments (DQF-COSY, Clean-TOCSY, and NOESY) were performed according to the conventional pulse sequences. Water suppression was carried out using selective, low power irradiation during the 1.5-s relaxation delay and during the mixing time in NOESY experiments. Routinely, the spectra were recorded with 6000 Hz spectral width in both dimensions and data sets collected as 512 and 2048 points in t1 and t2 dimensions, respectively, with 32 or 64 scans per increment. Data collection and processing were carried out as detailed previously (36Penin F. Geourjon C. Montserret R. Bockmann A. Lesage A. Yang Y.S. Bonod-Bidaud C. Cortay J.C. Negre D. Cozzone A.J. Deleage G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Lesage A. Penin F. Geourjon C. Marion D. van der Rest M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9647-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resonances of protons were ascribed by the conventional assignment method (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). NOE intensities used as input for structure calculations were obtained from the NOESY spectrum recorded with a 300-ms mixing time and checked for spin diffusion on spectra recorded at lower mixing times (50–150 ms). Spectra obtained at 303 K were also used to estimate NOE intensities for cross-peaks unresolved at 293 K. NOEs were partitioned into four categories of intensities that were converted into distances ranging from a common lower limit of 1.8 Å to upper limits of 2.8, 3.9, 5.0, and 6.0 Å, respectively. The cross-peak intensity of the Hδ-Hε protons of Phe362was used as a distance reference (2.45 Å). Protons without stereospecific assignments were treated as pseudoatoms, and correction factors were added to the upper and lower distance constraints (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). NOEs back-calculations were performed from calculated structures (see below) by using the standard procedure of X-PLOR 3.1 program (39Brünger A.T. Xplor, A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures were generated from NOE distances with X-PLOR 3.1, using the standard force fields and default parameter sets, except some minor modifications (36Penin F. Geourjon C. Montserret R. Bockmann A. Lesage A. Yang Y.S. Bonod-Bidaud C. Cortay J.C. Negre D. Cozzone A.J. Deleage G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to increase the duration of the molecular dynamic simulations and the number of energy minimization steps. A group of 50 structures was calculated to widely sample the conformational space and the structures were selected on the basis of low energy and NOE violations. The structures were compared by pairwise RMSD for the backbone atom coordinates (N, Cα, and C′). Local analogies were analyzed by calculating the local RMSD of a tripeptide window slided along the sequence. Statistical analysis, superimposition of structures, three-dimensional graphic displays, and manipulations were achieved by using RASMOL 2.5 software (40Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The secondary structure elements and Ramachandran plots were analyzed according to the Kabsch-Sander definition rules, as incorporated in the program PROCHEK-NMR (41Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). To confirm the role played by the TMDs of HCV envelope glycoproteins in heterodimerization, we used alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis, a technique which has been shown to disrupt helix-helix interaction in a membrane environment (19Braun P. Persson B. Kaback R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The TMDs of E1 and E2 are present at the C terminus of these proteins (Fig.1). The N-terminal amino acids of these domains have not been precisely determined but it has been predicted that they could start at position 353 and 718 for E1 and E2, respectively (16Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S.-I. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6215-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A series of mutated proteins were obtained by introducing a single alanine residue in the TMD of E1 or E2 (Fig. 1). Since HCV envelope glycoproteins are produced after cleavage of a polyprotein, these mutations were introduced in the context of an E1E2 polyprotein. Mutated E1E2 polyproteins were expressed in HepG2 cells by using the vaccinia virus expression system. The ability of the mutants to form a noncovalent E1E2 complex was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with a conformation-sensitive E2-specific mAb (H53) which has been shown to specifically precipitate the native E1·E2 complex (15Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Duvet S. Cocquerel L. Pillez A. Cacan R. Verbert A. Moradpour D. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32088-32095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells expressing mutated E1E2 polyproteins were pulse-labeled with35S-Protein Labeling Mix for 10 min and chased for 4 h. These conditions have been shown to be appropriate to detect the peak of heterodimer formation (10Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the level of expression of E1, a control immunoprecipitation with a conformation-insensitive anti-E1 mAb (A4) was performed. E1 expression was found to be constant whatever the alanine insertions (Fig.2 A). Since mAb H53 is E2-specific, and because E2 can fold independently of E1 (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the amount of E1 co-precipitated by mAb H53 is a good indicator of the assembly of the noncovalent heterodimer. To evaluate the percentage of heterodimerization, E1/E2 ratios were measured for each mutant and compared with the ratio obtained with wild type proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, a severe disruption of heterodimerization was observed when alanine residues were introduced at positions Ala355′, Ala358′, Ala361′, or Ala369′ of the TMD of E1. Similar results were observed for E2 mutants Ala727′ and Ala730′ (Fig.3); however, the effects of alanine inserti"
https://openalex.org/W2034362820,"Mutations that disrupt developmental patterning in Drosophila have provided considerable information about growth factor signaling mechanisms. Three genes recently demonstrated to affect signaling by members of the Wnt, transforming growth factor-β, Hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factor families inDrosophila encode proteins with homology to vertebrate enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis. We report here the biochemical characterization of glycosaminoglycans inDrosophila bearing mutations in sugarless, sulfateless, and tout-velu. We find that mutations insugarless, which encodes a protein with homology to UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, compromise the synthesis of both chondroitin and heparan sulfate, as would be predicted from a defect in UDP-glucuronate production. Defects in sulfateless, a gene encoding a protein with similarity to vertebrateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases, do not affect chondroitin sulfate levels or composition but dramatically alter the composition of heparin lyase-released disaccharides. N-, 6-O-, and 2-O-sulfated disaccharides are absent and replaced entirely with an unsulfated disaccharide. A mutation intout-velu, a gene related to the vertebrate Exostoses 1 heparan sulfate co-polymerase, likewise does not affect chondroitin sulfate synthesis but reduces all forms of heparan sulfate to below the limit of detection. These findings show that sugarless, sulfateless, and tout-velu affect glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and demonstrate the utility ofDrosophila as a model organism for studying the function and biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2048550005,"Within the bilaterally symmetric vertebrate body plan, many organs develop asymmetrically. Here, it is demonstrated that a cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, is one of the earliest proteins to be asymmetrically expressed in the chicken embryo and that its activity is required during gastrulation for proper establishment of the left-right axis. Blocking N-cadherin function randomizes heart looping and alters the expression of Snail and Pitx2, later components of the molecular cascade that regulate left-right asymmetry. However, the expression of other components of this cascade (Nodal and Lefty) was unchanged after blocking N-cadherin function, suggesting the existence of parallel pathways in the establishment of left-right morphogenesis. Here, the results suggest that N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion events are required for establishment of left-right asymmetry."

The role of the human chromatin-bound Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent endonuclease (CME) DNAS1L3 and its inhibition by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the DNA degradation that accompanies apoptosis was investigated. The nuclear localization of this endonuclease is the unique feature that distinguishes it from other suggested apoptotic nucleases. Purified recombinant DNAS1L3 was shown to cleave nuclear DNA into both high molecular weight and oligonucleosomal fragments in vitro. Furthermore, exposure of mouse skin fibroblasts expressing DNAS1L3 to inducers of apoptosis resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, an effect not observed in cells not expressing this CME, as well as in a decrease in cell viability greater than that apparent in the control cells. Recombinant DNAS1L3 was modified by recombinant human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in vitro, resulting in a loss of nuclease activity. The DNAS1L3 protein also underwent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in transfected mouse skin fibroblasts in response to inducers of apoptosis. The cleavage and inactivation of PARP by a caspase-3-like enzyme late in apoptosis were associated with a decrease in the extent of DNAS1L3 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which likely releases DNAS1L3 from inhibition and allows it to catalyze the degradation of genomic DNA.

CMEs introduce double strand breaks and single strand nicks into DNA, generating fragments with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini, a mode of DNA fragmentation consistent with the products of chromatin degradation in apoptotic cells (19.Shiokawa D. Ohyama H. Yamada T. Takahashi K. Tanuma S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20.Sokolova I.A. Cowan K.H. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys.

CME activity is increased by a variety of stimuli that induce apoptosis (17.Giannakis C. Forbes I.J. Zalewski P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 922-931PubMed Google Scholar), and treatments that prevent apoptosis also prevent the induction of CME activity. A role for CMEs in apoptosis has also been supported by studies demonstrating the inhibition of DNA fragmentation by Ca2+ chelators or Zn2+ (13.Charriaut-Marlangue C. Remolleau S. Aggoun-Zouaoui D.

One of earliest nuclear events in apoptosis is the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of various proteins by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme that is activated by the presence of DNA strand breaks (23.Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.

PARP catalyzes the modification of histones, topoisomerases I and II, SV40 large T antigen, DNA polymerase α, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and various other DNA-binding proteins (25.Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.

Indeed, we have previously shown that an early and transient burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins, prior to the commitment to cell death, is required for apoptosis (23.Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.

Our observations suggested that subsequent cleavage of PARP by a caspase-3-like protease releases certain nuclear proteins from poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-induced inhibition and thereby allows them to mediate DNA fragmentation and cell death (23.Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.

The activity of chromatin-bound CMEs purified from rat liver or thymus has been shown to be inhibited by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (27.Tanaka Y. Yoshihara K. Itaya A. Kamiya T. Koide S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6579-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Yoshihara K. Tanigawa Y. Koide S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1997; 236: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), however, until this time, a particular nuclease of this type had not been identified from human cells. We previously identified the human homolog, DNAS1L3, of bovine and rat chromatin-bound CMEs. The nuclear localization of DNAS1L3 is the unique feature of this enzyme that distinguishes it from other suggested apoptotic nucleases (32.Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that this nuclease cleaves DNA into both oligonucleosomal and high molecular weight fragments (32.Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We now provide additional evidence that DNAS1L3 is regulated by PARP and that it may be responsible for apoptotic DNA degradation. The results also demonstrate that the activation of DNAS1L3 increases rates of cell death during apoptosis. Mouse fibroblasts, immortalized by a standard 3T3 protocol, were kindly provided by Z. Q. Wang (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France). Cells were grown under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). They were maintained in the logarithmic phase of growth by passage every 2–3 days. DNAS1L3 cDNA was aligned to the coding region for six histidine residues followed by the FLAG epitope and cloned in pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Addition of the His-FLAG tag was necessary for analysis of protein expression and also for purification of the recombinant DNAS1L3, because antibodies against the native enzyme were not available. Cells were transfected with the use of the Mirus TransIT-100 reagent (Panvera) and selected by culture for 2–3 weeks in the presence of G418 and then pooled. Staurosporin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and antibodies to mouse Fas receptor were obtained from Sigma, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Kamiya Biomedical, respectively. Recombinant human PARP was purified essentially as described (33.Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3498PubMed Google Scholar). A pET21a(+) expression vector (Novagen) containing the coding region for DNAS1L3 was used for the production of recombinant nuclease; because the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of both DNAS1L3 and its rat homolog (DNase γ) are thought to be removed after synthesis, resulting in enzyme activation, we used the coding sequence for the “processed” form of DNAS1L3. The DNAS1L3 expression plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. After induction of recombinant gene expression with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, DNAS1L3 was isolated from bacterial inclusion bodies with the use of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). The purified protein was refolded in enzyme storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.3m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. The purity of the DNAS1L3 preparation was estimated as >95% on the basis of Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (not shown). DNAS1L3 activity was measured by evaluation of the integrity of double stranded phage λ DNA during incubation with the recombinant nuclease with the use of a Pico Green double stranded DNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes). The phage DNA (2 μg/ml) was first stained with the quantitation reagent (1:200 dilution in water) at room temperature for 30–60 min, and recombinant DNAS1L3 was diluted immediately before use to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, and various combinations and concentrations of cations. Equal volumes (100 μl) of λ DNA and DNAS1L3 were mixed together in the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, and the nuclease reaction was monitored continuously over 10 min at 37 °C with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) by measuring the decrease in DNA fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 520 nm, respectively. Reaction mixtures without DNAS1L3 were included in each experiment to provide an indication of background changes in fluorescence. The emission from each well was plotted against time, and linear regression analysis of the initial slope of each curve yielded an activity value. Nuclei were isolated from rat cerebellum as described (34.Newmeyer D.D. Wilson K.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In brief, minced tissue was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in a solution containing 15 mm Pipes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mmspermine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 250 mm sucrose. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, after which an equal volume of homogenization buffer containing 2.3 m sucrose was added to the filtrate. The resulting mixture was layered over 10 ml of homogenization buffer containing 2.3 m sucrose in a Beckman SW28 centrifuge tube and then centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 50% glycerol at a concentration of 3 × 107 to 7 × 107 nuclei per milliliter and stored at −80 °C (35.Enari M. Hase A. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5201-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for the DNA fragmentation assay contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 5 × 105 nuclei, and various concentrations of MgCl2, CaCl2, and recombinant DNAS1L3 in a final volume of 60 μl. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 15 or 60 min, after which DNA was isolated from the nuclei as described (36.Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Fox G.B. Goodnight R. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7415-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, nuclei were lysed in 300 μl of 7 mguanidine hydrochloride, and the lysates were mixed with 1 ml of Wizard Miniprep DNA purification resin (Promega) and drawn by vacuum through a Wizard Minicolumn (Promega). The column was washed with 3 ml of washing solution (90 mm NaCl, 9 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.25 mm EDTA, 55% ethanol) and dried by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube at 10,000 × g for 2 min. DNA was eluted from the column by adding 50 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.4) and centrifuging in a new microcentrifuge tube. Residual RNA was removed from the eluate by addition of 1 μg of RNase A and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis through an agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Genomic DNA of cultured fibroblasts was isolated and analyzed as described previously (36.Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Fox G.B. Goodnight R. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7415-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells collected from one 10-cm Petri dish were lysed in 1 ml of 7 m guanidine hydrochloride and mixed with 1 ml of Wizard Maxiprep Resin (Promega). The suspension was drawn by vacuum through a Wizard Midicolumn (Promega). Columns were washed, and DNA was eluted with 150 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4) and analyzed as described above. Isolated nuclei (2 × 106) were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), mixed with 150 μl of agarose solution (1% agarose in lysis buffer, maintained at 42 °C), and poured into a plug mold. After solidification, plugs were incubated twice for 24 h each time at 50 °C in five volumes of lysis buffer supplemented with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) and 1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. They were subsequently incubated for at least 24 h in 100 volumes of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C, with at least two changes of buffer, and then stored at 4 °C until use. DNA was subjected to transverse alternating-field electrophoresis (TAFE) through 1% agarose in 1× TAFE buffer (20× TAFE buffer: 0.2 m Tris, 7.8 mm EDTA, and 0.5% glacial acetic acid) at 170 V for 30 min with 4-s pulses, followed by 150 V for 18 h with 35-s pulses. This protocol allowed for resolution of DNA molecules of up to 1000 kilobases (kb) in size. Lambda DNA ladders (50–1000 kb) were used as standards. DNA fragments were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Cell viability was measured by retention and de-esterification of calcein AM (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed once in Locke's buffer containing 154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 5 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). After loading of cells with 5 μm calcein AM in Locke's buffer for 20 min, fluorescence was monitored with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 520 nm, respectively. Transcripts encoding the mouse homolog (LSDNase) of DNAS1L3 were detected by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR as described previously (36.Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Fox G.B. Goodnight R. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7415-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular RNA was isolated by acidic phenol extraction (37.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and treated with DNase I. RT was performed with 10 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction mixture, and one-tenth of the resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR. PCR primers were as follows (sense and antisense, respectively): mouse LSDNase, 5′-GAGACACAGACGTGTTTTCC-3′ and 5′-GTCCACAAAGCACAATCCTG-3′; mouse β-actin, 5′-GTTTGAGACCTTCAACACCCCAGCC-3′ and 5′-ATGTCACGCACGATTTCCCTCTCAG-3′. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles of denaturation for 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 57 °C, and primer extension for 45 s at 72 °C. The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide. The identity of specific PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were harvested, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), and aprotinin (5 μg/ml). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. A portion of the lysate (30 μg of protein) was then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) through a 4–20% gradient gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and transfer of samples and was then probed with specific antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Antibodies to RARP and poly(ADP-ribose) were obtained from Santa Cruz and Trevigen, respectively. Caspase-3-like activity was assayed as described (38.Eldadah B.A. Yakovlev A.G. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Portions of cytosolic extract (20 μg of protein in 100 μl of extraction buffer) were mixed in the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with an equal volume of 40 μmfluorescent tetrapeptide substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC; Bachem) in the same buffer. Accumulation of free aminomethylcoumarin (AMC), which was produced as a result of cleavage of the aspartate-AMC bond, was monitored continuously over 10 min with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The emission from each well was plotted against time, and linear regression analysis of the initial slope of each curve yielded the activity value. Purified recombinant DNAS1L3 and PARP were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 40 pmol of [32P]NAD (800 Ci/mmol), and 0.1 μg of high molecular weight or activated rat genomic DNA. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 10 min, after which samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE through a 12.5% gel. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The results of our previous study (32.Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggested that DNAS1L3 mediates Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent fragmentation of DNA both in vitro and in vivo. We have now examined the cation dependence of DNAS1L3 directly with the use of the purified recombinant enzyme. The purified protein required both Ca2+ and Mg2+ for maximal activity; the optimal concentrations of these cations were 2.5–5 mm(Fig. 1 A) and 5 mm(Fig. 1 B), respectively, values similar to those determined for CME activity in rat liver nuclei (32.Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The activity of DNAS1L3 was also supported by Mn2+ (Fig. 1 C), with 20 mm Mn2+ yielding ∼80% of the nuclease activity apparent in the presence of optimal concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+; this concentration of Mn2+ is ∼10 times that shown to be optimal for the rat homolog (DNase γ) of DNAS1L3 (39.Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The activity of DNAS1L3 in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, like that of DNase γ (39.Shiokawa D. Tanuma S. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was inhibited by Zn2+, with a median effective concentration of ∼45 μm (Fig. 1 D). To examine whether DNAS1L3 preferentially introduces single stranded nicks or double stranded breaks into DNA substrates, we incubated various amounts of the recombinant enzyme with supercoiled and linear forms of pCR2.1 plasmid DNA (Invitrogen) in the presence of optimal concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the reaction products revealed that DNAS1L3 cleaved both forms of DNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2). However, at low concentrations (2–4 μg/ml), the recombinant enzyme preferentially introduced single strand nicks rather than double strand breaks, as reflected by the relative abundance of relaxed and linear forms of DNA generated from the supercoiled plasmid (Fig. 2 A). We previously analyzed Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent cleavage of DNA in nuclei isolated from rat liver and cerebellum (32.Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although liver nuclei exhibited such DNA cleavage, cerebellar nuclei did not. Consistent with the notion that DNase γ is responsible for the observed DNA degradation in the liver nuclei, transcripts encoding this enzyme were detected in rat liver but not in cerebellum. We investigated this conclusion further in the present study by incubating rat cerebellar nuclei with recombinant human DNAS1L3 in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then analyzing the generation of high molecular weight and oligonucleosomal DNA fragments. TAFE revealed the presence of small amounts of >1000-kb DNA fragments in cerebellar nuclei incubated without DNAS1L3 in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig.3 A). Although Mg2+alone did not induce the production of high molecular weight DNA fragments in nuclei incubated in the presence of recombinant DNAS1L3, nuclei incubated with DNAS1L3 in the presence of 5 mmMg2+ and 0.1 mm Ca2+ exhibited a marked increase in the amount of >1000-kb DNA fragments. A further increase in the Ca2+ concentration to 2.5 mmresulted in processing of the >1000-kb DNA molecules into ∼50-kb fragments (Fig. 3 A). Electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels revealed that DNAS1L3 cleaved DNA in cerebellar nuclei into oligonucleosomal fragments in a manner that was dependent on both enzyme dose as well as Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig.3 B). No such internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was apparent in the absence of added DNAS1L3. These results thus provide direct evidence that DNAS1L3 catalyzes the cleavage of DNA into both high molecular weight and oligonucleosomal fragments. We next examined the potential role of DNAS1L3 in DNA cleavage during apoptosis and its effect on cell viability in mouse skin fibroblasts stably transfected with DNAS1L3 cDNA (32.Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The expression vector encoded DNAS1L3 fused at its COOH terminus with six histidine residues to facilitate protein purification with Ni-NTA agarose. The presence of this COOH-terminal tag did not inhibit DNAS1L3 activity, given that the recombinant nuclease expressed in and purified from bacteria for our in vitro experiments was similarly tagged. Mouse skin fibroblasts were chosen, because RT-PCR analysis did not detect endogenous transcripts encoding the mouse homolog of DNAS1L3 (data not shown) and because they do not exhibit internucleosomal DNA fragmentation during apoptosis induced by a variety of agents. Cells transfected with the DNAS1L3 expression plasmid or with the empty vector (control) were treated with staurosporin or with TNF-α plus cycloheximide, after which DNA fragmentation and cell viability were analyzed. Both treatments induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the DNAS1L3-expressing cells but not in control cells (Fig.4 A). Analysis of cell viability revealed that the apoptosis-inducing effects of these treatments were markedly potentiated in cells expressing DNAS1L3 (Fig.4 B). The incidence of cell death after culture of cells in the absence of serum or in the presence of other inducers of apoptosis, such as etoposide or antibodies to mouse Fas, was also greater for cells expressing DNAS1L3 than for control cells (Fig.4 C). RT-PCR analysis revealed that mRNA encoding the mouse homolog (LSDNase) of DNAS1L3 is present in a variety of tissues, with the highest amounts apparent in spleen, liver, and testes (Fig.5). Smaller amounts were detected in heart, lungs, skeletal muscle, and kidney, but LSDNase mRNA was not detected in mouse brain. Similar analysis of mouse embryos at various stages of development revealed that LSDNase mRNA was not detected in 7-days mouse embryos, and small amounts of this mRNA were detected at day 11, and higher amounts were detected at days 15 and 17 (Fig. 5). The bovine chromatin-bound CME and related enzymes are inhibited by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (24.Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W2106369180,"The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the immune, inflammatory, and apoptotic responses. Recently, we identified the NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO) as an essential component of this pathway. NEMO is a structural and regulatory subunit of the high molecular kinase complex (IKK) responsible for the phosphorylation of NF-κB inhibitors. Data base searching led to the isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein we called NRP (NEMO-related protein), which shows a strong homology to NEMO. Here we show that NRP is present in a novel high molecular weight complex, that contains none of the known members of the IKK complex. Consistently, we could not observe any effect of NRP on NF-κB signaling. Nonetheless, we could demonstrate that treatment with phorbol esters induces NRP phosphorylation and decreases its half-life. This phosphorylation event could only be inhibited by K-252a and stauroporin. We also show that de novo expression of NRP can be induced by interferon and tumor necrosis factor α and that these two stimuli have a synergistic effect on NRP expression. In addition, we observed that endogenous NRP is associated with the Golgi apparatus. Analogous to NEMO, we find that NRP is associated in a complex with two kinases, suggesting that NRP could play a similar role in another signaling pathway.

Analogous to NEMO, we find that NRP is associated in a complex with two kinases, suggesting that NRP could play a similar role in another signaling pathway. interleukin-1 lipopolysaccharide tumor necrosis factor α phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate NF-κBEssential Modulator NEMO-related protein dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline glutathioneS-transferase protein kinase C The transcription factor NF-κB plays a pivotal role in many cellular processes such as immune responses, inflammation, and apoptosis (1Baldwin A.S.

In response to diverse stimuli, including IL-1,1 LPS, TNFα, or PMA, as well as several viral proteins, active NF-κB translocates to the nucleus as a result of the complete proteolytic degradation of the IκB proteins. This mechanism has been best studied for the inhibitor IκBα and demonstrated to involve phosphorylation on two specific serine residues (8Didonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wuli J. Suyang H. Ghosh S.

More recently a specific serine protein kinase activity responsible for IκBα phosphorylation has been identified as a large cytoplasmic complex (600–800 kDa) containing two catalytic subunits (IKK1/α and IKK2/β) (15Didonato J.A.

Both proteins contain NH2-terminal kinase domains, leucine zipper, and helix-loop-helix motifs (16Mercurio F. Zhu H.Y. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M.

In vitro phosphorylation studies have shown that both kinases can phosphorylate IκBα on serines 32 and 36, but IKKβ is more active in this regard. Recently, we have cloned, by complementation of an NF-κB unresponsive cell line, a third component of the IKK complex (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), that we called NEMO (NF-κB Essential Modulator). NEMO is a 48-kDa glutamine-rich protein, which lacks a catalytic subunit, but contains two coiled-coil motifs, a leucine zipper, and a COOH-terminal zinc finger (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C.

NEMO is a regulatory and structural subunit of the complex which seems to interact directly with IKKβ, but not with IKKα (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Studies with NH2-terminal deletion mutants of NEMO show that the first 235 residues contain the site of interaction with IKKβ (21Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W.

The human homolog of NEMO, IKKγ/IKKAP, has been cloned after purification of the IKK complex (21Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H.

Data base searching led to the isolation of a cDNA encoding aNEMO-related protein (NRP), which shares 53% sequence similarity with NEMO. NEMO and NRP were also identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using an adenovirus protein (Ad E3-14.7K) as a bait. Interestingly, these proteins, named FIP-3 and FIP-2, respectively, could block the anti-apoptotic activity of the E3-14.7K protein after TNFα stimulation (23Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized NRP more thoroughly. In order to determine whether NRP is involved in NF-κB signaling, we investigated whether it is associated with the IKK complex, or whether it could complement a NEMO-deficient cell line. We could not observe any role of NRP in NF-κB signaling, but we found that the COOH-terminal zinc finger of NRP can functionally replace that of NEMO. We could demonstrate that NRP is present in a high molecular weight complex, smaller than the IKK complex, and is associated with two kinase activities. These results demonstrate that NRP could fulfill a similar regulatory function to that of NEMO in a non-NF-κB-dependent pathway. Moreover in an effort to characterize the signaling pathways that might target NRP, we showed that PMA stimulation induces its phosphorylation. This phosphorylation was inhibited by K-252a and stauroporin. Finally, we also demonstrated that NRP expression is synergistically induced by interferon and TNFα. 70Z/3 is a murine pre-B cell line and its variant 1.3E2 is a NEMO-deficient cell line (20Yamaoka S.

E29.1 is a CD4-negative, CD8-negative mouse T-cell hybridoma (kindly provided by P. Truffa Bachi). Jurkat is a human leukemia T cell line. These cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In the case of 70Z/3 and 1.3E2, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol were added in the medium. HeLa cells and 293T cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 7% CO2. The antisera used were the following: anti-IKK2 (Santa Cruz, ref. H470) is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum. Anti-CD28.2 is a murine monoclonal antibody directed against human CD28 (Immunotech). T cells were activated by stimulation with an anti-TCR murine monoclonal antibody (Vit-3) (kindly provided by W. Knapp). Anti-NEMO rabbit polyclonal antibody (serum 44106) was raised against a TrpE fusion protein encompassing amino acids 30–329 of murine NEMO (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R.

Anti-NRP (serum 46096) is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum generated against a TrpE fusion protein encompassing amino acids 84–164 of human NRP. NRP open reading frames were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Expression vectors for transfection into 1.3E2 cells were obtained by subcloning cDNAs encoding NEMO, NRP, or their derivatives into the plasmid pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen). NEMO Δ ZF represents amino acids 1–385 of NEMO. For the cloning of NEMO Δ ZF-NRP ZF, NRP plasmid was digested with BstBI/EcoRI and this fragment was ligated into the XbaI site of the NEMO plasmid. Details of all the constructions used in this article are available upon request. Cells (5 × 106) were incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C in 1 ml of regular growth medium containing 100 IU/ml TNFα (Pharmingen), 20 ng/ml IL-1, 10 ng/ml interferon α/β, 10 ng/ml interferon γ, 15 μg/ml LPS (Sigma), 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma), 1 μm calcium ionophore (Sigma), or 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Treatment of the cells with kinase inhibitors or activators was performed at 37 °C for 20 min and was followed by PMA stimulation for 30 additional minutes. The following kinase inhibitors and activators were purchased from Calbiochem and were used at the indicated doses: K-252a (2 μm), KN-93 (10 μm), W7 (50 μm), KN-62 (200 μm), calmidazolium (5 μm), GF 109203X (GFX, 20, 4 nm), GÖ6976 (3 μm), Rottlerin (10 μm), K-252b (250 μm), H7 (1, 5 μm), calphostin C (1 μm), stauroporin (1 μm), genistein (100 μm), thapisgargin (10 μm), PD098059 (50 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), Bt2cAMP (50 μm). Pertussis toxin (CyA), a gift from D. Ladant, Institut Pasteur, was used at 10 μm. 10 × 106 Jurkat cells were activated at 37 °C with 6 μg of the anti-TCR Vit-3 and/or 20 μg of the anti-CD28 antibody at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by adding an equal volume of 1 × CHRIS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA), supplemented with 20 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (100 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (2 mm). This analysis was performed using the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). Cells were lysed as described above. Specific polypeptides were then recovered by immunoprecipitation from equivalent amounts of cellular proteins (1 mg). Immune complexes were collected with Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). After washing the immunoprecipitates 3 times in lysis buffer, the proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Subsequent immunoblots were obtained using the protocol outlined below. Immunoblots were performed according to a previously described protocol (25Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israël A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We used antiserum, biotinylated protein A (Interchim Pierce), and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1/1000 dilution. Proteins transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore) were revealed with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Interchim Pierce) and immunoreactive products were detected by autoradiography. 1.3E2 cells were transfected by the DEAE dextran method. The total DNA content in each transfection was adjusted to 10 μg. The Ig-(κB)3-LUC reporter has been described previously (26LeBail O. Schmidt Ullrich R. Israël A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In the control, the cells were transfected with the appropriate empty parental expression vector pcDNA3. 24 h after transfection, LPS was added 5 h before harvest. Then, the cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in 300 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 1% Triton, 15% glycerol). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 r.p.m. at 4 °C for 5 min. The whole cell extract was used to measure luciferase activity in the lysis buffer containing 1 mmd-luciferin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 20 mm ATP. Cells were lysed with CHRIS buffer as described above. 1 mg of proteins from the lysates were incubated with 5 μl of the NEMO or NRP antibody. The immunoprecipitations were performed as described above, except that the immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with 1 × CHRIS followed by 3 washes with a kinase buffer containing: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl. The kinase reactions were conducted as described (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 30 °C in the kinase buffer, in the presence of 12.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and GST-IκBα 1–72 wild type (referred as IκBα wt) or GST-IκBα 1–72 A32A36 (IκBα 2A) as substrates. RNA was extracted in TRIzol (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of total RNA were separated on 1% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred onto nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a32P-radiolabeled probe corresponding to full-length humanNRP cDNA. Hybridization was carried out at 60 °C in 7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The membrane was washed successively in 0.1% SDS, 2 × SSC at 25 °C for 5 min and in 0.1% SDS, 0.1 × SSC at 60 °C for 30 min. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1 × CHRIS supplemented with 10 μg/ml of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 100 μg of total cell extracts were diluted 4 times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MnCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0, solution containing 500 units of λ-phosphatase (Calbiochem) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was inhibited with the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm), β-glycerophosphate (50 mm), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). HeLa cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in complete medium at 5 × 106 cells/1 ml with a total amount of 20 μg of plasmid, and the cells were electroporated with the Easyject system (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) in 4-mm cuvettes. Electroporation parameters were: 240 V, 1350 mivrofarads, 156 ohm, pulse time 211 ms. Transfected HeLa cells were seeded in 5 ml of minimal essential medium in 6-well plates and grown on glass coverslips. After 24 h the medium was changed. After an additional 24 h the cells were washed in PBS two times, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice in PBS and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After two washes with PBS, unspecific hybridization was blocked with 3% (v/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 15 min and incubated with primary antibody (purified NRP antibody) at 1/100 for 1 h at 37 °C. After washes, coverslips were incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:200. After being washed in PBS, coverslips were mounted on slides with Mowiol, and cells were examined with a Leica DMRXA-HC microscope. Fifty million 293T cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EGTA. Cells were lysed by 30 passages through a 26-gauge needle. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 rpm, the supernatant was recovered and complemented with 1 mm DTT, 0.025% Brij 35, and a mixture of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors. S100 were prepared by centrifuging the cytoplasmic extracts for 30 min at 52,000 rpm in a TLA 100.2 rotor (Beckman). After adding 10% glycerol, the S100 extracts were quickly frozen in dry ice and stored in liquid nitrogen. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precalibrated with aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Five-hundred μl fractions were recovered and directly analyzed by Western blotting with anti-NEMO and anti-NRP antisera. Cells were lysed and proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitates were applied to a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel which had been polymerized in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (bovine brain, Sigma). Following electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to several rounds of denaturation and renaturation. For the denaturation procedure, the gel was washed twice for 30 min with a 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, solution containing 20% isopropyl alcohol, and twice for 30 min with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and finally twice with 6 m urea in buffer A. Then the gel was renatured progressively at 4 °C by washing the gel once in a 3 m urea solution in buffer A containing 0.025% Tween 20 for 15 min, once in a 1.5 murea solution in buffer A containing 0.025% Tween 20 for 15 min, and once in a 0.75 m urea solution in buffer A containing 0.025% Tween 20 for another 15 min. For the kinase reaction, the gel was preincubated in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2) at 30 °C for 30 min and finally incubated at 30 °C for 2 h in the kinase buffer containing 2 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The gel was then washed 4 times for 15 min with trichloroacetic acid/PPi (5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% NaPPi), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Our previous results have shown that NEMO-deficient cell lines are refractory to all tested NF-κB-activating stimuli, suggesting that IKK is the unique complex involved in NF-κB signaling (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 27Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the possibility exists that kinase complexes different from the IKK complex might exhibit a tissue-restricted expression, or might respond to uncharacterized NF-κB activating stimuli. In an effort to identify components of such complexes, we looked for NEMO homologues by data bank searching. BLAST search allowed us to identify a cDNA encoding a 67-kDa protein we called NRP. NRP was also isolated under the name of FIP-2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the adenovirus E3-14.7K protein as a bait (24Li Y. Kang J. Horwitz M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequence encoded by NRP with that of NEMO shows 53% amino acid similarity (Fig.1). NRP consists of 572 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 67 kDa. Alignment of the 2 sequences indicates that NRP contains an “insert” of 167 additional amino acids positioned after residue 134 of NEMO (Fig. 1). Secondary structure prediction of the 2 proteins shows similar structural elements. Both proteins have coiled coil domains, a carboxyl-terminal zinc finger, and a putative leucine zipper, which is located at the beginning of the insert in NRP and in the COOH-terminal part of NEMO (Fig. 1). We have recently reported that NEMO could complement the 70Z/3-derived mutant cell line 1.3E2, that exhibits a defect in NF-κB activation (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). As NRP and NEMO are related, we asked whether NRP could also complement the 1.3E2 cell line. Transient transfection of a vector expressing NEMO in 1.3E2 resulted in a 30–40-fold increase in NF-κB activity following LPS stimulation, whereas transfection of the parental expression vector had no effect (Fig.2 A). In contrast to NEMO, transfection of NRP did not result in NF-κB activation under the same conditions, suggesting that NRP could not replace NEMO in NF-κB signaling. We recently showed that the zinc finger region of NEMO is essential for its activity, and that its deletion strongly reduces its ability to complement the 1.3E2 cell line (Fig.2 A). 2G. Courtois and S. Yamaoka, manuscript in preparation. As the zinc finger domains of NRP and NEMO are very similar (Fig. 1), we tested the possibility that the zinc finger domain of NRP could functionally replace that of NEMO. A hybrid molecule consisting of the NRP zinc finger fused to the rest of the NEMO molecule (NEMO ΔZF-NRP ZF) could activate NF-κB to the same extent as wild-type NEMO, suggesting a possible functional similarity between the two molecules. The significant homology between NEMO and NRP led us to investigate whether NRP was associated with the IKK complex. To examine this possibility, E29.1 T cell hybridoma lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit serum as a control (Fig. 2 B, lane 1), NRP antibody (lane 2), or NEMO antibody (lane 3). As described previously (20Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitation of NEMO followed by immunoblotting for IKKβ demonstrated the association between these proteins (lane 3); however, we did not find IKKβ in NRP immunoprecipitates (lane 2) and we could not detect an association between NEMO and NRP by immunoprecipitating one of these two proteins followed by immunodetection of the other (lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, these results show that NRP is not associated with NEMO, IKKβ, IKKα (data not shown) and is probably not a component of the IKK complex. Since NEMO is an essential component of the 600–800-kDa kinase complex that phosphorylates IκB, we investigated whether NRP is also present in a high molecular mass complex. S100 extracts were prepared from 293T cells and fractionated on a Superose 6 gel filtration column. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against NRP and NEMO. As shown in Fig.2 C, NRP is present in a high molecular mass complex ranging from 400 to 700 kDa (lanes 7–10), whereas the larger IKK complex containing NEMO migrates, as expected, at 600 to 800 kDa (lanes 9–11). These results suggest that these two proteins are essentially present in different complexes. The results presented above demonstrate that NRP is not associated with known IκB kinases but, they do not address whether NRP is associated with other putative IκB kinases. In order to elucidate this point, NEMO and NRP were immunoprecipitated from resting or stimulated cells. The immune complexes were assayed for phosphorylation of a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the amino-terminal part of IκBα in the wild type context (IκBα) or mutated on its two phosphorylation sites (IκBα 2A). In Fig. 2 D, top panel, Jurkat cells were stimulated for 10 min with PMA and ionomycin (lanes 3 and 4), anti-CD28 (lanes 5 and 6) or both (lanes 7 and 8). As expected, NEMO was found to be associated with an inducible kinase activity as highlighted by IκBα phosphorylation (compare lanes 3, 5, 7 to lane 1). This activity was directed against the phosphorylation sites of IκBα since IκBα 2A was not phosphorylated (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). This phosphorylation was maximum when the cells were co-stimulated with PMA, ionomycin, and anti-CD28 (compare lanes 7 to lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, we could not observe any kinase activity associated with NRP (lanes 9–16). In the bottom panels, we have evaluated the effect of PMA and TNFα treatment on NEMO and NRP kinase activity in HeLa and E29.1 cells. We could observe an inducible kinase activity associated with NEMO after TNFα stimulation (compare lanes 5 and 1) and to a lesser extent after PMA stimulation (compare lanes 3 and 1); however, we could not observe any kinase activity associated with NRP. These data indicate that NRP, in contrast to NEMO, is not associated with an IκBα kinase activity. In order to investigate the effect of different NF-κB stimuli on NRP expression, 70Z/3 preB cells were stimulated for the indicated time with PMA. As depicted in Fig. 3, top panel, precipitation of NRP followed by immunoblotting with the same antibody demonstrated an increase in the appearance of a slower migrating form of the molecule after 15 min of PMA stimulation (lanes 2–5). This upper band progressively returned to basal level after 1 h of stimulation (lanes 4 and 5). We then tested whether other stimuli could also increase the amount of the upper band. 70Z/3 cells were subjected to IL-1 (middle panel) or LPS stimulation (bottom panel), two other stimuli able to activate NF-κB in this cell line; we could not detect any effect on NRP expression following these treatments. To evaluate whether similar events could occur in T cells, the murine hybridoma E29.1 was subjected to PMA treatment (Fig. 3 B, top panel). We could observe a strong increase in the appearance of the slow migrating band after 5 min of stimulation (compare lanes 2and 1). However, TNFα treatment of E29.1 cells did not result in any change in NRP expression (bottom panel), although prolonged treatment with this cytokine strongly increased the level of the NRP mRNA (see below). We then investigated whether this slowly migrating band represents a hyperphosphorylated form of NRP. E29.1 cells were left untreated or were stimulated for 30 min with PMA and then lysed with Nonidet P-40 containing buffer (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 2). Following this treatment, cell extracts were treated with λ-phosphatase (lanes 3 and 4) or with λ-phosphatase plus phosphatase inhibitors (lanes 5 and 6). PMA treatment induced the appearance of the upper band (lane 2), which disappeared following phosphatase treatment; this disappearance could be blocked by phosphatas"

The chronology shows a distinct interannual (3 to 5 years) band of enhanced variability suggestive of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections into North America during the late Pleistocene, when the Laurentide ice sheet was near its maximum extent and climatic boundary conditions were different than those of today. This interannual variability largely disappears by the young end of the 4000-year chronology, with only the highest frequency components (roughly 3-year period) persisting. This record provides evidence of ENSO-like climate variability during near-peak glacial conditions."

Histone modification by acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation plays an important role in gene transcription and cell division. Histone H3 can be acetylated at lysines 9, 14, 18, 23; phosphorylated at serines 10 and 28; and methylated at lysines 9 and 27 in the N-terminal domain (1.Van Holde K.E. Rich A. Chromatin.

Phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 is thought to be a highly conserved event among eukaryotes and is probably involved in both mitotic and meiotic chromosome condensation (6.Wei Y.

Various stimuli including epidermal growth factor and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and stresses such as UV irradiation induce a Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase cascade that results in the transcription of a subset of genes known as immediate early response genes (8.Marshall C.J.

These genes include members of the c-fos and c-jun families that comprise transcription factor activator protein 1. Our previous study showed that UVB markedly induced activator protein 1 activity via the ERK pathway (12.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, UVB was shown to induce phosphorylation of H3 (2.Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and immediate early response gene induction was reported to correlate with phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 (13). These data imply that phosphorylation of H3 may play an important role in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and chromosome condensation during mitosis. However, the role of MAP kinases (ERKs, p38, and JNKs) in the process of H3 phosphorylation remains unclear. Very recently, Thomson et al. (13.Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) indicated that MSK1 was a potential histone H3/HMG-14 kinase, and Paolo et al. (14.Sassone-Corsi P.

Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) reported that epidermal growth factor induces phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 by the Rsk-2 pathway. In this study, we investigated the role of MAP kinases in phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 in vitro and in vivo after UVB irradiation. PD 98059 and SB 202190 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Sigma; pure histone H3 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; antibody-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and antibodies of phosphorylated ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs were from New England Biolabs; antibodies of H3 and phosphorylated H3 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); active ERK2, active JNK2, and active p38 kinase were from Upstate Biotechnology; Elk1, ATF2, and c-Jun fusion protein and MAP kinase (ERK2) were from New England Biolabs; antibodies of phosphorylated Elk1 serine 383, phosphorylated ATF2 thronine 71, and phosphorylated c-Jun serine 63 were from New England Biolabs; minimum essential medium (MEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Biowhittaker Biosciences; l-glutamine was from Life Technologies, Inc.; gentamicin was from Quality Biological, Inc. Equivalent numbers of JB6 Cl 41 cells were seeded in six-well plates or 10-cm dishes and cultured in 5% FBS MEM until they were 85% confluent and then starved in 0.1% FBS MEM for 48 h. Cells were then incubated for 2 h in fresh 0.1% FBS MEM, after which time they were exposed to UVB and then cultured for additional time periods. Since the normal UVB lamp also generates a small amount of UVC light, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber fitted with a Kodak Kodacel K6808® filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. After UVB irradiation, cultured cells were harvested and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Acid solution protein extraction was carried out as described by the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology (available on the World Wide Web). In brief, acid-soluble proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and then H2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m (0.4 n) and left for 60 min on ice. Supernatant fractions were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm/10 min and precipitated on ice for 45 min with 50% trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid. These tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm/10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed once with acidic acetone and once with acetone, respectively. The acid-soluble proteins were stored at −20 °C. Acid-soluble proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Resolved acid-soluble proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the first antibody against H3 or phospho-H3 overnight at 4 °C. The second antibody against rabbit IgG-conjugated alkaline phosphatase was incubated with the membranes for 4 h at 4 °C. Membrane-bound proteins were detected with chemiluminescence (ECF of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed using the Storm 840 Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Chromatin was prepared at 4 °C according to the procedure of Pumo et al. (15.Pumo D.E. Wierzbicki R. Chiu J.F. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2362-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, JB6 Cl 41 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and cultured in 5% FBS MEM until they were 85% confluent and then harvested. Cells were washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by the addition of 4 volumes of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 msucrose), and homogenized. The suspension was centrifuged at 2500 rpm/15 min (Rotor 224, Centra-MP4R; International Equipment Company). Pellets of cells were suspended by the addition of 9 volumes of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 m sucrose). The 4.5-ml suspension was added to 1.5 ml of buffer B in 6-ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm/40 min (Ti 42, Beckman L5–75). The pellets were resuspended by the addition of 20 volumes of buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA), homogenized, and then centrifuged at 2500 rpm/15 min. Pellets were suspended by the addition of 50 volumes of buffer D (0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate). The suspension was centrifuged at 3500 rpm/20 min (Rotor 224, Centra-MP4R; international Equipment Company) to recover chromatin. The protein concentration of chromatin was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) after sonicating four times for 5 s each. The chromatin pellet was stored at −70 °C until used. Phosphorylation of histone H3, Elk1, ATF2, or c-Jun by activated ERK2, p38 kinase, or JNK2 was carried out as described previously (16.Wei Y., Yu, L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In brief, pure histone H3, chromatin of JB6 Cl 41 cells or other kinase substrates (Elk1, ATF2, or c-Jun fusion protein) were incubated with ERK2, p38 kinase, or JNK2, respectively, and 200 μm ATP in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2) for 45 min at 30 °C. The samples were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylated H3 was detected by Western blot with H3-phospho-specific antibodies (6.Wei Y. Mizzen C.A Cook R.G.

Western blot analysis of ERK2, JNK2, or p38 kinase and their phosphorylated substrates was carried out as described previously (18.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pure histone H3 by ERK2 or p38 kinase was carried out as described by the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology. In brief, the following components were added to a series of tubes: 10 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol); 10 μl of various concentrations of pure histone H3; 10 μl of ERK2 or p38 kinase; and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP mixture (1 μCi/μl). Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and then 30 μl of the mixture was spotted on individual pieces of p81 paper (2 cm2). The assay squares were washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone and then transferred to scintillation vials with 5 ml of scintillation mixture and counted in a scintillation counter. K m values for H3 phosphorylation by ERK2 or p38 kinase were then determined. Phosphorylation of H3 may play a very important role in transcriptional regulation by a variety of signals. To study whether UV irradiation induces phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10, we first exposed JB6 epidermal C1 41 cells to UVB and analyzed the phosphorylation of H3 by Western blot using a phosphospecific antibody against phosphorylated H3 at serine 10 (6, 14, 16, 17). In a parallel blot, equal amounts of acid-soluble protein were confirmed by Western blot to detect histone H3 with anti-histone H3 antibody. Results showed that UVB (4 kJ/m2) induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 in the JB6 C1 41 mouse epidermal cell line (Fig. 1 A). Phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 was greater at 15 or 30 min than at 60 min following UVB irradiation and decreased markedly by 120 min (Fig. 1 A). A dose-response study showed that phosphorylation of H3 gradually increased with UVB exposures of 1–6 kJ/m2(Fig. 1 B). The results indicate that UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 is time- and dose-dependent. UVB irradiation causes activation of the MAP kinase superfamily, composed of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase (11.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J.

To identify the possible role of MAP kinases in mediating UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3, we first examined the influence of specific chemical inhibitors on UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 in JB6 C1 41 cells. The results showed that UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 was markedly blocked by pretreatment of cells with 1–4 μm SB 202190 (Fig.2 A), a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase (12.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13.Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C.

We previously showed that at these concentrations, SB 202190 and PD 98059 specifically inhibit UVB-induced p38 kinase and MEK1, respectively (12.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,18.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ERKs and p38 kinase may be involved in UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10. SB 202190 and PD 98059 block the UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10. A chemical inhibitor for JNKs is unknown at this time. Therefore, to further identify the role of MAP kinases in UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3, we used JB6 C1 41 cells expressing DNMs of ERK2, p38, and JNK1 (16.Wei Y., Yu, L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 22.Dong Z. Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Malewicz B. Baumann W.J. Kiss Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results showed that UVB strongly induced phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 and JNK in JB6 C1 41 cells (Fig. 3,A–C), but the expression of DNM ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNK1 in JB6 C1 41 cells specifically blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of ERKs, p38, and JNK kinases (Fig. 3, D–F). We then analyzed UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 in wild type and mutant JB6 C1 41 cells (Fig. 4). Compared with wild type cells (Fig. 4 A), the cells expressing DNM ERK2 (Fig. 4 B) or DNM p38 kinase (Fig. 4 C) markedly blocked H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 at 15 and 30 min (Fig. 4,B and C). However, a weak signal indicating H3 phosphorylation appears in DNM p38 cells at 60 min (Fig.4 C). In contrast, expression of DNM JNK1 did not reveal significant inhibition of H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 at 30 and 60 min; however, UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation was delayed in DNM JNK1 cells compared with JB6 Cl 41 cells (Fig. 4 D). Further, we used Jnk1 and Jnk2 knockout cells (Jnk1 −/−, Jnk2 −/−) and Jnks wild-type cells (Jnks +/+) to study the role of JNKs in the UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10. The results showed that UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 was not affected in Jnk1 −/− orJnk2 −/− cells as compared withJnks +/+ cells (Fig.5). The dose-response studies with UVB exposure (1, 2, 4, and 6 kJ/m2) further indicated that ERKs and p38 kinase are mediators of UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 (Fig. 6).Figure 4UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 is blocked by DNM ERK2 or DNM p38 kinases but not by DNM JNK1.

These results show that active ERK2 (Fig. 7 A) and p38 kinase (Fig. 7 B), but not JNK2 (Fig. 7 C), can directly phosphorylate H3 at serine 10 in vitro, while active JNK2, ERK2, and p38 kinase were able to phosphorylate their substrate c-Jun, Elk1, and ATF2, respectively (Fig. 7,A–C). Further, by using chromatin isolated from Cl 41 cells as substrate for these kinases, we obtained similar results (Fig.7 D), showing that ERK2 and p38 kinase, but not JNK2, caused H3 protein phosphorylation at serine 10 in vitro. These results confirm that ERK2 and p38 kinase are mediators of UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10. To determine the H3 phosphorylation by MAP kinases, we performed the kinase assay by using [γ-32P]ATP and pure histone H3 protein. Phosphate incorporation was 3.89 × 105 μmol of phosphate/μmol of ERK2 and 2.68 × 105 μmol of phosphate/μmol of p38 kinase. The K m values of H3 phosphorylation by ERK2 and p38 kinase were calculated, and results showed that K m values for H3 phosphorylation by ERK2 and p38 kinase were 2.04 × 10−5 and 4.89 × 10−6 mm, respectively. Different K m values for ERK2 and p38 kinase indicated that p38 kinase is more effective than ERK2 for H3 phosphorylation. To further investigate the interaction between H3 and MAP kinasesin vivo, we used anti-phospho-H3 at serine 10, phospho-ERKs, or phospho-p38 kinase to co-immunoprecipitate the complex of H3 and ERKs or H3 and p38 kinase from JB6 Cl 41 cells following UVB irradiation. No H3-ERKs or H3-p38 kinase co-immunoprecipitation complex was found (data not shown). In the present study, we provide evidence that UVB irradiation induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 in vivo. Pretreatment of cells with SB 202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor (12.Huang C. Ma W.-Y.

These results clearly suggest that ERKs and p38 kinase are mediators of UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10.

Phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 is also related to the expression of immediate early response genes (c-fos and c-jungene families) (9.Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Kardalinou E. Buckle R.S. Mahadevan L.C.

The above findings strongly imply that H3 phosphorylation plays an important role in gene expression and mitotic and meiotic chromatin condensation. However, H3 serine 10 is not phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (27.Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The H3 phosphorylation pathway remains poorly understood. Recently, epidermal growth factor was reported to induce phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 by the RSK2 pathway (14.Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D.

In this study, we investigated the role of MAP kinases in mediation of UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10. UVB induced the activation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase. Fifteen minutes after UV irradiation, UV-induced activation of these kinases correlated well with the UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 (Figs. 1and 3). However, the persistence of the H3 phosphorylation at 60 min suggests that H3 may be also phosphorylated by a kinase downstream of ERK or p38 kinase (Figs. 1 and 3).

The above data indicated that UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 may be mediated by ERKs and p38 kinase. Further studies using cells with dominant negative MAP kinases (DNM ERK2, DNM p38 kinase, or DNM JNK1) help clarify the role of MAP kinases in UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar), respectively. Our results showed that overexpression of dominant negative MAP kinases inhibited phosphorylation of endogenous ERKs, p38 kinase, or JNKs by about 60% (Fig. 3, D–F), compared with phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinase, or JNKs in wild type JB6 Cl 41 cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Time-dependent patterns of UVB-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases were similar to UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10. Phosphorylation of ERK2 and p38 kinase at 60 min declined by about 25%, compared with the level at 15 min following UVB irradiation in JB6 Cl 41 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). However, phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 at 60 min decreased by about 80% in JB6 Cl 41 cells (Fig. 1 A). Compared with ERKS and p38 kinase, the persistence of the H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 at 60 min implies that a downstream effector kinase of MAP kinase may be involved in H3 phosphorylation. This suggests that UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 may be dependent on the activation of MAP kinases. Expression of DNM ERK2 completely blocked phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 (Fig. 4 B). This result confirmed that ERKs indeed mediate UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10. Expression of DNM p38 kinase also displayed a similar inhibition (∼80%) of H3 phosphorylation at 15 and 30 min (Fig.4 C), but little signal was observed at 60 min following UVB irradiation. Expression of DNM JNK1 did not appear to inhibit UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 (Fig. 4 D), but the time course for phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 was slightly delayed in DNM JNK1 cells following UVB irradiation. The reason for this delay is unclear and is under investigation in this laboratory. UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 was not inhibited in theJnk1 −/− orJnk2 −/− cells as compared withJnks +/+ cells (Fig. 5). The in vitro experiments further confirmed, regardless of substrates for pure histone H3 or chromatin from JB6 Cl 41 cells, that ERK2 and p38 kinase, but not JNKs, phosphorylated H3 at serine 10. Notably, the assay of kinase activity showed that p38 kinase was more effective than ERK2 for H3 phosphorylation. Together, these results show that reduction of ERKs and p38 kinase leads to essentially complete cessation of UVB-induced H3 phosphorylation at serine 10, but JNKs do not appear to be involved. In conclusion, we have determined that ERKs and p38 kinase mediate UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10. These data suggest that phosphorylation of H3, which is a basic component of the transcriptional machinery and a structural protein of the nucleosome, is mediated by different MAP kinases as a means to satisfy the needs of cells in response to various environmental stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W2010724277,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play a major role in regulating insulin signaling. Among the PTPs that regulate this signaling pathway, PTP1B plays an especially prominent role. PTP1B inhibits insulin signaling and has previously been shown to bind to the activated insulin receptor (IR), but neither the mechanism nor the physiological importance of such binding have been established. Here, we show that a previously undefined region in the N-terminal, catalytic half of PTP1B contributes to IR binding. Point mutations within this region of PTP1B disrupt IR binding but do not affect the catalytic activity of this phosphatase. This binding-defective mutant of PTP1B does not efficiently dephosphorylate the IR in cells, nor does it effectively inhibit IR signaling. These results suggest that PTP1B targets the IR through a novel binding element and that binding is required for the physiological effects of PTP1B on IR signal transduction."

Class II AP endonucleases cleave the phosphodiester backbone on the 5′-side of the AP site and produce a 3′-OH group and a 5′-baseless deoxyribose 5′-phosphate residue.

Apn1 and Apn2 represent alternate pathways for the repair of AP sites in yeast, since the apn1Δ apn2Δ double mutant strain displays a synergistic increase in sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and the repair of AP sites is severely impaired in this mutant (6.Johnson R.E. Torres-Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).

Recently, a sequence, Ape2, has been identified in humans that possesses the C-terminal domain present inS. cerevisiae Apn2, and Ape2 also is more closely related to Apn2 than to ExoIII or Ape1. Thus, yeast Apn2 and its human counterpart, Ape2, represent a new subfamily in the ExoIII/Ape1/Apn2 family of proteins (see Fig. 1). Here, we purify the yeast Apn2 protein and show that it has an AP endonuclease activity. We also provide evidence that the Apn2 specific C terminus is not required for the AP endonuclease activity, but, interestingly, it is indispensable for thein vivo function of the protein in the repair of AP sites.DISCUSSIONYeast Apn2 and its orthologs in higher eukaryotes differ fromE. coli ExoIII and human Ape1 in possessing a C terminus that is absent from the ExoIII/Ape1 subfamily. Genetic studies in yeast have indicated that Apn1 and Apn2 constitute alternative pathways of AP site repair. The Apn1 protein has previously been shown to be an AP endonuclease (14.Johnson A.W. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18017-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we overproduce and purify the Apn2 protein from yeast and show that it has an AP endonuclease activity that cleaves the phosphodiester bond 5′ to the AP site and generates a 3′-OH and 5′-PO4 terminus. Thus, Apn2 is a class II AP endonuclease.To examine the role of the Apn2-specific C terminus in the biochemical and biological functions of the protein, we purified the Δ369 and Δ491 Apn2 proteins, which lack almost the entire C terminus and the last 29 residues of Apn2, respectively. Consistent with the presence of the motifs involved in metal binding and catalysis in the amino terminus, both C-terminally truncated proteins display nearly normal AP endonuclease activity. Interestingly, however, the C terminus is indispensable for the biological function of the protein, since expression of Δ369 protein does not elevate the repair efficiency of the apn1Δ apn2Δ strain. The carboxyl-terminal 29 residues that include the highly conserved sequence NXGRKFWXCXRXXG, however, are not needed for biological function, since expression of Δ491 protein complements the MMS sensitivity of the apn1Δ apn2Δ strain.How might the carboxyl terminus contribute to Apn2 function in vivo? Although the C-terminally deleted Apn2 protein has nearly normal AP endonuclease activity in vitro, it is possible that the C terminus modulates Apn2 activity in vivo. Because of histone and nonhistone proteins bound to DNA, and because of high compaction of DNA, the recognition of lesions could be a formidable task in vivo. Thus, in contrast to the ability of Apn2 to act upon AP sites in naked DNA in vitro, the highly compacted chromatin in vivo may necessitate that Apn2 be a part of the multiprotein complex for efficient recognition and cleavage of AP sites to occur. The Apn2 C terminus may be crucial for complex formation with other proteins, and in its absence, such a complex may not form. Such a possibility is supported from studies of nucleotide excision repair in yeast, where the repair of UV damage from the nontranscribed regions of the genome is strictly dependent upon theRAD7 and RAD16 genes (15.Verhage R. Zeeman A.-M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Gang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16.Mueller J.P. Smerdon M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3457-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vitro, however, the incision reaction can be reconstituted on UV-damaged DNA in the absence of Rad7 and Rad16 proteins (17.Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), although the addition of Rad7-Rad16 complex to the purified reconstituted system stimulates the incision reaction (18.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the absolute need for the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins is manifested in vivo but notin vitro. The Rad7-Rad16 protein complex has affinity for UV-damaged DNA, and it has been proposed that the Rad7-Rad16 complex functions in locating the damage in nontranscribed regions of DNA (18.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,19.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the damage can be recognized and incised in vitro on naked DNA without the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins, in the absence of these proteins, the search and demarcation of DNA damage may become quite inefficient in vivo.The identification of AP endonuclease activity in the yeast Apn2 protein and the demonstration that although the C terminus of the protein is not required for this activity it still is necessary for thein vivo function of the protein strongly suggest that the human Ape2 protein would also have such an activity and that the C terminus of the human protein also will be indispensable for itsin vivo function.By contrast to nucleotide excision repair, which involves the concerted action of several distinct multiprotein complexes (17.Guzder S.N.

A. 1996; 93: 10718-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), base excision repair has been thought to rely upon the sequential action of several independent enzymatic activities. For example, following the recognition and removal of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, an AP endonuclease is thought to cleave at the AP site (2.Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjorås M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 3.Wallace S. Oxidative Stress Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 49-90Google Scholar). However, the possibility that base excision repair involves a multiprotein complex is suggested by the observation that a glycosylase and an AP endonuclease may be present together in a complex with DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase I (22.Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Our studies raise the possibility that the recognition and cleavage of AP sites by Apn2 in vivo is accomplished by a multiprotein complex. Abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic; AP)1 sites are formed in DNA by spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond and from the action of DNA glycosylases on modified bases. It has been estimated that a mammalian cell loses up to 10,000 purines per day from its genome (1.Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Class II AP endonucleases cleave the phosphodiester backbone on the 5′-side of the AP site and produce a 3′-OH group and a 5′-baseless deoxyribose 5′-phosphate residue. Removal of the 5′-abasic residue followed by DNA repair synthesis and ligation completes the repair process (2.Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjorås M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 3.Wallace S. Oxidative Stress Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 49-90Google Scholar). Two families of class II AP endonucleases have been identified in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In Escherichia coli, exonuclease III (ExoIII) constitutes ∼90% of the total AP endonuclease activity, and endonuclease IV represents about 10% of the total AP endonuclease (2.Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjorås M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 3.Wallace S. Oxidative Stress Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 49-90Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Apn1 and Apn2 are the respective homologs of E. coli endonuclease IV and ExoIII (4.Popoff S.C. Spira A.I. Johnson A.W. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apn1 and Apn2 represent alternate pathways for the repair of AP sites in yeast, since the apn1Δ apn2Δ double mutant strain displays a synergistic increase in sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and the repair of AP sites is severely impaired in this mutant (6.Johnson R.E. Torres-Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Consistent with the high mutagenicity of AP sites, the frequency of MMS-induced mutations is greatly elevated in the apn1Δ apn2Δ strain (6.Johnson R.E. Torres-Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ape1, the human homolog of ExoIII, also known as Hap1, Apex, or Ref-1, is a class II AP endonuclease (8.Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9.Masuda Y. Bennett R.A.O. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The yeast Apn2 protein is unique in that it possesses a C-terminal domain that is absent from the ExoIII/Ape1 proteins (6.Johnson R.E. Torres-Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, a sequence, Ape2, has been identified in humans that possesses the C-terminal domain present inS. cerevisiae Apn2, and Ape2 also is more closely related to Apn2 than to ExoIII or Ape1. Thus, yeast Apn2 and its human counterpart, Ape2, represent a new subfamily in the ExoIII/Ape1/Apn2 family of proteins (see Fig. 1). Here, we purify the yeast Apn2 protein and show that it has an AP endonuclease activity. We also provide evidence that the Apn2 specific C terminus is not required for the AP endonuclease activity, but, interestingly, it is indispensable for thein vivo function of the protein in the repair of AP sites.

The 35-kDa protein was identified by peptide microsequence analysis as the human thioesterase II (hTE) enzyme, an enzyme previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a potential Nef-interacting protein. Immunofluorescence studies showed that hTE localizes to peroxisomes and that coexpression of Nef and hTE leads to relocalization of Nef to peroxisomes. Interaction of Nef and hTE was abolished by point mutations in Nef at residues Asp108, Leu112, Phe121, Pro122, and Asp123. All of these mutations also abrogated the ability of Nef to down-regulate CD4 from the surface of HIV-infected cells. Based on the x-ray and NMR structures of Nef, these residues define a surface on Nef critical for CD4 down-regulation. A subset of these mutations also affected the ability of Nef to down-regulate major histocompatibility complex class I. These results, taken together with previous studies, identify a region on Nef critical for most of its known functions. However, not all Nef alleles bind to hTE with high affinity, so the role of hTE during HIV infection remains uncertain.

Med. 1995; 332: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). How Nef achieves these in vivo effects is not yet clear. However, in tissue culture a number of effects of Nef have been documented. First, it enhances viral infectivity and replication in primary cells (8Miller M.D. Warmerdam M.T. Gaston I. Greene W.C.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Third, it reduces the cell surface expression of CD4, one of the cellular receptors for HIV (1Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 606-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Trono D. Cell. 1995; 82: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Cullen B.R.

The internalization and degradation of cell surface CD4 by Nef increases the infectivity of the released virion particles because CD4 interferes with incorporation of the HIV envelope protein into the virus particle (15Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 16Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Finally, Nef also down-regulates cell surface expression of MHC class I. This effect may be important for HIV immune evasion (17Cohen G.B. Gandhi R.T. Davis D.M. Mandelboim O. Chen B.K. Strominger J.L. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 18Collins K.L. Chen B.K. Kalams S.A. Walker B.D. Baltimore D.

Because Nef has no known catalytic activity, the above activities are probably mediated through interaction of Nef with host cell proteins, and several cellular proteins have been suggested to interact with Nef. For example, Nef contains a consensus SH3 domain binding sequence (PXXP) that mediates Nef association with members of the Src tyrosine kinase family (21Biggs T.E. Cooke S.J. Barton C.H. Harris M.P. Saksela K. Mann D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol.

Nef also associates with components of the endocytic machinery, β-cop, and the clathrin adaptor complex, and these interactions are important for linking CD4, through Nef, to endocytic pathways (19Le Gall S.

Biol. 1997; 4: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 31Sawai E.T. Baur A. Struble H. Peterlin B.M. Levy J.A. Cheng-Mayer C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recently, another Nef-interacting protein, human thioesterase (hTE), was cloned from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid screen (33Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Watanabe H. Shiratori T. Shoji H. Miyatake S. Okazaki Y. Ikuta K. Sato T. Saito T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). hTE belongs to a novel class of thioesterases and exhibits 42% amino acid identity with an Escherichia colithioesterase II (35Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise biological function of either hTE or its E. coli homolog is not yet clear. The best characterized thioesterases are involved in lipid metabolism; yet overexpression or deletion of the bacterial TEII enzyme in E. coli had no detectable effect on fatty acids levels (35Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Nef in modulating cell-signaling pathways, we used a Nef affinity column to purify Nef-interacting proteins from T-cell lysates. We found that hTE was the only protein in a T-cell lysate that associated with Nef with high enough affinity to be identified by peptide microsequence analysis in this screen. We then identified five point mutations in Nef that abolish binding to hTE. All of these mutations abrogated the ability of Nef to down-regulate CD4 from the surface of infected cells. Based on the x-ray and NMR structures of Nef, these mutations defined a surface on Nef critical for CD4 down-regulation. We found that part but not all of this region on Nef is also critical for Nef-induced MHC class I down-regulation. The mutagenesis analysis and in vivo immunofluorescence colocalization studies with Nef and hTE suggest that hTE plays a role during HIV infection. However, we found that not all Nef alleles bind to hTE with high affinity (e.g. SF2 Nef and SIV Mac239 Nef). Therefore, it is uncertain whether hTE binding plays a critical role in Nef function. The pGEX2T vector construct (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to express glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins of various Nef mutants. hTE cDNA containing a hexahistidine tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site was cloned into the expression vector, pRSET (Invitrogen) for expression in bacteria. Genes encoding for CD4, various Nef alleles, green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion proteins, and N-terminally Flu-tagged hTE were cloned into the pBABE retroviral expression vector (36Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) for expression in mammalian cells. Nef-GFP fusion constructs contained Nef at the 5′ end, a 12-base pair linker (GGC GGC CGC AGC) and enhanced humanized GFP (CLONTECH) at the 3′ end and are similar to a previously described construct used in Nef localization studies (28Greenberg M.E. Bronson S. Lock M. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6964-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For each residue mutated we synthesized a pair of overlapping primers where the codon to be mutated was synthesized using a mixture of all four nucleotide precursors. For example, the coding strand primer for mutating NL4–3 Nef at Asp108contained the sequence CAC TCC CAA AGA AGA CAA NNC ATC CTT GAT CTG TGG ATC (where that N indicates all four nucleotide bases were used). A separate polymerase chain reaction and ligation reaction was then done for each of the 8 residues to create a library of mutants at that residue. For each residue, 10 bacterial colonies were chosen at random and tested for association with hTE in the GST pull-down assay. Bacteria containing the hTE/pRSET plasmid were induced for hTE expression by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2–6 h. Cells were harvested, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged. The supernatant was passed over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and washed with a buffer containing 90 mm imidazole followed by elution of hTE with a buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. GST fusion proteins from bacteria were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Molecular Probes) (24Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Nef protein alone (in the absence of GST) was obtained by cleaving the thrombin cleavage site in the GST-Nef fusion protein, while the fusion protein was immobilized to the agarose beads. The eluted Nef protein was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography over a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by dialysis. This purified Nef protein was used to make a Nef affinity column using Affi-Gel beads (Bio-Rad) and for other experiments (e.g. circular dichroism) described in the text. Fresh calf thymii were washed in ice-cold PBS, cut into small pieces, and 2 volumes (weight to volume) of ice-cold buffer A (10% glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mmKCl, 1.3 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.0 mm dithiothreitol) plus 0.01% aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm KF, 0.25 mmorthovanadate, and 1 μm leupeptin were added. This mixture was pureed in a blender and sieved through a metal basket. Triton X-100 was added to 0.25%, and the mixture was stirred for 20′ at 4 °C and centrifuged 15′ at 1,500 × g, and the supernatant was passed through cheese cloth, recentrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45′, and then recentrifuged again at 80,000 × g. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.02% azide, held at 4 °C overnight, and respun at 80,000 ×g. The supernatant was then precleared by passing over an Affi-Gel bead column. Affi-Gel beads containing cross-linked Nef were then added (final concentration of Nef varied between 0.1 and 1.0 μm), and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then transferred to a column, and washes were done with Buffer A plus increasing concentrations of NaCl (up to 1.0m). Nef-associated proteins were eluted in Buffer A plus 2.0 m NaCl, concentrated by acetone precipitation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for peptide microsequence analysis. The enzyme activity of hTE was measured spectrophotometrically using Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) as described (37Smith S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Smith S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with 0.125 μg of purified hTE in a volume of 0.25 ml. An hTE radiochemical assay (37Smith S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Smith S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) contained [1-14C]palmitoyl CoA (31.4 Ci/mol) in a volume of 0.1 ml and incubations at 25 °C. The free14C palmitic acid produced was extracted and assayed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Extracts from 1.5 ml of bacteria culture expressing GST-Nef fusion proteins were prepared by sonication in 1 ml of PBS, 50 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Purified hTE (50–100 μg) was added to these crude bacterial lysates along with 10–20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads. Binding was carried out at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were spun down and washed with the binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. The human lymphoblastoid cell line 721.221 expressing CD4 and HLA-A2 (17Cohen G.B. Gandhi R.T. Davis D.M. Mandelboim O. Chen B.K. Strominger J.L. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and Bosc cells (39Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar) are as described. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and Bosc cells were transfected with various DNAs by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (39Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). HIV was generated from transfected 293 cells and HIV infection of target cells was done as described (40Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and various Nef mutants were cloned into the NL-PI vector derived from the molecular clone NL4–3 that carries the full complement of HIV genes as well as encoding for the placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) reporter gene (40Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single-round infectivity assays were performed using CD4-positive HeLa cells containing an HIV-LTR-βGal reporter (MAGI cells) (41Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat T-cells and CD4 positive 721.221 cells expressing HLA-A2 were infected with HIV-1 reporter virions encoding for PLAP. 2 days post-infection, the cells were stained for CD4, MHC class I, or PLAP expression followed by cytofluorimetry on a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN as described (17Cohen G.B. Gandhi R.T. Davis D.M. Mandelboim O. Chen B.K. Strominger J.L. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 40Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of CD4 in 293 cells was monitored after cotransfection of plasmids encoding for CD4 and various Nef mutants into 293 cells. CD4 expression levels were measured 2 days post-transfection by FACS. Nef expression levels were monitored by Western blot analysis. Nonreplication competent murine ecotropic retroviruses carrying the Nef-GFP fusion gene or Flu-tagged hTE were made using the retrovirus packaging cell line Bosc (39Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). Nef-GFP and Flu-hTE retroviruses were used either alone or together to (co)infect mouse NIH-3T3 cells. Infected 3T3 cells were grown on coverslips and stained 2 days post-infection. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed in PBS buffer, quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl/PBS, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml BSA. Cells were incubated with anti-Flu tag antibodies, washed three times, and stained with a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody. After three washes in PBS, cells were mounted on microscope slides in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mg/ml Mowiol, 25 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2.]octane, and 25% glycerol and examined under a epifluorescence microscope attached to a CCD camera or to a confocal microscope. No immunofluorescence staining was observed when secondary antibodies were used without the primary antibody or with an irrelevant primary antibody. When cell lysates from human Jurkat T-cells were applied to a GST-Nef affinity column (NL4–3 Nef allele), a 35-kDa protein bound to the column, but it did not bind to a control column containing the GST protein alone (data not shown). Because certain functions of HIV-Nef such as CD4 down-regulation can be species-independent (13Skowronski J. Parks D. Mariani R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 42Anderson S. Shugars D.C. Swanstrom R. Garcia J.V. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4923-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether a 35-kDa protein might also be found in a T-cell extract derived from calf thymus. For this experiment we used an affinity column of Nef alone covalently attached to Affi-Gel beads. Once again, only a 35-kDa protein was seen to specifically associate with the Nef affinity column but not with the control column (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 3). The protein seen at 27 kDa in lane 1 is Nef that was noncovalently attached to the column and came off when the beads alone, which had not been exposed to thymus extract, were boiled in SDS loading buffer (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5). Similarly, the proteins seen at 55 kDa in lane 1 were not derived from the T-cell extract because they were present when the beads alone were boiled in loading buffer (Fig.1 A, lanes 4 and 5), and they most likely represent dimerized Nef or residual GST-Nef from which the Nef was derived. The association of the 35-kDa protein (p35) with Nef was independent of the presence of the PxxP motif in Nef because a mutant Nef lacking the motif (P72A, P75A) (24Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), still bound to p35 (Fig.1 A, lane 2). Therefore, the 35-kDa protein probably is not binding to Nef through a SH3 domain interaction. The 35-kDa protein was purified from the calf thymus extract and subjected to peptide microsequence analysis. All seven peptide sequences obtained by peptide microsequence analysis (data not shown) were found in a single human expressed sequence tag data base clone. Using this information, we cloned the cDNA for a protein that is 42% identical to a bacterial protein called thioesterase II. This protein termed hTE was overexpressed in E. coli with a histidine tag at the N terminus of the protein. That the recombinant hTE and Nef could interact directly was then demonstrated in vitro. Purified His-tagged hTE or His-tagged HIV matrix protein (a control protein) were incubated with a bacterial cell lysate from cells expressing either GST-Nef or GST. Proteins present in the glutathione-agarose bound fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE. As shown in the Fig. 1 B, GST-Nef was able to bind hTE (lane 4) but not the HIV matrix protein (lane 3), whereas GST alone was unable to bind hTE (lane 2) or the HIV matrix protein (lane 1). Based on the intensity of staining with Coomassie blue, Nef and hTE appear to interact in an approximately stoichiometric ratio. We also investigated whether Nef can interact with the E. coli TE II homolog or rat mammary gland thioesterase II (43Naggert J. Witkowski A. Wessa B. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (rat TEII belongs to a class of thioesterases that do not share a sequence similarity to hTE). However, we found that neither of these thioesterases could interact with HIV Nef in the GST pull-down assay (data not shown). Therefore, the amino acid residues in hTE that are not conserved in the E. coli homolog are important in the interaction with HIV Nef. The homolog of hTE from E. coli hydrolyzes acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths (35Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, hTE was assessed for its ability to utilize various acyl-CoAs as substrates. Enzyme activity of hTE was measured either by a spectrophotometric assay or a radiochemical assay (37Smith S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Smith S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The hTE protein hydrolyzed acyl-CoA substrates of chain lengths C8, C10, C12, C14, and C16. The V max values for these substrates are 9, 6, 5, 8, and 8 μmol/min/mg respectively. The turnover number (k cat) of hTE with C10-CoA as a substrate is about 12-fold lower than that of E. colithioesterase II. The pH optimum for the enzyme was between pH 8.0 and 8.2, similar to that of the E. coli enzyme. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme revealed that hTE, like its E. colicounterpart, works on a broad range of acyl chain length acyl-CoAs, butKm values tend to increase with decreasing chain length. The Km value for C8, C10, C12, C14, and C16 acyl-CoA substrates is 82, 20, 4, 4, and 2 μm,respectively. Therefore, the specificity of the enzyme, as measured by V max/Km, shows a preference for longer chain fatty acids. Incubation of the purified hTE with a 7-fold excess of GST-Nef, conditions known to favor the hTE-Nef interaction, had no effect on the enzyme activity either under substrate-limiting (s < Km) or saturating (s > Km) conditions when assayed using decanoyl-CoA as a substrate (data not shown). Earlier studies had indicated that E. coli thioesterase II exists as a tetramer (35Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the subunit structure of hTE was investigated by gel filtration high pressure liquid chromatography using a Sigmachrom GFC-1300 (300 × 7.5 mm) column. We found that the oligomeric status of hTE is highly dependent on protein concentration. At 3 mg/ml hTE ran as a tetramer on a gel filtration column with no sign of any material corresponding to either a dimer or monomer of hTE. However, upon dilution to 0.5 mg/ml, hTE ran as a dimer. Both the tetrameric and dimeric forms of hTE exhibited similar enzymatic activity (data not shown). The hTE protein contains eight cysteine residues. However, because β-mercaptoethanol treated and untreated hTE both ran as a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 35 kDa when subjected to SDS-PAGE, it is unlikely that disulfide bridges contribute to the polymerization of the protein (data not shown). A previous report of Nef interaction with hTE identified a mutant, called Mut.4, that did not interact with hTE (33Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This Nef mutant contains 5 point mutations from the original Nef-LAI wild-type sequence: W57R, F68S, D123G, H166R, and L170Q. To identify residue(s) that are critical for interaction with hTE, we mutated the above residues in Nef allele NL4–3 individually and tested the resulting mutant Nef proteins for their ability to interact with hTE in a Gst-Nef pull-down assay (Fig.1 C). Except for the Nef protein carrying the mutation, D123G, all the other single Nef mutants exhibited normal interaction with hTE. We also did not detect an interaction between D123G Nef and hTE in a yeast two-hybrid screen (data not shown). Because wild-type and D123G Nef show similar CD spectra, temperature melt CD curves, and the ability to interact with the Hck SH3 domain in a GST pull-down assay (data not shown), these results suggest that this mutation does not cause a global disruption in Nef structure. Moreover, in vivo the D123G Nef mutant retains some of its Nef-associated activities (see below). The mutant D123G Nef and other Nef mutants were then cloned back into HIV strain NL4–3 (NL-PI) carrying the PLAP reporter gene. PLAP is a cell surface protein, and PLAP expression allows us to follow HIV infection of cells by flow cytometry (40Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of these various mutants to down-regulate CD4 was assessed in HIV-infected Jurkat cells. NL-PI carrying wild-type Nef alleles down-regulates CD4 rapidly in this assay. Therefore, there appears to be a direct inverse relation between PLAP expression and CD4 levels in Jurkat cells (Fig.2). However, in NL-PI carrying a frameshift in Nef, there is little CD4 down-regulation until there are high levels of PLAP expression. CD4 down-regulation in these cells is due to the synthesis of two late HIV genes, Vpu and Env (40Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F68S Nef, H166R Nef, and L170Q Nef proteins that interact with hTE were able to induce CD4 down-regulation similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. 2 and Table I). However, neither D"

The roles for specific PKC isozymes in regulating this glial response, however, are not well understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of PKC isozymes and the role of PKC-η expression in regulating cellular proliferation in two well characterized astrocytic tumor cell lines (U-1242 MG and U-251 MG) with different properties of growth in cell culture. Both cell lines expressed an array of conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (θ and ε) PKC isozymes that can be activated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Another novel PKC isozyme, PKC-η, was only expressed by U-251 MG cells. In contrast, PKC-δ was readily detected in U-1242 MG cells but was present only at low levels in U-251 MG cells. PMA (100 nm) treatment for 24 h increased cell proliferation by over 2-fold in the U-251 MG cells, whereas it decreased the mitogenic response in the U-1242 MG cells by over 90%. When PKC-η was stably transfected into U-1242 MG cells, PMA increased cell proliferation by 2.2-fold, similar to the response of U-251 MG cells. The cell proliferation induced by PMA in both the U-251 MG and U-1242-PKC-η cells was blocked by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (0.5 μm) and the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059 (50 μm).

Tight regulation of PKC activity may control neoplastic glial proliferation (5.Baltuch G.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.-G. Yong V.W. Can. J. Neurol.

The activities of both the conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (μ, θ, ε, η, and δ) PKC isozymes are regulated by phorbol esters, diacylglycerols, and phospholipids. Conventional PKC isozymes require Ca2+ for activity, whereas novel PKC and atypical (λ, ζ) PKC isozymes are Ca2+-independent (11.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). The atypical PKC isozymes are not activated by diacylglycerol, a product of receptor-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis (12.Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of PKC in various cell types may lead to the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation pathways, the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and c-fos induction, all of which may increase cellular proliferation (13.Kaneki M.

Neurosci. 1995; 17: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involving PKC isozymes in neural cell types are not well understood.Both human and experimental rodent gliomas express multiple classes of PKC isozymes, including PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, -θ, -η, and -ζ (17.Luo W. Sharif T.R. Houghton P.J. Sharif M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1225-1240PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Mishima K Ohno S. Shitara N. Yamaoka K. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19424-19430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In cultured human and rat glioma cells, the differential expression of specific isozymes accompanies alterations in both proliferative activity and phenotypic differentiation that are related to specific cell lineages. Despite the putative role(s) of PKC signaling in the invasive growth of gliomas, there are conflicting data as to how specific PKC isozyme(s) may affect this malignant growth (22.Zellner A. Fetell M.R. Bruce J.N. De Vivo D.C. O'Driscoll K.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1797-1802PubMed Google Scholar). Although most studies have focused on the role of conventional PKC isozymes, particularly PKC-α, with reports of either increasing proliferation or blocking apoptosis in malignant astrocytic tumor cells, the differential expression of nonconventional PKC isozymes may account for the apparent contradictory biologic effects of phorbol ester treatment or the experimental overexpression of different PKC isozymes (23.Guizzetti M. Wei M. Costa L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 359: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The relationship between the expression of a specific novel PKC isozyme and increased proliferative capacity in glioblastomas was examined in two well characterized glioblastoma cell lines with different growth phenotypes and opposite patterns of [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to PMA treatment. Stable expression of PKC-η in a glioblastoma cell line not expressing this isozyme converted the transfectants into a PMA growth-stimulated phenotype. These data suggest that the different profiles of PKC isozymes may determine the type of biologic response to cytokines and other mitogenic stimuli acting via PKC signaling pathways. The differential expression of PKC-η appears to determine the proliferative response of glioblastoma cells to PMA and thus may play a role in mediating the invasive growth of glioblastomas.DISCUSSIONAlthough previous studies have strongly implicated PKC in regulating the growth of glioblastomas (5.Baltuch G.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.-G. Yong V.W. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1995; 22: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30.Sharif T.R. Sharif M. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 14 (135): 327PubMed Google Scholar), there are conflicting data as to how it regulates the malignant phenotype(s) of a high proliferative rate and cellular invasiveness (22.Zellner A. Fetell M.R. Bruce J.N. De Vivo D.C. O'Driscoll K.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1797-1802PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Baltuch G.H. Yong V.W.

Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The differential expression of PKC isozymes, each mediating diverse biologic functions, could account for the contrasting effects of phorbol esters on specific biologic activities in astrocytic tumors (33.Szaniawska B. Maternicka K. Kowalczyk D. Miloszewska J. Janik P. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34.Pollack I.F. Randall M.S. Kristofik M.P. Kelly R.H. Selker R.G.

Neurosurg. 1990; 73: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise, this PKC isozyme diversity also could account for the apparently different cellular responses following the expression or overexpression of specific PKC isozymes (18.Mishima K Ohno S. Shitara N. Yamaoka K. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17.Luo W. Sharif T.R. Houghton P.J. Sharif M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The responses of glioblastomas to therapy with relatively nonspecific PKC inhibitors in several clinical trials have been ambiguous. These outcomes suggested that the in situ growth of only certain, as yet undefined, tumor subgroups may be sensitive to the disruption of PKC signaling (23.Guizzetti M. Wei M. Costa L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 359: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37.Pollack I.F. DaRosso R.C. Robertson P.L. Jakacki R.L. Mirro Jr, J.R. Blatt J. Nicholson S. Packer R.J. Allen J.C. Cisneros A. Jordan V.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1109-1115PubMed Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies with both human glioma and experimental rodent tumor cell lines have demonstrated that specific PKC isozymes may selectively affect astrocytic tumor growth. PKC-α has been implicated in proliferation or suppression of apoptosis (19.Shen L. Glazer R.I Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A role for PKC-γ in augmenting anchorage-independent growth in cell culture has also been suggested (18.Mishima K Ohno S. Shitara N. Yamaoka K. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Regulation of human astrocyte proliferation or apoptosis by the novel isozymes has not been clearly defined. PKC-ε appeared to affect the initial exit from the G0/G1 phase in human 132–1N1 astrocytoma cells (38.Couldwell W.T. Hinton D.R. Surnock A.A. DeGiorgio C.M. Weiner L.P. Apuzzo M.L. Masri L. Law R.E. Weiss M.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 619-622PubMed Google Scholar), but PKC-α played the major determinant role for proliferation. PKCδ overexpression decreased anchorage-independent growth in U-251 MG but did not affect basal or growth factor-stimulated proliferation (18.Mishima K Ohno S. Shitara N. Yamaoka K. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).We have found that both U-251 MG and U-1242 MG cells expressed PKC-α, -βI, -βII, -δ, and -θ but that PKC-η was expressed only in the invasive U-251 MG cells (Fig. 1). Treatment of the cells with PMA for 24–48 h caused a decrease in expression of all isozymes, except that PKC-βII and PKC-η were up-regulated in the U-251 cells (Figs.1 and 2). Prior to the decrease in isozyme expression detectable by Western blotting, some increase in expression was observed for most of the isozymes. The peak in expression tended to occur earlier (∼2 h after PMA stimulation) for the classical, Ca2+-dependent isozymes and later (∼6–16 h) for the novel, Ca2+-independent isozymes.There is also a trend for PMA-induced up-regulation of PKC-η or for the absence of down-regulation in other cell types. Unique up-regulation of PKC-η has been noted previously in interleukin 2-producing EL4 mouse thymoma cells (12.Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar), in murine keratinocytes (39.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yupsa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar), and in breast cancer lines (40.Basu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the lack of down-regulation was observed also in A431 human epidermal carcinoma cells (41.Greif H. Ben-Chaim J. Shimon T. Bechor E. Eldar H. Livneh E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Basu (40.Basu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) observed down-regulation of PKC-η after treatment of MCF-7 cells with BIM, but we did not see a BIM-induced down-regulation of PKC-η expression in the astrocytic cell lines (data not shown). In the astrocytic tumor cells studied here, it is notable that each cell line appears to up-regulate one classical isozyme and one novel isozyme significantly; but the predominant up-regulated isozymes differ: PKC-βI and PKC-η in U-251 MG cells and PKCα and PKC-δ in U-1242 MG cells. This may indicate involvement of different classes of isozymes in different phases of a biologic response and may suggest that other members of a class may mediate analogous early or late functions.The biologic responses of U-251 MG and U-1242 MG cells to PMA differ. U-251 MG cells are growth-stimulated by PMA, whereas U-1242 MG cells are growth-inhibited (Fig. 3). The general PKC inhibitor BIM blocked the PMA-induced growth stimulation or growth-inhibition (Fig. 3), suggesting that PKC is responsible for both effects. The opposing effects may be attributable to the different isozymes expressed. Stable expression of PKC-η in the U-1242 MG cells (Fig. 4) converted the PMA response from growth inhibition to growth stimulation like that of the U-251 cells (Fig. 5). The PMA-induced proliferative response in wild type U-251 MG cells was also completely blocked by PKC-η phosphorothioate oligonucleotide antisense (Fig. 6). These results further argue for involvement of PKC-η in the growth stimulatory response of the malignant astrocytic tumor cells to PMA. Although expression of PKC-η correlates with a proliferative response of the astrocytoma cells, these isoform-specific trends are not present in different cell types. In EL4 thymoma cells, PKC-θ has been associated with growth stimulatory responses (12.Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Alterman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PKC-η has been implicated in morphological changes of EL4 cells (42.Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Alterman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NIH3T3 fibroblasts (44.Livneh E. Shimon T. Bechor E. Doki Y. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1545-1555PubMed Google Scholar). There are no significant morphological differences between U-1242 MG cells and the U-1242-PKC-η clone, but the U-251 MG and U-1242 MG cells are morphologically different. U-1242 MG monolayer cultures show contact inhibition at confluence, whereas U-251 MG cells do not.A doublet of PKC-η-immunoreactive bands was detected in the U-251 MG cells, whereas only the lower band was present in the U-1242 MG cells that were transfected with the PKC-η expression construct. Similar differences have been described previously in other cell lines. A doublet of PKC-η-reactive bands was present in EL4 thymoma cells that were responsive to phorbol esters (12.Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Resnick M.S. Kang B-S. Luu D. Wickham J.T. Sando J.J. Hahn C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27654-27661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), whereas only the lower band of PKC-η was observed in phorbol ester-resistant EL4 cells that had been infected with a Sinbis viral construct expressing PKC-η. The relationship between the doublet bands is not clear. These may represent differences in phosphorylation, alternatively spliced forms, or even closely related isozymes. Correlation of the growth response of U-1242 MG cells with expression of the lower molecular weight PKC-η-reactive band suggests that the protein of lower molecular mass is responsible for the mitogenic effects of PMA in these gliobalstoma cells.The signaling pathways by which PKC-η may up-regulate cell proliferation in human glioblastomas is not yet clear. In many cell types, the MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in the PMA-induced growth stimulatory response (45.Slevin M. Krupinski J. Kumar S. Gaffney J. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 987-1003PubMed Google Scholar). The MAP kinase pathway is stimulated by PMA in the astrocytic tumor cells as indicated by phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinases after PMA treatment and its blockade by both the PKC inhibitor BIM and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 6). The MEK inhibitor also diminished the proliferative response. Although PKC-η may be sufficient for MAP kinase activation, it is not exclusively essential because MAP kinase phosphorylation occurred in the U-1242 MG cells that lack PKC-η. The growth inhibition of U-1242 MG cells even with this ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation argues that MAP kinase activation is not sufficient for a growth stimulatory response to PMA in this cell line. One possibility is that other PKC isozymes expressed by both U-251 MG and U-1242 MG may account for the MAP kinase phosphorylation but that these isozymes do not significantly mediate cell proliferation in astrocytomas or affect it only when PKC-η also is expressed. A second possibility could be that another isozyme, such as PKC-δ, which is present at higher levels in U-1242 MG cells, blocks the proliferative response of MAP kinase activation, unless PKC-η is co-expressed. The latter is consistent with the results of Mishimaet al. (18.Mishima K Ohno S. Shitara N. Yamaoka K. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), in which overexpression of PKC-δ decreased anchorage-independent growth (46.Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).EGF is another potent mitogen for astrocytoma cells and induces proliferation of both U-1242 MG and U-251 MG cells. EGF can activate PKC, but the proliferative response of U-1242 MG cells argues against the involvement of PKC-η in the EGF effect. The effectiveness of EGF but not phorbol esters to induce a mitogenic response in U-1242 MG cells may suggest involvement of non-PKC pathways, such as tyrosine kinase activation, in EGF-induced mitogenesis and/or possibly atypical PKCs that are not activated by phorbol ester.The functional characterization of PKC isozymes in human astrocytic tumors (17.Luo W.

Animal cell lines may also have limited utility in the study of specific isozyme-associated biologic responses in human cells because these responses appear to differ between human and rodent cells (48.Hoffman J. Whittle S. Toews M. J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signaling. 1996; 13: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the overexpression of PKC-η combined with the use of inhibitors and oligonucleotide antisense has implicated this novel PKC isozyme in PMA-induced proliferative activity. PKC-η has a more limited tissue distribution than do many of the isozymes that have been previously implicated in up-regulating glial proliferation, with minimal expression in normal brain (49.Osada S.

Tight regulation of PKC activity may control neoplastic glial proliferation (5.Baltuch G.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.-G. Yong V.W. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1995; 22: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PKC is a family of ubiquitous phospholipid-dependent enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways associated with a variety of cellular responses including cell growth and differentiation, gene expression, hormone secretion, and membrane function (6.Nishizuka Y.

The activities of both the conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (μ, θ, ε, η, and δ) PKC isozymes are regulated by phorbol esters, diacylglycerols, and phospholipids. Conventional PKC isozymes require Ca2+ for activity, whereas novel PKC and atypical (λ, ζ) PKC isozymes are Ca2+-independent (11.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). The atypical PKC isozymes are not activated by diacylglycerol, a product of receptor-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis (12.Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of PKC in various cell types may lead to the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation pathways, the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and c-fos induction, all of which may increase cellular proliferation (13.Kaneki M.

Neurosci. 1995; 17: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involving PKC isozymes in neural cell types are not well understood. Both human and experimental rodent gliomas express multiple classes of PKC isozymes, including PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, -θ, -η, and -ζ (17.Luo W. Sharif T.R. Houghton P.J. Sharif M.

In cultured human and rat glioma cells, the differential expression of specific isozymes accompanies alterations in both proliferative activity and phenotypic differentiation that are related to specific cell lineages. Despite the putative role(s) of PKC signaling in the invasive growth of gliomas, there are conflicting data as to how specific PKC isozyme(s) may affect this malignant growth (22.Zellner A. Fetell M.R. Bruce J.N. De Vivo D.C. O'Driscoll K.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1797-1802PubMed Google Scholar). Although most studies have focused on the role of conventional PKC isozymes, particularly PKC-α, with reports of either increasing proliferation or blocking apoptosis in malignant astrocytic tumor cells, the differential expression of nonconventional PKC isozymes may account for the apparent contradictory biologic effects of phorbol ester treatment or the experimental overexpression of different PKC isozymes (23.Guizzetti M. Wei M. Costa L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 359: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The relationship between the expression of a specific novel PKC isozyme and increased proliferative capacity in glioblastomas was examined in two well characterized glioblastoma cell lines with different growth phenotypes and opposite patterns of [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to PMA treatment. Stable expression of PKC-η in a glioblastoma cell line not expressing this isozyme converted the transfectants into a PMA growth-stimulated phenotype. These data suggest that the different profiles of PKC isozymes may determine the type of biologic response to cytokines and other mitogenic stimuli acting via PKC signaling pathways. The differential expression of PKC-η appears to determine the proliferative response of glioblastoma cells to PMA and thus may play a role in mediating the invasive growth of glioblas"
https://openalex.org/W2064991645,"Inhibitor-2 (I-2) is the regulatory subunit of a cytosolic type 1 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP1) and potently inhibits the activity of the free catalytic subunit (CS1). Previous work from the laboratory had proposed that the interaction of I-2 with CS1 involved multiple sites (Park, I. K., and DePaoli-Roach, A. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28919–28928). The present study refines the earlier analysis and arrives at a more detailed model for the interaction between I-2 and CS1. Although the NH2-terminal I-2 regions containing residues 1–35 and 1–64 have no inhibitory activity on their own, they increase the IC50 for I-2 by ∼30-fold, indicating the presence of a CS1-interacting site. Based on several experimental approaches, we have also identified the sequence Lys144-Leu-His-Tyr147 as a second site of interaction that corresponds to the RVXF motif present in many CS1-binding proteins. The peptide I-2(135–151) significantly increases the IC50 for I-2 and attenuates CS1 inhibition. Replacement of Leu and Tyr with Ala abolishes the ability to counteract inhibition by I-2. The I-2(135–151) peptide, but not I-2(1–35), also antagonizes inhibition of CS1 by DARPP-32 in a pattern similar to that of I-2. Furthermore, a peptide derived from the glycogen-binding subunit, RGL/GM(61–80), which contains a consensus CS1-binding motif, completely counteracts CS1 inhibition by I-2 and DARPP-32. The NH2-terminal 35 residues of I-2 bind to CS1 at a site that is specific for I-2, whereas the KLHY sequence interacts with CS1 at a site shared with other interacting proteins. Other results suggest the presence of yet more sites of interaction. A model is presented in which multiple “anchoring interactions” serve to position a segment of I-2 such that it sterically occludes the catalytic pocket but need not make high affinity contacts itself.

Only one CS1-binding protein is found in any given holoenzyme, suggesting that the interaction with regulatory subunits is mutually exclusive. I-2 associates with CS1 to form the ATP-Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatase whose activity is regulated by the phosphorylation of I-2 (3Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

I-2 has two key properties, it inhibits free CS1 and it controls the cyclic inactivation/activation of CS1 in the ATP-Mg2+-dependent phosphatase complex. Inhibition occurs rapidly and leaves the CS1 in its “active” conformation even though its activity is blocked. Inactivation is slower and involves conversion of CS1 to an inactive conformation. The inactive CS1·I-2 complex can be reactivated through phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr72 by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (27DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Cohen P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18352-18358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). I-2 can also be phosphorylated on Ser86 by casein kinase II. This phosphorylation alone does not activate the complex but enhances the effect of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (27DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Park I.K. Roach P. Bondor J. Fox S.P. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in our laboratory have indicated that different domains of I-2 are involved in inhibition, inactivation, and reactivation of the phosphatase (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the NH2-terminal 35 residues of I-2 increased the IC50 by two orders of magnitude, suggesting a role in inhibition. Within this domain, residues 10–13 (IKGI) were recently implicated in inhibition (32Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shih S.R. Tsay H.J. Li H.C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The region surrounding Thr72was shown to be important for the inactivation of CS1, and the COOH-terminal region of I-2 may be required for reactivation of the inactive CS1·I-2 complex (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of these domains individually was not sufficient to disrupt complex formation. In contrast to I-2, I-1 and DARPP-32 require phosphorylation at a threonine residue by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase for inhibitory activity (21Shenolikar S. Sem. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D961-D972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14491-14497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CS1 is also inhibited by a number of naturally occurring toxins, including okadaic acid, microcystin, calyculin A, and tautomycin (34Holmes C.F. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CS1α complexed with microcystin has provided a basis to understand the mechanism by which the toxin interacts at the active site to block access of the substrates (35Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Genetic and mutagenesis studies have implicated the β12-β13 loop of CS1 in inhibition by both toxins and protein inhibitors (36Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, although structurally different, the natural toxins bind to CS1 at a site that is shared or overlaps with that of the protein inhibitors, explaining their mutual competition (38Picking W.D. Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10280-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39MacKintosh C. Beattie K.A. Klumpp S. Cohen P. Codd G.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Although there is no extensive sequence homology among the different CS1 regulatory subunits, biochemical and crystallographic studies and peptide library screening have identified a consensus (K/R)(V/I)X(F/W) motif that is present in a number of CS1-binding proteins (40Johnson D.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), including the glycogen-, myosin-, and nuclear-targeting subunits, I-1 and DARPP-32. The crystal structure of CS1 complexed with a 13-amino acid peptide containing this motif showed that the residues RRVSFA occupy a hydrophobic groove, opposite to the catalytic site, flanked by a negatively charged region that accommodates the NH2-terminal basic residues in the peptide (41Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). DARPP-32 and I-1 contain the sequence KIQF, similar to RVXF, and the interaction of the KIQF motif in I-1 and DARPP-32 with CS1 is essential for inhibition (43Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 44Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Multiple sites of interaction have recently been shown also for NIPP-1, in which the RVXF and a flanking basic inhibitory sequence appear to be required to stabilize the association with CS1 (45Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to what was originally proposed for I-2 (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the notion has evolved that the association of inhibitory proteins with CS1 involves multiple contacts. No sequence analogous to the consensus RVXF motif has been reported for I-2. However, the fact that I-2 and other regulatory subunits are mutually exclusive for CS1 binding (46Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 47Alessi D.R. Street A.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and that a DARPP-32 peptide containing the KIQF could antagonize CS1 inhibition by I-2 (44Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggested that I-2 may contain a similar sequence. In this study we provide evidence that residues Lys144-Leu-His-Tyr147, serve this role in I-2. Comparison of the effects of various peptides on CS1 inhibition by I-2 and DARPP-32 indicates that the NH2 terminus of I-2 interacts with CS1 at a site that is unique for I-2, whereas the KLHY sequence interacts with CS1 at a site that is common to RGLand DARPP-32 and most likely other CS1-binding proteins. Evidence is also presented for the existence of additional sites in I-2 that interact with CS1. The implication is that interaction of the various binding subunits involves shared as well as unique sites that may be important for the diverse mechanisms by which different regulatory proteins control enzyme activity. Glycogen phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, and CS1 were purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (27DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

The Cβ catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Uhler (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI).

Two mutant I-2 peptides, I-2(135–151)L145A/Y147A, in which both Leu145and Tyr147 were replaced by Ala, and I-2(135–151)F139A, where Phe139 was substituted by Ala, were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources, Colorado State University. Radionuclides were from NEN Life Science Products. General chemicals were from Life Technologies, Inc., Sigma, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Bio-Rad. The coordinates of the CS1 and RGL peptide complex were kindly provided by Dr. David Barford (Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom). CS1α and γ cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. CS1α cDNA was synthesized from rabbit skeletal muscle total RNA, using SUPERSCRIPTTM II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Oligonucleotides 5′-GCCCATATGTCCGACAGCGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CCCGTCGACTATTTCTTGGCTTTG-3′ were used as the 5′-primer and 3′-primer, respectively. CS1γ cDNA was amplified from rat liver total cDNA (CLONTECH), using oligonucleotides 5′-ACGCATATGGCGGATATCGATAAA-3′ as the 5′-primer and 5′-AGTGTCGACTATTTCTTTGCTTGC-3′ as the 3′-primer. An NdeI site was engineered at the ATG start codon in the 5′-primers, and a SalI site was introduced after the TAG stop codon in the 3′-primers (sites areunderlined). The polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned into pCR II vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The CS1α and γ cDNA fragments were then excised and inserted into the pTacTac vector (48Browner M.F. Rasor P. Tugendreich S. Fletterick R.J. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) at the NdeI and SalI sites. Protein expression and purification were performed by modification of published procedures (49Zhang Z. Bai G. Deans-Zirattu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity, greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE, with a specific activity for both CS1α and γ of 13,000–18,000 units/mg. The wild type I-2, the COOH-terminally truncated mutant, I-2(1–145), and the NH2-terminally truncated I-2, I-2(36–204), were prepared as described previously (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs for the I-2 NH2-terminal polypeptides I-2(1–64), I-2(1–75), and I-2(1–114) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction, using I-2·pET8d as template (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification utilized a common 5′-oligonucleotide primer and different 3′-primers. The 5′-primer was 5′-TACATATGGGCTCCATGGCGGCCTCGACGG-3′ (NcoI siteunderlined); the three 3′-oligonucleotides for the different fragments were 5′-TCGCTCAGCTATAAACCATAGTCTTTGTCTGC-3′ for I-2(1–64), 5′-CCGCTCAGCTAATGGTAAGGAGTGCTTGGTT-3′ for I-2(1–75), and 5′-TGGCTCAGCTACCGATACTTTGGCTCTGAG-3′ for I-2(1–114) (Bpu1102 I site underlined). The amplified DNAs were subcloned into the pCRII vector and sequenced. The NcoI-Bpu1102 I fragments were then cloned into pET8c vector. The I-2 mutants, I-2(F139A), in which Phe139was mutated to Ala, and I-2(L145A/Y147A), in which both Leu145 and Tyr147 were replaced by Ala, were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (50Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R., M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar) using I-2·pET8d as template. The set of primers for mutating Phe139 to Ala were the 5′-primer 5′-GCGACAAGCTGAAATGAAAAGG-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-CATTTCAGCTTGTCGCTTTTTTTC-3′. The primers for replacing both Leu145 and Tyr147 with Ala were the 5′-primer 5′-GGAAGGCTCACGCCAATGAAGGACTA-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-CATTGGCGTGAGCCTTCCTTTTCATT-3′. The altered codons are underlined. The full-length I-2 mutant cDNAs were cloned into the pET21d vector (Novagene), and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression in Escherichia coli was carried out as described (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used for induction of I-2(F139A) and I-2(L145A/Y147A). Proteins were purified to homogeneity by the previously reported procedure (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Dr. Tania Barshevsky at New England Biolabs. Briefly, the heat-treated cell lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the cleared extract was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose fast flow column. After extensive washing with buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 50 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol) plus 0.05 mNaCl, the column was developed with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.45m NaCl in buffer A (200 ml). Fractions containing the I-2 protein were combined, dialyzed against buffer A, and then applied onto a Toyopearl AF-Heparin-650 M column. The column was washed with buffer A plus 0.04 m NaCl, and the bound proteins were eluted with a 0.04–0.4 m NaCl linear gradient in buffer A (200 ml). I-2(1–64) and I-2(1–75) were purified directly by AF-Heparin-650M chromatography, using conditions similar to those described above. Fractions containing I-2 proteins were stored at −80 °C. All I-2 polypeptides were purified to near homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, B and C). DARPP-32 was phosphorylated in 0.1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 16 μm of DARPP-32, 2 μm of Cβ catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by inactivation of the enzyme at 100 °C for 10 min. The sample was then diluted with 0.1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol and extensively dialyzed against the same buffer to remove the unreacted ATP. The phosphorylation level was determined in a parallel reaction containing [γ-32P]ATP. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was ∼1 mol/mol. Phosphatase activity was measured as described previously (30Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of either I-2 or DARPP-32 and in combination with various peptides. CS1 purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (29Wang Q.M. Guan K.L. Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18352-18358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used in most of the studies, because, unlike recombinant CS1, it does not require Mn2+ for activity, which could interfere with the inhibition assays. Furthermore, the native but not the recombinant CS1 is inhibited effectively by I-1 (51Endo S. Connor J.H. Forney B. Zhang L. Ingebritsen T.S. Lee E.Y. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6986-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of peptides on the I-2 IC50, fixed concentrations of the peptide and varied amounts of I-2 were preincubated with CS1 at 30 °C for 5 min. The phosphatase reaction was then initiated by the addition of [32P]phosphorylase a (300–4000 cpm/pmol) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 17% trichloroacetic acid. To evaluate the antagonistic effect of the peptides, fixed amounts of I-2 (4 nm) or phosphorylated DARPP-32 (2 nm), which inhibit CS1 by ∼70–75%, were preincubated with CS1 and various concentrations of peptides at 30 °C for 5 min. Phosphatase activity was then measured as described above. The effect of the peptides was expressed either as their ability to alter the IC50 for I-2 or by their ability to release CS1 inhibition by I-2 or DARPP-32. One unit of phosphorylase phosphatase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 nmol of phosphate/min at 30 °C. CS1·I-2 complexes were formed by incubating recombinant CS1 and I-2 proteins at a 1:1.3 ratio for 40 min at room temperature. Incubation was in the presence or absence of a ∼100-fold molar excess of I-2(1–35), a ∼200-fold molar excess of I-2-(135–151), or a combination of the two peptides. To detect the effect of microcystin-LR on complex formation, CS1 was preincubated with a 2-fold excess of I-2 for 40 min before the addition of microcystin at a concentration equimolar to I-2. All samples were analyzed by native PAGE performed similarly to Laemmli SDS-PAGE (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) except that SDS was omitted, and both stacking and separating gel buffer were at pH 8.8. Gels were run at low voltage (100 V) with cold buffer or at 4 °C to prevent heat denaturation of the proteins. Different forms of I-2 were separated on 13% Tricine-SDS-PAGE (53Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20) for 2 h before overnight incubation with 4 μg/ml of purified recombinant CS1α at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated with anti-CS1α peptide antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After treatment with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-anti-chicken secondary antibodies, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The structure of CS1 complexed with the RGLpeptide (41Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) was utilized as the starting point for modeling the I-2 KLHY tetrapeptide bound to CS1. The program O (54Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) was used to change the amino acid side chains on the RGL peptide to those of the I-2 peptide. A library of standard amino acid side chain rotomers was used to find the best conformation of each mutated residue within the complex. Two amino acid side chains (Leu243 and Leu289) in the catalytic subunit were also rotated using the standard library to more commonly observed side chain rotomers to complement better the binding of the Leu side chain on the I-2 peptide. No atomic contacts with distances less than 2.6 Å are found in the modeled complex. The backbone atoms in both the catalytic subunit and the bound RGL peptide were not altered during this modeling study. No energy minimization of the resulting CS1·I-2 complex was performed since the complex closely resembled that found for the RGL complex and no unfavorable contacts were produced by the amino acid substitutions in the RGL peptide. Concentrations of CS1α and γ, DARPP-32, and I-2 polypeptides were determined by the method of Bradford (55Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Peptide concentrations based on weight were confirmed by quantitative amino acid analysis performed in the Department of Biochemist"

The goal of this study was to determine the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family in regulation of SM-α-actin expression. AVP activated all three MAP kinase family members: ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinase. Inhibition of JNKs or p38 decreased AVP-stimulated SM-α-actin promoter activity, whereas inhibition of ERKs had no effect. A 150-base pair region of the promoter containing two CArG boxes was sufficient to mediate regulation by vasoconstrictors. Mutations in either CArG box decreased AVP-stimulated promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides corresponding to either CArG box resulted in a complex of similar mobility whose intensity was increased by AVP. Antibodies against serum response factor (SRF) completely super-shifted this complex, indicating that SRF binds to both CArG boxes. Overexpression of SRF increased basal promoter activity, but activity was still stimulated by AVP. AVP stimulation rapidly increased SRF phosphorylation. These data indicate that both JNKs and p38 participate in regulation of SM- α-actin expression.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 2.Campbell J.H. Tachas G. Black M.J. Cockerill G. Campbell G.R. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1991; 86: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar). During normal development VSMC undergo continuous differentiation from a proliferative phenotype, characteristic of embryonic and neonatal vessels, to a non-proliferating contractile phenotype associated with adult vessels. Smooth muscle α-actin (SM-α-actin) is probably the earliest marker of this process, and quantitative changes in SM-α-actin expression occur during development (3.Owens G.K. Wise G. Agents Actions Suppl. 1997; 48: 3-24PubMed Google Scholar). In pathophysiologic settings such as atherosclerotic lesions (4.Ross R. Wight T.N. Strandness E. Thiele B. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 114: 79-93PubMed Google Scholar) or following creation of intimal lesions by balloon catheterization, a subpopulation of VSMC undergo a phenotypic conversion to acquire many of the characteristics of neonatal SMC. This modulation of phenotype is associated with a decrease in expression of SM-α-actin and increases in non-muscle β-actin expression (5.Gabbiani G. Kocher O. Bloom W.S. Vanderkerckhove J. Weber K. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is presumed that modulation of VSMC phenotype is mediated through activation of specific signal transduction pathways that act on transcription factors. In cultured VSMC, increases in SM-α-actin expression are observed in response to specific agonists. Vasoconstrictors such as arginine vasopressin (AVP) or angiotensin II (6.Geisterfer A.A.T.

Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and others (11.Hautmann M.B. Thompson M.M. Swartz E.A. Olson E.N. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that a 150-base pair region of the rat SM-α-actin promoter is sufficient to mediate induction by vasoconstrictors in VSMC. This region contains two CC(A/T)6GG elements, known as CArG boxes: CArG-B (−121 to −112) and CArG-A (−71 to −62). Multiple CArG boxes have been identified in promoters of muscle-specific genes including skeletal and cardiac α-actin (12.Muscat G.E.O. Gustafson T.A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4120-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13.MacLellan W.R. Lee T.-C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A CArG box also forms the core of the serum response element, controlling induction of c-fos. Serum response factor (SRF), a member of the MADS family of transcription factors (15.Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), binds to the CArG box in the c-fos promoter (16.Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) as well as to CArG boxes in promoters of muscle-specific genes (17.Lee T.-C. Chow K.-L. Fang P. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

Induction of c-fos by mitogens involves formation of a ternary complex between DNA, SRF, and ternary complex factor (TCF), a member of theets family of transcription factors (20.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ternary complex factor (TCF) by members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family is critical for formation of this complex (21.Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1994; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Although SRF binding to CArG boxes in promoters of muscle-specific genes appears to be required for increased expression (17.Lee T.-C. Chow K.-L. Fang P. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Boxer L.M. Miwa T. Gustafson T.A. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1284-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Shimuzu R.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), these genes are generally repressed by mitogenic stimuli. Conversely, induction of these genes during phenotypic modulation is often associated with withdrawal from the cell cycle and growth arrest. The mechanism whereby SRF acts on these two opposing patterns of gene expression remains to be determined but is likely to involve interactions with other transcriptional factors mediated through specific signaling pathways. Earlier work from our laboratory showed that induction of SM-α-actin promoter activity by AVP is mediated through members of the Gq family of trimeric G-proteins (22.Higashita R. Li L. Van Putten V. Yamamura M. Zarinetchi F. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25845-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies implicated a role for MAP kinase in this regulation. Three major MAP kinase families have been described: extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs),the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAP kinase family (23.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 24.Takahashi E. Berk B.C. Acta Physiol.

Each of these is activated by specific upstream kinases: MKK1/2 for extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), MKK4/7 for JNKs, and MKK3/6 for p38 MAP kinase. Expression of dominant negative MKK4 inhibited the induction of the SM-α-actin promoter by vasoconstrictors (22.Higashita R. Li L. Van Putten V. Yamamura M. Zarinetchi F. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25845-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the role of other members of the MAP kinase family has not been examined in detail. The goal of the present study was to determine the role of the MAP kinase family in regulation of SM-α-actin expression and identify transcription factors that may mediate this effect. The expression plasmid for SRF was a gift of Dr. Michael Gilman (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). Full-length SRF was made as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, cut withXbaI and BamHI, and inserted into pCGN cut withXbaI and BamHI. The phospho-specific antibody against SRF was a gift of Dr. Michael Greenberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and specifically recognizes SRF phosphorylated at serine 103 (26.Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Antibody against SRF used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) super-shift assays was purchased from Santa Cruz Pharmaceuticals (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat VSMC were isolated and cultured as described previously (27.Caramelo C. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28.Meyer-Lehnert H.

Briefly, thoracic aortas were dissected from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) and incubated in Eagle's MEM containing 2 mg/ml collagenase for 1 h at 37 °C. The adventitia was removed, and the aortas were minced and incubated in the MEM collagenase solution at 37 °C for 2 h. The isolated cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104cells/ml culture media (Eagle's MEM containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum) in 35-mm culture dishes. Cells were passed by trypsinization and used between passage numbers 3 to 9. mRNA was isolated from VSMC using the Promega poly(A)tract 1000 kit. Reverse transcription-PCR reactions were performed using primers specific for individual JNK isoforms: JNK1 5′ primer, GCAGCTTATGATGCTATTCTTGAA; 3′ primer, TGGATGCTGAGAGCCATTGAT; JNK2 5′ primer, GCTGCATTTGATACAGTTCTTGG; 3′ primer, GATCGATGAAGACTGAGAAGGAG; JNK3 5′ primer, AAACATTACAACATGAGCAAAAGCAA(A/T)GT; 3′ primer, TGGGAAGAGTTTGGGGAAGGTGAG. The resultant PCR products were confirmed to be the appropriate JNK isoform by direct sequencing. Inhibitory forms of JNKs in which the TPY sequence required for activation by upstream kinases was replaced by APF were prepared as described previously (29.Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins consisting of MKK7 fused to specific JNK isoforms were prepared as described previously (30.Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol.

VSMC grown to 80–90% confluence in 60-mm dishes were made quiescent by incubation with Eagle's MEM plus 0.2% FCS for 12 h. Cells were stimulated with AVP (10−7m) for the indicated time. Lysates were prepared by harvesting cells in 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate). Solubilized proteins were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatant protein was quantified by the Bradford assay. For immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-p38MAPK antibody (Santa Cruz Pharmaceutical) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with 1 ml of lysis buffer and 2 times with 1 ml of PAN buffer, pH 7.0 (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl). The beads were then suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 200 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μmNa3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, and a recombinant fragment of ATF-21–96 (Santa Cruz) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with 2× Laemmli buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with quantification of activity by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. A genomic clone of the 765-base pair rat SM-α-actin promoter was isolated and ligated into a promoterless luciferase vector (PA3-Luc) or the pCAT Basic vector (Promega, CATACT(−713/52)) as described previously (10.Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For studies examining signaling pathways, VSMC were transiently transfected using electroporation with 15 μg of the SM-α-actin-luciferase construct together with 5 μg of a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector (CLONTECH) and 5 μg of plasmids encoding signaling enzymes or pcDNA-3 as a control as described previously (10.Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 18 h in Eagle's MEM media with 10% FCS as described previously and then placed in Eagle's MEM media with 0.2% FCS with or without AVP (10−6m) for 72 h. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity determined as described previously (32.Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as luciferase units normalized to β-galactosidase. PCR technique was then used to make single point mutations (T to G) at positions −66 and −115 in CArG-A and CArG-B, respectively, or to make the double mutant. Oligonucleotides for the point mutations were custom-designed and obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.: CArG-Amut sense, 5′-TTTGCTCCTTGGTTGGGAAGC, and CArG-Bmut sense, 5′-TGAGGTCCCTAGATGGTTGTG, where the bold type indicates the mutation. Oligonucleotides for the end sequences of the SM-α-actin promoter were as described previously (10.Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and contained aHindIII site (5′) or an XbaI site (3′). The resulting PCR products were ligated into the HindIII andXbaI sites of the pCCAT Basic vector (CATCArG-AMut, CATCArG-Bmut, and CATCARrG-ABMut). The sequences of the double-stranded cDNAs were verified using the SEQUENASE version 2.0 kit from United States Biochemical Corp. Plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified by an alkaline lysis procedure with purification over an anion-exchange resin (Qiagen Inc.). Cells were transfected as described above. After incubation with or without AVP, cells were harvested by trypsinization, and the cell pellets were frozen in liquid N2. CAT activity was measured using a modification of the thin-layer chromatographic method as described previously (33.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as pmol of chloramphenicol acetylated/h/milliunit of β-galactosidase. VSMC were grown to confluence and growth arrested for 3 days in media containing 0.2% FCS. The cells were then exposed to AVP or vehicle (control) for the indicated times. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Andrew and Faller (34.Andrew N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets containing 107 cells were resuspended in a 5× volume of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 10 min, vortexed, and centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. Extracts were separated into aliquots and stored at −70 °C. Single-stranded oligonucleotide probes encoding the CArG elements plus 10 nucleotides of flanking sequence on both sides were custom-designed as follows: CArG-A sense, 5′-TGTCTTTGCTCCTTGTTTGGGAAGCGAGTG; CArG-AMut sense, 5′-TGTCTTTGCTCCTTGGTTG-GGAAGCGAGTG; CArG-B sense, GTGCTGAGGTCCCTATATGGTTGTGTTAGA; CArG-Bmut sense, GTGCTGAGGTCCCTAGATGGTTGTGTTAGA. The 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides were annealed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C and allowing the reaction mixture to slowly return to room temperature. Probes were radiolabeled using DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment and [32P]dCTP for CArG-B and [32P]dGTP for CArG-A. Unincorporated 32P nucleotides were removed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the labeled probe was eluted from the gel. A 30-min binding reaction was performed at 4 °C (20 μl total volume; 5–10 μg of nuclear binding proteins, ∼75 pg of32P-labeled DNA, 0.125 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 12 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 12% glycerol). For competition studies, the appropriate concentration of unlabeled DNA was added to the reaction 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. In the super-shift experiments, antibodies were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min with the nuclear binding proteins before addition of32P-labeled DNA. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% acrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, Life Technologies) and electrophoresed at 25 mAmp/gel for 2 h in 1× TGE (25 mm Tris, 1.0 mm EDTA, 190 mmglycine). The gels were subsequently dried and exposed to film for autoradiography. We previously demonstrated that expression of dominant negative MKK4, which specifically activates JNKs, partially inhibited the AVP-mediated increase in SM-α-actin promoter activity (22.Higashita R. Li L. Van Putten V. Yamamura M. Zarinetchi F. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25845-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since multiple forms of JNK have been identified by molecular cloning, we sought to determine which isoforms were expressed in VSMC. By reverse transcription-PCR analysis and direct sequencing of the PCR product, all three gene products (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) were expressed in these cells (data not shown). Although the expression of JNK1 and JNK2 has been shown to be widespread, JNK3 expression has only been reported in a limited number of tissues including heart and brain (25.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). To test the role of individual isoforms in the regulation of SM-α-actin expression, VSMC were transiently co-transfected with the SM-α-actin promoter construct along with dominant-negative isoforms of JNK in which the sequence TPY, required for activation by upstream kinases, had been mutated to APF (35.Butterfield L. Zentrich E. Beekman A. Heasley L.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression of APF mutants of JNK1, JNK2, or JNK3 inhibited induction of the SM-α-actin promoter by either AVP or angiotensin II (Fig. 1). Zhenget al. (30.Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) report that fusion of JNKs to their upstream activating kinases (MKK7) results in constitutively active forms of JNK (30.Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have prepared similar constructs based on the findings of these authors and have demonstrated that they have constitutive activity.2 Co-transfection of multiple MKK7/JNK fusions together with the SM-α-actin promoter resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in promoter activity in the absence of AVP stimulation (Fig.2).Figure 2Expression of constitutively active MKK7/JNK fusions stimulates SM-α-actin promoter activity. VSMC were transiently co-transfected with the SM-α-actin promoter along with 5 μg of plasmids encoding MKK7 fusions with the indicated JNK isoform. Cells were then incubated for 3 days with media containing 0.2% FBS. Separate dishes were transfected without the MKK7 fusions and stimulated with AVP or 0.2% FBS for 3 days. Cells were harvested, and promoter activity normalized to β-galactosidase determined.

Stimulation of VSMC with AVP increased p38 MAP kinase, as determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-p38 antibodies and phosphorylation of ATF-2 in the immunocomplex (Fig. 3). Maximal stimulation (∼3–4-fold) was observed at 5–10 min and had decreased by 30 min. The stimulation was approximately 20% of that seen in cells exposed to UV light for 1 min. Treatment of cells with a SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor (36.Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar) inhibited AVP-mediated induction of the SM-α-actin promoter in a dose-dependent fashion, with half-maximal inhibition occurring between 2 and 5 μm (Fig.4 A). In contrast, PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor (37.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), had no effect on either basal or AVP-stimulated SM-α-actin promoter activity (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, expression of constitutively active MKK6, which specifically activates p38 MAP kinase (38.Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), increased SM-α-actin promoter activity to the same level seen with AVP stimulation of cells not expressing constitutively active MKK6 (Fig.5). This increase was blocked by treating the cells with SB203580.Figure 4Effect of MAP kinase inhibitors on induction of SM-α-actin promoter by AVP. Panel A, VSMC transfected with the SM-α-actin promoter construct were stimulated for 3 days with AVP in the presence of the indicated concentration of SB203580.

DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify potential targets of these kinase pathways, we sought to characterize critical elements of the SM-α-actin promoter and identify transcription factors that bind to these elements. Point mutations in each of the two CArG boxes were prepared by PCR and ligated into a promoterless CAT vector. VSMC were transfected with the respective constructs, and CAT activity was determined after incubation of cells for 3 days in the presence or absence of AVP, PDGF, or both agents. A point mutation in either CArG box resulted in a marked decrease in both basal and AVP-stimulated CAT activity (Fig.6). Constructs encoding a mutation in CArG-B retained greater levels of promoter activity in response to AVP than mutations in CArG-A. A construct in which both CArG boxes were simultaneously mutated did not show any increased CAT activity in response to AVP. Mutations in the individual CArG boxes also blunted the increase in SM-α-actin promoter activity induced by transient expression of constitutively active α16(α16Q212L), (data not shown). Complexes formed with the individual CArG boxes were analyzed by EMSA using nuclear extracts prepared from control and AVP-treated VSMC. Incubation of nuclear extracts with 32P-labeled CArG-B revealed a single major complex (Fig.7 A). Exposure of cells to AVP increased the intensity of this band by as early as 4–6 h, and this increase was maintained for at least 24 h(data not shown). The labeled complex was competed off by double-stranded cold oligonucleotides (Fig.7, DS) but not by single-stranded sense (SS) or antisense oligonucleotides (not shown). Incubation of the same extracts with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the point mutation shown in Fig. 6 did not result in the appearance of this band. EMSA with 32P-CArG-A and identical extracts produced a major specific band of similar mobility as seen with CArG-B (Fig.7 B). The lower bands seen in this figure appear to represent binding to single-stranded DNA or nonspecific complexes. The intensity of this band was also increased in extracts from AVP-stimulated cells. With equal concentrations of oligonucleotide and extract protein, the intensity of the band seen with CArG-A was significantly less intense than that seen with CArG-B (exposure time in Fig. 7 A was three times as long as Fig. 7 B). As with CArG-B, this complex was not detected using 32P-CArG-Amut (data not shown). Previous studies indicate that one of the transcription factors binding to CArG boxes in this promoter is SRF (11.Hautmann M.B. Thompson M.M. Swartz E.A. Olson E.N. Owens G.K. Circ. Re"

Five variant forms of SecB, previously demonstrated to be defective in mediating export in vivo (Gannon, P. M., and Kumamoto, C. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 1590-1595; Kimsey, H. K., Dagarag, M.

We present evidence that at least two regions of SecA are involved in the formation of active complexes with SecB. The variant forms of SecB were all capable of interacting with SecA in solution to form complexes with stability similar to that of complexes between SecA and wild-type SecB. However, the variant forms were defective in interaction with a separate region of SecA, which was shown to trigger a change that was correlated to activation of the complex. The region of SecA involved in activation of the complexes was defined as the extreme carboxyl-terminal 21 aminoacyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1987580575,"The β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) is one of the rare proteins known to be phosphorylated within its ectodomain. We have shown previously that βAPP can be phosphorylated within secretory vesicles and at the cell surface (Walter, J., Capell, A., Hung, A.

We have now specifically characterized the phosphorylation of cell surface-located βAPP and identified two ectoprotein kinases that phosphorylate βAPP at the outer face of the plasma membrane. By using selective protein kinase inhibitors and by investigating the usage of ATP and GTP as cosubstrates, we demonstrate that membrane-bound βAPP as well as secreted forms of βAPP can be phosphorylated by casein kinase (CK) 1- and CK2-like ectoprotein kinases. The ectodomain of βAPP was also phosphorylated by purified CK1 and CK2 in vitro, but not by protein kinases A and C. Phosphorylation of βAPP by ectoprotein kinases and by purified CK1 and CK2 occurred within an acidic domain in the N-terminal half of the protein. Heparin strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of cell-surface βAPP by ecto-CK1 and ecto-CK2, indicating a regulatory role of this extracellular matrix component in βAPP phosphorylation.

Indeed, direct binding of βAPP to the extracellular matrix component heparin was demonstrated (23Small D.H. Nurcomb V. Reed G. Clarries H. Moir R. Beyreuther K. Masters C. J.

Soluble forms of βAPP promote neurite outgrowth and cell adhesion and are neuroprotective (25Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 26Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). In addition, splice variants of βAPP containing the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain have been shown to be inhibitors of blood coagulation factors IXa and XIa (27Smith R.P. Higuchi D.A. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,28Wagner S.L. Siegel R.S. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. van Nostrand W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since βAPP is also released from activated platelets, βAPP might play a role in homeostasis (29Bush A.I. Martins R.N. Rumble B. Moir R. Fuller S. Milward E. Currie J. Ames D. Weidemann A. Fischer P. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). βAPP is post-translationally modified by N′- and O′-glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation (7Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Besides phosphorylation in its cytoplasmic tail (31Suzuki T. Oishi M. Marshak D.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), βAPP is predominantly phosphorylated within its ectodomain (33Knops J. Gandy S. Greengard P. Lieberburg I. Sinha S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Hung A. Selkoe D.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ectodomain phosphorylation of βAPP was mapped to serine residues located within an acidic region in the N-terminal half of the protein (34Hung A. Selkoe D.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Walter J. Capell A. Hung A.Y. Langen H. Schnölzer M. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that phosphorylation of the βAPP ectodomain can occur during transport to the cell surface within secretory vesicles (35Walter J. Capell A. Hung A.Y. Langen H. Schnölzer M. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, βAPP can also be phosphorylated at the cell surface by ectoprotein kinase activities (35Walter J. Capell A. Hung A.Y. Langen H. Schnölzer M. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ectoprotein kinases act on the outer side of the plasma membrane and use extracellular nucleoside triphosphates as cosubstrates, which can be released by intact cells upon certain stimuli (36Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 37Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectoprotein kinases phosphorylate membrane-bound proteins as well as soluble extracellular proteins. Phosphorylation of cell-surface proteins has been implicated in the regulation of certain cellular functions, including long-term potentiation in neurons (38Chen W. Wieraszko A. Hogan M.V. Yang H.A. Kornecki E. Ehrlich Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8688-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and synaptogenesis (39Muramato K. Taniguchi H. Kawahara M. Kobayashi K. Nonomura Y. Kuroda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the relevant protein substrates that are phosphorylated by ectoprotein kinases in these processes remain to be identified. Several ectoprotein kinase activities have been characterized, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase-like (40Kübler D. Pyerin W. Bill O. Hotz A. Sonka J. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14549-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and casein kinase (CK)-like (41Kübler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1995; 316: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) activities at the cell surface has also been demonstrated. By analyzing the cell-surface phosphorylation of βAPP, we have now identified CK1- and CK2-type ectoprotein kinases (ecto-CK1 and ecto-CK2), which phosphorylate membrane-bound as well as soluble βAPP. Phosphorylation of βAPP is significantly inhibited by heparin, indicating a regulatory role of extracellular matrix components in βAPP phosphorylation. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell lines stably overexpressing βAPP-(1–695) and a truncated form of βAPP ending at the α-secretase cleavage site have been described previously (34Hung A. Selkoe D.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Walter J. Capell A. Hung A.Y. Langen H. Schnölzer M. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.). The βAPP S198A/S206A cDNA was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described previously (35Walter J. Capell A. Hung A.Y. Langen H. Schnölzer M. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The resulting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment was subcloned into linearized pCMV695 and stably transfected into HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 single cell clones were generated by selection in G418. To generate fusion proteins of maltose-binding protein (MBP) and βAPP, the sequence of βAPP695 encoding amino acids 1–641 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGCGAATTCATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAAGAGATCTCCTCCGTCTT-3′. The resulting fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). The deletion construct MBP-βAPPΔ181–224, lacking amino acids 181–224, was also generated by PCR. For PCRs, the following primer pairs were used: 1) 5′-CGCGAATTCATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGC-3/5′-GCTACTTCTACTACCTTGTCAATTCCGCAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTGCGGAATTGACAAGGTAGTAGAAGTAGC-3′/5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAAGAGATCTCCTCCGTCTT-3′. After gel purification, the primary PCR products were mixed, and a second PCR was carried out using primers 5′-CGCGAATTCATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGC-3 and ACGCGTCGACTTAAGAGATCTCCTCCGTCTT-3′. The resulting fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified on amylose resin according to the supplier's instructions. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (48Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies 6687 and 5313 were raised against fusion proteins of maltose-binding protein and the C terminus of βAPP (amino acids 652–695) or of maltose-binding protein and the N-terminal domain of βAPP (amino acids 444–592). Cell-surface phosphorylation was carried out as described (47Kübler D. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 322-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent monolayer cell cultures grown on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were washed twice with prewarmed (37 °C) isotonic phosphorylation buffer (30 mm Tris (pH 7.3), 70 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4; 290 ± 10 mosm) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the same buffer. Phosphorylation was started by the addition of 1.5 μm [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C. To characterize the protein kinases that phosphorylate βAPP, reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of the following selective kinase inhibitors: 20 μm5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.), an inhibitor of CK2; 1 μmCKI-7 (Medac), an inhibitor of CK1; 1 μmhymenialdisine (HD; gift from L. Meijer), an inhibitor of CK1; 1 μm H-89 (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent kinase; 10 μmroscovitine (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases; 5 μm KN-62 (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II; and 1 μm GF109203X (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Heparin (Sigma) was added to the cell supernatants at the concentrations indicated. The phosphorylation reactions were terminated by removing cell supernatants, followed by two immediate washes of the cells with ice-cold phosphorylation buffer containing 2 mmunlabeled ATP. Subsequently, cells were lysed in the presence of 2 mm ATP for 7 min on ice as described (48Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates and cell supernatants were clarified by centrifugation (10 min at 14,000 ×g). Membrane-bound and secreted βAPPs were isolated by immunoprecipitation as described above and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography or by phosphoimaging. Cell viability during phosphorylation assays was evaluated by the criteria of Kübler et al. (47Kübler D. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 322-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant rat CK1δ (New England Biolabs Inc.), the recombinant α-subunit of human CK2 (gift from Dr. W. Pyerin), and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A purified from bovine heart (gift from Dr. V. Kinzel) were used for in vitro phosphorylation assays in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Protein kinase C purified from rat brain (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.) was assayed in a similar buffer supplemented with 1 μm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, and 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine under mixed micellar conditions (49Huang K.P. Huang F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins of MBP and βAPP (see above) and soluble βAPP secreted from HEK 293 cells were used as substrates. Soluble βAPP was immunoprecipitated with antibody 1736, which specifically recognizes APPS-α (17Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in 1 ml of the respective assay buffer. In vitro phosphorylation assays were carried out in a final volume of 30 μl for 10 min at 32 °C. To control the kinase activities, parallel phosphorylation reactions were carried out using phosvitin (1 mg/ml; Sigma) or histone (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) as protein substrate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out by one-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis according to Jelinek and Weber (50Jelinek T. Weber M.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 629-630Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp.) were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 90 min at 110 °C. Subsequently, supernatants were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, and pellets were dissolved in 8 μl of pH 2.5 buffer (5.9% glacial acetic acid, 0.8% formic acid, 0.3% pyridine, and 0.3 mm EDTA) and spotted onto 20 × 20-cm cellulose TLC plates (Merck) together with unlabeled phosphoamino acids (1 μg each of Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P); Sigma). High voltage electrophoresis was carried out for 45 min at 20 mA. Radioactive phosphoamino acids were localized by autoradiography and identified by comparison with comigrating phosphoamino acids after ninhydrin staining. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. One-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was carried out as described previously (35Walter J. Capell A. Hung A.Y. Langen H.

To identify protein kinases that are capable of phosphorylating βAPP within its ectodomain, we first investigated phosphorylation of soluble βAPP in vitro. Soluble βAPP was isolated by immunoprecipitation from the conditioned medium of HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant βAPP, which corresponds to α-secretase-processed βAPP (APPS-α) (34Hung A. Selkoe D.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Purified APPS-α was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of several protein kinases that have been demonstrated to be also present at the cell surface (40Kübler D. Pyerin W. Bill O. Hotz A. Sonka J. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14549-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kübler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2022-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After the phosphorylation reactions, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled βAPP was visualized by autoradiography. Incubation with CK1 and CK2 resulted in the strong phosphorylation of βAPP, whereas protein kinases A and C were not effective (Fig.1, left panel). Phosphorylation reactions carried out under the same conditions using the cognate protein substrates phosvitin for CK1 and CK2 and histone for protein kinases A and C demonstrated that the respective kinases were enzymatically active (data not shown). When [γ-32P]GTP was used as cosubstrate, βAPP was phosphorylated exclusively by CK2 (Fig. 1, right panel) due the unique feature of CK2 to use GTP and ATP equally well as cosubstrate (51Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data demonstrate that APPS-α is a protein substrate for CK1 and CK2 in vitro. To characterize the phosphorylation of βAPP at the surface of cultured cells directly, [γ-32P]ATP was added to the supernatants of HEK 293 cells overexpressing βAPP-(1–695) (10Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Since [γ-32P]ATP does not penetrate the cell membrane, phosphorylation of cell-surface proteins by ectoprotein kinases can be selectively detected (47Kübler D. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 322-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the phosphorylation reaction, βAPP was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with antibody 6687, directed against the cytoplasmic tail of βAPP; and precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Two prominent bands at 105 and 120 kDa corresponding to immature and mature (fullyN′- and O′-glycosylated) forms of βAPP, respectively, were detected by Coomassie staining (Fig.2 a). The identity of both bands was verified with antibody 5313 by Western blotting (data not shown; see also Fig. 3 d). Phosphoimaging revealed that only the mature form of βAPP was phosphorylated by ectoprotein kinase activity (Fig. 2 a).Figure 3Cell-surface βAPP is phosphorylated by ecto-CK1 and ecto-CK2. a, cell-surface proteins of HEK 293 cells were phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP as cosubstrate in the presence or absence of the CK2-specific inhibitor DRB (20 μm). Phosphorylation of βAPP was analyzed by phosphoimaging (upper panels), and βAPP was stained with Coomassie (lower panels). b, phosphorylation of βAPP was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP as described for a in the presence or absence of the CK1-specific inhibitor HD (1 μm). To saturate the activity of CK2, the reactions were carried out in the presence (right panels) or absence (left panels) of 1 mm unlabeled GTP.c, cell-surface phosphorylation of βAPP with [γ-32P]ATP was carried out in the presence or absence of 2 mg/ml phosvitin. Note that the cognate protein substrate of CKs suppressed the phosphorylation of βAPP. d, shown is the phosphorylation of βAPP at the cell surface in the presence or absence of the selective protein kinase inhibitors H-89 (1 μm; protein kinase A inhibitor), KN-62 (5 μm; Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II inhibitor), roscovitine (10 μm; cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor), GF109203X (1 μm; protein kinase C inhibitor), HD (1 μm), and DRB (20 μm). To suppress ecto-CK2 activity, all reactions were carried out in the presence of 1 mmunlabeled GTP. Radiolabeled βAPP was detected by phosphoimaging (upper panels), and total βAPP was detected by immunoblotting with antibody 5313 (lower panels). Phosphorylated endogenous βAPP is indicated (*). Ctr., control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the protein kinases involved in the in vivophosphorylation of cell-surface βAPP, we first analyzed the usage of ATP and GTP as cosubstrates. Incubation of HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing βAPP with both [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]GTP resulted in the phosphorylation of βAPP (Fig. 2 b). The ability to use GTP as cosubstrate indicates the involvement of the ectoprotein kinase CK2 (ecto-CK2) in the phosphorylation of the βAPP ectodomain. To determine if ectoprotein kinases other than ecto-CK2 also phosphorylate cell surface-located βAPP, we added 1 mmunlabeled ATP or GTP to the phosphorylation reactions together with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP to suppress the incorporation of 32P by cosubstrate competition. Labeling of βAPP with 1.5 μm [γ-32P]ATP as cosubstrate could be almost completely suppressed by the addition of excess amounts (1 mm) of unlabeled ATP, whereas the addition of 1 mm unlabeled GTP only partly inhibited32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.2 b). Phosphorylation of βAPP using [γ-32P]GTP as cosubstrate could be completely suppressed by both unlabeled ATP and GTP (Fig. 2 b). As shown by Coomassie staining of the gels, the addition of 1 mm ATP or GTP did not affect the expression of βAPP (Fig. 2 b,lower panels). Similar results were obtained by analyzing soluble βAPP, which had been secreted from cells into the supernatant during the incubation period (data not shown; see also Fig. 4). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the phosphorylation of cell-surface βAPP involves at least two distinct ectoprotein kinases, one of which is ecto-CK2, capable of using GTP as cosubstrate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of βAPP from cells labeled with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP revealed that βAPP was phosphorylated predominantly on serine residues (Fig.2 c). To prove the involvement of ecto-CK2 and to identify other protein kinases that potentially phosphorylate βAPP at the cell surface, we tested the effects of several selective protein kinase inhibitors. First, cells were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]G"

PC12 cells was used as a model to delineate respective signaling of prolactin. Prolactin acted as a mitogen for undifferentiated PC12 cells, as measured by significant increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and in cell numbers, with an efficacy equal to epidermal growth factor. Both the long and short form of the prolactin receptor was expressed, yet only the long isoform was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon agonist binding. Functional prolactin receptor signaling was further demonstrated in the activation of JAK2 and phosphorylation activation of the transcription factors Stat1, -3, and -5a. Surprisingly, prolactin stimulated a sustained activation of Raf-B, without activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 or -2. Instead, in solid phase kinase assays using a glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun fusion protein (amino acids 1–79) as the substrate, a significant activation of the mitogen-activated protein Janus kinase (c-Jun N-terminal kinase; JNK) was observed. The prolactin-induced activation of JNK was prolonged and accompanied by a significant increase in c-Jun mRNA abundance and c-Jun protein synthesis. Moreover, analysis of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation at the single cell level revealed that epidermal growth factor-dependent incorporation was inhibited by PD98059 and independent of SB203580, whereas prolactin-induced incorporation was ERK and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 independent but was abolished with JNK inhibition by 30 μm SB203580.

Furthermore, several vertebrate neuroendocrine tissues, including the central nervous system, peripheral neural populations, and adrenal, have been shown to express mRNA encoding the long and short forms of the prolactin receptor (PRLR). The study of prolactin action in the nervous system has been focused on the modulation of neuronal neurotransmitter expression and secretion in postnatal postmitotic neurons. However, the direct effects of prolactin in developing neural cells and the signal transduction pathways that mediate them have only recently been addressed (3DeVito W.J. Stone S. Mori K.

The PRLR belongs to the superfamily of cytokine class-1 receptors (5Bazan J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The PRLR, like the other members of this family, does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain but signals through activation of associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (JAK) and Src kinase families (6Rui H.

Prolactin binding promotes dimerization of PRLR, which triggers activation of tyrosine kinases and further transduction of the signal (8Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol.

Association of JAK2 with a PRL-bound receptor is sufficient for activation of the kinase, phosphorylation of PRLR, and the recruitment and activation of members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, in particular Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 (14Lebrun J.J.

In addition, phospholipase C-protein kinase C and the ERK and p38 MAP kinase activation have also been reported as effectors of PRLR (9Berlanga J.J. Fresno Vara J.A. Martin-Perez J. Garcia-Ruiz J.P.

However, it is not clear whether these interacting or often parallel pathways specifically mediate cell proliferation or differentiation. With this background, we undertook these studies to investigate the potential role of prolactin as a growth factor in PC12 cells, a model system to delineate proliferation and differentiation signal transduction pathways. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Ovine prolactin was purchased from Sigma, and rat prolactin was provided by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institutes of Health. Polyclonal antibodies against Stat3, Stat5a, c-Jun, and JNK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); a monoclonal antibody against ERK1/2, monoclonal antibody 4G10 against phosphotyrosine, a polyclonal antibody to JAK2, a polyclonal antibody to Raf-B, and recombinant protein A-agarose were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; the U5 monoclonal antibody against the prolactin receptor was from ABR Inc.; a monoclonal antibody to Stat1 was from Transduction Laboratories; rabbit anti-mouse IgGs were from Jackson Laboratories; and anti-5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PP1, PD98059, and SB203580 were purchased from Alexis, Inc. PC12 cells, obtained from Dr. Aaron Fox (University of Chicago), were plated at 25,000 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell cultures were switched to chemically defined medium (20Skaper S.D. Selak I. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1983; 10: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or Neurobasal medium supplemented withl-glutamine and N2 (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) for an average of 48 h, before treatment with prolactin (ovine or rat) or other agonists at concentrations and for the times indicated per experiment. PC12 cells were plated on Corning plates engraved with a 2 × 2-mm grid. Ten fields per dish of four per experimental group were chosen randomly, charted on the grid, and followed every 12 h by time lapse photography through a 20× lens on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a N6006 Nikon camera and an 125 ASA Plus-X pan Kodak film. Cell numbers were then counted on black and white pictures. Sister cultures were trypsinized, and cell numbers were directly assessed with a Coulter counter (21Mangoura D. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were changed to Neurobasal plus N2 medium 36 h prior to indicated treatments. After 16 h of agonist treatment, BrdUrd (10 μm) was added for 60 min, and cultures were fixed and stained with anti-BrdUrd according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications (4Mangoura, D., Leung, S., Pelletiere, C., Sakellaridis, N., and Wang, D. (2000) Int. J. Dev. Neurosci., in pressGoogle Scholar). The antibody binding was visualized with an anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG. Before mounting, nuclei were stained with bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33258, Sigma) to identify normal (intact) and apoptotic (fragmented) nuclei. Cells were viewed and photographed first for BrdUrd uptake under light using a Nikon 6006 camera and a × 20 lens. Assessment of cell numbers and apoptosis was done by switching to a UV optical filter and counting intact and fragmented nuclei. Total cell lysates, PC12 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, i.e. a 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, and 1% Triton X-100 with two protease inhibitors, leupeptin and Ep459, at 1 μg/ml. After a 10-min centrifugation, supernatant solutions were assayed for protein content. Lysates normalized per protein content were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membranes as described (22Mangoura D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To assure equal loading, membranes were first stained with the reversible dye Pounceau S. Abundance and electrophoretic ability of Raf-B, ERK1 and -2, and c-Jun in the various groups were detected by blotting the membranes with a monoclonal antibody. Immunoreactivity was visualized by further incubation with species-specific, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (7Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14021-14026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mangoura D. Pelletiere C. Wang D. Sakellaridis N. Sogos V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 429: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NAF, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min. After removal of insoluble material (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), supernatant solutions were assayed for protein content with the DC-Bio-Rad kit. Equal amounts of lysates were incubated for at least 2 h with monoclonal antibody U5 (5 μg/ml) or a monoclonal antibody to Stat1 (1 μg/250 μg) or polyclonal antibodies to Stat3 or -5a (1 μg/ml). Monoclonal antibodies were incubated for another hour with rabbit-anti-mouse antibodies (2 μg/ml) prior to the addition of 100 μl of 50% protein A-agarose to all lysates. Immunoprecipitates were briefly centrifuged, the supernatant solutions were discarded, and the agarose pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with PBS. Precipitated material was eluted from the beads by boiling the pellet in 25 μl of sample buffer at 95 °C for 2 min. Following boiling, proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The phosphotyrosine content of immunoprecipitated proteins was detected by blotting the membranes with the antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. The membranes were reblotted routinely with the immunoprecipitating antibody to reassure equal abundance. Each experiment was repeated 4–10 times. PC12 cells were treated with rat prolactin (1 nm) for 20 min, and total RNA was isolated with the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Using designed primers according to the rat c-Jun DNA sequence (24Kitabayashi I. Saka F. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (forward, 5′-TCGTGGGATCCCCATGACTGCAAAGATGGAAACG-3′; backward, 5′-ACCCGGAATTCCTCAGGCGCTCCAGCTCCGGCGA-3′) and 5 μg of RNA per sample for reverse transcription-PCR, a DNA fragment that carried the N-terminal c-Jun protein sequence (amino acids 1–79) was generated. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h (Titan One; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two microliters of this reaction were amplified by 40 cycles of PCR (94 °C × 1 min, 54 °C × 1 min, 72 °C × 1 min) in a Perkin-Elmer PE 2400. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Sizes were calculated relative to a 100-base pair ladder standard (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into a GST-plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-c-Jun fragment was used to transform TOP10F′ One Shot Competent Cells (Invitrogen). After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside according to standard procedures, the expressed GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein was purified through a glutathione-Sepharose-4B column. The assays were performed as described previously with some modification (25Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Briefly, JNK was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts (500 μg) of total cell protein with anti-JNK antibodies in a 20 mm HEPES, pH 1.4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, and Ep459 at 10 μg/ml). Antibody-antigen complexes were collected with protein A-agarose beads. Beads were washed three times with a 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 30 μl of the kinase buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Reactions were initiated with the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-c-Jun, carried out for 20 min at 30 °C, and terminated by adding 2× SDS sample buffer. The eluate was analyzed with SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the dried polyacrylamide gels. We used three different methods to study the effects of prolactin on the proliferation or differentiation of PC12 cells, namely cell counts, BrdUrd uptake, and time lapse photography. First, PC12 cells were grown for 2 days after plating and then arrested with preincubation in a chemically defined medium for 48 h or in Neurobasal medium plus N2 supplement. Under these conditions, proliferation ceases and cells acquire differentiated features (20Skaper S.D. Selak I. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1983; 10: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Dahmer M.K. Perlman R.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2109-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At the end of this period, rat prolactin (1 nm) or vehicle was added for an additional time with calf serum (10%) and EGF (50 ng/ml) used in parallel cultures as positive mitogenic controls. After treatment, cells were trypsinized, and cell numbers were assessed directly with a Coulter counter. Prolactin was a mitogen, as strong as EGF, while calf serum was, as expected, stronger than both (Fig.1 A). Specifically, cell numbers after 2 days of treatment with prolactin (1 nm) had increased to an average of 5.45 × 105 ± 0.63 cells/dish versus 3.02 × 105 ± 0.15 in cultures treated with vehicle. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.002), suggesting that PRL had induced mitosis. By 72 h, the difference in growth rate between control and prolactin-treated cells was not as dramatic; however, cell numbers in the prolactin-treated group remained significantly higher that in controls (p < 0.01). The increase in cell number was due to cell proliferation, as verified with BrdUrd incorporation studies. A multifold increase in the numbers of nuclei BrdUrd-positive nuclei was evident after prolactin stimulation as compared with control, with 3.5% BrdUrd-positive nuclei in controls (positive/total nuclei) versus 64.8% after 18 h of PRL treatment. Quantitation of apoptotic nuclei in the same cell population by Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide) staining showed that apoptosis was negligible. These results established that prolactin is a mitogen for PC12 cells. Next, we sought to establish whether PRL had affected cell differentiation while inducing a cell cycle, as we have established for astrocytes (4Mangoura, D., Leung, S., Pelletiere, C., Sakellaridis, N., and Wang, D. (2000) Int. J. Dev. Neurosci., in pressGoogle Scholar). Ten fields per dish were chosen randomly, charted on the imprinted grid of the tissue culture dish, and photographed prior to the addition of prolactin, EGF, or vehicle. The same fields were photographed again 24 h later (Fig. 1 B). Statistical analysis verified that, while cell loss was minimal in all groups, cell numbers were significantly increased from an average of 8% per day in the vehicle-treated control group to 34% with prolactin treatment (a representative example is shown in Fig. 1 B, control (upper panel) and prolactin-treated (middle panel)). Similar increases were observed with EGF (lower panel). This type of analysis also allowed observations on the state of differentiation and cell loss. Control cultures continued to differentiate during the elapsed 24-h time period, as evident from the increasing length of neurites (Fig. 2 B,arrowheads in the upper panel). In the prolactin-treated cultures, several cells had completed a cell cycle over the same period of 24 h (Fig. 2 B,arrows in the middle panel) and then assumed a polarized phenotype. In the EGF-treated cultures, while the number of proliferating cells appeared to be similar, the cells appeared to lag behind in cell cycle completion as compared with prolactin, with several of them observed in anaphase (Fig.2 B, lower panel, arrows). This time-lapse analysis also verified that cell loss was minimal (asterisk). All subsequent signaling studies were performed with the same experimental design to assure examination of the events within a time frame of what appeared as a concomitant signal for proliferation and differentiation by prolactin. Western blot analysis with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 has established functional expression of PRLR by showing that several proteins were modified with time of PRL exposure (27Cheng Y. Perlman R.L. Mangoura D. Trans. Soc. Neurosci. 1996; 22: 1212Google Scholar). The long isoform of the prolactin receptor is one of the proteins modified by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to prolactin; JAK2 is then activated, and the PRLR-JAK2 complex propagates the signaling through recruitment of a member of the STAT transcription factor family. In order to establish activation of this pathway in PC12 cells, we employed immunoprecipitation combined with Western blot analysis of total lysates of prolactin-treated cells. First, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the U5 anti-prolactin receptor antibody (IP:U5), and the electrophoretically resolved proteins were Western blotted with U5 (WB:U5) (Fig. 2 A). Two bands were detected with apparent M r of 100,000 and 60,000, which correspond to the long and short isoform of PRLR, respectively. When the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the long isoform of the receptor corresponded to the most prominent protein band with increased tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). Phosphorylation of the PRLR long form was maximal by 5 min and remained increased for at least 20 min. Two minor bands of lower M r were faintly detected with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Another higherM r protein band that co-immunoprecipitated with the prolactin receptor band also showed increases in phosphotyrosine content with time (Fig. 2 B, upper arrow). Reblotting of these Western blots revealed that this protein co-migrated with a protein that was reactive to JAK 2 antibodies (data not shown), as anticipated. To confirm activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by prolactin, the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1, -3, and -5a was investigated with immunoprecipitation of whole PC12 cell lysates with the respective antibodies and Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies first and then reblotting with the immunoprecipitating antibodies. A rapid phosphorylation of Stat1 by prolactin became maximal at 15 min of exposure to prolactin. The phosphorylation/activation was sustained for hours and returned to unstimulated levels by 3 h (Fig. 2 C). The time course of Stat3 (Fig. 2 D) and Stat5 (Fig. 2 E) tyrosine phosphorylation in response to prolactin was also acute and maximal by 15 min but slightly differed from that of Stat1 in that the tyrosine phosphorylation returned to basal levels in about 2 h. The regulation of the phosphorylation of all three STATs was also similar. As shown representatively in Fig. 2, D and E, low concentrations of SB203580, 1 μm (a concentration that only inhibits p38) or 30 μm (which inhibits p38, JNK2, and c-Raf), or Src family kinases (PP1, at 10 μm) had no significant effect on the PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these STATs. Having demonstrated that prolactin is a mitogen in PC12 cells, we examined its coupling to ERK activation, the duration of which in PC12 cells is known to correlate with mitogenicity of the signal; i.e. EGF produces a relatively acute but transient activation of ERK 2, while NGF promotes a later but sustained activation of this kinase (28York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In this prototypic mitogenic signaling pathway activated by EGF, the serine/threonine kinase Raf-B is upstream to the activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2. Activated Raf phosphorylates and activates downstream kinases of the MEK family, thus initiating the MEK-MAP kinase cascade (29Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Upon activation, Raf is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, and its apparent molecular weight increases (30Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8855-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of Raf-B in total lysates from PC12 cells treated for different times with prolactin was studied by Western blot analysis with anti-Raf-B antibodies (results of a representative Western experiment are shown in Fig. 3 A). By 15 min of stimulation with prolactin, the mobility of Raf was obviously retarded, indicating activation of Raf molecules. The activation lasted for over 1 h. In comparison, the activation induced by EGF was more robust but less sustained (Fig. 3 B). The effect of EGF, used as a positive control for activation, was established by 1 min, maximal by 5 min, and almost over by 15 min. The time course of EGF-stimulated Raf phosphorylation was consistent with it being upstream to ERK activation, as seen in total lysates analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody, which primarily recognizes ERK2 and cross-reacts with ERK1 (Fig.3 C). Because a significant number of amino acid residues are phosphorylated on ERK1/2 molecules when they are activated, the electrophoretic mobility of the activated molecules also changes. The result is the appearance of an additional band of slightly higherM r (activated) right above the baseline band (nonactivated ERK) and the overall appearance of ERK1 or -2 as doublet bands in Western blots. Use of ERK mobility as a measure of its activation clearly showed that PRL did not cause detectable activation of ERK1 or -2 as concluded in several experiments (Fig. 3 C), while EGF stimulated both ERK1 and ERK2 5 min after its introduction into the culture medium. The activation lasted several more minutes. ERK1 activation appeared more transient than that of ERK2, which lasted for 1 h. Similar experiments using different antibodies or in-gel assays (21Mangoura D. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Pavlovic-Surjancev B. Cahill A.L. Perlman R.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2134-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also did not detect any ERK activation with prolactin, even with concentrations as high as 1 μm. The surprising finding that while Raf was activated by prolactin, several sensitive detection methods of ERK activation clearly showed that the prolactin receptor is not coupled to ERK1/2 in PC12 cells prompted us to investigate whether prolactin is coupled to activation of another major MAP kinase, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNKs exclusively phosphorylate Ser63 and Ser73 in the transactivation domain of c-Jun, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, and we exploited this specificity to measure JNK activation in solid phase kinase assays. We first generated a fragment from amino acids 1–79 of c-Jun using PRL-stimulated PC12 cells as a template, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A GST fusion c-Jun fragment was constructed and used as a substrate to assay JNK activation (Fig.4). After different times of treatment with prolactin, JNK was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody and allowed to phosphorylate GST-c-Jun-(1–79) in vitro. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Densitometry of the autoradiogram (a typical one is shown in Fig.4 A) revealed that JNK was activated by prolactin in PC12 cells. The activation had reached 3-fold over base line by 30 min and 10-fold, the maximal activation, by 1 h. The activation was sustained maximal for an additional 2 h until it declined to control levels after 6 h (Fig. 4 A). This is the first demonstration of prolactin-receptor coupling to JNK in any cell type. The activation of the transcription factor c-Jun downstream to prolactin receptor activation was verified in vivo as well. Total lysates from cells with different exposure time to prolactin were studied by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-c-Jun antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A significant increase in the synthesis of c-Jun was observed starting as early as 1 min of prolactin tr"

Footprinting shows that the polymerase and 5′-nuclease cannot bind simultaneously to a DNA substrate and appear to compete with one another, suggesting that the two active sites are physically separate and operate independently. The desired biological end point, a ligatable nick, results from the substrate specificities of the polymerase and 5′-nuclease. The preferred substrate of the 5′-nuclease is a “double-flap” structure having a frayed base at the primer terminus overlapping the displaced strand that is to be cleaved by the 5′-nuclease. Cleavage of this structure occurs almost exclusively between the first two paired bases of the downstream strand, yielding a ligatable nick. In whole DNA polymerase I, the polymerase and 5′-nuclease activities are coupled such that the majority of molecules cleaved by the 5′-nuclease have also undergone polymerase-catalyzed addition to the primer terminus. This implies that the 5′-nuclease can capture a DNA molecule from the polymerase site more efficiently than from the bulk solution.

DNA polymerase I The DNA polymerase I (Pol I)1 enzymes of eubacteria function in DNA repair and in the removal of RNA primers from Okazaki fragments during lagging strand replication (1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992Google Scholar). To facilitate the formation of ligatable structures, the bacterial Pol I enzymes usually have nuclease activity, which degrades the downstream DNA or RNA strand. Originally described as a 5′-3′ exonuclease, this activity is now recognized to be a structure-specific nuclease with specificity for the junction between a DNA duplex and a 5′-single-stranded tail (or flap) and is therefore better described as a 5′-nuclease (2.Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1993; 260: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). On a nicked DNA duplex, polymerase-catalyzed primer extension continuously regenerates the substrate for the 5′-nuclease, so that the polymerase effectively drives nick translation (3.Lundquist R. Olivera B. Cell. 1982; 31: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 5′-nuclease activity of Pol I is present on an independent structural domain encoded by the first one-third of the structural gene, which can be separated from the polymerase by proteolysis or by recombinant DNA manipulations (4.Klenow H.

Two extreme scenarios can be envisaged. The Pol I molecule might adopt a structure that brings the two active sites into close proximity so they can bind simultaneously to the DNA substrate. Alternatively, the polymerase and 5′-nuclease activities might operate essentially independently of one another, perhaps even with the DNA traveling from one active site to the other via dissociation into free solution. This latter scenario fits well with the existence of a separate 5′-nuclease in some systems and is analogous to the relationship between the polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease (editing) functions of Klenow fragment, where the two active sites are separated by about 30 Å, with a substantial amount of the transfer between them occurring via dissociation (19.Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10858-10866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Close juxtaposition of polymerase and 5′-nuclease active sites might be difficult to achieve; the polymerase active site is located at the base of a cleft (20.Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and the 5′-nuclease domain is structurally complex, possibly requiring threading of the unpaired 5′ end through an arch or loop of the protein (16.Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Sück D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17.Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, recent structures of polymerases with DNA bound at the polymerase site suggest a dislocation of the downstream DNA template beyond the site of synthesis (21.Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 22.Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and such a dislocation might provide a way to accommodate both polymerase and 5′-nuclease active sites in reasonably close proximity. Only two polymerase crystal structures (both of Taq DNA polymerase) include a 5′-nuclease domain. The first structure showed the polymerase and 5′-nuclease sites separated by about 70 Å at opposite ends of a rather extended molecule, arguing in favor of separate and independent active sites; however, x-ray scattering measurements suggested that the polymerase may fold more compactly in solution (15.Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.-S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A more recent crystal structure of Taq DNA polymerase complexed with an Fab showed the nuclease domain (which was remote from the Fab location) close to the fingers subdomain of the polymerase (23.Murali R. Sharkey D.J. Daiss J.L. Murthy H.M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12562-12567Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the active sites were still separated by almost 40 Å, this location brings the 5′-nuclease much closer to the downstream portion of a DNA molecule bound at the polymerase active site. At the very least, the structural data suggest a flexible linkage between the 5′-nuclease and the rest of the polymerase molecule, and this could allow the two domains to be closely associated in an active complex.In this work, we have investigated two aspects of the collaboration between the polymerase and 5′-nuclease components of Escherichia coli Pol I: the way in which the substrate preferences of both activities are biased so as to produce a ligatable nick and the extent to which polymerase and 5′-nuclease are coupled so that both reactions take place within the same DNA binding event.DISCUSSIONTo perform its functions in vivo, in excision repair and in lagging strand replication, Pol I must leave a ligatable nick. Achieving this end point requires a delicate balance between polymerase and 5′-nuclease activities; an imbalance will give either a gapped or a 5′-tailed duplex, neither of which is a substrate for DNA ligase. Our results imply that the DNA substrate cannot contact both polymerase and 5′-nuclease active sites simultaneously but, rather, must be passed back and forth between two autonomous and non-overlapping active sites. The correct end point, a ligatable nick, results from the substrate preferences of the two domains and the cleavage specificity of the 5′-nuclease.Polymerase and 5′-Nuclease Sites Are Separate and Operate IndependentlyOur footprinting data show that the polymerase and 5′-nuclease domains, when present on separate molecules, cannot bind simultaneously to a DNA substrate. The slight overlap between the footprints of the separate domains accounts for the inhibition by Klenow fragment of both the binding and nuclease activity of the 5′-nuclease domain. The substrate specificities described below imply that the polymerase senses what is beyond the primer terminus and the 5′-nuclease senses the location of the upstream primer strand, and this fits with the observed footprints. When the polymerase and 5′-nuclease are covalently joined in whole Pol I, the polymerase mode of binding dominates, consistent with its greater DNA binding affinity (6.Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27.Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Failure to observe a Pol I footprint that is the sum of the footprints of the two separate domains suggests that no benefit results from the high local concentration of the 5′-nuclease domain when the polymerase is bound to DNA and argues strongly that the two domains do not cooperate so as to bind simultaneously to the DNA substrate. The apparent antagonism between the polymerase and nuclease binding modes probably accounts for the lower activity of the 5′-nuclease when present in whole Pol I (6.Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Formation of a Ligatable NickBoth polymerase and 5′-nuclease discriminate between related substrate structures in such a way as to increase the probability of generating a ligatable nick. The preference of the polymerase for gapped structures helps to ensure that gaps are filled, whereas rapid dissociation from a nick allows other enzymes to act. The preferred substrate of the 5′-nuclease is a double-flap molecule with an unpaired base at the primer terminus. Cleavage of the double-flap DNA is focused almost exclusively to a single position between the first two paired bases of the strand with the 5′ overhang, generating a ligatable nick. The efficient processing of this substrate to yield the required product suggests that the double-flap structure may be the natural substrate for the 5′-nuclease. A preference for double-flap substrates has also been reported for the 5′-nucleases ofTaq and Tth DNA polymerases and for eukaryotic and archaebacterial FEN-1 enzymes (7.Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Varvel V.E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6143-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30.Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31.Kaiser M.W. Lyamicheva N. Ma W. Miller C. Neri B. Fors L. Lyamichev V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21387-21394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In contrast to 5′-nuclease cleavage of the double-flap structure, the reaction with nicked and gapped substrates seems much less efficient and precise. The predominant cleavage site on a nicked or gapped substrate is between the first two paired bases of the downstream strand (Fig. 7) (2.Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1993; 260: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which means that cleavage must be followed by at least one more round of polymerase addition before ligation can take place. Cleavage of nicked and gapped substrates often occurs at more than one position, and this could reflect formation (via branch migration) of several interconvertible structures. The extent to which a particular cleavage site is represented in the reaction products would be determined by the abundance of the relevant structure and the efficiency with which it is cleaved by the 5′-nuclease. Specifically, we suggest that the cleavages that apparently map within the single-stranded 5′ tail actually involve rearrangement of the DNA to give double-flap structures, usually having imperfect base pairing around the cleavage site. These double-flap and related structures need not be abundant in the substrate pool if they are strongly preferred as nuclease substrates. Similar reasoning has been invoked to explain the formation of a variety of cleavage products by the Taq5′-nuclease (7.Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Varvel V.E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6143-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Examination of the structural model proposed for T5 5′-nuclease bound to its DNA substrate (16.Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Sück D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) suggests that there could be room for an additional base at the primer terminus; contacts between the active site and the 3′-unpaired base would then account for the preference of the 5′-nuclease for the double-flap substrate.The potential for 5′-nuclease substrates (particularly those made by strand-displacement synthesis) to rearrange and form double-flap structures may account for some inconsistencies in the cleavage sites reported for these enzymes. For example, Lundquist and Olivera (3.Lundquist R. Olivera B. Cell. 1982; 31: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) consistently observed cleavage by the 5′-nuclease of E. coliPol I apparently at the junction between the downstream duplex and the 5′ single strand, whereas other studies agree that the predominant cleavage position for the bacterial Pol I 5′-nucleases is one base 3′ to this position, i.e. between the first two paired downstream bases (2.Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1993; 260: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 6.Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32.Kelly R.B. Atkinson M.R. Huberman J.A. Kornberg A. Nature. 1969; 224: 495-501Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Significantly, Lundquist and Olivera (3.Lundquist R. Olivera B. Cell. 1982; 31: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) made their DNA substrates by polymerase-catalyzed primer extension, whereas the other studies used synthetic oligonucleotides in which the possibilities for branch migration were more limited.Our data suggest the following scenario for the processing of a DNA substrate by Pol I (Fig. 9). The polymerase extends the upstream primer strand, in some cases proceeding beyond the junction with the downstream DNA. Branch migration can then generate a family of interconvertible structures. Double-flap structures with a single frayed base at the primer terminus will be the most readily cleaved by the 5′-nuclease, generating a nick that discourages binding of the polymerase, allowing access of DNA ligase. Other conformations will lack the full complement of contacts to the 5′-nuclease domain and will therefore be cleaved less rapidly, allowing time for further rearrangement to a more optimal substrate or generating a product that can undergo additional cycles of extension and cleavage.Coupling of Polymerase and 5′-NucleaseWhen both polymerase and 5′-nuclease are covalently linked in whole Pol I, the fraction of product molecules that have undergone both reactions is greater than when polymerase and nuclease are on separate molecules, implying that both enzymatic reactions can take place within the same protein-DNA binding event. Given the greater binding affinity and reaction rate at the polymerase active site, the most likely scenario is that the polymerase acts first, giving a DNA intermediate that is then cleaved by the 5′-nuclease. Covalent linkage of the two domains delivers a high effective concentration of the 5′-nuclease, compensating for the rather weak binding of DNA to this domain. Nevertheless, the majority of the DNA molecules extended by the polymerase dissociate rather than become substrates for the 5′-nuclease, and this probably argues against an active mode of channeling the DNA intermediate from one active site to the other. Instead, coupling of the two activities may involve partial dissociation of the DNA from one active site followed by capture by the other active site before it is lost into the bulk solution.Polymerase activity is also coupled to variable extents to some of the other auxiliary functions present in polymerases. Coupling between the polymerase and 3′-5′-editing exonuclease activity is rather limited in Klenow fragment (19.Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10858-10866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but greater in T4 and T7 DNA polymerases, where the 3′-5′ exonuclease reaction is more rapid and therefore competes more effectively with dissociation (34.Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35.Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). By contrast, there appears to be tight coupling between polymerase and RNase H activity in human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase (36.Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10763-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The important difference may be that in reverse transcriptase the nucleic acid substrate is able to contact both polymerase and RNase H sites simultaneously (37.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), whereas a DNA substrate has to transfer between the polymerase and editing sites of DNA polymerases. The coupling we have observed between polymerase and 5′-nuclease is not necessarily restricted to those systems in which the two activities are covalently linked. The activity of the bacteriophage T4 5′-nuclease (T4 RNase H) on the lagging strand may be integrated with the rest of the T4 replication complex through an interaction with the gene 32 single-stranded-binding protein (38.Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the eukaryotic FEN-1 enzymes may be localized at the replication fork by association with the processivity factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (39.Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.-L. Burgers P.M.J. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The DNA polymerase I (Pol I)1 enzymes of eubacteria function in DNA repair and in the removal of RNA primers from Okazaki fragments during lagging strand replication (1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992Google Scholar). To facilitate the formation of ligatable structures, the bacterial Pol I enzymes usually have nuclease activity, which degrades the downstream DNA or RNA strand. Originally described as a 5′-3′ exonuclease, this activity is now recognized to be a structure-specific nuclease with specificity for the junction between a DNA duplex and a 5′-single-stranded tail (or flap) and is therefore better described as a 5′-nuclease (2.Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1993; 260: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). On a nicked DNA duplex, polymerase-catalyzed primer extension continuously regenerates the substrate for the 5′-nuclease, so that the polymerase effectively drives nick translation (3.Lundquist R. Olivera B. Cell. 1982; 31: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 5′-nuclease activity of Pol I is present on an independent structural domain encoded by the first one-third of the structural gene, which can be separated from the polymerase by proteolysis or by recombinant DNA manipulations (4.Klenow H. Overgaard-Hansen K. FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5.Setlow P. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 232-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Xu Y.

Oncostatin M, a known endotoxin-responsive proinflammatory cytokine, proved to be an effective inhibitor of renin gene expression. Suppression by oncostatin M involves activated STAT5 and requires an inhibitory element in the renin promoter that functions separately from cell type-specific enhancer elements. The renal acute phase reaction, unlike the liver acute phase reaction, is more strongly dependent on locally produced inflammatory factors. acute phase protein cAMP response element-binding protein distal enhancer element green fluorescent protein interleukin leukemia inhibitory factor lipopolysaccharide negative regulatory element oncostatin M serum amyloid A signal transducer and activator of transcription tissue inhibitor for metalloproteinase-1 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase tumor necrosis factor kilobase(s) Tissue damage, infection, or endotoxin induces a local inflammatory reaction by the recruitment of an interacting network of effector cells and intercellular mediators (1.Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). The various cells respond through panels of inflammatory factors, which on one side augment the local response and, on the other side, enter circulation causing systemic propagation of the acute phase reaction. The liver response, in particular, stands out through the massive changes in acute phase plasma proteins. The local inflammatory response invariably affects endothelial cells, which in part through NO-mediated mechanisms effect relaxation of adjacent smooth muscle (2.Titheradge M.A Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3.Mashimo H. Goyal R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G745-G750PubMed Google Scholar). Vasodilation in turn assists in plasma effusion and extravasation of chemotactically mobilized leukocytes. The accompanying drop in blood pressure should serve generally as a signal for compensatory reaction to restore normal vascular tone by mobilization of the renin/angiotensin system.

In this study we identify a kidney response to endotoxin and systemic inflammatory mediators that involves an enhanced expression of plasma proteins generally associated with the liver acute phase reaction and a reduced expression of renin. The suppression of renin is contrasted by an induction of renal serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin, and TIMP-1.

As4.1 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 2193) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotica. Transfections were carried out with FuGene6 (4 μg of DNA and 6 μl of FuGene6) according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All transfections included 0.25 μg of pEGFP-N1 as marker, 3 μg of CAT reporter construct, and 0–0.75 μg of expression vector for transcription factors. Transfected cultures were passaged, and subcultures were treated in serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0–100 ng/ml of recombinant human IL-6 (Genetics Institute), LIF (Immunex Corp), epidermal growth factor (Collaborative Research), growth hormone (Genentech), mouse OSM (produced by transiently transfected COS cells; Ref. 16.Tanaka M.

A digital image of each GFP positive culture was taken under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon) with a SPOT camera, and fluorescence above background for a constant view area was quantitated in the NIH Image program version 1.62. The integrated net pixel values served as a measure for transfection efficiency. CAT activity in serially diluted cell extract was determined, normalized to the GFP signal for each culture, and expressed as relative CAT activity. Aliquots of cell extract were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrotransferred onto protean membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were reacted with primary antibodies to phosphotyrosine (py20, Transduction Laboratories; 4G10, Upstate Biotechnologies), STAT3 and STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphorylation-specific anti-STAT3, STAT5, and ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs), followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Capel) and visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SAA isoforms synthesized and secreted by As4.1 cells were identified by immunoblotting using isofrom-sepcific antibodies against mouse SAA proteins (generously provided by Dr. E. P. Benditt, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Adult (10–12 weeks old) male and female C57BL/6 mice received either two subdermal injections of 25 μl of turpentine on both flanks of the hind legs (sterile tissue injury model) or a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg of LPS in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/25 g of body weight (endotoxemia model). Each experimental series included 2–5 replicate animals/treatment. Treatment with phosphate-buffered saline alone served as control. To activate an OSM-specific systemic reaction, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 × 107plaque-forming units of the adenovirus with deletion of the early regions 1 and 3 region (17.Bett A.J.

RNAs were extracted from liver and kidney by the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots of 5–20 μg of total RNA were separated on a formaldehyde containing agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted with32P-labeled cDNAs to mouse renin, haptoglobin, SAA-3 or SAA-1, α1-protease inhibitor, or TIMP-1. The hybridization signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager scanning and analysis with the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). The digital image of the ethidium bromide stained 28 S rRNA band served as loading marker and was quantitated by analysis with the NIH Image program 1.62. The hybridization signal was normalized to the 28 S rRNA signal. In each experimental series, the mean value of the control animals was defined as 100%, and the values of each animal were then expressed relative to that control mean values. Two separate mouse models of in vivo inflammatory reactions were examined for effects on kidney. One model, the LPS-initiated intraperitoneal inflammation model, couples a systemic distribution of LPS and activation of endotoxin-responsive cells at different organ sites (19.Karima R. Matusmoto S. Higashi H. Matsushima K. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 20.Wiese A Brandenburg K. Ulmer A.J. Seydel U. Muller-Loennies S. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to produce inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, LIF, and OSM (21.Matsukawa A. Yoshinaga M.

Blood. 1999; 93: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second model, the turpentine-induced sterile tissue injury model, causes a confined but strong local inflammation and initiates a systemic acute phase reaction by means of humoral mediators of which IL-6 is the most significant component (24.Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). Within 24 h following LPS administration, the characteristic induction of the representative APPs, haptoglobin and SAA, was observed for liver (Fig. 1 A,bottom panel). Analysis of kidney RNA showed an appreciable induction of the same two plasma proteins, although the peak values observed were a fraction of those found for liver. The kidney RNA analysis also revealed a 2–3-fold LPS-mediated reduction of renin mRNA (Fig. 1, A, top panel, and B,left panel), which appeared to be inversely correlated with the prominent induction of TIMP-1 and SAA. A quantitatively distinct pattern of regulation was evident in animals undergoing turpentine-elicited tissue injury. It was more effective in inducing APP genes in the liver and of SAA and haptoglobin in the kidney but produced only a minor induction of TIMP-1 (Fig.1 A) and somewhat lower suppression of renin than LPS treatment (Fig. 1 B, left panel). The more prominent effects of turpentine induction on liver and kidney APP genes was attributed to systemically distributed cytokines, of which IL-6 is probably a major component (24.Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar, 25.Kaibara A. Espar N.J. Auffenberg T. Abouhamze A.S. Martin D. Kalra S. Moldawer L.L. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The LPS-specific activity was attributed to both systemically distributed (26.Naemura J.R. Radka S.F. Lymphokine Cytok. Res. 1993; 12: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar) and locally elicited production of inflammatory mediators that act on cells in the same tissue context. The particularly effective induction of TIMP-1 and reduction of renin may represent the effects of LPS-dependent renal mediators. To profile the effects of specific factors on renal gene regulation, we turned to the As4.1 murine kidney cell line that exhibits features characteristic of juxtaglomerular cells, such as prominent renin expression (27.Sigmund C.D. Okuyama K. Ingelfinger J. Jones C.A. Mullins J.J. Kane C. Kim U. Wu C.Z. Kenny L. Rustum Y. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19916-19922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were treated with cytokines predicted to be induced by LPS, namely OSM, IL-6, LIF, IL-1β, and TNFα (Fig. 1,C and D). Time course analysis indicated maximal effects on gene induction at 24 h of treatment (data not shown). OSM yielded the most prominent suppression of renin (Fig.1 B, right panel); smaller but significant reductions were also obtained with IL-6, IL1β, and TNFα (Fig.1 C and D). LIF appeared to be essentially ineffective (Fig. 1 C). Endotoxin was also able to act directly on As4.1 cells to reduce renin mRNA abundance (Fig.1 D). Additional specificity in cell response was noted in the strong induction of TIMP-1 by OSM (only weakly by IL-6) and the more effective regulation of SAA by IL-1β, TNFα, and endotoxin. Analysis of As4.1 mRNA (28.Thompson H.A. Burson J.M. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3037-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and cellular and secreted proteins by anti-SAA immunoglobulins indicated that As4.1 cells expressed only the SAA-3 gene (data not shown). Although the expression and regulation of renin, TIMP-1 and SAA genes in As4.1 cells mirrored responses observed for total kidney in vivo, the As4.1 cells differed from kidney by not expressing haptoglobin and α1-protease inhibitor. The combination of OSM with IL-1β, TNFα, or endotoxin gave distinct patterns of gene regulation. Although all combinations were more inhibitory on renin expression than each factor alone, only the combination of OSM and IL-1β synergistically enhanced expression of SAA (Fig. 1 C). The other combinations showed mutually reduced action on the SAA gene (Fig. 1 D). We next tested the effects of dexamethasone in combination with cytokines on As4.1 cells, in an attempt to mimic the composition of effectors presumed to exist during the inflammatory response after activation of the hypothalamic-adrenal axis in vivo. In As4.1 cells, dexamethasone reduced renin expression but also attenuated OSM-stimulation of TIMP-1 expression (Fig. 1 C). The divergent actions of OSM, i.e. suppression of renin and induction of TIMP-1, followed the same OSM dose dependence with maximal effect measured at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1 E). The induction of genes in As4.1 cells exhibited identical OSM dose responses as the induction of APP genes in hepatic cells, 3Y. Wang, O. Robledo, E. Kinzie, F. Blanchard, C. D. Richards, A. Miyajima, and H. Baumann, submitted for publication. suggesting common signaling mechanisms. As4.1 cells offered the opportunity to identify the signal transduction pathways utilized. Short term treatment with a panel of cytokines indicated a most active OSM response system recognized by the relatively high levels of phosphorylated STAT3, STAT5, and ERKs (Fig.2 A). The IL-6 response exhibited a strong STAT3 activation but lower effects on STAT5 and ERK. The low LIF responsiveness of As4.1 cells was confirmed. The signaling pattern of IL-6 cytokines as regards the relative involvement of STAT and ERK pathways was contrasted by the action of EGF and growth hormone, which primarily affected ERK and STAT5, respectively (Fig.2 A). IL-6 and OSM elicited a half-maximal response at 1–10 ng/ml (Fig. 2 B). The OSM dose response at the level of immediate signaling (Fig. 2 B) closely correlated with the change in renin and TIMP-1 mRNA abundance (Fig. 1 E) The transcriptional effects of OSM were tested in transiently transfected As4.1 cells (Fig.3 A). As4.1 cells supported a minor induction of the OSM-responsive, STAT5-sensitive test construct p(8xHRRE)-CAT, whereas the 4.1-kb renin-CAT construct yielded a prominent basal expression that was reduced by OSM and other effectors. The relative rank order of activities in the transfection reporter assay were comparable with those detected at the level of renin mRNA abundance (Fig. 3 A versus Fig. 1,C and D). The profile of regulation for the transfected TIMP-1 promoter contrasted sharply with that observed for the renin promoter, and the robust induction of the TIMP-1-CAT construct by OSM was in accordance with regulation of the endogenous TIMP-1 gene. A strong contributing activity of OSM-activated STAT proteins was suggested. The prominent cell type-specific expression of the 4.1-kb renin-CAT construct has been described to depend on two critical elements: a promoter proximal element at position −60 and a distal enhancer element (DEE) at position −2690 (11.Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A set of promoter truncations and mutations was tested to localize the functional element(s) responsible for OSM suppression (Fig. 3 B). With deletion of the DEE, essentially all expression was abolished. Removal of the intervening sequence between DEE and position −117 reduced the basal expression of the promoter less than 2-fold but eliminated suppression by OSM. The mutation of a cAMP response element modulator/CREB-binding element within the DEE reduced basal expression but did not reintroduce either positive or negative responsiveness to OSM. By retaining more 5′ flanking sequence upstream of −117, the region from −694 to −365 was found to restore full sensitivity to OSM inhibition of promoter activity. This region contains at −650 a negative regulatory element (NRE) that has been suggested to exert an inhibitory activity on constitutive expression of the renin gene (29.Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Morishita R. Zhang L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify signaling molecules that potentially connect the OSMR to the renin gene regulatory element, we assessed the relative contribution of the particularly strong activated ERK and STAT pathways (Fig. 2 A). Inhibition of MEK-1 by U0126 during OSM treatment did not affect OSM inhibition (Fig.4 A). Dominant negative A-Fos was unable to modify promoter activity. In contrast, the dominant negative A-CREB essentially abolished all promoter activity, likely through neutralization of the DEE-interacting cAMP response element modulator/CREB proteins.2 Overexpression of the dominant negative STAT3Δ55C was inconsequential; however, the dominant negative STAT5BΔ40C severely reduced basal expression, as well as expression in OSM-treated cells (Fig. 4 A). The inhibition by STAT5BΔ40C in the absence of OSM treatment probably reflected the elevated DNA binding activity of STAT5 proteins as a result of overexpression (30.Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 13704-13708Google Scholar). The same inhibitors and dominant negative transcription factors were used to characterize the regulation of the TIMP-1-CAT reporter gene construct. A fundamentally different, inverse pattern of action was observed. In this case, U0126 inhibition of MEK lowered the OSM-dependent OSM induction. Similarly, A-Fos, the dominant forms for STAT3 and STAT5 reduced TIMP-1-CAT expression (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the probable mode of STAT5BΔ40C inhibition of renin promoter activity was mediated via the NRE-containing region, different length promoter proximal 5′-flanking regions linked to the DEE were challenged by OSM treatment in the presence of overexpressed STAT5BΔ40C (Fig. 4 C). Significant suppression was evident for the −696 promoter construct, which included the NRE. The suppression of basal and OSM-induced inhibition by truncated STAT5 suggest that interaction of STAT5 either directly with the DNA site or indirectly through an the NRE-associated component is sufficient to obtain inhibition. That STAT5B, with or without the C-terminal transactivation domain, could act as an inhibitor was confirmed by demonstrating that suppression of renin promoter activity by overexpressed wild type STAT5B occurred to the same extent as observed for truncated STAT5B (Fig. 4 C). The combined results from the tissue culture analyses strongly support a prominent renin suppressing activity of OSM that in part could account for the effects observed in kidneys of LPS-treated mice (Fig.1, A and B, left panel). To directly assess an inhibitory activity of OSM in vivo, we next determined renin mRNA levels in the kidneys of mice infected with an adenoviral vector expressing murine OSM (Fig.5). Whereas the animals infected with control virus did not show appreciable changes in APP expression, the AdmOSM-treated animals demonstrated within 48 h an enhanced level of liver APP mRNA and serum APP levels that were characteristic for OSM and a prominent reduction of renin mRNA in the kidney. Taken together, these data support the notion that endotoxin action in kidney, presumably by resident macrophages, may involve the local production of OSM, which, together with other inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin, suppresses renin expression in juxtaglomerular cellsin vivo by mechanisms comparable with that observed for As4.1 cells in vitro. The inflammation-specific reduction of renin expression identifies this gene product as a potential negative acute phase reactant. Although secretion of renin, a regulated process in juxtaglomerular cells, may not precisely track the kinetics of the acute phase-induced reduction observed for renin mRNA levels during the chronic stage of inflammatory reaction, a decrease in the RPC is expected that likely will assume physiologically relevant consequences for blood pressure homeostasis. At issue in this study is the cell type-specific regulation of APP production and the relative role of specific inflammatory cytokines. Although the hepatic induction of APP genes and the synthesis of their cognate products clearly represents a dominant process systemically, the availability or accumulation of the individual plasma proteins in physiologically significant levels at distant sites of inflammation may require on the order several hours to occur. An alternative mechanism to gain protective APPs at sites of inflammation has been suggested to occur through local production. Extrahepatic APP synthesis has been noted in organs such as lung and intestine that are especially exposed to insults (31.Schreiber G. Aldred A.R. Mackiewicy A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins, Molecular Biology, Biochmistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 39-76Google Scholar). Our data indicate that kidney possesses a capability to carry out a similar process that involves positively and negatively affected genes. The response of As4.1 cells suggests that the positive APPs comprise a cellular response for juxtaglomerular cells in situ that is similar to that identified for interstitial myofibroblasts and mediated by the same signal transduction systems as the inhibition of renin (32.Duymelinck C. Deng J.-T. Dauwe S.E.H. De Broe M.E. Verpooten G.A. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 804-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The primary regulators of positive as well as negative APP have emerged as IL-1- and IL-6-type cytokines. Increased transcription of various APP genes is attributable to the action of specific sets of transcription factors that generally include CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β and nuclear factor κB, stimulated primarily by IL-1 cytokines, and STAT3 and AP-1 components, stimulated by IL-6 cytokines. The mode of regulation of negative APPs is less well understood but appears to involve in part the same transcription factors as those acting on positive APP genes (33.Qian X. Samadani U. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The contrasting regulatory action of OSM on renin versusTIMP-1 gene expression in As4.1 cells revealed a novel mechanism. Although transcriptional activity of the renin gene appears to be moderated by a number of proinflammatory cytokines and dexamethasone (Fig. 1), the signaling through OSMR emerged as particularly effective. The identification of STAT5 as an inhibitor of renin gene expression explains in part the OSM effect, as OSMR signaling, unlike that of the other IL-6 cytokine receptors, involves STAT5 as a major signal-transducing component. The observation that other effectors, such as LPS, IL-1β, TNFα, and dexamethasone, and even to some extent IL-6, all of which are not associated with prominent STAT5 activation, can also reduce renin expression implies that STAT5 is not the exclusive suppressor of renin but that additional pathways act on renin gene expression. The identity of those intracellular mediators and their genetic targets within the renin gene remain to be established. STAT5 has been recognized to be a preferred substrate for activation by several hematopoietin receptors and generally been associated with stimulated transcription (34.Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). The inhibition of renin by STAT5 involves a mode of action that appears to be distinct from its stimulatory functions. Moreover, although there is a clear requirement for specific promoter elements, the suppression effect is manifested irrespectively of the presence of the transactivating domain on STAT5. Precedent for such an inhibitory activity has been reported recently for STAT5 in regulation of the IRF-1 promoter by prolactin (35.Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have been unable to identify a STAT5-binding element in the renin promoter or to detect a direct physical interaction of activated STAT5B with the region containing the NRE. 4H. Baumann, Y. Wang, C. D. Richards, C. A. Jones, T. A. Black, and K. W. Gross, unpublished results. Conceivably, STAT5 may bind to DNA recognition sequences, but that interaction is undetectable by the in vitro assay conditions employed, or STAT5 may be acting indirectly through association with other transcription factors (squelching). In either case, we would expect that STAT5 exerts its transcriptional suppression by interfering with the strong transcriptional regulators of the renin gene. Our results demonstrate the regulatory capability of the kidney in response to an acute inflammatory process. Preliminary results with animals treated repeatedly with LPS for several days indicate a persistent expression patterns of enhanced APPs and reduced renin.4 Yet to be determined is the influence of inflammatory stimuli, which are expected to be present during chronic renal inflammatory diseases. Long term intrarenal tissue damage, coupled with inflammatory cell activities, would inevitably introduce new conditions that will affect the regulatory phenotype of the kidney. This will include not only an adaptive regulation of the renin/angiotensin system but also a profound tissue repair reaction that results in a change in tissue composition, as best exemplified by interstitial fibrosis (32.Duymelinck C.

P19 clones stably expressing constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of MEKK1 and MEKK4 were created and characterized. Expression of the constitutively active form of either MEKK1 or MEKK4 mimicked the action of retinoic acid, inducing these embryonal carcinoma cells to primitive endoderm. Expression of the dominant negative form of MEKK1 had no influence on the ability of retinoic acid to induce either JNK activation or primitive endoderm formation in P19 stem cells. Expression of the dominant negative form of MEKK4, in contrast, effectively blocks both morphogen-induced activation of JNK and cellular differentiation. These data identify MEKK4 as upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the pathway mediating differentiation of P19 stem cells to primitive endoderm. Differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells in response to the morphogen retinoic acid is regulated by Gα12/13 and is associated with activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Various G-proteins have been shown to regulate features of cellular differentiation. Gαs suppresses adipogenesis of the NIH 3T3-L1 embryonal fibroblasts, which can be relieved by loss of Gαs in response to inducers of differentiation and mimicked with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to Gαs (2Wang H.Y.

Overexpression of wild-type Gαi2 or its Q205L constitutively activated mutant can induce differentiation in these 3T3-LI cells (3Su H.L. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Am. J.

The activation of protein kinase C and the ERK1/21 members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family is the basis for morphogen-induced differentiation of these totipotent F9 cells (9Gao P.

Retroviral infection with a vector expressing RNA antisense to Gαi2, but not one expressing RNA antisense to either Gαo or Gαs, provokes a decline in Gαi2 and differentiation to primitive endoderm in the absence of morphogen (7Watkins D.C.

Three germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm, can be derived from P19 cells through the use of appropriate culture conditions and an inducer(s) (18Jones-Villeneuve E.M.

Retinoic acid stimulates P19 cells to differentiate into primitive endoderm, as defined by the loss of the embryonic antigen SSEA-1 and positive staining with the TROMA antibody, specific for the cytokeratin endo A protein that is the hallmark of the endodermal phenotype (19Jones-Villeneuve E.M. McBurney M.W. Rogers KA Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). RA-induced differentiation is accompanied by the expression of Gα13 and activation of JNK, but neither ERK1/2 or p38 members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (20Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of the constitutively active mutant form of Gα13 activates JNK and induces P19 clones to differentiate into primitive endoderm in the absence of RA induction. In addition, expression of the dominant negative form of JNK1 blocks the ability of the morphogen to induce the cells to primitive endoderm (20Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the linkage from Gα13 to JNK activation in P19 cell differentiation, we explored the upstream control of JNK activation, focusing on the potential roles of two mitogen and extracellularly activated protein kinase kinases, MEKK1 and MEKK4 (22Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 23Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The results provide compelling evidence that MEKK4 mediates the signaling from retinoic acid to JNK and differentiation in these embryonic carcinoma cells.RESULTSRat embryonic carcinoma P19 cells were stably transfected with the expression vectors harboring WT, CA, and DN mutant forms of either MEKK1 or MEKK4 (23Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Endogenous MEKK1 and MEKK4 were identified in immunoblots of extracts of P19, mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3-L1, and human epidermoid carcinoma cells subjected first to SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). MEKK1 is subject to ready proteolysis with a terminal, long lived fragments displaying molecular masses of ∼100 kDa and ∼115 kDa, as observed in P19 and 3T3-L1 cells. The full-length form is observed in the blot of A431 cells shown here. MEEK4, likewise, is cleaved to a terminal, long lived fragment displaying a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa in blots prepared from P19, 3T3-L1, and A431 cells. Thus, both MEKK1 and MEKK4 are present in P19 cells, and both kinases are sensitive to proteolytic cleavage. These cleavages of MEKK family members are believed to be a normal and necessary processing step in their biological activation (26Fanger B.O. Wade A.C. Cardin A.D. Regul. Pept. 1991; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).HA-tagged forms of MEKK1 WT and CA and DN mutant forms were stably expressed, and extracts of these clones were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the HA epitope (Fig.1 B). Much like that observed for the endogenous MEKKs, MEKK1 and MEKK4 wild-type and mutant forms were subject to proteolytic cleavage to a limit digest of ∼100 kDa. Multiple clones were prepared and characterized for stable transfection of each construct. The immunoblotting reveals similar levels of expression for wild-type and mutant forms of MEKK1 and for those of MEKK4, although the level of expression for MEKK1 was consistently greater than that observed for MEKK4. The identity of the stained species of wild-types MEKK1 and MEKK4 as HA-tagged was confirmed by use of the HA-blocking peptide (Fig. 1 C). In the presence of the HA antigen, the staining of the HA-tagged MEKK1 and MEKK4 forms was virtually abolished. Similar experiments performed with the HA-tagged mutant versions of either MEKK displayed the same sensitivity to blocking by the HA antigen peptide (data not shown).The various forms of MEKK1 and MEKK4 expressed in P19 cells were examined for their ability to phosphorylate a common substrate. The HA-tagged mutant MEKKs were immunoprecipitated from whole-cell lysates from P19 clones, and their ability to catalyze the phosphorylation of the substrate, rGST-JNKK1 protein, was evaluated for multiple clones from each of the stable transfections (Fig. 1 D). The results of representative assays reveal that the expression of the DN forms of either MEKK resulted in a blunted phosphorylation of rGST-JNKK1 in comparison with that of extracts from cells expressing the WT forms of each MEKK. Expression of the constitutively activated forms of MEKK1 and MEKK4 provoked a sharp increase in the phosphorylation of their downstream substrate, JNKK1.Assay of JNK activity in the whole-cell extracts of the clones expressing WT, CA, or DN forms of MEKK1 using a GST-c-Jun fusion protein as a read-out confirms the increased activation of JNK1 in the clones overexpressing WT-MEKK1 or expressing the CA-MEKK1 (Fig.2 A). JNK1 activity increased ∼3-fold in the clones overexpressing CA-MEKK1 as well as in the clones expressing WT-MEKK1. The P19 clones expressing the DN form of MEKK1 displayed a low level of JNK1 activity, similar to that of the clones harboring the empty expression vector. Most interestingly, expression of CA-MEKK1 was sufficient to induce differentiation of P19 cells to an endodermal phenotype in the absence of the morphogen RA, as evidenced by positive staining with the TROMA antibody (Fig.2 B). The positive staining of P19 clones expressing CA-MEKK1 was similar to that of the P19 clones transfected with empty vector alone that had been induced to differentiate to primitive endoderm with RA. The expression of the WT-MEKK1 also induced the P19 clones to differentiate and stain positive for TROMA. In sharp contrast to the clones expressing either WT-MEKK1 or CA-MEKK1, those expressing DN-MEKK1 display no positive staining for TROMA. Staining of the SSEA-1 embryonic antigen was negative for clones expressing WT-MEKK1 or CA-MEKK1 and positive for the clones expressing the DN-MEKK1 (not shown).Figure 2Expression of wild-type and constitutively active MEKK1 induces differentiation in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Cells were transfected with WT, CA, and DN forms of MEKK1 that were N-terminal-tagged with the HA peptide. Stably transfected clones were analyzed for the level of expression of the proteins, JNK1 activity, and phenotypic changes. A, cell lysates were resolved on a 10% acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The immunoblot was probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against the HA peptide. Solid-phase JNK1 assay was performed on immunoprecipitates obtained by immunoprecipitating the cell lysate on protein A/G-agarose beads using a polyclonal antibody to JNK1. Bacterially expressed recombinant protein, GST-c-Jun, was employed as a substrate. The phosphorylation product was analyzed on a 10% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE and processed for autoradiography. A replicate of the immunoprecipitates was used to detect the level of JNK1 protein by immunoblotting followed by probing with a polyclonal antibody to JNK1. The data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments for each. B, cells overexpressing different forms of MEKK1 were cultured in chamber slides and processed for immunofluorescence using an antibody to cytokeratin endo-A (TROMA-1), the marker protein for primitive endoderm.

EV, empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effects of addition of RA to the clones expressing the CA form of MEKK1 on JNK activation and on the differentiation process was examined (Fig. 3). RA alone stimulates a 2–3-fold increase in the activity of JNK1, as measured using the GST-c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate. The expression of the CA form of MEKK1 yields about the same level of activation of JNK1. Challenging the clones that express the CA-MEKK1 with the morphogen RA failed to increase the level of JNK1 activity beyond that observed with either CA-MEKK1 expression or RA treatment alone, suggesting that the effects were not additive. In each of the trials, RA treatment of the clones expressing CA-MEKK1 resulted in a modest (<20%) decline in JNK1 activity. Companion studies of indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of the clones expressing the CA form of MEKK1 reveal the absence of the SSEA-1 antigen and the strong, positive staining of the endodermal marker antigen with TROMA for both the clones expressing CA-MEKK1 in the absence or presence of RA (Fig. 3 B). These data agree well with the measurements of JNK1 activity and suggest that the effects for RA and expression of CA-MEKK1 in the differentiation of the P19 cells are non-additive in nature.Figure 3Differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells in response to expression of constitutively active MEKK1 is not enhanced further by retinoic acid. P19 clones overexpressing constitutively active forms of MEKK1 and clones harboring the “empty” expression vector were treated with retinoic acid (10 nm) for 2 days while cultured in aggregates in bacterial grade Petri dishes. Treatment of retinoic acid was conducted for 2 additional days after seeding the cells in tissue culture grade Petri dishes. Aliquots of the cell suspensions were seeded also in chamber slides. A, cells treated with retinoic acid for 4 days were harvested, and crude cell lysate was prepared. JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using antibody to JNK1. Solid-phase kinase assay was performed on the immu- noprecipitates using the recombinant GST-c-Jun as a substrate. The kinase assay products were analyzed on a 10% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE. A replicate of the immunoprecipitates was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection of the JNK1 was performed using an antibody to JNK1. The gels were stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. B, cells cultured simultaneously in chamber slides were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence detection of phenotype-specific marker proteins. Endodermal marker, cytokeratin endo A (TROMA-1), and embryonal marker SSEA-1 were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Both phase contrast (PC) and epifluorescence (IIF) images are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In view of the ability of overexpression of MEKK1 or expression of the CA-MEKK1 to induce differentiation much like RA does, the effects of expression of the DN form of MEKK1 on the ability of RA to induce differentiation was investigated (Fig.4). Measurements of JNK1 activity using the GST-c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate show the ability of the DN-MEKK1 to suppress JNK activity in the cells unchallenged with morphogen while not preventing the ability of RA to induce a 4-fold activation of JNK1 (Fig. 4 A). RA induces a loss in staining of SSEA-1 and an increase in TROMA staining in the clones harboring the expression vector, which is “empty” (EV), in good agreement with the results obtained with wild-type P19 cells. Interestingly, the expression of the dominant negative form of MEKK1 failed to influence the ability of RA to differentiate the P19 clones to primitive endoderm. The clones expressing DN-MEKK1 lost SSEA-1 staining and displayed positive staining by TROMA in response to RA. Although overexpression of WT-MEKK1 and expression of CA-MEKK1 can cause the P19 stem cells to differentiate, mimicking the effects of RA itself, MEKK1 does not appear to play an obligate role in the signaling of this process.Figure 4Retinoic acid induces differentiation of P19 cells overexpressing a dominant negative form of MEKK1. P19 clones harboring empty expression vector and clones overexpressing the DN form of MEKK1 were analyzed for JNK1 activity of whole-cell lysates and for phenotype. Cells were treated with 10 nm RA, as aggregates seeded on bacterial-grade Petri dishes. After 2 days of treatment, the aggregates were dissociated and cultured on tissue culture dishes for an additional period of 2 days in the presence of RA (+ RA).A, whole-cell lysates were prepared from each sets of conditions. JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using antibody to JNK1. Solid-phase kinase assay was performed on the immunoprecipitates using the recombinant GST-c-Jun as a substrate. The kinase assay products were analyzed on a 10% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE. A replicate of the immunoprecipitates was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection of the JNK1 was performed using an antibody to JNK1. The gels were stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. B, aliquots of the cell suspensions were cultured simultaneously in chamber slides. At the end of the retinoic acid treatment, cells were harvested for further analysis. Cells grown in chamber slides were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody (TROMA) to the endodermal marker antigen, cytokeratin endo A. A duplicate set of cells was immunostained with an antibody to an embryonic marker-specific antigen, SSEA-1. Both phase contrast and epifluorescence images are displayed. The results are representative of at least three separate experiments.

Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), MEKK4 was explored for its possible role in RA-induced differentiation of P19 cells. Analysis of the JNK1 activity of the whole-cell extracts from clones expressing WT and CA forms of MEKK4 reveals a 2.5-fold and a 4.0-fold increase in JNK1 activity, respectively, using the GST-c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate for phosphorylation. The measurements of JNK1 activity agree well with the phenotypic changes in the clones overexpressing WT-MEKK4 or expressing CA-MEKK4 (Fig.5 A). The clones expressing the DN mutant of MEKK4 displayed low JNK1 activity, as predicted from the dominant negative nature of the MEKK4 construct. Much like the effects of overexpression of the wild-type form and expression of the constitutively active form of MEKK1, the analogous forms of MEKK4 were found to provoke differentiation of P19 clones (Fig. 5 B). Based upon positive staining of the endodermal marker TROMA, clones overexpressing WT-MEKK4 and CA-MEKK4 differentiate in the absence of the morphogen RA, displaying cell morphologies and staining patterns not unlike the P19 clones harboring the empty vector upon treatment with RA. The clones expressing the DN form of MEKK4, in sharp contrast to those expressing either WT- or CA-MEKK4, displayed no TROMA staining.Figure 5Expression of wild-type and constitutively active MEKK4 induces differentiation in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Cells were transfected with WT, CA, and DN forms of MEKK4 that were N-terminal-tagged with the HA peptide.

EV, empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The clones expressing the CA-MEKK4 were challenged with RA in an effort to ascertain if the differentiation process was sensitive to the morphogen (Fig. 6). The measurements of JNK1 activity reveal a 2.0-fold increase in phosphorylation of the GST-c-Jun fusion protein with samples from the P19 clones harboring the empty vector following challenge with RA (Fig. 6 A). The expression of CA-MEKK4 was accompanied by a 3.5-fold increase in JNK1 activity, correlating well with the differentiation of these cells to primitive endoderm. When the clones expressing the CA-MEKK4 were challenged with RA, the amount of JNK1 activity displayed a reproducible, modest decline. This modest decline in JNK1 activity in response to RA for the clones expressing CA-MEKK4 was similar to the decline also noted in the clones expressing CA-MEKK1 following challenge with RA. Constitutively active MEKK4 provokes differentiation to primitive endoderm and prominent staining by the TROMA antibody. SSEA-1 staining is absent in the clones expressing CA-MEKK4, confirming the loss of the embryonic state and differentiation to endoderm (Fig.6 B). When treated with RA, the clones expressing CA-MEKK4 appeared much like the clones not exposed to RA, with the phenotypic morphology and prominent staining with TROMA.Figure 6Differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells in response to expression of constitutively active MEKK4 is not enhanced further by retinoic acid.

Unlike the effects observed in the clones expressing the DN form of MEKK1, the expression of the DN-MEKK4 was associated with a loss in the ability of the morphogen both to activate JNK and to induce differentiation of the P19 clones (Fig. 7). Expression of the DN form of MEKK4 potently suppressed JNK activity, well below the ambient levels of JNK in the clones harboring the empty vector and in the absence of morphogen (Fig. 7 A). Clones expressing the dominant negative form of MEKK4 display positive staining with antibodies for SSEA-1 embryonic antigen (Fig. 7 B), indicating that the clones maintained an embryonic phenotype, even in the face of a challenge with the morphogen RA. TROMA staining of the clones expressing DN-MEKK4 was negative, also reflecting the embryonic phenotype of these clones made resistant to the actions of RA through loss of MEKK4-mediated signaling.Figure 7P19 cells overexpressing dominant negative MEKK4 fail to differentiate in response to retinoic acid.

In the present study, we have generated rats harboring a dominant negative ERα, which inhibits the actions of not only ERα but also recently identified ERβ. Contrary to our expectation, the bone mineral density (BMD) of the resulting transgenic female rats was maintained at the same level with that of the wild-type littermates when sham-operated. In addition, ovariectomy-induced bone loss was observed almost equally in both groups. Strikingly, however, the BMD of the transgenic female rats, after ovariectomized, remained decreased even if 17β-estradiol (E2) was administrated, whereas, in contrast, the decrease of littermate BMD was completely prevented by E2. Moreover, bone histomorphometrical analysis of ovariectomized transgenic rats revealed that the higher rates of bone turnover still remained after treatment with E2. These results demonstrate that the prevention from the ovariectomy-induced bone loss by estrogen is mediated by ER pathways and that the maintenance of BMD before ovariectomy might be compensated by other mechanisms distinct from ERα and ERβ pathways.

However, the precise mechanism of ER responsible for the bone metabolism remains to be understood.Both classical ERα and recently identified ERβ (7.Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S.

Several studies have suggested that the estrogen action mediated by ERα cause the mineralization of bone-forming cells, the osteoblasts (10.Komm B.S. Terpening C.M. Benz D.J. Graeme K.A. Gallegos A.

On the other hand, it is reported that the estrogen response element (ERE)-mediated transcription is not necessarily observed in the mineralizing process, suggesting the existence of the estrogen-induced but ER-independent signaling pathways (13.Takeuchi M. Tokin M. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).In contrast to the report of a man homozygous for ERα gene mutation who suffered from severe osteoporosis based on the increased bone turnover (14.Smith E.P.

Schomberg D.W. Smith E.P. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 159-186PubMed Google Scholar). The unclear phenotypes of ERαKO mice in the bone may be partly because of the possible compensation of ERα-mediated cascade by ERβ, as well as the involvement of the so-called non-genomic action of estrogen. These possibilities are also suggested in the vascular walls of ERαKO mice, which show a response to estrogen similar to that of wild-type mice when they were injured (18.Iafrati M.D. Karas R.H. Aronovitz M. Kim S. Sullivan Jr., T.R. Lubahn D.B. O'Donnell Jr., T.F. Korach K.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 19.Gustafsson J.Å. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 493-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).We have recently demonstrated that a dominant negative mutant of human ERα constructed by C-terminal truncation, namely ERα-(1–530), blocked both ERα and ERβ signaling pathways (20.Ogawa S. Inoue S. Orimo A. Hosoi T. Ouchi Y. Muramatsu M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to clarify the roles of ERs in exerting the physiological effects of estrogen, we introduced the expression vector encoding the corresponding mutant of rat ERα, namely rERα-(1–535), into rats, thereby inhibiting both ERα and ERβ signaling pathways in vivo. Taking advantage of the analytical merits of rat as a species for the physiological and the histomorphometrical studies over that of mice (21.Mullins J.J. Peters J. Ganten D. Nature. 1990; 344: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 22.Morimura S. Suzuki T. Hochi S. Yuki A. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Nagatsu I. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2065-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we studied effects of estrogen on the bone metabolism using these transgenic rats. As a result, we have established a transgenic animal model with the impaired estrogen sensitivity in the bone, exhibiting the decreased mineralizing response after ovariectomy followed by 17β-estradiol (E2) administration.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have established the rats antagonizing both ERα and ERβ pathways in vivo and demonstrated for the first time that the ovariectomy-induced bone loss was prevented by the ER-mediated signaling pathways.Southern blot analysis of the DNA from each of the transgenic rat line indicated different sites of insertion of the transgene (data not shown). This allows us to conclude that the bone phenotypes observed were consequences of expression of transgene rather than insertional mutagenesis. The rERα-(1–535) transcript was expressed in various kinds of tissues including bone. Assuming that the expression of the transgene remains rather constant throughout the target tissues, the relative ratio of transgene product to endogenous product should become greater in the tissues where the expression of endogenous ERs is lower. For example, in transgenic primary osteoblast-like cells, the rERα-(1–535) protein detected by Western blotting is abundant enough to cause the complete inhibition of the E2-dependent transactivation by endogenous ERs. We could not detect the endogenous ER proteins in osteoblast-like cells using anti-ERα and anti-ERβ antibodies by Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, it is suggested that the expression of the endogenous ER proteins confirmed by functional analysis here are under threshold levels of Western blot analysis. 1.4-fold higher serum E2level in transgenic rats, although it may not seem so remarkable compared with ERαKO mice, is statistically significant and reflects the reduced estrogen responsiveness. In the case of human, only a man with a point mutation of ERα was reported (14.Smith E.P. Boyd J. Frank G.R. Takahashi H. Cohen R.M. Specker B. Williams T.C. Lubahn D.B. Korach K.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar) and his serum E2 level (119 pg/ml) was remained approximately twice that the normal male serum concentration (50 pg/ml). The absence of reproductive abnormalities including uterine weight in transgenic rat might be partly because the differences in the dose-response curves for ER agonism and antagonism by the dominant negative transgene (34.Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are required for clarifying the ER-mediated transcriptional inhibition in other cells and tissues.The bone mineral measurements clearly revealed that the ovariectomy-induced bone loss was prevented through ER-mediated signaling pathway, and the data presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that ER plays a major role in the bone physiology (16.Korach K.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Histomorphometrical analysis supports the mechanism that the prevention from the high bone turnover due to ovariectomy was mediated by the ER cascades. The serum osteocalcin levels of the transgenic rats remained increased after ovariectomy followed by E2 administration, reflecting the high turnover state where both bone formation and its resorption are accelerated (25.Ducy P.

The reasons why the difference of BMD was not observed between sham-operated transgenic rats and their littermates still remain to be resolved. Taken together with that the bone density in the femurs is not significantly decreased in the ERαKO (16.Korach K.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 37.Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr.

This possibility is also supported from our results; the intact transgenic rats and littermates exhibited no difference in the distal femur BMD in the presence of pharmacological (100 nm) E2concentration. Alternatively, it may be possible that the dominant negative activity of rERα-(1–535) is not enough to inhibit ER-mediated pathways completely in this condition.Several studies have focused on the possible involvement of bone resorbing cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) (40.Pacifici R. Rifas L. McCracken R. Vered I. McMurtry C. Avioli L.V. Peck W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2398-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (41.Jilka R.L.

Nature. 1986; 319: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) in the stimulation of bone resorption due to estrogen deficiency (43.Pacifici R.

Estrogen is supposed to suppress the production of these cytokines by osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells (44.Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 45.Pacifici R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Although substantial lines of evidence regarding the protective effects against the bone loss caused by ovariectomy have been accumulated from the several transgenic animal models such as IL-6 (33.Poli V. Balena R. Fattori E. Markatos A. Yamamoto M. Tanaka H. Ciliberto G. Rodan G.A. Costantini F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1R1) (46.Lorenzo J.A. Naprta A. Rao Y. Alander C. Glaccum M. Widmer M. Gronowicz G. Kalinowski J.

Rizzoli R. Bonjour J.P. Bourrin S. Meyer J.M. Vassalli P. Garcia I. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), specific contribution of these cytokines to the bone loss due to estrogen deficiency still remains controversial. Moreover, whether ERs are directly responsible for the regulation of these estrogen-regulated cytokines is completely unknown.Our results demonstrated that the inhibition of ERα and ERβ still induced bone loss after ovariectomy to the same degree as that of littermates. If we assume that the dominant negative activity is sufficient to inhibit ER pathways as shown in the case of E2 treatment after ovariectomy, the regulation of the bone-resorbing cytokines by estrogen may be involved in ovariectomy-induced bone loss rather than the classical ER/ERE-dependent regulation. Alternatively, ovariectomy may cause some changes other than the decline of E2concentration in vivo, influencing the crucial effects in the bone metabolism. These possibilities are also supported by the results of the ERαKO (37.Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 47.Pan L.C. Ke H.Z. Simmons H.A.

Andersson G. Gustafsson J.Å. Ohlsson C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) mice showing the bone loss due to ovariectomy.In the present study, we have created a transgenic rat line with impaired estrogen sensitivity by expressing a dominant negative mutant against both ERα and ERβ in bone and other tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical usefulness of the rat as species, we thus opened a way to examine the physiological roles of estrogen through ER-dependent and ER-independent signaling pathways. Moreover, this study provides a mechanism for diseases caused by the dominant negative phenotypes of the mutations of nuclear receptors including ER. In practice, some patients with thyroid hormone resistance are caused by the heterozygous mutation of thyroid hormone receptor to its dominant negative mutant (48.Sakurai A. Miyamoto T. Refetoff S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 49.Chatterjee V.K. Nagaya T. Madison L.D. Datta S. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. J. Clin.

The forthcoming analyses of the bone phenotypes of the ERα/β double-knockout mice and the comparison with our animal model described here will give us further insights into the physiological and pathophysiological actions of estrogen in the bone metabolism. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone resorption due to estrogen deficiency (1.Lindsay R. Hart D.M. Aitken J.M. MacDonald E.B. Anderson J.B. Clarke A.C.

The supplement of estrogen markedly prevents the disease (3.Felson D.T. Zhang Y. Hannan M.T. Kiel D.P. Wilson P.W. Anderson J.J. N. Engl. J.

Action of estrogen is generally supposed to be mediated by estrogen receptor (ER),1 a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (4.Evans R.M.

However, the precise mechanism of ER responsible for the bone metabolism remains to be understood. Both classical ERα and recently identified ERβ (7.Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S.

Several studies have suggested that the estrogen action mediated by ERα cause the mineralization of bone-forming cells, the osteoblasts (10.Komm B.S. Terpening C.M. Benz D.J. Graeme K.A. Gallegos A.

Moreover, whether ERs are directly responsible for the regulation of these estrogen-regulated cytokines is completely unknown.Our results demonstrated that the inhibition of ERα and ERβ still induced bone loss after ovariectomy to the same degree as that of littermates. If we assume that the dominant negative activity is sufficient to inhibit ER pathways as shown in the case of E2 treatment after ovariectomy, the regulation of the bone-resorbing cytokines by estrogen may be involved in ovariectomy-induced bone loss rather than the classical ER/ERE-dependent regulation. Alternatively, ovariectomy may cause some changes other than the decline of E2concentration in vivo, influencing the crucial effects in the bone metabolism. These possibilities are also supported by the results of the ERαKO (37.Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 47.Pan L.C. Ke H.Z. Simmons H.A.

Taking advantage of the analytical usefulness of the rat as species, we thus opened a way to examine the physiological roles of estrogen through ER-dependent and ER-independent signaling pathways. Moreover, this study provides a mechanism for diseases caused by the dominant negative phenotypes of the mutations of nuclear receptors including ER. In practice, some patients with thyroid hormone resistance are caused by the heterozygous mutation of thyroid hormone receptor to its dominant negative mutant (48.Sakurai A. Miyamoto T. Refetoff S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 49.Chatterjee V.K. Nagaya T. Madison L.D. Datta S. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The forthcoming analyses of the bone phenotypes of the ERα/β double-knockout mice and the comparison with our animal model described here will give us further insights into the physiological and pathophysiological actions of estrogen in the bone metabolism. In this study, we have established the rats antagonizing both ERα and ERβ pathways in vivo and demonstrated for the first time that the ovariectomy-induced bone loss was prevented by the ER-mediated signaling pathways. Southern blot analysis of the DNA from each of the transgenic rat line indicated different sites of insertion of the transgene (data not shown). This allows us to conclude that the bone phenotypes observed were consequences of expression of transgene rather than insertional mutagenesis. The rERα-(1–535) transcript was expressed in various kinds of tissues including bone. Assuming that the expression of the transgene remains rather constant throughout the target tissues, the relative ratio of transgene product to endogenous product should become greater in the tissues where the expression of endogenous ERs is lower. For example, in transgenic primary osteoblast-like cells, the rERα-(1–535) protein detected by Western blotting is abundant enough to cause the complete inhibition of the E2-dependent transactivation by endogenous ERs. We could not detect the endogenous ER proteins in osteoblast-like cells using anti-ERα and anti-ERβ antibodies by Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, it is suggested that the expression of the endogenous ER proteins confirmed by functional analysis here are under threshold levels of Western blot analysis. 1.4-fold higher serum E2level in transgenic rats, although it may not seem so remarkable compared with ERαKO mice, is statistically significant and reflects the reduced estrogen responsiveness. In the case of human, only a man with a point mutation of ERα was reported (14.Smith E.P. Boyd J. Frank G.R. Takahashi H. Cohen R.M. Specker B. Williams T.C. Lubahn D.B. Korach K.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar) and his serum E2 level (119 pg/ml) was remained approximately twice that the normal male serum concentration (50 pg/ml). The absence of reproductive abnormalities including uterine weight in transgenic rat might be partly because the differences in the dose-response curves for ER agonism and antagonism by the dominant negative transgene (34.Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are required for clarifying the ER-mediated transcriptional inhibition in other cells and tissues. The bone mineral measurements clearly revealed that the ovariectomy-induced bone loss was prevented through ER-mediated signaling pathway, and the data presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that ER plays a major role in the bone physiology (16.Korach K.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Histomorphometrical analysis supports the mechanism that the prevention from the high bone turnover due to ovariectomy was mediated by the ER cascades. The serum osteocalcin levels of the transgenic rats remained increased after ovariectomy followed by E2 administration, reflecting the high turnover state where both bone formation and its resorption are accelerated (25.Ducy P.

Each toxin position was substituted individually for a cysteine, which was then linked to a maleimido moiety through three different spacers, varying in length from 10 to 22 Å. We estimated the coupling efficiency between the 15 toxin derivatives and the reduced cystine α(192–193) by gel densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. A nearly quantitative coupling was observed between αCys192 and/or αCys193 and all probes introduced at the tip of the first (position 10) and second (position 33) loops of Naja nigricollis α-neurotoxin. These data sufficed to locate the reactive thiolate in a “croissant-shaped” volume comprised between the first two loops of the toxin. The volume was further restrained by taking into account the absence or partial coupling of the other derivatives. Altogether, the data suggest that αCys192and/or αCys193, at the αγ interface of a muscular-type acetylcholine receptor, is (are) located in a volume located between 11.5 and 15.5 Å from the α-carbons at positions 10 and 33 of the toxin, under the tip of the toxin first loop and close to the second one.

It is quasi-irreversibly blocked by snake curarimimetic toxins, a feature which helped in the isolation and purification of the receptor almost three decades ago. However, only recently has some light been shed on the molecular interaction between snake toxins and the nAChR. At least 10 residues of a sea snake toxin are involved in binding to the receptor from Torpedo marmorata,i.e. Gln7, Ser8, Gln10, Lys27, Trp29, Asp31, Arg33, Ile36, Glu38, and Lys47 (1Pillet L.

Receptor regions that interact with snake toxins have also been investigated in various studies. Some lines of evidence indicate that snake toxins can bind to two sites located at the interfaces of the αγ- and αδ-subunits (3Oswald R.E. Changeux J.P.

Among the different receptor regions that may be implicated in toxin binding, the domain 180–200 of the α-subunit is clearly an important determinant (for a review see Ref. 6Arias H.R. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 25: 133-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is also involved in various other binding functions, because it is recognized by small organic agonists (7Middleton R.E.

More recently, double mutant cycle analyses have revealed a number of contacts that may occur between nAChR and a cobra curarimimetic toxin (13Ackermann E.J. Ang E.T.H. Kanter J.R. Tsigelny I.

Thus, Arg33 of NmmI toxin is coupled to the receptors αVal188 and γLeu119, whereas the toxin Lys27 interacts with γGlu176, and to a lesser extent with αTyr190, Pro197, and Asp200. Although double mutant cycle analyses have evaluated the distances between various charged residues of this short-chain toxin and some residues of the receptor γ-subunit (15Osaka H. Malany S. Molles B. Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5478-5484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the relative positioning of the toxin with respect to the receptor α-subunit still remains unclear. To address this question, we have estimated the distances that separate several functionally important toxin residues from Cys192 and/or Cys193, two residues that belong to the critical binding region 180–200 of the two α-subunits. More precisely, we used experimental conditions that allowed us to perform this study at a single binding site, namely, the site at the αγ interface. It is known that the disulfide bond α(Cys192-Cys193) can be selectively reduced without affecting antagonist binding (16Barrantes F.J.

Treatment of the receptor with bromoacetylcholine or [4-(N-maleimido)benzyl]trimethylammonium iodide (MBTA) in the presence of a disulfide reducing agent leads to the covalent modification of one or both α-subunits, depending on the concentration of affinity label (20Karlin A.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4268-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was later located at the αγ interface of the receptor (11Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 24Blount P. Merlie J. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Using radioactive MBTA, it was further demonstrated that αCys192 and αCys193 are the exclusively labeled residues (8Kao P.N. Dwork J.A. Kaldany J.R.R. Wideman S.J. Stein S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11662-11665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our strategy was inspired from this site-directed alkylation procedure. First, we chemically engineered analogues of a curarimimetic snake toxin, by automated peptide synthesis. More precisely, we individually replaced each of the five functional residues Gln10, Lys27, Trp29, Arg33, and Lys47 by a cysteine residue. The reason for the choice of these residues was that they are both important binding contributors to toxin-receptor formation and are widely spread over the functional topography of the snake toxin (1Pillet L.

Second, we linked each of them to three spacers of different lengths (10, 14, and 22 Å) that always ended in a maleimido group. Third, each of the 15 monomodified toxin derivatives was mixed with the receptor whose α(Cys192-Cys193) disulfide bond was selectively reduced and affinity-labeled under conditions where only the αγ interface was modified (23Ratnam M. Gullick W. Spiess J. Wan K. Criado M. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4268-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fourth, the coupling yield was estimated from gel electrophoresis experiments. Fifth, the data were exploited to build a model in which the toxin was positioned relative to cysteines 192 and/or 193 of the α-subunit at the αγ interface. Peptides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 433 apparatus, using Fmoc-protected amino acids of the highest purity commercially available from Novabiochem or Advanced Chemtech. N,N′-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide andN,N′-(1,4-phenylene)dimaleimide were from Aldrich, andN,N′-bis(3-maleimidopropionyl)-2-hydroxy-1,3-propanediamine was from Sigma. [α-125I]bungarotoxin (Bgtx) (200 Ci.mmol−1) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. LiveT. marmorata were from the Station Biologique d'Arcachon (France). Naja nigricollis horse antivenom serum was from the Institut Pasteur (France). Goat anti-rat (GAR-PO) and rabbit anti-horse (RAH-PO) IgG peroxidase conjugates were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out using a Quattro II spectrometer from Micromass. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon CD6 dichrograph at 22 °C. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purifications were done with a Vydac C4 semipreparative column (10 × 250 mm; flow rate, 4 ml.min−1; linear gradient, 5% to 21% B in 6 min; then 21% to 27% B in 19 min (A, H2O −0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B, CH3CN −0.06% trifluoroacetic acid)). nAChR-rich membranes from the electric tissue of T. marmorata were prepared, as described previously (25Saitoh T. Oswald R. Wennogle L.D. Changeux J.P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 116: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in the presence of 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block all free cysteines. They were further purified by alkali treatment (26Neubig R.R. Krodel E.K. Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The concentration of acetylcholine binding sites was measured at equilibrium with [α-125I]Bgtx (27Schmidt J. Raftery M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 52: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). N. nigricollisα-toxin analogues were synthesized as described earlier (28Mourier G. Zinn-Justin S. Trémeau O. Ménez A. Epton R. Ramage R. Peptides. Mayflower Scientific Ltd., Kingswinford, England1996: 659-660Google Scholar, 29Ruoppolo M. Moutiez M. Mazzeo M.F. Pucci P. Ménez A. Marino G. Quéméneur E.

Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and refolded with 1.5–15 mm oxidized dithiothreitol (DTT) overnight, under inert atmosphere. The refolded toxins were purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described above, and checked by electrospray mass spectrometry and circular dichroism. To conjugate the single free cysteine (Q10C, K27C, W29C, R33C, or K47C) of each toxin mutant with dimaleimide reagents, we first solubilized 0.7 mg (0.1 μmol) of toxin analogue in 200 μl of 250 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5)/2.5 mm EDTA and 100 μl of H2O. The solution was then poured on 20 equivalents of dimaleimide-containing reagent dissolved in either a mixture of dimethylformamide (40 μl)/acetone (160 μl) for the two shorter reagents (Mal10 and Mal14) or in 200 μl of sodium acetate buffer for the longest (Mal22) reagent, with rapid stirring. The mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min, except for the K27C derivatives, where the incubation time was prolonged to 8 h. Excess reactant was removed by exclusion chromatography (Biogel P2 from Bio-Rad), with the toxin migrating in the void volume. Each maleimido-toxin derivative was purified by HPLC as described above, and its mass was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Binding competition experiments were performed at equilibrium, using [α-125I]Bgtx (200 Ci.mmol−1) as radioactive tracer. Varying amounts of toxins were incubated in Ringer's buffer (5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.01% Triton X-100), with 0.3 nmα-toxin binding sites and 9 nm[α-125I]Bgtx for 5 h at room temperature. The mixture was filtered through Millipore filters (HAWP), which had been soaked in the same buffer. The filters were rinsed twice with 5 ml of Ringer's buffer and counted on a 1261-multigamma counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined from IC50 values according to Cheng and Prusoff (31Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). Selective reduction of the α(Cys192-Cys193) bond was carried out using a slight modification of a previously described procedure (22Walker J.W. Richardson C.A. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nAChR (3.3 nmol of toxin binding sites) was incubated under argon in degassed sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm DTT, for 20 min at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged at 17,600 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of degassed buffer A (250 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, 2.5 mm EDTA) under argon. The last step was reproduced twice to eliminate excess DTT, and the pellet was resuspended in 1.1 ml of the same buffer, under argon. For affinity-labeling experiments, the reduced nAChR (1 μm toxin binding sites) was mixed with each purified maleimido-toxin derivative (1 μm final concentration) in buffer A (200-μl final volume). After 15- or 90-min incubation at room temperature, under argon, each sample was centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 70 μl of Laemmli buffer. For protection experiments, the reduced receptor was first incubated with native erabutoxin a (70 μm) for 2 h at room temperature, under argon, before reaction with the maleimido derivatives. After reduction, the receptor was incubated with 10 μm bromoacetylcholine for 10 min at room temperature, under argon, in the presence of 5 μm tacrine (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase). The receptor was then reacted as described above with R33C-Mal22 for 15 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a mini-protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). Briefly, about 30 μg of each sample was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS gel of 1-mm thickness, which was then stained with Coomassie Blue. For immunoblots, 3- to 10-μg protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microporous membrane. The PVDF sheet was quenched for 2 h at room temperature with buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The sheet was incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibody 155 (33Tzartos S.J. Remoundos M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (1/4000), or horse antiserum to the venom (1 mg.ml−1) solubilized in 10 ml of quench buffer. The PVDF membrane was washed (four times for 5 min) in buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Peroxidase-labeled antibodies GAR-PO or GAH-PO (1/4000) in 10 ml of quench buffer was added to the PVDF membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The PVDF sheet was washed again (four times for 5 min) in phosphate buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and for 5 more min in the same buffer without Triton. The solution containing the peroxidase substrate was used when freshly prepared and consisted of 25 ml of phosphate buffer, 250 μl of CoCl2 solution (30 g.l−1), and 25 μl of H2O2 solution (30%). Development was stopped by rinsing the membrane in water. Toxin α from N. nigricollis is amenable to peptide synthesis on the micromole scale by automated Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (28Mourier G. Zinn-Justin S. Trémeau O. Ménez A. Epton R. Ramage R. Peptides. Mayflower Scientific Ltd., Kingswinford, England1996: 659-660Google Scholar, 29Ruoppolo M. Moutiez M. Mazzeo M.F. Pucci P. Ménez A. Marino G. Quéméneur E.

Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We thus prepared five toxin derivatives in which the functionally important Gln10, Lys27, Trp29, Arg33, and Lys47 (1Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S.

The deprotected peptides were then reoxidized in the presence of oxidized DTT. The resulting proteins all had a wild-type toxin secondary structure, as indicated by the similarity of their CD spectra (Fig. 2). The unique exception was the W29C derivative, which displayed no positive peak at 230 nm, a finding that confirms that this band is associated with a contribution of the tryptophan residue (34Ménez A. Bouet F. Tamiya N. Fromageot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 453: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Each protein possesses a single cysteine, as assessed with Ellman's reagent (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar), and is characterized by the expected mass determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (not shown). Up to 15 mg of each toxin derivative was obtained, the overall average yield of synthesis being about 5%. Therefore, none of the substitutions of any of the five original functional residues by a cysteine altered the capacity of the toxin to refold with its native-like secondary structure.Figure 2Circular dichroism spectra of the five “cysteine” analogues of N. nigricollisα-neurotoxin derivatives.

The wild-type toxin had aK i of 13 pm, consistent with itsK d value (36Weber M. Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar), and this value decreased 4-, 18-, 145-, 12-, and 29-fold upon use with mutations Q10C, K27C, W29C, R33C, and K47C, respectively. Despite the affinity decreases, the analogues still retained relatively high binding affinities.Table IInhibition constants of N. nigricollis derivatives for T. marmorata nAChRK i1-aK i, inhibition constant for toxin derivative; K iwt, inhibition constant for the wild-type toxin.K i/K iwtnmWild-type0.0131Q10C0.056 ± 0.0204.3Q10C-Mal100.13 ± 0.0510Q10C-Mal140.07 ± 0.035.5Q10C-Mal220.08 ± 0.046K27C0.23 ± 0.0817.5K27C-Mal100.39 ± 0.2030K27C-Mal140.42 ± 0.2033K27C-Mal220.07 ± 0.05 (high)5∼9 (low)1-bDue to a lack of points at high concentrations of ligand, the given K i value is only an estimate.∼700W29C1.9 ± 0.8145W29C-Mal10>11>850W29C-Mal14>11>850W29C-Mal22>11>850R33C0.16 ± 0.0712R33C-Mal100.07 ± 0.035.5R33C-Mal140.04 ± 0.023R33C-Mal220.02 ± 0.011.5K47C0.37 ± 0.1328.5K47C-Mal100.20 ± 0.1015.5K47C-Mal140.09 ± 0.047K47C-Mal220.11 ± 0.048.5Inhibition constants were obtained by competition at equilibrium against α-[125I]bungarotoxin (9 nm) on T. marmorata nAChR (0.3 nm toxin binding sites).

Mean ± S.E. or standard errors for two or more measurements. Three dimaleimides called Mal10, Mal14, and Mal22 (Fig. 3) were reacted with the additional cysteine introduced into each of the five toxin mutants. To avoid formation of toxin dimers and to favor formation of monomodified derivatives, we used a large excess of dimaleimides (20 eq). Excess reactant was subsequently eliminated by gel exclusion, and the 15 derivatives were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. All but the K47C-Mal10 derivative eluted as a single peak, which is strongly indicative of their homogeneity. The K47C-Mal10 derivative HPLC profile showed a slight but unexplained shoulder (not shown). All the derivatives displayed the expected mass (not shown) and were used as such for the labeling experiments. All chemically modified derivatives but W29C displayed similar affinities for nAChR as compared with cysteine-containing derivatives (Table I). Due to a lack of material, we could not determine the IC50 values for W29C maleimido analogues. Interestingly, the K27C-Mal22 derivative discriminated between the two toxin binding sites, one of them being recognized with almost the same affinity as for the wild-type toxin and the other with an affinity approximately two orders of magnitude lower. At first, all free cysteines of a membrane preparation of nAChR were blocked using 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The nAChR possesses three types of disulfide bonds spread over the extracellular domains of the various subunits. These are Cys128-Cys142 on all subunits, Cys192-Cys193 on the two α-subunits, and the Cys500-Cys500 on the δ-subunits, linking two monomers of the receptor (37DiPaola M. Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under mild reducing conditions, only the α(Cys192-Cys193) disulfide bond is affinity-labeled (8Kao P.N. Dwork J.A. Kaldany J.R.R. Wideman S.J. Stein S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11662-11665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and if the reducing agent is eliminated before the alkylation step, only the αγ interface is labeled (23Ratnam M. Gullick W. Spiess J. Wan K. Criado M. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4268-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore carefully considered this procedure in a tentative attempt to generate selective labeling of the reduced α(Cys192-Cys193) bond at the αγ interface. Incubation of the 15 maleimido-containing derivatives with the reduced nAChR was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and revealed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4 A). The control lane with no derivative (lane 1) shows the four expected nAChR subunits. Clear changes in intensity patterns were only seen for all derivatives modified at Q10C and R33C and for the derivative W29C-Mal22 (Fig. 4 A; lanes 2, 3, 4,10, 11, 12, and 13). In all these cases, the intensity of the α-subunit decreased. This change was concomitantly associated with an increased intensity in the β-subunit, whose apparent molecular mass was close to 46 kDa, which not only fits with the β-subunit but also with a complex consisting of an α-subunit molecule associated with one toxin molecule. No such clear-cut phenomenon was seen with the eight other derivatives. Neither was it seen in control experiments where the receptor was not reduced, nor when the reduced receptor was treated with the well-known thiol blocking reagents N-ethylmaleimide or 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (not shown). Moreover, when the reduced nAChR was pretreated with an excess of an analogous snake toxin, erabutoxin a, the effect vanished for all the derivatives, except for the Q10C analogues for which the protection from affinity labeling was around 80% (data not shown). These data indicate that the phenomenon (i) is associated with the presence of free cysteines 192 and 193, (ii) requires a maleimido-containing toxin derivative, and (iii) is specific to the introduced linkers located at positions 10, 29, and 33. To demonstrate that the toxin moiety was covalently associated with the new 46-kDa protein band, we blotted an SDS gel previously incubated with antitoxin antibodies present in a snake antivenom (Fig.4 B). Curiously, nonspecific detection was seen weakly at the level of the α-subunit and even more weakly around the β-subunit (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). Nevertheless, strong differential labeling was readily observed around 46 kDa with W29C-Mal22 and all the derivatives modified at Q10C and R33C. For all these analogues, therefore, the toxin (molecular mass of 7 kDa) migrates with an apparent mass of approximately 46 kDa. No such detection was seen with other derivatives. To establish whether the α-subunit is also present in the new 46-kDa band, we performed a similar blot experiment with an α-subunit-specific monoclonal antibody (33Tzartos S.J. Remoundos M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 C). The control revealed an intense band migrating at the expected position of the free α-subunit (40 kDa). An additional band was seen around 46 kDa with the three derivatives modified at Q10C and R33C and with the longest derivative at W29C, confirming that, when these derivatives were present, the α-subunit migrated with a larger apparent molecular mass. In other words, these particular toxin derivatives comigrated with the α-subunit, a finding that strongly indicated their covalent association. We observed a similar though much weaker band with some other derivatives, in particular wit"

This plasmid library was transformed into a temperature-sensitive yeast strain (top2-1), and viable transformants were selected at the restrictive temperature. Among the active TOP2α mutants, no substitution was allowed at Tyr805, the 5′ anchor of the cleaved DNA, and only conservative substitutions were allowed at Leu794, Asp797, Ala801, and Arg804. Thus, these 5 residues are critical for human TOP2α activity, and the remaining mutagenized residues are less critical for function. Using the x-ray crystal structure of yeast TOP2 as a structural model, it can be deduced that these 5 functionally important residues lie in a plane. One of the possible functions of this plane may be that it interacts with the DNA substrate upon catalysis. The side chains of Ser803 and Lys798, which confer drug resistance, lie adjacent to this plane.

The side chains of Ser803 and Lys798, which confer drug resistance, lie adjacent to this plane. topoisomerase II polymerase chain reaction Type II DNA topoisomerases are essential cellular enzymes that are required for cell proliferation. They catalyze topological change of DNA molecules through the transient breakage and rejoining of double-stranded DNA; mechanistically, the enzyme makes a gate in one double-strand DNA segment and allows another DNA segment to pass through the gate. These reactions relax supercoiled DNA and catenate or decatenate covalently closed circular DNA molecules (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). In addition, type II DNA topoisomerases are clinical targets for antibiotics and anticancer drugs.Prokaryotic DNA TOP2, also known as DNA gyrase, is composed of two subunits, A protein (GyrA) and B protein (GyrB), and the active form is an A2B2 heterodimer. Eukaryotic TOP21 is a homodimer composed of a monomer with two domains, B′ and A′, corresponding to DNA gyrase B and A subunits, respectively (2Lynn R. Giaever G. Swanberg S.L. Wang J.C. Science. 1986; 233: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All TOP2 enzymes share sequence similarity (3Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; : 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); in addition, similarity has been observed in the x-ray crystal structures of TOP2 proteins (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 5Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Because TOP2 is conserved through evolution, limited genetic interchangeability for TOP2 from different species is observed (6Adachi N. Miyaike M. Ikeda H. Kikuchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5297-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Rose A. McMahon J. Duncan D. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wyckoff E. Hsieh T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The enzymatic mechanism of TOP2 has been studied extensively, and it is thought to involve multistep conformation changes of the enzyme (9Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because only a small number of crystal structures of TOP2 have been published, it is difficult to understand the enzymatic mechanism fully from this structural information alone. However, biochemical experiments have been carried out to provide information on the interactions between the enzyme and its DNA substrate. For example, Worland and Wang (10Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the active site Tyr783attaches covalently to the 5′ end of the cleaved DNA chain. Recent work on DNA gyrase suggested specific interactions between the enzyme and its DNA substrate at distinct steps of the catalytic cycle by probing the topology of the enzyme-bound DNA segment (11Kampranis S.C. Bates A.D. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).To understand enzymes and their biological function, it is important to characterize both their catalytic and their structural properties. Several experimental approaches are commonly used for this purpose. One approach is to determine the primary structures (i.e.protein sequences) of related proteins from different species and align them with one another. Such a sequence alignment is useful to identify the evolutionarily conserved amino acids and motifs that may play functional roles in a group of related proteins. X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance are used to study the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the atomic level. These structural methods provide information on the structure of the entire protein and its subdomains and subunits. Such information is necessary to understand how enzymes interact with substrates, other molecules, inhibitors, and activators, etc., and to evaluate the biological roles of the proteinsin vivo. Once a structural model is available, site-directed mutagenesis of specific residues is often undertaken to determine the structure/function relationships of the protein in detail.Ala scanning is a commonly used mutagenesis approach, in which protein residues of interest (i.e. in the active site, ligand binding site, or protein interface) are systematically changed one by one from their identity in the wild type protein to Ala in a corresponding mutant. This is useful to create mutant proteins, but the effects of specific amino acid substitutions are not generally predictable. Another approach is to randomly mutagenize a codon or group of codons by random substitution of nucleotides; the group of mutants can then be subjected to genetic selection (12Bowie J.U. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 247: 1306-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 13Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5703-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If a particular property of a side chain (length, hydrophobicity, etc.) is important at a given position, only side chains with conservative amino acid substitutions will be allowed in functional mutants (i.e. those that survive the selection process). This method reinforces the interpretation of x-ray crystal structures and helps to define the functional roles of each amino acid residue in vivo.Such mutagenesis studies have exclusively used Escherichia coli as the host for expression and selection of mutant proteins. Large numbers of mutant proteins are easily analyzed in E. coli; however, high molecular weight mammalian enzymes that are not able to be expressed in E. coli cannot be analyzed by this approach in this host. In the present study, random mutagenesis was carried out on human topoisomerase 2α (TOP2α). To characterize mutants of TOP2α, they were expressed in a yeast strain carrying a temperature-sensitive endogenous yeast TOP2, which can be genetically complemented by the gene encoding wild type human TOP2α. This mutagenesis study specifically targets amino acid residues 793–808 around the active site of human TOP2α. This highly conserved region is of particular interest because it is involved in both catalytic activity and drug sensitivity. The results presented here provide useful information on the roles of these active site residues. Based on the amino acid substitutions allowed in active mutants and their drug sensitivity profiles, possible functions of the targeted amino acid residues are proposed and discussed. Type II DNA topoisomerases are essential cellular enzymes that are required for cell proliferation. They catalyze topological change of DNA molecules through the transient breakage and rejoining of double-stranded DNA; mechanistically, the enzyme makes a gate in one double-strand DNA segment and allows another DNA segment to pass through the gate. These reactions relax supercoiled DNA and catenate or decatenate covalently closed circular DNA molecules (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). In addition, type II DNA topoisomerases are clinical targets for antibiotics and anticancer drugs. Prokaryotic DNA TOP2, also known as DNA gyrase, is composed of two subunits, A protein (GyrA) and B protein (GyrB), and the active form is an A2B2 heterodimer. Eukaryotic TOP21 is a homodimer composed of a monomer with two domains, B′ and A′, corresponding to DNA gyrase B and A subunits, respectively (2Lynn R. Giaever G. Swanberg S.L. Wang J.C. Science. 1986; 233: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All TOP2 enzymes share sequence similarity (3Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; : 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); in addition, similarity has been observed in the x-ray crystal structures of TOP2 proteins (4Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 5Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Because TOP2 is conserved through evolution, limited genetic interchangeability for TOP2 from different species is observed (6Adachi N. Miyaike M. Ikeda H. Kikuchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5297-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Rose A. McMahon J. Duncan D. Nitiss J.L.

The enzymatic mechanism of TOP2 has been studied extensively, and it is thought to involve multistep conformation changes of the enzyme (9Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because only a small number of crystal structures of TOP2 have been published, it is difficult to understand the enzymatic mechanism fully from this structural information alone. However, biochemical experiments have been carried out to provide information on the interactions between the enzyme and its DNA substrate. For example, Worland and Wang (10Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the active site Tyr783attaches covalently to the 5′ end of the cleaved DNA chain. Recent work on DNA gyrase suggested specific interactions between the enzyme and its DNA substrate at distinct steps of the catalytic cycle by probing the topology of the enzyme-bound DNA segment (11Kampranis S.C. Bates A.D. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To understand enzymes and their biological function, it is important to characterize both their catalytic and their structural properties. Several experimental approaches are commonly used for this purpose. One approach is to determine the primary structures (i.e.protein sequences) of related proteins from different species and align them with one another. Such a sequence alignment is useful to identify the evolutionarily conserved amino acids and motifs that may play functional roles in a group of related proteins.

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 27: 76-82Google Scholar, 2Matsunaga T. Hieda K. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are the most common lesions produced by exposure of DNA to short wavelengths of UV light (below 295 nm). This lesion can exist in two main forms as follows: the cis-syn isomer, which is the predominant form, and the trans-syn isomer, which is less common (3Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11143-11151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The trans-syn dimer exists as two stereoisomers,trans-syn I and trans-syn II (4Liu F.-T. Yang N.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4865-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A defect in the repair of pyrimidine dimers can be associated with several biological consequences, including cell death, mutagenesis, and potentially, carcinogenesis. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms possess elaborate mechanisms either for the removal of these lesions (nucleotide excision repair and enzyme-catalyzed photoreversal) or for damage avoidance (recombination), thus enhancing survival and minimizing mutagenesis (reviewed in Refs. 5Lloyd R.S. Van Houten B. Vos J.-M.H. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar and 6Friedberg, E. C, Walker, G. C., and Siede, W. (eds) (1995) DNA Repair and Mutagenisis, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar). In addition, various organisms and viruses possess a base excision repair (BER)1 mechanism for the removal of these lesions (Ref. 7McCullough A.K. Romberg M., T. Nyaga S. Wei Y. Wood T.G.

The initial step in BER is carried out by enzymes known as DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove the damaged base. Many glycosylases have concomitant abasic (AP) lyase activity and are known as glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes. The prototype of these is endonuclease V (since renamed T4-pdg), which was originally discovered in Escherichia coli that had been infected with the bacteriophage T4. T4-pdg is a well characterized BER enzyme that is specific for cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. In addition, this enzyme has been shown to incise DNA at the sites of trans-syn II dimers (3Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. J. Biol.

Zastawny T.H. Carmical J.R. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The rate of incision at these lesions is approximately 1% that of the rate of incision atcis-syn dimers (3Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. J. Biol.

The active site nucleophile of T4-pdg has been identified as the α-amino group of N-terminal Thr-2 (12Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Nucleophilic attack on the C1′ of the sugar linked to the 5′-pyrimidine of the dimer results in cleavage of the N-glycosyl bond. This process results in the formation of an imino enzyme-DNA intermediate, which can be trapped by treatment with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride (14Dodson M.L. Schrock III, R.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of strong reducing agents, the sugar-phosphate backbone is cleaved on the 3′ side of the abasic site sugar by a β-elimination mechanism (lyase reaction). This results in cleavage products with 5′-phosphate and 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde termini, respectively (14Dodson M.L. Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S.

Thus, T4-pdg catalyzes successiveN-glycosylase and AP lyase reactions. A few microorganisms, including Micrococcus luteus, have been shown to harbor cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase/AP lyase activities similar to those of T4-pdg. Two different genes encoding enzymes that are specific for the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in M. luteus have been cloned. One of these genes encodes a 31-kDa protein (Mlu-pdg I) that bears sequence similarities to E. coli endonuclease III and MutY (20Piersen C.E. Prince M.A. Augustine M.L. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J.

The other gene encodes an 18-kDa protein (Mlu-pdg II) that exhibits 27% amino acid sequence identity with T4-pdg (8Lloyd R.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

For the last few years, our laboratory has been systematically searching for enzymes that initiate BER at UV-induced lesions. This study describes the identification, purification, and initial characterization of two pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes from the bacterium, Neisseria mucosa. Heparin-Sepharose and Mono S column matrices, as well as FPLC supplies, deoxyoligonucleotide sizing markers, and Kodak XAR and Hyperfilm (X-Omat) autoradiography films were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Prestained protein molecular weight markers and cellophane membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. T4 polynucleotide kinase and DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Plasmid AL-1A was purified by the NIEHS Molecular Biology Core Laboratory (University of Texas Medical Branch). The BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit was purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. Approximately 100 g of frozen N. mucosa cells were thawed and resuspended in 150 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol). The cells were lysed using a French press cell (1100 pounds/square inch), and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 500-ml single-stranded DNA agarose column that had been previously equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with 4 column volumes of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (1000 ml) ranging from 25 mm to 2.0 m NaCl in buffer A, followed by additional washing with buffer A containing 2.0m NaCl. Fractions (10 ml) were collected and monitored for pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity using UV-irradiated plasmid DNA and a 32P-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide duplex containing a single cis-syn thymine dimer (gift of J.-S. Taylor, Washington University, St. Louis), as described below. The single-stranded DNA agarose column fractions that were found to harbor pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity were pooled and extensively dialyzed against buffer B (25 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol) and then loaded onto a 20-ml heparin-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with buffer B. After extensive washing with buffer B (150 ml), proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (200 ml), ranging from 50 mm to 2.0 m NaCl in buffer B. This was followed by continued washing with buffer B containing 2.0 m NaCl. Fractions (5.0 ml) collected during the gradient and high salt wash were assayed for pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity as described below. Three activities, designated A (fractions 7–10), B (fractions 12–16), and C (fractions 17–21), were revealed. These activities were later renamed Nmu-pdg I, Nmu-uve, and Nmu-pdg II, respectively, based on their apparent catalytic mechanisms. Although all three activities were further purified, only the purification of Nmu-pdg I and II is described in detail here. Fractions containing Nmu-pdg I (activity A) were pooled and diluted with 8 volumes of buffer C (25 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol). The resulting mixture was loaded onto a 1.0-ml Mono S FPLC column that had been equilibrated with 5.0 ml of buffer C. After washing with buffer C, bound protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient ranging from 0 to 350 mm NaCl in buffer C. This was followed by further washing with buffer C containing 350 mm NaCl. The resulting fractions (2.0 ml) were screened for pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity, and those found to have activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. The silver-stained gel indicated that Nmu-pdg I had been purified to near homogeneity. Heparin-Sepharose fractions containing Nmu-pdg II (activity C) were pooled and purified using a Mono S FPLC column as described for Nmu-pdg I, except that the samples were diluted 7-fold prior to chromatography. The FPLC fractions were analyzed for activity and protein contaminants as described for Nmu-pdg I. One of the Mono S fractions contained the bulk of the pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity. This fraction was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Briefly, 350 μl of sample was applied to a Vydac C18 reversed-phase HPLC column previously equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 0.05 to 0.56% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min over a period of 90 min. The gradient was held at a constant 5% for 5 min. The column eluate was monitored at 215 nm, and 200-μl fractions were collected. The protein-containing fractions were screened for pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity, and the active fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. These analyses demonstrated that Nmu-pdg II had been purified to apparent homogeneity. The concentrations of purified Nmu-pdg I and II were determined using the BCA protein assay according to the supplier's instructions. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Nmu-pdg II was determined by sequential Edman degradation, which was carried out by the NIEHS Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory at University of Texas Medical Branch (courtesy of Drs. Alexander Kurosky and Steve Smith). UV damage-specific nicking assays were performed as described previously (25Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified covalently closed circular plasmid DNA was UV irradiated to introduce approximately 25 dimers per plasmid molecule. The irradiated DNA (0.5 μg) was incubated with appropriate dilutions of enzymes from the various chromatographic steps in a standard reaction buffer containing 25 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of agarose gel loading buffer. Form I and II DNAs were separated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide overnight, and their images were captured and analyzed using a VISAGE gel electrophoresis system (BioImage). The surviving mass fraction of form I DNA was used to determine the average number of single-strand breaks introduced in the DNA population. The sequences of the deoxyoligonucleotide substrates containing a single site-specific UV lesion (cis-syn, trans-syn I, trans-syn II, (6-4) photoproduct, or Dewar photoproduct of thymidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-thymidine), AP site, AP site analog (reduced AP site or tetrahydrofuran), pyrrolidine, or 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU) are shown in Table I. All of the DNAs containing site-specific UV photoproduct lesions were the generous gifts of Dr. John-Stephen Taylor, Washington University, St. Louis (3Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. J. Biol.

DNAs containing the 5,6-dihydrouracil and pyrrolidine were the generous gifts of Dr. Paul Doetsch, Emory University, Atlanta, and Dr. Gregory Verdine, Harvard University, Cambridge, respectively. The tetrahydrofuran-containing phosphoramidite was purchased from Glen Research and was incorporated into a deoxyoligonucleotide by the Molecular Biology Core of the University of Texas Medical Branch NIEHS Center. The AP and reduced AP site containing DNAs were prepared as described below. Except where noted, the substrates were labeled on the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to their complementary oligonucleotides.Table IDNA substratesUV photoproduct-containing DNAs5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGTATTATGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′1-aThe bold TT in this sequence indicates a cis-syn dimer.5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAATTAAGCAAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′1-bThe bold TT is atrans-syn I dimer, trans-syn II dimer, (6-4) photoproduct, or Dewar photoproduct.AP site- and reduced AP site-containing DNAs5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAAUTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG-3′1-cThe bold U represents a uracil residue that was enzymatically removed by uracil DNA glycosylase in the presence or absence of NaBH4 to generate a reduced AP site or AP site, respectively.DHU-containing DNA5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCTCTGCCCTTCGAACCCDACCTCAACCTCTGCCCAC-3′1-dThe bold D represents the position of the DHU.1-a The bold TT in this sequence indicates a cis-syn dimer.1-b The bold TT is atrans-syn I dimer, trans-syn II dimer, (6-4) photoproduct, or Dewar photoproduct.1-c The bold U represents a uracil residue that was enzymatically removed by uracil DNA glycosylase in the presence or absence of NaBH4 to generate a reduced AP site or AP site, respectively.1-d The bold D represents the position of the DHU. Open table in a new tab A single-stranded 49-mer containing a single uracil at position 21 (Midland Reagent Co.) with the following sequence, 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAA UTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG-3′, was labeled on the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to its complementary strand. The resulting duplex was incubated with 1 unit of uracil DNA glycosylase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 30 min in the reaction buffer from the suppliers. DNA containing reduced AP sites was made by co-incubating the uracil-containing DNA with uracil DNA glycosylase and 100 mm NaBH4 in reaction buffer. The appropriate lesion-containing oligonucleotide (3 ng) was incubated with aliquots of either Nmu-pdg I or Nmu-pdg II in at 37 °C in 20 μl. After 30 min, an aliquot (10 μl) was removed and mixed with stop buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanole). DNAs in this aliquot were separated by electrophoresis with no additional treatment. The remaining sample (10 μl) was treated with 1.0 μl of 1.0m piperidine, incubated at 90 °C for 30 min, and then evaporated to dryness in a vacuum microcentrifuge for 1 h. Following evaporation, the sample was resuspended in 40 μl of stop buffer just prior to electrophoresis. This treatment cleaves any residual AP sites left by the enzyme. All samples were separated by electrophoresis through 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 8m urea. Electrophoresis was performed at constant 20 watts for approximately 4 h. The wet gels were analyzed by autoradiography and/or with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Single-stranded 49-mer DNA containing a singlecis-syn pyrimidine dimer (see Table I, 32 fmol/reaction) was labeled on the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed with a 3-fold excess of its complementary strand. This substrate was incubated at 37 °C with the indicated enzyme in which 100 mm NaBH4 had been substituted for the 100 mm NaCl. As a control, duplex 49-mer DNA without a lesion was incubated with the enzyme in the presence of NaBH4. A second set of controls contained NaCl (100 mm) in place of NaBH4. After 30 min, the reactions were terminated and the products separated by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The wet gels were analyzed by autoradiography. One of the recent goals of our research has been to identify and characterize novel DNA glycosylases, glycosylase/AP lyases, and endonucleases that are specific for UV light-induced photoproducts. To this end, 108 bacterial cell-free extracts (courtesy of Dr. Richard Roberts at New England BioLabs, Inc.) were screened for their ability to incise a double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide containing either a single cis-syncyclobutane thymine dimer or a (6-4) photoproduct. Several extracts were found to possess pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity, including those derived from the following: N. mucosa, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria mucosa heidelbergenesis, Bacillus sphaericus, Moraxella bovis, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, and Hemophilus gallinarum (data not shown). Interestingly, none of these cell-free extracts were found to harbor (6-4) photoproduct-specific glycosylase or glycosylase/AP lyase activity, even though this photoproduct is one of the predominant lesions formed by exposure of DNA to UV light. In an attempt to isolate the UV lesion-specific nicking activity observed in N. mucosa, we obtained and lysed approximately 100 g of N. mucosa cells (gift of Dr. Peter Goldfarb, New England Biolabs, Inc.). Soluble proteins were subjected to the following four chromatographic steps: single-stranded DNA agarose and heparin-Sepharose column chromatography, followed by FPLC (Mono S) and reversed-phase HPLC. Throughout these procedures, fractions were assayed for pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity using either a duplex DNA 49-mer containing a single centrally locatedcis-syn thymine dimer (3Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11143-11151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (TableI) or UV light-damaged plasmid DNA (25Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of purification after each chromatographic step was determined by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein(s) responsible for the observed pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity bound tightly to the single-stranded DNA-agarose column, eluting in a broad peak with approximately 600–800 mm NaCl. This affinity is very similar to what has been previously reported for T4-pdg (27Higgins K.M. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Mlu-pdg I (28Hamilton R.W. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17422-17427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions containing activity were subjected to heparin-Sepharose column chromatography. Analysis of the resulting fractions revealed that there was a broad elution of proteins with pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity (Fig. 1). No activity was measured on nondimer-containing DNA (data not shown). Preliminary analyses of the cis-syn dimer incision data revealed that enzymes containing β- and β,δ-elimination activities eluted between ∼300 and 450 mm NaCl and again between 600 and 750 mm NaCl, whereas an activity displaying the hallmarks of a hydrolytic endonuclease was observed to elute between 450 and 600 mm NaCl. These column fractions were reassayed at greater dilutions, and analyses of these data revealed three distinctive peaks of activity (data not shown); however, these data also reinforced the assertion that the low and high salt elution peaks generated a 3′ sugar ring opened, α,β-unsaturated aldehyde β elimination product, and a 3′-phosphate δ elimination product. The middle fractions were presumed to possess hydrolytic activity for two reasons. The DNA products co-migrated with an authentic 3′-OH standard, and the migration of the products did not change upon piperidine treatment. Since there was suggestive evidence for multiple activities, the purification of these three proteins was continued separately. Heparin-Sepharose fractions corresponding to the first peak of activity (fractions 7–10) were pooled and applied to a Mono S FPLC column. The bulk of this pyrimidine dimer-specific activity was recovered in the flow-through. SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining indicated that a protein of approximately 30 kDa was responsible for the observed activity (Fig. 2 A). After further characterization (see below), this protein was namedNmu-pdg I. Heparin-Sepharose fractions corresponding to the third peak of activity (fractions 17–21, see Fig. 1) were pooled and subjected to Mono S FPLC. Following this step, several proteins remained, as evidenced by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Specifically, a doublet at 19–20 kDa and a band at 6 kDa were present (data not shown). In order to purify the protein responsible for the pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity to homogeneity, the Mono S fraction with the highest activity was chromatographed by reversed-phase HPLC. Pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity was recovered, and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the enzyme had been purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2 B). This enzyme was found to have an apparent molecular mass of approximately 19 kDa and, after subsequent characterization, was named Nmu-pdg II. The specific activity measurements of Nmu-pdg I and Nmu-pdg II at each step of the purification procedure are given in Tables II andIII, respectively. Nmu-pdg I was purified approximately 30,000-fold, whereas Nmu-pdg II was purified approximately 10,000-fold.Table IISpecific activity analyses for Nmu-pdg IPurification stepTotal volumeSSB/DNA2-aUV-irradiated plasmid DNAs were incubated with an appropriate dilution of Nmu-pdg I at 37 °C for 45 min.

Mutagenesis has been used to probe the function of a sequence in the ς54 DNA binding domain that includes residues that cross-link to promoter DNA. Several activities of the ς and holoenzyme are shown to depend on the cross-linking patch. The patch contributes to promoter binding by ς54, and holoenzyme and is involved in activator-dependent ς isomerization. As part of the ς54-holoenzyme, some residues in the patch limit basal transcription. Other cross-linking patch sequences appear to limit activator-dependent open complex formation. Deletion of 19 residues adjacent to the cross-linking patch resulted in a holoenzyme unable to respond to activator but capable of activator-independent (bypass) transcription in vitro. Overall results are consistent with the cross-linking patch directing interactions to the −12 promoter region to set basal and activated levels of transcription.

Overall results are consistent with the cross-linking patch directing interactions to the −12 promoter region to set basal and activated levels of transcription. ortho-copper phenanthroline ς54 lacking Region I ς factors play a pivotal role in bacterial transcription. Through their association with core RNA polymerase they function in promoter-specific initiation. DNA contact by ς is required for promoter recognition and can contribute to the DNA opening event in open promoter complex formation. Two classes of ς factor exist, apparently unrelated by sequence (1.Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. Yamamoto K. McKnight S. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 129-176Google Scholar, 2.Merrick M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Members of the class related to the ς70 of Escherichia coli form holoenzymes that are active for transcription in the absence of accessory proteins (3.Chan C.L. Lonetto M.A. Gross C.A. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1235-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4.deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record Jr., M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the ς54-type factor forms a holoenzyme silent for transcription until acted upon by an enhancer binding activator protein. In a reaction requiring nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis by the activator protein, the ς54-holoenzyme bound in a closed complex isomerizes, and start site proximal DNA is melted out to form a stable open promoter complex (5.Kustu S. Santero E. Keener J. Popham D. Weiss D. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 367-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Wedel A. Kustu S.

Thus, one core RNA polymerase can participate in two distinct mechanisms of transcription initiation. Key functional activities of ς54 are arranged in discrete sequences across three regions identified by sequence alignment (Fig.1). The amino-terminal Region I includes sequences that are essential for enhancer responsiveness, whereas Region II sequences assist in promoter recognition (9.Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10.Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11.Cannon W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25285-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Region III contains determinants for core polymerase binding at its amino end and a domain containing motifs for DNA binding toward the carboxyl-terminal end (13.Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14.Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ς54-holoenzyme recognizes promoters with conserved sequences at −24 and −12 relative to the transcription start site, and ς contacts these sequences (15.Cannon W. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Determining the amino acids in ς that direct promoter binding is important for understanding how the initial specific closed complex is formed. Additionally, whether ς-DNA contacts contribute to post binding steps such as DNA melting can be evaluated. Biochemical and genetic experiments with Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli ς54 has shown that the major DNA-contacting surfaces of ς54 are located in a carboxyl-terminal domain of approximately 150 amino acids (14.Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Cannon W. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M.

Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Within the holoenzyme-promoter closed complex, DNA sequences that must be melted to form open complex are contacted by ς54 (14.Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Cannon W. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M.

The DNA binding domain is likely to be functionally involved in open complex formation. Cross-linking methods are useful for identifying ς-DNA interacting domains. Native promoter DNA can be specifically cross-linked to ς54 and its holoenzyme by a “zero length” UV light-catalyzed reaction (19.Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The DNA cross-linking patch of ς54, composed of residues 329–346 (17.Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), sits at the amino terminus of the DNA binding domain and is linked by a predicted surface-exposed element to an adjacent domain that enhances DNA binding activity (20.Casaz P. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12145-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21.Cannon W.V. Chaney M.K. Wang X. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have shown that the invariant residue Arg-336, within the cross-linking patch, is important for maintaining the holoenzyme as a closed complex, silent for transcription before activation (22.Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Deletion of Region I (ΔI) or mutation of Arg-336, each, alter the interaction of holoenzyme with −12 promoter sequences and allow the holoenzyme to isomerize independent of activator (9.Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22.Chaney M. Buck M. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Region I binds core polymerase, and deletion of Region I alters the conformation of the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of ς54 as part of the holoenzyme, suggesting a linked interaction between amino and carboxyl parts of ς54 (13.Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,24.Casaz P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Identification of ς54 sequences involved in interaction with promoter DNA provides a basis for understanding the mechanism of transcription initiation by enhancer binding activators. To further explore the involvement of the DNA cross-linking patch in ς54 function, conserved residues within the patch were mutated. Single amino acid substitutions were obtained that led to defects in ς promoter binding, ς isomerization, and activator-dependent transcription. We also deleted the adjacent surface-exposed element, amino acids 310–328, which links the cross-linking patch with a domain that enhances DNA binding (20.Casaz P. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12145-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21.Cannon W.V. Chaney M.K. Wang X. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Deletion of the linking element resulted in holoenzyme unable to form open complex but able to initiate transcription in the absence of activator from supercoiled DNA. The K. pneumoniae rpoN gene codons 328 (Trp), 338 (Asp), and 342 (Arg) were changed to CGA (Ala); codon 340 (Leu), in line with other substitutions of Leu in ς54 (10.Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was changed to AGC (Ser); and codons 310–328 were deleted using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to mutate a carboxyl-terminal-codingSacI-HindIII fragment from pMM70 (25.Merrick M.J. Gibbins J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7607-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), cloned in M13mp18. Replacement cloning of a carboxyl-terminal-encoding pMM70BamHI-HindIII fragment and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the structure of the altered rpoN genes. For overexpression, BamHI-HindIII fragments were replacement-cloned into pWVC93025 (14.Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutant rpoNgenes were recloned into the low copy-number plasmid pHSG576 (43.Takeshita S. Sato M. Tobo M. Masahashi W.

Cells (1 ml) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 60 μl of 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mmEDTA, pH 7.9; 10 μl of concentrated cells was lysed with 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and heated to 95 °C, and 6 μl of each sample was loaded. Proteins were resolved on denaturing SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mini-gels and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Anti-ς54 (a gift from A. Ishihama (28.Jishage M. Iwata A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) antibodies were used for detection. All mutant ς54 proteins except W328A were overproduced and re-folded from urea as described previously (15.Cannon W. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that induction was at 42 °C. Re-folded protein was chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose at pH 7.0 in 20 mm imidazole buffer and eluted with a NaCl gradient. Purified protein was stored in 50% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA at −20 °C. The L340S protein did not bind to DEAE-cellulose and was chromatographed on heparin (Hi-Trap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In initial overexpression trials, only W328A was found as soluble protein. The W328A protein was expressed in the tryptophan auxotrophE. coli CY15077 grown in Luria broth at 30 °C. Cells were disrupted by French pressure cell treatment, and the protein was purified at 4 °C by the same procedures used for wild type ς54 (14.Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell-free extract was subjected to streptomycin sulfate precipitation to remove nucleic acid and then ammonium sulfate fractionation to recover the W328A protein as a precipitate. This was followed by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, heparin (Hi-Trap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and finally strong anion exchange chromatography. The protein was stored as above except NaCl was at 50 mm. The DNA used in the assay was a 650-base pair fragment containing the Sinorhizobium meliloti nifHpromoter and NifA upstream activation sequences, prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the promoter in pMB210 (27.Buck M. Cannon W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2597-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and gel-purified. Reactions contained 5 nm[32P]DNA, 50 nm E. colicore RNA polymerase (Epicentre Technologies), 25–400 nmς54, 3.8 μm PspFΔHTH (29.Jovanovic G. Weiner L. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1936-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 mm GTP in STA buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3.5% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000). Core and ς54 were added to the DNA and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min before the addition of activator and GTP. At 15 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 μl of stop mix (50% glycerol, 600 μg/ml heparin, and 0.05% w/v bromphenol blue) and gently mixed. Reactions were directly loaded onto 4% native polyacrylamide Bio-Rad mini-protean II gels and run at room temperature at 60 V in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.6, for 2 h. [32P]DNA was detected by a phosphorimaging device. Reactions were replicated to enhance reliability of the data. S. meliloti nifH promoter DNA as plasmid pMKC28 was used as the template in transcription experiments (22.Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Assays (at 30 °C) contained holoenzyme assembled from 100 nm E. coli core RNA polymerase and a 6-fold excess of ς54. Pre-incubation of promoter DNA (20 nm) and holoenzyme was for 10 min in STA buffer with ATP (4 mm) and activator protein PspFΔHTH (4 μm) unless otherwise stated in the figure legend. A mixture of the remaining 3 NTPs (GTP and CTP 0.2 mm, UTP 0.05 mm) and 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP plus 100 μg/ml heparin was then added for a further 10 min. Reactions were stopped by mixing in formamide-sequencing loading buffer and heated to 90 °C, and half the sample was directly run on 6% denaturing sequencing gels. Reactions were replicated to enhance reliability of the data. Transcripts were detected by phosphorimaging device. Transcription from nifH on pMKC28 yields a 469-base product. These were conducted using linear end-labeled S. meliloti nifH promoter fragments as described previously (9.Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30.Oguiza J.A. Gallegos M.T. Chaney M.K. Cannon W.V. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Reactions were replicated to enhance reliability of the data. Either an 88-mer homoduplex or heteroduplex molecule from −60 to +28, the latter with the −10 to −1 or −12/−11 non-template strand sequence mismatched, was used. One strand was [32P]DNA, and the other unlabeled strand was annealed at a 2-fold excess. Binding reactions with DNA (2.5 nm) were in STA buffer at 30 °C, and bound and unbound DNA was resolved on 4–4.5% native polyacrylamide Bio-Rad mini-protean II gels run at room temperature at 60 V in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.6. These were conducted on linear DNA fragments generated by primer extension of single-stranded DNA derived from M13mp19 clones of the S. meliloti nifH promoter (9.Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23.Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). End-labeled universal sequencing primer was extended by Klenow polymerase. Footprints were as before and used either S1 nuclease (9.Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or ortho-copper phenanthroline (o-Cup)1 (23.Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was conducted as described previously (17.Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly ς54 (4 μm) and labeled 21-base pair (−30 to −10) S. meliloti nifH promoter duplex (100 nm) were incubated together in STA buffer with 0.34 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA at 30 °C for 10 min, chilled on ice, and irradiated with a 254-nm light source for 20 min on ice. The cross-linking reactions were warmed to 37 °C and resolved on denaturing SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mini gels. Reactions were replicated to enhance reliability of the data. Cross-linking products were detected by a phosphorimaging device. Enzyme and chemical cleavage of ς54 suggested that the patch of ς54 that can be UV-cross-linked to promoter DNA resided between or included residues Trp-328 to Cys-346 (14.Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17.Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further study the importance of this patch for ς54 function, single amino acid substitutions of conserved residues W328A, R336A, D338A, L340S, R342A, and deletion of an adjacent surface-exposed region Δ310–328 were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Preparation of R336A has been described previously (22.Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In each case the integrity of the mutatedrpoN was established by DNA sequencing. Immunoblots using polyclonal anti-ς54 antibody confirmed that all mutants were expressed as intact protein (data not shown). Initially the ability of each mutant ς54 to complement an rpoN − K. pneumoniae mutant for growth on arginine as a nitrogen source was tested (Table I). The Δ310–328 mutant did not allow growth, whereas L340S allowed approximately 25% growth compared with wild type. The mutants W328A, D338A, and R342A were largely unimpaired for growth. Using therpoN − K. pneumoniae strain, each ς54 mutant was tested for transcription activity using ς54-dependent reporter promoters fused tolacZ. Five test promoters were used to evaluate any promoter-specific effects: the wild type K. pneumoniae nifHand mutants nifH049, nifH050 , nifH053, and nifH054, all of which respond to activator NifA. The nifH049, -050,-053, and -054 promoters are mutants of theK. pneumoniae nifH promoter (see TableII) with changed affinities for ς54 (18.Buck M. Cannon W. Nature. 1992; 358: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown under anaerobic nitrogen-limiting conditions to induce synthesis and activity of chromosomal nifA. Overall, the in vivotranscription results mirror the initial growth test. Δ310–328 gave no detectable transcription activity, whereas L340S produced significantly lower transcription activity compared with wild type ς54-holoenzyme at all promoters (Table II, data in parentheses). At the K. pneumoniae nifH promoter, all mutants gave reduced levels of activity compared with wild type (TableII, column 2, data in parentheses). At the K. pneumoniae nifH049 promoter, all point mutant transcription activity increased with D338A and R342A, producing close to wild type level (Table II, column 3, data in parentheses). At the nifH049promoter, the activity of L340S, although low, was 4-fold that seen at the K. pneumoniae nifH promoter. As discussed previously (22.Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the “T-tract” in the nifH049 promoter may be compensating for a lost or reduced contact made by ς54 as part of the holoenzyme (18.Buck M. Cannon W. Nature. 1992; 358: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Greater affinity for the promoter could increase occupancy and potentially favor initiation by holoenzymes, which form open complexes slowly.Table IComplementation for growth on arginine in an rpoN − K. pneumoniae mutantς54Growth on (NH4)2SO4Growth on arginineWT++++++Δ310–328+++−W328A++++++D338A++++++I340S++++R342A+++++++++ indicates growth judged comparable with cells containing the wild type rpoN. + indicates poor growth, and − indicates no growth. Open table in a new tab +++ indicates growth judged comparable with cells containing the wild type rpoN. + indicates poor growth, and − indicates no growth. To further explore the stimulatory effect of the T-tract we used aK. pneumoniae nifH mutant promoter series in which each C from −17 to −15 has individually been replaced by T (27.Buck M. Cannon W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2597-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Table II). These data show that for wild type and all mutant ς54-holoenzymes, a C to T change at −17 or −15 produces at least a 2-fold increase in transcription activity and is at least as stimulatory for transcription as the −17 to −15 CCC to TTT change (Table II). Except for L340S, which showed a 3-fold increase in activity, the C to T change at −16 was not stimulatory for transcription. The L340S ς54-holoenzyme, which has the lowest activity compared with wild type ς54-holoenzyme (Table II, data in parentheses), was highly stimulated by the C to T change at −15, producing a 10-fold increase above its activity at the wild type nifH promoter. In vivo experiments using a consensus promoter sequence where the consensus −12 core promoter sequence (TTGC) was randomly mutated suggested that the −15 consensus T was important for maintaining promoter function (31.Wang L. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7558-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that the L340S mutation may cause a disruption in correct recognition and/or binding to the K. pneumoniae nifH-12 promoter region, which is to some degree rescued by the C to T change at −15. Overall the in vivo analysis revealed that substitutions in the cross-linking patch and deletion of adjacent residues leads to three classes of mutant: class I, no transcription activity (Δ310–328); class II, reduced transcription activity (L340S); and class III, significant levels of activity stimulated further by a high affinity promoter. To facilitate further analysis of any defects in the mutant ςs, proteins were overexpressed and purified. Each ς54 was judged to be >90% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An essential early step in transcription is the binding of ς to core to form the holoenzyme. To determine whether any mutation grossly altered the interaction of ς with core, a native gel holoenzyme assembly assay was conducted. With the exception of L340S, each mutant shifted all core at a molar ratio of 1:1 (ς54:core), indicating that core binding was intact and could not readily account for the defects in transcription seenin vivo (data not shown). In contrast to the other mutants and wild type ς54, L340S and its holoenzyme did not enter the native gel, indicating this protein has altered physical properties. All other mutant holoenzymes appeared to have a mobility indistinguishable from wild type holoenzyme. This suggests that, with the exception of L340S, the conformation of the holoenzyme is not grossly changed by the cross-link patch substitution or deletion of residues 310–328. The native gel also showed that free-running W328A ς54 (not associated with core) has increased mobility compared with wild type ς54, suggesting that the W328A substitution has altered the conformation of the ς54protein (data not shown). ς54 binds the S. meliloti nifHpromoter in the absence of core polymerase (18.Buck M. Cannon W. Nature. 1992; 358: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effects of mutations on ς54 DNA binding, gel-shift assays using S. meliloti nifH promoter DNA were conducted. Titration of the mutant ς54 showed that mutations W328A and R342A each reduce DNA binding, whereas Δ310–328 and D338A were essentially wild type for DNA binding in this assay (Fig.2 A). Wild type ς54 shifted half the DNA at 1.5 μm, whereas W328A and R342A shifted approximately half the probe at 4 μm. L340S did not detectably bind the DNA; however, it could not be properly assayed because of its aberrant gel mobility. The lack of DNA binding by L340S may therefore be related to structural defects (as indicated by native gel mobility) rather than loss of an essential DNA contact. The reduced DNA binding of W328A and R342A indicates that they are functionally important residues within the DNA cross-linking patch of ς54 that contribute to DNA binding. We directly confirmed this by conducting a DNA cross-linking assay (Fig. 2 B). The formation of two products in the cross-linking assay probably reflects stable cross-linking of ς54 to either both strands or one strand o"
