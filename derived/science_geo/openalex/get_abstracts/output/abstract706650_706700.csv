https://openalex.org/W4313316222,"Tororo District, in Eastern Uganda, experienced a dramatic decline in malaria burden starting in 2014 following the implementation of indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) in the setting of repeated long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) distribution campaigns. However, in 2020 malaria began to resurge in Tororo following a change in the active ingredient used for IRS. In this study, epidemiological measures of malaria were compared shortly after the resurgence between two parishes in Tororo District (Kayoro and Osukuru) and one contiguous parish in Busia District (Buteba), where IRS has never been implemented. A cohort of 483 residents from 80 randomly selected households were followed from August 2020 to January 2021. Mosquitoes were collected every 2 weeks using CDC light traps in rooms where participants slept; parasitemia and gametoctyemia measured every 4 weeks by microscopy and PCR; and symptomatic malaria measured by passive surveillance. The annual entomological inoculation rate was significantly higher in Buteba (108.2 infective bites/person/year), compared to Osukuru (59.0, p = 0.001) and Kayoro (27.4, p<0.001). Overall, parasite prevalence was 19.5% by microscopy and 50.7% by PCR, with no significant differences between the three parishes. Among infected individuals, gametocyte prevalence by PCR was 45.5% and similar between sites. The incidence of malaria was significantly higher in Osukuru (2.46 episodes PPY) compared to Buteba (1.47, p = 0.005) and Kayoro (1.09, p<0.001). For participants over 15 years of age, the risk of symptomatic malaria if microscopic parasitemia was present was higher in Osukuru (relative risk [RR] = 2.99, p = 0.03) compared to Buteba. These findings highlight the complex relationships between measures of malaria transmission, infection, and disease, and the potential for excess disease burden, possibly due to waning immunity, in areas where vector control interventions begin to fail after a sustained period of highly effective control."
https://openalex.org/W4313316008,"A growing body of research emphasizes both endogenous and social motivations in human vocal development. Our own efforts seek to establish an evolutionary and developmental perspective on the existence and usage of speech-like vocalizations (""protophones"") in the first year of life. We evaluated the relative occurrence of protophones in 40 typically developing infants across the second-half year based on longitudinal all-day recordings. Infants showed strong endogenous motivation to vocalize, producing vastly more protophones during independent vocal exploration and play than during vocal turn taking. Both periods of vocal play and periods of turn-taking corresponded to elevated levels of the most advanced protophones (canonical babbling) relative to periods without vocal play or without turn-taking. Notably, periods of turn taking showed even more canonical babbling than periods of vocal play. We conclude that endogenous motivation drives infants' tendencies to explore and display a great number of speech-like vocalizations, but that social interaction drives the production of the most speech-like forms. The results inform our previously published proposal that the human infant has been naturally selected to explore protophone production and that the exploratory inclination in our hominin ancestors formed a foundation for language."
https://openalex.org/W4313318656,"Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) often suffer from sleep disturbances, including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). These symptoms are also experienced by patients with narcolepsy, which is characterized by orexin neuronal loss. In PD, a decrease in orexin neurons is observed pathologically, but the association between sleep disturbance in PD and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels is still unclear. This study aimed to clarify the role of orexin as a biomarker in patients with PD. CSF samples were obtained from a previous cohort study conducted between 2015 and 2020. We cross-sectionally and longitudinally examined the association between CSF orexin levels, sleep, and clinical characteristics. We analyzed 78 CSF samples from 58 patients with PD and 21 samples from controls. CSF orexin levels in patients with PD (median = 272.0 [interquartile range = 221.7–334.5] pg/mL) were lower than those in controls (352.2 [296.2–399.5] pg/mL, p = 0.007). There were no significant differences in CSF orexin levels according to EDS, RBD, or the use of dopamine agonists. Moreover, no significant correlation was observed between CSF orexin levels and clinical characteristics by multiple linear regression analysis. Furthermore, the longitudinal changes in orexin levels were also not correlated with clinical characteristics. This study showed decreased CSF orexin levels in patients with PD, but these levels did not show any correlation with any clinical characteristics. Our results suggest the limited efficacy of CSF orexin levels as a biomarker for PD, and that sleep disturbances may also be affected by dysfunction of the nervous system other than orexin, or by dopaminergic treatments in PD. Understanding the reciprocal role of orexin among other neurotransmitters may provide a better treatment strategy for sleep disturbance in patients with PD."
https://openalex.org/W4313306203,"Recent studies indicate that wearable sensors can capture subtle within-person changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and play a role in detecting COVID-19 infections. However, in addition to direct effects of infection, wearable sensor data may capture changes in behavior after the receipt of COVID test results. At present, it remains unclear to what extent the observed discriminative performance of the wearable sensor data is affected by behavioral changes upon receipt of the test results.We conducted a retrospective study of wearable sensor data in a sample of medical interns who had symptoms and received COVID-19 test results from March to December 2020, and calculated wearable sensor metrics incorporating changes in step, sleep, and resting heart rate for interns who tested positive (cases, n = 22) and negative (controls, n = 83) after symptom onset. All these interns had wearable sensor data available for > 50% of the days in pre- and post-symptom onset periods. We assessed discriminative accuracy of the metrics via area under the curve (AUC) and tested the impact of behavior changes after receiving test results by comparing AUCs of three models: all data, pre-test-result-only data, and post-test-result-only data.Wearable sensor metrics differentiated between symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative individuals with good accuracy (AUC = 0.75). However, the discriminative capacity of the model with pre-test-result-only data substantially decreased (AUC from 0.75 to 0.63; change = -0.12, p = 0.013). The model with post-test-result-only data did not produce similar reductions in discriminative capacity.Changes in wearable sensor data, especially physical activity and sleep, are robust indicators of COVID-19 infection, though they may be reflective of a person's behavior change after receiving a positive test result as opposed to a physiological signature of the virus. Thus, wearable sensor data could facilitate the monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence, but not yet replace SARS-CoV-2 testing."
https://openalex.org/W4313306290,"Nomophobia is considered a disorder of the modern world and describes the fear of being separated from one’s smartphone and being no longer connected and reachable. The aims of this Study were to translate the nomophobia questionnaire (NMP-Q) into German, validate the NMP-Q-D, and use it to shed light on the nomophobia construct. A total of 807 volunteer test subjects were included in the evaluation, 50 of them participated five months later in a retest study. A 4-factor structure of the NMP-Q-D could be confirmed by exploratory as well as by confirmatory factor analyses. The four factors are: (1) ""Not being able to communicate"", (2) ""Losing connectedness"", (3) ""Not being able to access information"", and (4) ""Giving up convenience"". The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the NMP-Q-D was .92 and the test-retest-reliability was .80. Significant correlations of frequency of smartphone usage with time spent confirmed criterion validity of NMP-Q-D. Construct validity was given by significant correlations of NMP-Q-D to fear of missing out and smartphone addiction. Neuroticism was positively associated with nomophobia, while consciousness and openness were lightly negatively associated. Anxiety correlated significantly positively with factor 1, and stress with factors 1 and 4. Life satisfaction was positively associated with factor 3 and well-being negatively with factor 4. A multiple regression analysis revealed smartphone usage, gender, and neuroticism as significant predictors of nomophobia. Females scored significantly higher for factors 1 and 4 compared to males. Nomophobia was rather widespread in the sample: Nearly half of the participants (49.4%) had a moderate level of nomophobia and 4.1% a severe nomophobia."
https://openalex.org/W4313306327,"Burden of disease estimation commonly requires estimates of the population exposed to a risk factor over a time window (yeart to yeart+n). We present a microsimulation modelling approach for producing such estimates and apply it to calculate the population exposed to long working hours for one country (Italy).We developed a three-model approach: Model 1, a multilevel model, estimates exposure to the risk factor at the first year of the time window (yeart). Model 2, a regression model, estimates transition probabilities between exposure categories during the time window (yeart to yeart+n). Model 3, a microsimulation model, estimates the exposed population over the time window, using the Monte Carlo method. The microsimulation is carried out in three steps: (a) a representative synthetic population is initiated in the first year of the time window using prevalence estimates from Model 1, (b) the exposed population is simulated over the time window using the transition probabilities from Model 2; and (c) the population is censored for deaths during the time window.We estimated the population exposed to long working hours (i.e. 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 hours/week) over a 10-year time window (2002-11) in Italy. We populated all three models with official data from Labour Force Surveys, United Nations population estimates and World Health Organization life tables. Estimates were produced of populations exposed over the time window, disaggregated by sex and 5-year age group.Our modelling approach for estimating the population exposed to a risk factor over a time window is simple, versatile, and flexible. It however requires longitudinal exposure data and Model 3 (the microsimulation model) is stochastic. The approach can improve accuracy and transparency in exposure and burden of disease estimations. To improve the approach, a logical next step is changing Model 3 to a deterministic microsimulation method, such as modelling of microflows."
https://openalex.org/W4313306199,"We assessed the role of the protein-coding gene chaperonin-containing TCP1 subunit 6A (CCT6A) in osteosarcoma, as this is currently unknown. Using data from the R2 online genomic analysis and visualization application, we found that CCT6A messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression is increased in osteosarcoma tissue and cells. Transfection of CCT6A small interfering RNA into cultured osteosarcoma cells revealed that CCT6A knockdown attenuates cell growth, cell viability, cell survival, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phases. Moreover, CCT6A knockdown downregulated phospho-protein kinase B (p-Akt), cyclinD1 and B-cell lymphoma-2, whereas upregulated Bcl-2-associated X-protein expression. Thus, CCT6A knockdown inhibits cell proliferation, induces cell apoptosis, and suppresses the Akt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4313306202,"The number of people reducing their meat consumption due to ethical and environmental concerns is growing. However, meat reducers sometimes care for omnivorous or carnivorous pets, creating the 'vegetarian's dilemma'. Some meat-reducers opt to feed plant-based diets to companion animals, but others express reservations. Cultivated meat offers a possible third path, but consumer perceptions of cultivated meat as pet food have received little scholarly attention. Using survey data from 729 respondents, we analyzed consumers' willingness to feed cultivated meat to companion animals, particularly with reference to their own current dietary practices, and their own willingness to eat cultivated meat. Though not all our respondents willing to eat cultivated meat were willing to feed it to their companions, a large majority were (81.4%, 193/237). However, for those unwilling to eat cultivated meat, the story was more complicated. Vegans and vegetarians were less likely to say they would eat cultivated meat (16.4%, 39/238) than meat-eating respondents (40.3%, 198/491). However, among vegans and vegetarians who would not consume cultivated meat, the majority (55.9%, 86/154) indicated that they would still feed it to their pets. Among meat-eating respondents, only a small minority (9.6%, 11/114) unwilling to eat cultivated meat would feed it to their pets. Consequently, we suggest that the potential market for cultivated meat for pet food is markedly different from the potential market for cultivated meat from human consumption. A key concern among our respondents about feeding cultivated meat to pets was a worry that it was not healthy, indicating that there may be easy gains in cultivated pet food's uptake through messaging relating to safety and nutritional completeness."
https://openalex.org/W4313316083,"Although the proportion of people living in slums is increasing in low- and middle-income countries and food insecurity is considered a severe hazard for health, there is little research on this topic. This study investigated and compared the prevalence and socio-demographic associations of household food insecurity in seven slum settings across Nigeria, Kenya, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Data were taken from a cross-sectional, household-based, spatially referenced survey conducted between December 2018 and June 2020. Household characteristics and the extent and distribution of food insecurity across sites was established using descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistic regression of data in a pooled model including all slums (adjusting for slum site) and site-specific analyses were conducted. In total, a sample of 6,111 households were included. Forty-one per cent (2,671) of all households reported food insecurity, with varying levels between the different slums (9-69%). Household head working status and national wealth quintiles were consistently found to be associated with household food security in the pooled analysis (OR: 0·82; CI: 0·69-0·98 & OR: 0·65; CI: 0·57-0·75) and in the individual sites. Households which owned agricultural land (OR: 0·80; CI: 0·69-0·94) were less likely to report food insecurity. The association of the household head's migration status with food insecurity varied considerably between sites. We found a high prevalence of household food insecurity which varied across slum sites and household characteristics. Food security in slum settings needs context-specific interventions and further causal clarification."
https://openalex.org/W4313316086,"Insect taxonomy lies at the heart of many aspects of ecology, and identification tasks are challenging due to the enormous inter- and intraspecies variation of insects. Conventional methods used to study insect taxonomy are often tedious, time-consuming, labor intensive, and expensive, and recently, computer vision with deep learning algorithms has offered an alternative way to identify and classify insect images into their taxonomic levels. We designed the classification task according to the taxonomic ranks of insects-order, family, and genus-and compared the generalization of four state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures. The results show that different taxonomic ranks require different deep learning (DL) algorithms to generate high-performance models, which indicates that the design of an automated systematic classification pipeline requires the integration of different algorithms. The InceptionV3 model has advantages over other models due to its high performance in distinguishing insect order and family, which is having F1-score of 0.75 and 0.79, respectively. Referring to the performance per class, Hemiptera (order), Rhiniidae (family), and Lucilia (genus) had the lowest performance, and we discuss the possible rationale and suggest future works to improve the generalization of a DL model for taxonomic rank classification."
https://openalex.org/W4313316231,"Advances in microscopy hardware and storage capabilities lead to increasingly larger multidimensional datasets. The multiple dimensions are commonly associated with space, time, and color channels. Since “seeing is believing”, it is important to have easy access to user-friendly visualization software. Here we present IMAGE-IN, an interactive web-based multidimensional (N-D) viewer designed specifically for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data, with the goal of assisting biologists in their visualization and analysis tasks and promoting digital workflows. This new visualization platform includes intuitive multidimensional opacity fine-tuning, shading on/off, multiple blending modes for volume viewers, and the ability to handle multichannel volumetric data in volume and surface views. The software accepts a sequence of image files or stacked 3D images as input and offers a variety of viewing options ranging from 3D volume/surface rendering to multiplanar reconstruction approaches. We evaluate the performance by comparing the loading and rendering timings of a heterogeneous dataset of multichannel CLSM and FIB-SEM images on two devices with installed graphic cards, as well as comparing rendered image quality between ClearVolume (the ImageJ open-source desktop viewer), Napari (the Python desktop viewer), Imaris (the closed-source desktop viewer), and our proposed IMAGE-IN web viewer."
https://openalex.org/W4313318663,"The consumption of news media covering national and global events, particularly those that invoke fear or worry, such as pandemics or terrorist attacks, may affect older adults’ mental wellbeing. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, this research analyzes nationally representative data from older adults in the US to address the following research questions: (1) What is the relationship between COVID-19-based media consumption and psychological distress? (2) Does any relationship between media consumption and psychological distress vary by gender, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status? Results indicate that (1) older adults who closely followed the news about the pandemic scored higher on psychological distress than those following less closely and (2) this relationship was more pronounced among Hispanic older adults. These findings are contextualized in the broader stress process model with a focus on a macro-level stressor and differential exposure and vulnerability resulting in variability in the relationship between the stressor and psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W4313306149,"Objectives To describe education level and employment status among adults with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and explore factors related to work participation. Materials and methods Cross-sectional postal survey in 2018. Individuals with molecularly verified diagnosis were recruited through a National Resource Centre for Rare Disorders. A study specific questionnaire included topics on disease burden and validated instruments regarding education level, employment, pain, fatigue, psychological distress, and satisfaction with life. Results Fifty persons (56% women) aged 18–67 years, participated. Almost 60% reported education level ≤13 years. Two thirds (66%) received disability benefits, 21 (42%) had full-time disability pension. The median age at ending work was 41 years. Full-time employed and students were younger (p = 0.014), less fatigued (p = 0.035), had less sleep problems (p = 0.028) and higher satisfaction with life (p&lt;0.001) than those who received disability pension. A third (32%) were currently or used to be in sedentary work, and 68% currently had or used to be in practical work requiring much standing and walking (23%), much walking and lifting (34%) or heavy manual work (11%). Conclusions There is a potential that more adults with these diagnoses can sustain employment for more years. Health and social service follow-up routines and future studies should include details on employment perspectives to reveal those at risk of poor employment and to identify modifiable factors for work participation."
https://openalex.org/W4313306167,"Breastfeeding has several benefits for both mothers and their children. Despite strong evidence in support of the practice, its prevalence has remained low worldwide, particularly in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study is aimed to assess breastfeeding knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy among mothers with index infants and young children in the rural community of Southwest Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March and April 2022 as baseline data for a cluster of randomized control trials. Multistage sample techniques followed by systematic random sampling techniques were employed. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests were used to assess the baseline differences in the socio-demographic characteristics of the two groups. An independent sample t-test was used to determine the mean differences. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association. All tests were two-tailed, and a statistically significant association was declared at a p-value ≤ 0.05.A total of 516 mothers (258 from the intervention and 258 from the control group) were interviewed. A total of 516 mothers (258 from the intervention group and 258 from the control group) were interviewed. Except for the child's sex and age, no significant difference was observed between the intervention and control groups in terms of socio-demographic variables (p > 0.05). Independent t-tests found no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05) in terms of the mean score of maternal breastfeeding knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy at baseline. After adjusting for other covariates, maternal age (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.69, 3.07), educational status (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 0.56,2.33), occupation (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI, 1.04, 3.69), ANC (antenatal care) (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI, 1.11, 4.09), received breastfeeding information (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.33, 5.04), postnatal care (PNC) (AOR = 3.85, 95% CI, 2.01, 5.77) and parity (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI, 1.08, 4.19) were significantly associated high level breastfeeding knowledge. The positive attitude was associated with maternal age (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI, 1.18, 5.67), education status (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI, 0.99,4.03), ANC (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI, 1.44,5.13), last child breastfeeding history (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI, 1.21,4.88) and high level of breastfeeding knowledge (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI, 1.56,4.04). Finally, high breastfeeding self-efficacy was associated with ANC (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.04,3.83), parity (AOR = 4.05, 95% CI, 1.49, 5.03) and high knowledge level (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI, 0.89,2.85).The study concluded that mothers in both the intervention and control groups have a low level of breastfeeding knowledge, a neutral attitude, and medium self-efficacy. Therefore, nutrition education interventions using tailored messages appropriate to the sociocultural context in the rural setting should be developed and evaluated continuously."
https://openalex.org/W4313306186,"Background Infections complicate the acute phase of stroke in one third of patients and especially pneumonia is associated with increased risk of death or dependency. In randomized trials of stroke patients, preventive antibiotics reduced overall infections, but did not reduce pneumonia or improve outcome. This may be explained by broad selection criteria, including many patients with a low risk of pneumonia. To assess the potential of selection of patients at high risk of pneumonia, we performed a post-hoc analysis in the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS). Methods PASS was a multicentre phase 3 trial in acute stroke patients who were randomized to preventive ceftriaxone for four days within 24 hours or standard care. For this analysis patients were divided based on the ISAN risk score for pneumonia as follows: low (0–6), medium (7–14) and high (15–21). Primary outcomes were pneumonia rate during admission as judged by the treating physician, and by an independent committee; secondary outcomes were overall infections and unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≥3). We adjusted with multivariable regression for possible confounders: age, stroke subtype and severity, pre-stroke dependency and diabetes. Results Pneumonia occurred more frequently in higher risk groups (25.7% (high), 9.0% (medium) 1.5%, (low)). The absolute difference in pneumonia rate between patients treated with ceftriaxone or standard care increased with the ISAN score (low: 0.5%, medium: 1.2%, high: 10.1%). After adjustment ceftriaxone reduced overall infections in the low and medium groups, not in the high-risk group. There was a trend towards reduction of pneumonia as judged by the committee (3.7% vs 13.6%, aOR = 0.164, p = 0.063) in the high-risk group. Conclusions This post-hoc analysis of PASS confirmed higher rates of pneumonia with higher ISAN scores, and suggests that in acute stroke patients with an ISAN score of ≥15, preventive ceftriaxone for four days may reduce pneumonia rate."
https://openalex.org/W4313306198,"Some macroalgae drift on the ocean and are stranded on coasts, and these stranded brown macroalgae are regarded to be degraded by organisms. Alginate is a major component of brown macroalgae. An uncovering of how carbon is cycled through brown macroalgae is needed to deeply understand coastal ecosystems. In this study, to gain insights into metabolism of brown macroalgae and alginate in the organisms, we initially confirmed that supralittoral talitrid amphipods (beach fleas or sandhoppers collected on the Shibagaki coast in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan) fed on the brown macroalgae. We then isolated bacteria such as Vibrio sp. with alginate-assimilating capability from the gut of the amphipods. Metagenomic analysis of the gut of amphipods housed in several conditions (e.g. macroalgae or paper as feed, non-sterilized or sterilized environment) showed no condition-dependent compositions of bacteria and fungi, but Vibrio sp. were detected at high frequency, in good agreement with the isolation of Vibrio sp. An intervention study using antibiotics showed that amphipods fed on algae or paper at about the same rate in the presence or absence of antibiotics, and that the antibiotics had no effects on the life span. Moreover, intervention with antibiotics completely killed Vibrio sp. and some other bacteria, and had significant effects on the composition of the flora in the gut, with elimination of the variations observed in the guts of amphipods housed without antibiotics. These data suggest that microbes that were killed by antibiotics, including Vibrio sp., in the gut of talitrid amphipods are not essential for assimilation of brown macroalgae."
https://openalex.org/W4313306200,"Human gastrointestinal helminthic infections have a direct and/or indirect effect on the composition of the host gut microbial flora. Here, we investigated the effect of infection with a soil-transmitted intestinal nematode, Strongyloides stercoralis, on the gut microbiota of the human host. We also investigated whether composition of the microbiota in infected persons might vary across endemic regions. Fecal samples were obtained from volunteers from two areas endemic for strongyloidiasis, Khon Kaen Province in northeastern Thailand and Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in southern Thailand. Samples from Khon Kaen were from infected (SsNE) and uninfected (NegNE) individuals. Similarly, samples from the latter province were from infected (SsST) and uninfected (NegST) individuals. DNA sequences of the V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were obtained from the fecal samples. No statistical difference in alpha diversity between groups in terms of richness or diversity were found. Statistical difference in beta diversity was observed only between NegNE and NegST. Some significant differences in species abundance were noted between geographical isolates. The SsNE group had a higher abundance of Tetragenococcus holophilus than did the SsST group, whereas Bradyrhizobium sp. was less abundant in the SsNE than the SsST group. For the uninfected groups, the NegNE had a higher abundance of T. holophilus than the NegST group. Our data showed that S. stercoralis infection leads to only minor alterations in the relative abundance of individual bacterial species in the human gut: no detectable effect was observed on community structure and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4313306245,"Acute mental stress (MS) induces a transient increase in arterial stiffness. We verified whether a single bout of bench step (BS) exercise for 3 minutes counteracts acute MS-induced arterial stiffening. Fifteen healthy young men (mean age, 21.7 ± 0.3 years) underwent two experimental trials: rest (RE) and exercise (EX) trials. Following a 5-minute MS task, the participants in the RE trial rested on a chair for 3 minutes (from 10 to 13 minutes after task cessation), whereas those in the EX trial performed the BS exercise for the same duration. The heart-brachial pulse wave velocity (PWV) (hbPWV), brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV), heart-ankle PWV (haPWV), and the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) were measured at baseline and at 5 and 30 minutes after the task. In both trials, significant increases in hbPWV, haPWV, and CAVI occurred at 5 minutes after the task; these elevations persisted until 30 minutes after the task in the RE trial, but significantly decreased to baseline levels in the EX trial. baPWV was significantly elevated at 30 minutes after the task in the RE trial, but not in the EX trial. This study reveals that a 3-minute BS exercise offsets acute MS-induced arterial stiffening."
https://openalex.org/W4313306292,"Moss, was frequently found growing in litchi orchards. However, less known about whether it can be used as a visual bio-indicator for evaluating soil fertility and health. Therefore, soil chemical and biological properties, microbial community structures and the metabolic functions of microbes in soils between moss- and non-moss-growth areas were analyzed using traditional and high-throughput sequencing technologies. The results showed that pH and the contents of and available phosphorus (AP) in moss growth areas were significantly lower than those of non-moss growth areas, but the contents of alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN) and available potassium (AK) were significantly increased. In comparison with the soil of the non-moss-growth area, the abundances of hypotrophic microorganisms, such as Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria and WPS-2 enriched in the soil of the moss-grown area. Moreover, the proportions of eutrophic microorganisms, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes also declined in the soils of the moss-growth area. Furthermore, the metabolic pathways of soil bacteria and fungi were also degraded in the moss-growth area. All above results indicated that not only lower soil fertility, but also soil microbial diversity also declined in moss growth area which compared to those of non-moss growth area. In one word, moss can be considered using as a visual bio-indicator for representing soil degradation in litchi orchards."
https://openalex.org/W4313306304,"Neonatal mortality is the probability of dying during the first 28 days of life. Of approximately 5 million children who die in the first year of life in the world, about 3 million are within their first 28 days of birth. In Ethiopia, the neonatal mortality rate is high about 37 per 1000 live births, and the factors are not well documented. Then, this study aimed to determine the key factors that have a significant influence on neonatal mortality.A total of 5753 neonatal mortality-related data were obtained from Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey (2019) data. A frequency distribution to summarize the overall data and Binary Logistic Regression to identify the subset of significant risk factors for neonatal mortality were applied to analyze the data.An estimated 36 per 1000 live children had died before the first 28 days, with the highest in the Benishangul Gumuz region (15.9%) and the lowest in Addis Ababa (2.4%). From the Binary logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio and 95% CI of age 25-34 (OR = 0.263, 95% CI: 0.106-0.653), Afar (OR = 0.384, 95% CI: 0.167-0.884), SNNPR (OR = 0.265, 95% CI: 0.098-0.720), Addis Ababa (OR = 5.741, 95% CI: 1.115-29.566), Urban (OR = 0.253, 95% CI: 0.090, 0.709), toilet facility (OR = 0.603, 95% CI: 0.404-0.900), single birth (OR = 0.261, 95% CI: 0.138-0.495), poorest (OR = 10.573, 95% CI: 2.166-51.615), poorer (OR = 19.573, 95% CI: 4.171-91.848), never breastfed (OR = 35.939, 95% CI: 25.193-51.268), public health delivery (OR = 0.302, 95% CI: 0.106-0.859), private health facility (OR = 0.269, 95% CI: 0.095-0.760).All regional states of Ethiopia, specially Benishangul Gumuz, and the Somali region must take remedial actions on public health policy, design strategies to improve facilities, and improve the capacities of stakeholders living in their region toward those major factors affecting neonatal mortality in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4313306307,"Introduction Patient-centered communication (PCC) is one important component of patient-centered care and seen as a goal for most clinical encounters. Previous research has shown that higher PCC is related to an increase in healthy behaviors and less morbidity, among other outcomes. Given its importance, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) commissioned a monograph in 2007 to synthesize the existing literature on PCC and determine measurement objectives and strategies for measuring this construct, with a particular focus on cancer survivors. Based on this effort, a seven-item PCC scale was included on the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a probability-based survey of the US adult population. This study used HINTS data collected in 2018 to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PCC scale for the general US adult population including measures of reliability and validity. Results Through an exploratory factor analysis, the seven-item PCC scale was shown to be unidimensional with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .92). A confirmatory factor analysis verified the factor structure. Other construct validity metrics included known groups and discriminant validity. Known group comparisons were conducted for several sociodemographic factors and health self-efficacy confirming a priori assumptions. Discriminant validity tests with measures of social support and anxiety/depression showed relatively weak associations. Conclusions The psychometric properties of this scale demonstrate its scientific utility for both surveillance research and other smaller-scale studies. Given its association with many health outcomes, it can also be used to better understand the dynamics in a clinical encounter."
https://openalex.org/W4313306347,"Introduction The current methodologies to quantify the palatal expansion are based on a preliminary rigid superimposition of 3D digital models representing the status of a given patient at different times. A new method based on affine alignment is proposed and compared to the gold standard, leading to the automatic analysis of 3-dimensional structural changes and to a simple numeric quantification of overall expansion vector and a better alignment of the digital models. Materials and methods 40 digital models (timing span delta 25.8 ± 12.5 months) from young patients (mean age 10.7 ± 2.6) treated with two different palatal expansion techniques (20 subjects with RME—Rapid Maxillary Expander, and 20 subjects with NiTiSE, NiTi self-expander) were superimposed with the new affine alignment technique implemented as an extension package of the open-source MeshLab, from a golden standard starting point of rigid alignment. The results were then compared. Results The new measurement function indicates a mean expansion expressed in a single numeric value of 9.3%, 10.3% for the RME group and 8.4% for the NiTiSE group respectively. The comparison with the golden standard showed a decrease to the average error from 0.91 mm to 0.58 mm. Conclusions Affine alignment improves the current perspective of structural change quantification in the specific group of growing patients treated with palatal expanders giving the clinician useful information on the 3-dimensional morphological changes."
https://openalex.org/W4313316256,"Female Sex Workers (FSWs) are a hard-to-reach and understudied population, especially those who begin selling sex at a young age. In one of the most economically disadvantaged regions in Malawi, a large population of women is engaged in sex work surrounding predominantly male work sites and transport routes. A cross-sectional study in February and April 2019 in Nsanje district used respondent driven sampling (RDS) to recruit women ≥13 years who had sexual intercourse (with someone other than their main partner) in exchange for money or goods in the last 30 days. A standardized questionnaire was filled in; HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia tests were performed. CD4 count and viral load (VL) testing occurred for persons living with HIV (PLHIV). Among 363 study participants, one-quarter were adolescents 13-19 years (25.9%; n = 85). HIV prevalence was 52.6% [47.3-57.6] and increased with age: from 14.7% (13-19 years) to 87.9% (≥35 years). HIV status awareness was 95.2% [91.3-97.4], ART coverage was 98.8% [95.3-99.7], and VL suppression 83.2% [77.1-88.0], though adolescent FSWs were less likely to be virally suppressed than adults (62.8% vs. 84.4%). Overall syphilis prevalence was 29.7% [25.3-43.5], gonorrhea 9.5% [6.9-12.9], and chlamydia 12.5% [9.3-16.6]. 72.4% had at least one unwanted pregnancy, 17.9% had at least one abortion (40.1% of which were unsafe). Half of participants reported experiencing sexual violence (SV) (47.6% [42.5-52.7]) and more than one-tenth (14.2%) of all respondents experienced SV perpetrated by a police officer. Our findings show high levels of PLHIV-FSWs engaged in all stages of the HIV cascade of care. The prevalence of HIV, other STIs, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and sexual violence remains extremely high. Peer-led approaches contributed to levels of ART coverage and HIV status awareness similar to those found in the general district population, despite the challenges and risks faced by FSWs."
https://openalex.org/W4313318651,"The ability to recognise emotion from faces or voices appears to decline with advancing age. However, some studies have shown that emotion recognition of auditory-visual (AV) expressions is largely unaffected by age, i.e., older adults get a larger benefit from AV presentation than younger adults resulting in similar AV recognition levels. An issue with these studies is that they used well-recognised emotional expressions that are unlikely to generalise to real-life settings. To examine if an AV emotion recognition benefit generalizes across well and less well recognised stimuli, we conducted an emotion recognition study using expressions that had clear or unclear emotion information for both modalities, or clear visual, but unclear auditory information. Older (n = 30) and younger (n = 30) participants were tested on stimuli of anger, happiness, sadness, surprise, and disgust (expressed in spoken sentences) in auditory-only (AO), visual-only (VO), or AV format. Participants were required to respond by choosing one of 5 emotion options. Younger adults were more accurate in recognising emotions than older adults except for clear VO expressions. Younger adults showed an AV benefit even when unimodal recognition was poor. No such AV benefit was found for older adults; indeed, AV was worse than VO recognition when AO recognition was poor. Analyses of confusion responses indicated that older adults generated more confusion responses that were common between AO and VO conditions, than younger adults. We propose that older adults' poorer AV performance may be due to a combination of weak auditory emotion recognition and response uncertainty that resulted in a higher cognitive load."
https://openalex.org/W4313318660,"Sit-to-stand can be defined as a set of movements that allow humans to rise from a sitting position to a bipedal standing pose. These movements, often categorized as four distinct kinematic phases, must be coordinated for assuring personal autonomy and can be compromised by ageing or physical impairments. To solve this, rehabilitation techniques and assistive devices demand proper description of the principles that lead to the correct completion of this motor task. While the muscular dynamics of the sit-to-stand task have been analysed, the underlying neural activity remains unknown and largely inaccessible for conventional measurement systems. Predictive simulations can propose motor controllers whose plausibility is evaluated through the comparison between simulated and experimental kinematics. In the present work, we modelled an array of reflexes that originate muscle activations as a function of proprioceptive and vestibular feedback. This feedback encodes torso position, displacement velocity and acceleration of a modelled human body with 7 segments, 9 degrees of freedom, and 50 actuators. We implemented two controllers: a four-phases controller where the reflex gains and composition vary depending on the kinematic phase, and a simpler two-phases controller, where three of the kinematic phases share the same reflex gains. Gains were optimized using Covariance Matrix Adaptation. The results of the simulations reveal, for both controllers, human-like sit-to-stand movement, with joint angles and muscular activity comparable to experimental data. The results obtained with the simplified two-phases controller indicate that a simple set of reflexes could be sufficient to drive this motor task."
https://openalex.org/W4313318673,"Plants play a very important role in landscape construction. In order to explore whether different living environment will affect people's preference for the structural features of plant organs, this study examined 26 villagers and 33 college students as the participants, and pictures of leaves, flowers and fruits of plants as the stimulus to conduct eye-tracking and EEG detection experiments. We found that eye movement indicators can explain people's visual preferences, but they are unable to find differences in preferences between groups. EEG indicators can make up for this deficiency, which further reveals the difference in psychological and physiological responses between the two groups when viewing stimuli. The final results show that the villagers and the students liked leaves best, preferring aciculiform and leathery leaves; solitary, purple and capitulum flowers; and medium-sized, spathulate, black and pear fruits. In addition, it was found that the overall attention of the villagers when watching stimuli was far lower than that of the students, but the degree of meditation was higher. With regard to eye movement and EEG, the total duration of fixations is highly positively correlated with the number of fixations, and the average pupil size has a weak negative correlation with attention. On the contrary, the average duration of fixations has a weak positive correlation with meditation. Generally speaking, we believe that Photinia×fraseri, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Photinia serratifolia, Koelreuteria bipinnata and Cunninghamia lanceolata are superior landscape building plants in rural areas and on campuses; Pinus thunbergii, Myrica rubra, Camellia japonica and other plants with obvious features and bright colours are also the first choice in rural landscapes; and Yulania biondii, Cercis chinensis, Hibiscus mutabilis and other plants with simple structures are the first choice in campus landscapes. This study is of great significance for selecting plants for landscape construction and management according to different environments and local conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4313306138,"A subset of individuals with COVID-19 can suffer from a severe form of the disease requiring breathing support for respiratory failure and even death due to disease complications. COVID-19 disease severity can be attributed to numerous factors, where several studies have associated changes in the expression of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines with disease severity. However, very few studies have associated the changes in expression of pro-inflammatory changes in the nasopharyngeal milieu with disease severity. Therefore, in the current study, we performed differential gene expression analysis of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in the nasopharyngeal milieu of mild & severe COVID-19 cases.For this retrospective, cross-sectional study, a total of 118 nasopharyngeal swab samples, previously collected from mild and severe (based on the WHO criteria) COVID-19 patients were used. A real-time qPCR was performed to determine the viral loads and also evaluate the mRNA expression of eight cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, and TNF-α). Subsequently, an unpaired T-test was applied to compare the statistical difference in mean expression of viral loads and each cytokine between the mild and severe groups, while the Pearson correlation test was applied to establish a correlation between disease severity, viral load, and cytokines expression. Similarly, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between different variables from the data and disease severity.Out of 118 samples, 71 were mild, while 47 were severe. The mean viral load between the mild and severe groups was comparable (mild group: 27.07± 5.22; severe group: 26.37 ±7.89). The mRNA expression of cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IFN- γ, and TNF-α was significantly different in the two groups (p<0.05), where the Log2 normalized expression of IL-2, IL-6, IFN- γ, and TNF-α was found to be 2.2-, 16-, 2.3-, and 1.73-fold less in the severe group as compared to the mild group. Furthermore, we also observed a significant positive correlation between all the cytokines in the severe group. The multivariate analysis showed a significant relationship between age, IL-6, and disease severity.This decreased expression of certain cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) in the nasopharyngeal milieu may be considered early biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W4313306146,"Background Black Canadian communities are disproportionately impacted by HIV. To help address this challenge, we undertook research to engage heterosexual Black men in critical dialogue about resilience and vulnerability. They articulated the necessity of making health services ‘cool’. Methods We draw on the analyses of focus groups and in-depth interviews with 69 self-identified heterosexual Black men and 12 service providers who took part in the 2016 Toronto arm of the weSpeak study to explore what it means to make health and HIV services ‘cool’ for heterosexual Black Canadian men. Results Our findings revealed four themes on making health services cool: (1) health promotion as a function of Black family systems; (2) opportunities for healthy dialogue among peers through non-judgmental interactions; (3) partnering Black men in intervention design; and (4) strengthening institutional health literacy on Black men’s health. Conclusions We discuss the implications of these findings for improving the health of Black Canadians."
https://openalex.org/W4313306151,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common infection, and high-quality studies report that misdiagnosis is frequent, with diagnostic testing needed to distinguish it from other causes of vaginitis and avoid inappropriate empiric treatment. However, few recent studies have evaluated U.S. healthcare providers' testing practices for VVC in detail. We evaluated healthcare providers' self-reported testing practices for VVC and treatment outcomes as part of a nationwide online survey in order to identify potential opportunities for improving VVC testing and treatment in the United States. Among 1,503 providers surveyed, 21.3% reported ""always"" (7.4%) or ""usually"" (13.9%) ordering diagnostic testing for patients with suspected VVC; this proportion was higher among gynecologists (36.0%) compared with family practitioners (17.8%) and internists (15.8%). Most providers (91.2%) reported that patients' VVC ""always"" (6.4%) or ""usually"" (84.9%) responds to initial treatment. Whether the symptom resolution reported in this survey was truly related to VVC is unclear given high rates of misdiagnosis and known widespread empiric prescribing. With only about one-in-five providers reporting usually or always performing diagnostic testing for VVC despite guidelines recommending universal use, research is needed to address barriers to proper testing."
https://openalex.org/W4313306181,"Publication bias may lead to a misestimation in the association between pharmacogenetic biomarkers (PGx) and antiseizure drug’s adverse effects (AEs). We aimed to assess its prevalence in this field. We searched for systematic reviews assessing PGx of antiseizure drug’s AEs. For each unique association between a PGx, a drug and its AE, we used the available odds ratio (ORs) to generate corresponding funnel plots. We estimated the prevalence of publication bias using visual inspections and asymmetry tests. We explored the impact of publication bias using ORs adjusted for potential publication bias. Twenty-two associations were available. Our visual analysis suggested a publication bias in five out twenty-two funnel plots (23% [95%CI: 8; 45]). The Egger’s test showed a significant publication bias in one (HLA-B*15:02 and phenytoin-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, p = 0.03) out of nine (11% [95%CI: 0; 48]) and the Begg’s test in one (HLA-B*15:02 and carbamazepine-induced serious cutaneous reactions, p = 0.02) out of ten (10% [95%CI: 0; 45]) assessable funnel plots. Adjusting for publication bias may reduce by half the ORs of the pharmacogenetics associations. Publication bias in the pharmacogenetic of antiseizure drug’s AEs is not uncommon and may affect the estimation of the effect of such biomarkers. When conducting pharmacogenetic studies, it is critical to publish also the negative one."
https://openalex.org/W4313306185,"Purpose To investigate whether raised levels of retinal cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was reflected in plasma levels in PDE6A -/- dogs. Materials and methods Retina was collected from 2-month-old wildtype dogs ( PDE6A +/+ , N = 6), heterozygous dogs ( PDE6A +/- , N = 4) and affected dogs ( PDE6A -/- , N = 3) and plasma was collected from 2-month-old wildtype dogs ( PDE6A +/+ , N = 5), heterozygous dogs ( PDE6A +/- , N = 5) and affected dogs ( PDE6A -/- , N = 5). Retina and plasma samples were measured by ELISA. Results cGMP levels in retinal samples of PDE6A -/- dogs at 2 months of age were significantly elevated. There was no significant difference in plasma cGMP levels between wildtype and PDE6A -/- or PDE6A +/- puppies. However, the plasma cGMP levels of the PDE6A -/- puppies were significantly lower than that of PDE6A +/- puppies. Conclusion cGMP levels in the plasma from PDE6A -/- was not elevated when compared to control dogs. At the 2-month timepoint, cGMP plasma levels would not be a useful biomarker for disease."
https://openalex.org/W4313306217,"Background Mechanical factors are primary complications that justify early removal of a peripherally inserted central catheter, and thrombotic catheter occlusion is the most critical mechanical complication associated with loss of device functionality. Studies have investigated these factors in adult patients, but findings are not directly applicable to newborns. Therefore, systematic reviews focusing on this population are necessary for consolidated evidence to aid clinical practice. Aims This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent heparin washing versus 0.9% sodium chloride solution for preventing occlusion in newborns with peripherally inserted central catheters. Methods We will use the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Clinical Trial Databases for article search, without language or publication periods restrictions. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of intermittent heparin washing versus 0.9% sodium chloride solution in newborns with peripherally inserted central venous catheters will be included. The primary outcome will be peripherally inserted central catheter occlusion. Two reviewers will independently screen the studies, based on the inclusion criteria, extract the data for each included study and assess the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The data will be synthesized using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.4.1). To classify the strength of the evidence of results, we will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE). The review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021281509). Expected results We expect that this study would reveal the best method for preventing catheter occlusion in newborns with peripherally inserted central catheters."
https://openalex.org/W4313306223,"Space radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer risk models for future interplanetary astronauts are being developed that primarily rely on quantitative animal model studies to assess radiation-quality effects of heavy-ion space radiation exposure in relation to γ-rays. While current GI-cancer risk estimation efforts are focused on sporadic GI-cancer mouse models, emerging in-vivo data on heavy-ion radiation-induced long-term GI-inflammation are indicative of a higher but undetermined risk of GI-inflammation associated cancers, such as colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Therefore, we aimed to assess radiation quality effects on colonic inflammation, colon cancer incidence, and associated signaling events using an in-vivo CAC model i.e., Il10-/- mice. Male Il10-/- mice (8-10 weeks, n = 12/group) were irradiated with either sham, γ-rays or heavy-ions (28Si or 56Fe), and histopathological assessments for colitis and CAC were conducted at 2.5 months post-exposure. qPCR analysis for inflammation associated gene transcripts (Ptges and Tgfb1), and in-situ staining for markers of cell-proliferation (phospho-histone H3), oncogenesis (active-β-catenin, and cyclin D1), and inflammation (phospho-p65NF-κB, iNOS, and COX2) were performed. Significantly higher colitis and CAC frequency were noted after heavy-ion exposure, relative to γ and control mice. Higher CAC incidence after heavy-ion exposure was associated with greater activation of β-catenin and NF-κB signaling marked by induced expression of common downstream inflammatory (iNOS and COX2) and pro-proliferative (Cyclin D1) targets. In summary, IR-induced colitis and CAC incidence in Il10-/- mice depends on radiation quality and display co-activation of β-catenin and NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4313306263,"Segmental bone defects present complex clinical challenges. Nonunion, malunion, and infection are common sequalae of autogenous bone grafts, allografts, and synthetic bone implants due to poor incorporation with the patient’s bone. The current project explores the osteogenic properties of periosteum to facilitate graft incorporation. As tissue area is a natural limitation of autografting, mechanical strain was implemented to expand the periosteum. Freshly harvested, porcine periosteum was strained at 5 and 10% per day for 10 days with non-strained and free-floating samples serving as controls. Total tissue size, viability and histologic examination revealed that strain increased area to a maximum of 1.6-fold in the 10% daily strain. No change in tissue anatomy or viability via MTT or Ki67 staining and quantification was observed among groups. The osteogenic potential of the mechanical expanded periosteum was then examined in vivo . Human cancellous allografts were wrapped with 10% per day strained, fresh, free-floating, or no porcine periosteum and implanted subcutaneously into female, athymic mice. Tissue was collected at 8- and 16-weeks. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in the fresh periosteum group at 8-weeks post implantation compared to all other groups. Values among all groups were similar at week 16. Additionally, histological assessment with H&amp;E and Masson-Goldner Trichrome staining showed that all periosteal groups outperformed the non-periosteal allograft, with fresh periosteum demonstrating the highest levels of new tissue mineralization at the periosteum-bone interface. Overall, mechanical expansion of the periosteum can provide increased area for segmental healing via autograft strategies, though further studies are needed to explore culture methodology to optimize osteogenic potential."

This study aimed to assess the uptake of the Appointment Spacing Model of care and associated factors among stable adult HIV clients on ART in Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 3 to November 30, 2020 among 415 stable adult ART clients. EpiData version 4.2 was used for data entry and SPSS version 25 was used for cleaning and analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify associated factors, with CI at 95% with AOR being reported to show the strength of association. Results The uptake of the appointment spacing model was 50.1%. Residence [AOR: 2.33 (95% CI: 1.27, 4.26)], monthly income [AOR: 2.65 (95% CI: 1.13, 6.24)], social support [AOR: 2.21 (95% CI: 1.03, 4.71)], duration on ART [AOR: 2.41 (95% CI: 1.48, 3.92)], baseline regimen change [AOR: 2.20 (95% CI: 1.02, 4.78)], viral load [AOR: 2.80 (95% CI: 1.06, 7.35)], and alcohol abstinence [AOR: 2.02 (95% CI: 1.21, 3.37)] were statistically significant. Conclusions The uptake of the ASM was low. Behavioral change communication, engaging income-generating activities, and facility-level service providers’ training may improve the uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4313306331,"Previous studies found that infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) who were treated for more posterior disease with a greater number of laser spots developed higher myopia. These studies included multiple physicians with variations in laser density. In treatments by a single physician, laser spot count is a better surrogate for area of avascular retina and anterior-posterior location of disease, so that the relationship with myopia can be better assessed.Our retrospective study included infants treated with laser for ROP by a single surgeon at a single center. Exclusion criteria were irregularities during laser and additional treatment for ROP. We assessed correlation between laser spot count and change in refractive error over time using a linear mixed effects model.We studied 153 eyes from 78 subjects treated with laser for ROP. The average gestational age at birth was 25.3±1.8 weeks, birth weight 737±248 grams, laser spot count 1793±728, and post-treatment follow up 37±29 months. Between corrected ages 0-1 years, the mean spherical equivalent was +0.4±2.3 diopters; between ages 1-2, it was -1.3±3.2D; and ages 2-3 was -0.8±3.1D. Eyes that received more laser spots had significantly greater change in refractive error over time (0.30D more myopia per year per 1000 spots). None of the eyes with hyperopia before 18 months developed myopia during the follow-up period.Greater myopia developed over time in infants with ROP treated by laser to a larger area of avascular retina."
https://openalex.org/W4313306333,"Tactile sensitivity in the infant period is poorly characterized, particularly among children with prior surgery, anaesthesia or critical illness. The study aims were to investigate tactile sensitivity of the foot and the associated coordination of lower limb motor movement in typically developing infants with and without prior hospital experience, and to develop feasible bedside sensory testing protocols.A prospective, longitudinal study in 69 infants at 2 and 4 months-old, with and without prior hospital admission. Mechanical stimuli were applied to the foot at graded innocuous and noxious intensities. Primary outcome measures were tactile and nociceptive threshold (lowest force required to evoke any leg movement, or brisk leg withdrawal, respectively), and specific motor flexion threshold (ankle-, knee-, hip-flexion). Secondary analysis investigated (i) single vs multiple trials reliability, and (ii) the effect of age and prior surgery, anaesthesia, or critical illness on mechanical threshold.Magnitude of evoked motor activity increased with stimulus intensity. Single trials had excellent reliability for knee and hip flexion at age 1-3m and 4-7m (ICC range: 0.8 to 0.98, p >0.05). Nociceptive threshold varied as a function of age. Tactile sensitivity was independent of age, number of surgeries, general anaesthesia and ICU stay.This brief sensory testing protocol may reliably measure tactile and nociceptive reactivity in human infants. Age predicts nociceptive threshold which likely reflects ongoing maturation of spinal and supraspinal circuits. Prior hospital experience has a negligible global effect on sensory processing demonstrating the resilience of the CNS in adverse environments."
https://openalex.org/W4313306334,"Depressive disorders are a leading cause of global morbidity and remain disproportionately high in low- and middle-income settings. Stressful life events (SLEs) are known risk factors for depressive episodes and worsened depressive severity, yet are under-researched in comparison to other depression risk factors. As depression is often comorbid with hypertension, diabetes, and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), research into this relationship among patients with NCDs is particularly relevant to increasing opportunities for integrated depression and NCD care. This study aims to estimate the cross-sectional association between SLEs in the three months preceding baseline interviews and baseline depressive severity among patients with at least mild depressive symptoms who are seeking NCD care at 10 NCD clinics across Malawi. SLEs were measured by the Life Events Survey and depressive severity (mild vs. moderate to severe) was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The study population (n = 708) was predominately currently employed, grand multiparous (5–8 children) women with a primary education level. Two thirds (63%) had mild depression while 26%, 8%, and 3% had moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Nearly all participants (94%) reported at least one recent SLE, with the most common reported SLEs being financial stress (48%), relationship changes (45%), death of a family member or friend (41%), or serious illness of a family member or friend (39%). Divorce/separation, estrangement from a family member, losing source of income, and major new health problems were significant predictors of greater (moderate or severe) depressive severity compared to mild severity. Having a major new health problem or experiencing divorce/separation resulted in particularly high risk of more severe depression. After adjustment, each additional SLE was associated with a 9% increased risk of moderate or worse depressive severity compared to mild depressive severity (RR: 1.09; (95% CI: 1.05, 1.13), p&lt;0.0001). Among patients with NCDs with at least mild depressive symptoms, SLEs in the prior 3 months were associated with greater depressive severity. While many SLEs may not be preventable, this research suggests that assessment of SLEs and teaching of positive coping strategies when experiencing SLEs may play an important role in integrated NCD and depression treatment models."
https://openalex.org/W4313306344,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels are important heterotetrameric proteins in the retina, with different subunit composition in cone and rod photoreceptor cells: three CNGA3 and one CNGB3 in cones and three CNGA1 and one CNGB1 in rods. CNGA and CNGB subunits form separate subfamilies. We have analyzed the evolution of the CNG gene family in metazoans, with special focus on vertebrates by using sequence-based phylogeny and conservation of chromosomal synteny to deduce paralogons resulting from the early vertebrate whole genome duplications (WGDs). Our analyses show, unexpectedly, that the CNGA subfamily had four sister subfamilies in the ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians that we named CNGC , CNGD , CNGE and CNGF . Of these, CNGC , CNGE and CNGF were lost in the ancestor of Olfactores while CNGD was lost in the vertebrate ancestor. The remaining CNGA and CNGB genes were expanded by a local duplication of CNGA and the subsequent chromosome duplications in the basal vertebrate WGD events. Upon some losses, this resulted in the gnathostome ancestor having three members in the visual CNGA subfamily ( CNGA1-3 ), a single CNGA4 gene, and two members in the CNGB subfamily ( CNGB1 and CNGB3 ). The nature of chromosomal rearrangements in the vertebrate CNGA paralogon was resolved by including the genomes of a non-teleost actinopterygian and an elasmobranch. After the teleost-specific WGD, additional duplicates were generated and retained for CNGA1 , CNGA2 , CNGA3 and CNGB1 . Furthermore, teleosts retain a local duplicate of CNGB3 . The retention of duplicated CNG genes is explained by their subfunctionalisation and photoreceptor-specific expression. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for four previously unknown CNG subfamilies in metazoans and further evidence that the early vertebrate WGD events were instrumental in the evolution of the vertebrate visual and central nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W4313306345,"In animal models, prenatal zinc deficiency induced epigenetic changes in the fetus, but data in humans are lacking. We aimed to examine associations between maternal zinc levels during pregnancy and DNA methylation in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive sequences in young adult offspring, as well as anthropometry and cardiometabolic parameters.Participants were 74 pregnant women from the Chiang Mai Low Birth Weight cohort, and their offspring followed up at 20 years of age. Maternal plasma zinc concentrations were measured at approximately 36 weeks of gestation. DNA methylation levels in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive sequences were measured in the offspring, as well as anthropometry and cardiometabolic parameters (lipid profile, blood pressure, and glucose metabolism).Over half of mothers (39/74; 53%) were zinc deficient (<50 μg/dL) during their third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal zinc concentrations during pregnancy were associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation levels in adult offspring. Specifically, lower prenatal zinc concentrations were associated with: 1) lower levels of total LINE-1 methylation; 2) lower levels of LINE-1 hypermethylation loci; and 3) higher levels of LINE-1 partial methylation loci. Prenatal zinc concentrations were not associated with Alu methylation levels, nor with any anthropometric or cardiometabolic parameters in adult offspring. However, we observed associations between Alu and LINE-1 methylation patterns and cardiometabolic outcomes in offspring, namely total cholesterol levels and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.Lower maternal zinc concentrations late in gestation were associated with changes in DNA methylation in later life. Thus, zinc deficiency during pregnancy may induce alterations in total LINE-1 methylation and LINE-1 hypermethylation loci. These results suggest a possible epigenetic link between zinc deficiency during pregnancy and long-term outcomes in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W4313315969,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only has a long-term effect on its survivors, it also affects their quality of life, including inducing depression as a possible manifestation of central nervous system disruption. Favipiravir shows promising efficacy as an antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. However, its effect on the sequelae of COVID-19 has not been explored. Therefore, this study aims to assess the impact of Favipiravir and address the factors associated with post-COVID depression in Indonesia.This cohort study conducted a post-COVID-19 survey on Indonesian patients who were diagnosed by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen tests until January 2022. An online questionnaire was distributed to obtain information on demographics, comorbidities, health behavior, symptoms, and treatment. The propensity technique was used to allocate the participants into the favipiravir and nonrecipient groups (1:1). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used for outcome measurement. The cohort was followed up biweekly for 60 days after onset/diagnosis to determine the occurrence of depression. Cox regression analysis with an adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the effect of favipiravir on post-COVID-19 depression.The data included the information of 712 participants, of whom 18.54% had depression within 60 days after onset/diagnosis. Depression was higher in the nonrecipient group (21.06%) than in the favipiravir group (16.01%). After adjustment by other factors, favipiravir prescription was found to be associated with depression (aOR 0.488, 95% CI 0.339-0.701 p < 0.001). In accordance with the PHQ-9 subset, favipiravir exerted a significant protective effect against depressive mood and loss of interest. However, patients living alone were prone to experiencing loss of interest (aOR 2.253, 95% CI 1.329-3.818, p = 0.003).The data obtained in this preliminary survey suggested that favipiravir may be useful for preventing post-COVID depression. However, further study is needed. Moreover, the provision of mental health support, particularly to those who live alone, must be ensured.Registry NCT05060562."
https://openalex.org/W4313316073,"Background Like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya has experienced rapid urbanization in recent years. Despite the distinct socioeconomic and environmental differences, few studies have examined the adherence to movement guidelines in urban and rural areas. This cross-sectional study aimed at examining compliance to the 24-hour movement guidelines and their correlates among children from urban and rural Kenya. Method Children (n = 539) aged 11.1 ± 0.8 years (52% female) were recruited from 8 urban and 8 rural private and public schools in Kenya. Physical activity (PA) and sleep duration were estimated using 24-h raw data from wrist-worn accelerometers. Screen time (ST) and potential correlates were self- reported. Multi-level logistic regression was applied to identify correlates of adherence to combined and individual movement guidelines. Results Compliance with the combined movement guidelines was low overall (7%), and higher among rural (10%) than urban (5%) children. Seventy-six percent of rural children met the individual PA guidelines compared to 60% urban children while more rural children also met sleep guidelines (27% vs 14%). The odds of meeting the combined movement guidelines reduced with age (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35–0.87, p = 0.01), was greater among those who could swim (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.09–9.83, p = 0.04), and among those who did not engage in ST before school (OR = 4.40, 95% CI = 1.81–10.68, p&lt;0.01). The odds of meeting PA guidelines increased with the number of weekly physical education sessions provided at school (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.36–3.21, p&lt;0.01) and was greater among children who spent their lunch break walking (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.15–5.55, p = 0.02) or running relative to those who spent it sitting (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.27–4.27, p = 0.01). Conclusions Prevalence of meeting movement guidelines among Kenyan children is low and of greatest concern in urban areas. Several correlates were identified, particularly influential were features of the school day, School is thus a significant setting to promote a healthy balance between sleep, sedentary time, and PA."

We carried out a study of this type to explore risk factors for the onset of gallstones. This study included Japanese participants aged 40-107 years who were followed prospectively from January 2012 to September 2020 using a dataset composed of two individually linked databases, one containing annual health checkup records and the other containing medical claims for beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance System and the Medical Care System for Elderly in the Latter Stage of Life in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Among the 611,930 participants in the analysis set, 23,843 (3.9%) were diagnosed with gallstones during the observational period (median [max]: 5.68 [7.5] years). Multivariate analysis revealed that risk of gallstone disease was increased by male sex, cerebrovascular disease, any malignancy, dementia, rheumatic disease, chronic pulmonary disease, hypertension, and H. pylori-infected gastritis. These findings provide essential insights into the etiology of cholelithiasis and may contribute to efforts to reduce the incidence of the disease."

A high-risk group for having severe outcomes from foodborne illnesses. This study aimed to assess self-reported food safety knowledge and practices among pregnant women in the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 354 pregnant women residing in the UAE completed an online survey between October 2021 and January 2022. The questionnaire included socio-demographic information, food safety knowledge, and food practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Correct answers for food safety knowledge were scored out of 50 and the total score was compared by sociodemographic characteristics. The total mean score for the study population was 26.7 ± 4.6 out of 50. Participants had good knowledge about foodborne diseases (81.3%) and personal hygiene practices (61.8%). While they were least knowledgeable about cross-contamination (43.3%) and temperature control practices (35.8%). Significantly higher knowledge scores were observed with higher levels of education and primigravida women (p<0.05). Knowledge about the COVID-19 virus and its relation to food safety was adequate for most participants. This study infers the need for food safety-related education and training programs to reduce the risk of foodborne disease among this vulnerable group. It also highlights the need to enhance the role of healthcare professionals as trusted sources of information in improving food safety during pregnancy."

Clinical outcomes were measured at baseline and 6 months postpartum.50 participants were recruited from 155 eligible women (32% recruitment rate). Thirty-four were recruited to the intervention group (23 following randomisation (RI-group) and 11 based on preference (PI-group)); and 16 to the control group (13 randomised (RC-group) and 3 preference (PC-group)). Attrition was 44% (n = 22/50). Forty-six percent (n = 6) of the intervention group (25% (n = 2) of the RI-group and 80% (n = 4) of the PI-group) achieved ≥5% weight loss compared to 8% (n = 1) in the control group (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.69 to 0.07). Mean weight change was -2.1kg±9.0 in the intervention group (0kg±5.4 in the RI-group and -5.4kg±13.0 in the PI-group) compared to +4.4kg±4.9 in the control group (RC +4.4kg ±5.3 and PC +4.7kg ±3.1, 95% CI -12.4 to 0.2).Recruitment was feasible, but strategies to improve retention are needed. The findings suggest the intervention can support women with GDM to lose weight. The observed weight loss was primarily in women who preferred the intervention. Therefore, future trials may need to adopt a preference design and consider factors associated with preference.Trial registration: ISRCTN52675820 https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN52675820?q=ISRCTN52675820&filters=&sort=&offset=1&totalResults=1&page=1&pageSize=10&searchType=basic-search."

Main outcome was self-report of possible PASC symptoms 3 weeks or longer after positive COVID-19 test. In-depth interviews were guided by a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions and probes based on emerging literature on PASC and the impact of COVID-19.With a survey response rate of 70%, 442 participants were included in this analysis, mean (SD) age 45.4 (16.2) years, 71% female, 12% Black/African American. Compared to those with no PASC symptoms, persons who reported PASC symptoms were more likely to be older (mean age: 46.5 vs. 42; p = 0.013), female (74.3% vs. 61.2%; p = 0.010), to have pre-existing conditions (49.6% vs. 34%; p = 0.005), and to have been hospitalized for COVID-19 (14.2% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.002). About 30% of the participants experienced severe fatigue; the proportion of persons reporting severe fatigue was 7-fold greater in those with PASC symptoms (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR] 6.73, 95%CI: 2.80-16.18). Persons with PASC symptoms were more likely to report poor quality of life (16% vs. 5%, p<0.001) and worse mental health functioning (Mean difference: -1.87 95%CI: -2.38, -1.37, p<0.001). Themes from in-depth interviews revealed PASC was experienced as debilitating.In this study, the prevalence of PASC among community-dwelling adults was substantial. Participants reported considerable coping difficulties, restrictions in everyday activities, invisibility of symptoms and experiences, and impediments to getting and receiving PASC care."
https://openalex.org/W4313316232,"Cognitive ageing is often associated with slower lexical processing, which might influence both language production and comprehension. Words are typically used in context, which can further influence word processing and potential age differences. However, it remains unclear how older adults are affected by context during reading. Older adults are reported to have in-tact semantic knowledge, which could potentially help them to process words predicted by semantic information in the preceding context. However, potential difficulties with semantic control might mean older adults have greater difficulty suppressing interfering information from mismatching contexts. In this study we examined the influence of contexts that either predicted a specific target word (""matched"", e.g., ""The man watched the lava erupt from the volcano"") or predicted another word than the target (""mismatched"", e.g., ""The swimmer dived into the volcano"") as compared to neutral contexts (e.g., ""They went to see the volcano""). We also examined the potential role of task demands by asking participants to either just read the sentences for comprehension or to answer questions. Forty younger adults (18-35 years old) and forty older adults (65-80 years old) completed a self-paced reading task in which we measured reading times for the target words. Older adults showed slower reading times overall. Matched sentence contexts facilitated reading times in both age groups. Surprisingly, mismatched sentence contexts did not hinder reading times in either age group. Furthermore, reading times were not influenced by task demands. Together, this shows the importance of studying language in context. While interference from mismatching sentence contexts might have not been substantial enough to delay reading, reading was faster when processing expected words. This suggests older adults can indeed benefit from semantic knowledge to facilitate word processing during comprehension. This occurred even when no additional task was presented and people were purely reading for comprehension."
https://openalex.org/W4313316375,"Background The global burden of febrile illness and the contribution of many fever inducing pathogens have been difficult to quantify and characterize. However, in sub-Saharan Africa it is clear that febrile illness is a common cause of hospital admission, illness and death including in Ethiopia. Therefore the major aim of this study is to explore the spatial variation and associated factors of childhood febrile illness among under-five children in Ethiopia. Methods This study were based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic health survey data. A total weighted sample of 10,127 under- five children was included. Data management was done using Stata version-14, Arc-GIS version—10.8 and SatsScan version- 9.6 statistical software. Multi-level log binomial model was fitted to identify factors associated with childhood febrile illness. Variables with a p-value &lt; 0.2 in the bi-variable analysis were considered for the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable multilevel log binomial regression analysis p-value&lt; 0.05, the APR with the 95% CI was reported. Global spatial autocorrelation was done to assess the spatial pattern of childhood febrile illness. Spatial regression was done to identify factors associated with the spatial variations of childhood febrile illness and model comparison was based on adjusted R2 and AICc. Result The prevalence of febrile illness among under-five children was 13.6% (95% CI: 12.6%, 14 .7%) with significant spatial variation across regions of Ethiopia with Moran’s I value of 0.148. The significant hotspot areas of childhood febrile illness were identified in the Tigray, Southeast of Amhara, and North SNPPR. In the GWR analysis, the proportion of PNC, children who had diarrhea, ARI, being 1 st birth order, were significant explanatory variables. In the multilevel log binomial regression age of children 7–24 months(APR = 1.33, 95% CI: (1.03, 1.72)), maternal age 30–39 years (APR = 1.36 95% CI: 1.02, 1.80)), number of children (APR = 1.78, 95% CI: 0.96, 3.3), diarrhea(APR = 5.3% 95% CI: (4.09, 6.06)), ARI (APR = 11.5, 95% CI: (9.2, 14.2)) and stunting(APR = 1.21; 95% CI: (0.98, 1.49) were significantly associated with childhood febrile illness. Conclusion Childhood febrile illness remains public health problem in Ethiopia. On spatial regression analysis proportion of women who had PNC, proportion of children who had diarrhea, proportion of children who had ARI, and proportion of children who had being 1 st birth order were associated factors. The detailed map of childhood febrile illness and its predictors could assist health program planners and policy makers to design targeted public health interventions for febrile illness."

Despite the decrement in early onset neonatal sepsis, there is still an increment in late-onset neonatal sepsis. Ethiopian demography and health survey report showed an increment in neonatal mortality in 2019/20.The objective of this study was to assess the determinants of late-onset neonatal sepsis among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Arba-Minch general hospital, southern Ethiopia.An institution based study was conducted from March 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021 in Arba-Minch general hospital. Cases were neonates diagnosed with late-onset neonatal sepsis with their index mother chart and controls were neonates admitted with other diagnoses at the same period. Cases and controls were selected consecutively. Data extraction tool and interview which was developed by reviewing different kinds of literature was used to collect data. Data were entered by using Epi data version 3.1software and transformed to Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 software for analysis. The binary logistic regression model was used to assess determinants and variables with a p-value <0.2 were transformed to multivariable logistic regression then, a p-value < 0.05 with 95% confidence interval were used to declare significant association with the outcome variable.A total of 180 subjects (60 cases and 120 controls) were included in this study. The mean age of neonates was 12.1 days with standard deviations of 4.3. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that; history of either sexually transmitted disease /urinary tract infection [AOR = 9.4; 95%CI(3.1-28.5)], being preterm (gestational age of <37 weeks) [AOR = 4.9; 95%CI (1.7-13.7)], use of endotracheal intubation/mechanical intubation [AOR = 8.3; 95%CI (1.8-26.4)]and either mixed types of infant feeding option or formula feeding before admission [AOR = 12.7; 95%CI(3.7-42.8)]were significantly associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis.This study revealed that antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum factors have shown an association with late-onset neonatal sepsis. It is recommended to strengthen counseling and advice to mothers with specific risk factors of late-onset neonatal sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W4313318690,"Background Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) remains a cause of sporadic illness and occasional outbreaks in Ethiopia and other east African countries in overcrowded and unhygienic settings. In this article, we present clinical profiles and treatment outcome of patients treated as confirmed or probable cases of LBRF at Jimma Medical Center (JMC) in southwest Ethiopia. Methods Patients treated as confirmed or probable cases of LBRF at JMC during a period of May–July 2022 were prospectively followed during their course of hospital stay. All patients were evaluated with blood film for hemoparasites, complete blood count, and liver enzymes on hospital presentation. They were followed with daily clinical evaluation during their hospital stay. Result Thirty-six patients were treated as cases of LBRF. All patients except one were from Jimma Main Prison in Jimma Town, Ethiopia. All the patients were male with mean age of 28.7 years (SD = 12.7). The diagnosis of LBRF was confirmed by detection of B . recurrentis in blood film of 14 (38.9%) of the patients; the rest were treated as presumptive case of LBRF. Fever, reported by all patients, and an acute onset epistaxis, 30 (83.3%), were the major reasons for healthcare visits. Twenty-two (61.1%) patients were having thrombocytopenia with a platelet count &lt; 150,000/μL; nine (25%) of which had severe forms (&lt;50,000/μL). All patients were treated with oral doxycycline and discharged with improvement after a mean length of hospital stay of 4.25 days (SD = 0.77), range 2–6 days. Public health emergency was activated within two days of the first cases and helped in delousing all the cases and their contacts. Conclusion LBRF remains a public health problem in Ethiopia in settings with poor personal hygiene. Patients with LBRF may present with severe thrombocytopenia and life-threatening bleeding. Early detection and treatment initiation prevents outbreak propagation and improves treatment outcome."
