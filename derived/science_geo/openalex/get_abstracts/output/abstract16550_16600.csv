https://openalex.org/W1979761686,"Peroxisomes are cytoplasmic organelles which are important in mammals in modulation of lipid homeostasis, including the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids and conversion of cholesterol to bile salts (reviewed in refs 1 and 2). Amphipathic carboxylates such as clofibric acid have been used in man as hypolipidaemic agents and in rodents they stimulate the proliferation of peroxisomes. These agents, termed peroxisome proliferators, and all-trans retinoic acid activate genes involved in peroxisomal-mediated beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Here we show that the receptor activated by peroxisome proliferators and the retinoid X receptor-alpha (ref. 6) form a heterodimer that activates acyl-CoA oxidase gene expression in response to either clofibric acid or the retinoid X receptor-alpha ligand, 9-cis retinoic acid, an all-trans retinoic acid metabolite; simultaneous exposure to both activators results in a synergistic induction of gene expression. These data demonstrate the coupling of the peroxisome proliferator and retinoid signalling pathways and provide evidence for a physiological role for 9-cis retinoic acid in modulating lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1999824494,"A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of GRB2 or H-ras proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2077389439,"Antigen-specific T cell activation depends on T cell receptor-ligand interaction and costimulatory signals generated when accessory molecules bind to their ligands, such as CD28 to the B7 (also called BB1) molecule. A soluble fusion protein of human CTLA-4 (a protein homologous to CD28) and the immunoglobulin (lg) G1 Fc region (CTLA4lg) binds to human and murine B7 with high avidity and blocks T cell activation in vitro. CTLA4lg therapy blocked human pancreatic islet rejection in mice by directly affecting T cell recognition of B7+ antigen-presenting cells. In addition, CTLA4lg induced long-term, donor-specific tolerance, which may have applications to human organ transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1967582433,"The x-ray structures of a murine MHC class I molecule (H-2Kb) were determined in complex with two different viral peptides, derived from the vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein (52-59), VSV-8, and the Sendai virus nucleoprotein (324-332), SEV-9. The H-2Kb complexes were refined at 2.3 A for VSV-8 and 2.5 A for SEV-9. The structure of H-2Kb exhibits a high degree of similarity with human HLA class I, although the individual domains can have slightly altered dispositions. Both peptides bind in extended conformations with most of their surfaces buried in the H-2Kb binding groove. The nonamer peptide maintains the same amino- and carboxyl-terminal interactions as the octamer primarily by the insertion of a bulge in the center of an otherwise beta conformation. Most of the specific interactions are between side-chain atoms of H-2Kb and main-chain atoms of peptide. This binding scheme accounts in large part for the enormous diversity of peptide sequences that bind with high affinity to class I molecules. Small but significant conformational changes in H-2Kb are associated with peptide binding, and these synergistic movements may be an integral part of the T cell receptor recognition process."
https://openalex.org/W2019993505,"Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules interact with self and foreign peptides of diverse amino acid sequences yet exhibit distinct allele-specific selectivity for peptide binding. The structures of the peptide-binding specificity pockets (subsites) in the groove of murine H-2Kb as well as human histocompatibility antigen class I molecules have been analyzed. Deep but highly conserved pockets at each end of the groove bind the amino and carboxyl termini of peptide through extensive hydrogen bonding and, hence, dictate the orientation of peptide binding. A deep polymorphic pocket in the middle of the groove provides the chemical and structural complementarity for one of the peptide's anchor residues, thereby playing a major role in allele-specific peptide binding. Although one or two shallow pockets in the groove may also interact with specific peptide side chains, their role in the selection of peptide is minor. Thus, usage of a limited number of both deep and shallow pockets in multiple combinations appears to allow the binding of a broad range of peptides. This binding occurs with high affinity, primarily because of extensive interactions with the peptide backbone and the conserved hydrogen bonding network at both termini of the peptide. Interactions between the anchor residue (or residues) and the corresponding allele-specific pocket provide sufficient extra binding affinity not only to enhance specificity but also to endure the presentation of the peptide at the cell surface for recognition by T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2157189324,"Purified bovine brain phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pl3-kinase) is composed of 85 kd and 110 kd subunits. The 85 kd subunit (p85 alpha) lacks Pl3-kinase activity and acts as an adaptor, coupling the 110 kd subunit (p110) to activated protein tyrosine kinases. Here the characterization of the p110 subunit is presented. cDNA cloning reveals p110 to be a 1068 aa protein related to Vps34p, a S. cerevisiae protein involved in the sorting of proteins to the vacuole. p110 expressed in insect cells possesses Pl3-kinase activity and associates with p85 alpha into an active p85 alpha-p110 complex that binds the activated colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. p110 expressed in COS-1 cells is catalytically active only when complexed with p85 alpha."

https://openalex.org/W2108119444,"Several subunits of the glutamate receptor of the AMPA subtype have been cloned recently. These subunits, named GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, and GluR4, exist as two splicing variants (flip and flop). We have determined the subset of AMPA receptor subunits expressed by single cerebellar Purkinje cells in culture. This was achieved by combining whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and a molecular analysis, based on the polymerase chain reaction, of the messenger RNAs harvested into the patch pipette at the end of each recording. We found that each single cell expresses the messenger RNAs encoding the following five subunits: the flip and flop versions of GluR1 and GluR2 as well as GluR3flip, GluR2 being the most abundant. In addition, GluR3flop and GluR4flip were scarcely expressed in half of these neurons, and GluR4flop was never detected."
https://openalex.org/W2011365922,The study of the human pathogen papillomaviruses (HPVs) has been hampered by the inability to propagate the virus in tissue culture. The addition of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate to the media of organotypic (raft) cultures increased expression of physiological markers of keratinocyte differentiation and concomitantly induced production of virions. Capsid production was detected in differentiated suprabasal cells. Virions approximately 54 nanometers in size were observed by electron microscopy in raft tissue cross sections in the suprabasal layers. Virions purified through isopycnic gradients were found to contain type 31b DNA and exhibited an icosahedral shape similar to that of papillomaviruses found in clinical samples.
https://openalex.org/W2006374456,"Analysis of neuronal migration in mouse cerebellar slice preparations by a laser scanning confocal microscope revealed that postmitotic granule cells initiate their migration only after the expression of N-type calcium channels on their plasmalemmal surface. Furthermore, selective blockade of these channels by addition of Ï‰-conotoxin to the incubation medium curtailed cell movement. In contrast, inhibitors of L- and T-type calcium channels, as well as those of sodium and potassium channels, had no effect on the rate of granule cell migration. These results suggest that N-type calcium channels, which have been predominantly associated with neurotransmitter release in adult brain, also play a transient but specific developmental role in directed migration of immature neurons before the establishment of their synaptic circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2018547231,"gamma-Aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The role of protein phosphorylation in the modulation of GABAA receptor function was examined with cells transiently transfected with GABAA receptor subunits. GABAA receptors consisting of the alpha 1 and beta 1 or the alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma 2 subunits were directly phosphorylated on the beta 1 subunit by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The phosphorylation decreased the amplitude of the GABA response of both receptor types and the extent of rapid desensitization of the GABAA receptor that consisted of the alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits. Site-specific mutagenesis of the serine residue phosphorylated by PKA completely eliminated the PKA phosphorylation and modulation of the GABAA receptor. In primary embryonic rat neuronal cell cultures, a similar regulation of GABAA receptors by PKA was observed. These results demonstrate that the GABAA receptor is directly modulated by protein phosphorylation and suggest that neurotransmitters or neuropeptides that regulate intracellular cAMP levels may modulate the responses of neurons to GABA and consequently have profound effects on synaptic excitability."
https://openalex.org/W1584157616,"The relative specificities of members of the G alpha q family of GTP-binding proteins were tested for their ability to activate different phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) beta isozymes. Cos-7 cells were transfected with cDNA corresponding to G alpha q, G alpha 11, G alpha 14, and G alpha 16. Most of the recombinant protein was bound to the cell membrane and these membranes were washed to elute endogenous PI-PLC activity. The membrane preparation was reconstituted with purified preparations of the PI-PLC beta isozymes and guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S)-stimulated enzyme activity was measured. All four proteins of the G alpha q family were found to stimulate PI-PLC beta 1, with G alpha q and G alpha 11 being most efficient. On the other hand, G alpha 16 was found to most effectively activate PI-PLC beta 2, while G alpha q, G alpha 11, and G alpha 14 showed less stimulation. Specific anti- G alpha 16 antibody blocked the stimulation of both PI-PLC beta 1 and PI-PLC beta 2 in the enriched membrane fraction. We conclude that there is specificity in the interaction of different members of the Gq family with different PI-PLC beta effectors. This specificity may be important in generating tissue- or receptor-specific responses in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1979555034,"Immune responses in lymphocytes require cellular accumulation of large amounts of calcium (Ca2+) from extracellular sources. In the T cell tumor line Jurkat, receptors for the Ca(2+)-releasing messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) were localized to the plasma membrane (PM). Capping of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex, which is associated with signal transduction, was accompanied by capping of IP3 receptors. The IP3 receptor on T cells appears to be responsible for the entry of Ca2+ that initiates proliferative responses."
https://openalex.org/W2042844998,"The zeta subunit of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) exists primarily as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This receptor subunit is important in TCR-mediated signal transduction and is a substrate for a TCR-activated protein tyrosine kinase. The zeta chain was found to undergo ubiquitination in response to receptor engagement. This posttranslational modification occurred in normal T cells and tumor lines. Both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated zeta molecules were modified, and at least one other TCR subunit, CD3 delta, was also ubiquitinated after activation of the receptor. These findings suggest an expanded role for ubiquitination in transmembrane receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2007231856,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF), an alkylether phospholipid, is produced in the brain when it is subjected to various stimuli. Using a Xenopus oocyte expression system, we obtained evidence for functional PAF receptor mRNA expression in rat brain. The presence of the PAF receptor was confirmed and shown to be quite ubiquitous in the CNS by RNA blot and radioligand binding studies. To investigate the neuronal functions of PAF, intracellular Ca2+ increase elicited by nanomolar PAF application was analyzed in cultured rat hippocampal cells. Fractions of NMDA-responsive cells and non-NMDA-responsive cells were shown to respond to PAF, suggesting a potential role for PAF in the Ca2+ signaling pathway in the hippocampus."

https://openalex.org/W1502533342,"A number of studies have demonstrated that the retroviral protein integrase (IN) alone is sufficient to carry out two discrete steps required for retroviral integration: the endonucleolytic processing of viral DNA ends and the cleavage and joining of host DNA to the processed viral DNA termini. Little is known about the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms involved in these reactions. Here, we employ in vitro assays of Rous sarcoma virus IN to demonstrate for the first time that IN is capable of multiple turnover in both the processing and joining reactions. The turnover number calculated for the processing reaction is 0.26 cleavages/min/mol of IN. Our steady state kinetic studies indicate that both the processing and joining activities require a multimeric form of IN. Ultracentrifugation analyses reveal a substrate-independent reversible equilibrium among the monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms of this protein. From these results we conclude that the minimal functional unit for both the processing and joining of each viral DNA end is an IN dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1532844137,"Lipoxin A4 stimulates rapid lipid remodeling and a pertussis toxin-sensitive release of arachidonic acid in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) (Nigam, S., Fiore, S., Luscinskas, F.W., and Serhan, C.N. (1990) J. Cell. Physiol. 143, 512-523) and has been shown to inhibit leukocyte responses in several systems. To examine the basis underlying these actions, we have prepared [11,12-3H]lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and characterized its interactions with human PMN. Time course studies (0-90 min) with intact PMN demonstrated cell association of 3H label which was specific and reversible. PMN bound [3H]LXA4 with a Kd of 0.5 +/- 0.3 nM, representing approximately 1,830 sites/PMN, and the Hill plot value of 1.9 suggests cooperative binding. [3H]LXA4 binding was stereoselective since neither leukotriene B4 (LTB4), lipoxin B4 (LXB4), (6S)-LXA4, 11-trans-LXA4, nor SKF 104353 competed for [3H]LXA4-specific binding while LTD4 and LTC4 partially competed. Subcellular fractionation revealed that specific binding with [3H]LXA4 was associated with membrane (42.1%)-, granule (34.5%)-, and nuclear (23.3%)-enriched fractions, a distribution distinct from that of [14,15-3H] LTB4 binding. [11,12-3H]LXA4-specific binding was modulated by guanosine analogs, suggesting the involvement of G proteins. A fluorescent LXA4 derivative (methyl-7-methoxycoumarin-LXA4) competed with [3H]LXA4 binding to intact PMN and showed specific and reversible binding as monitored by flow cytometric analysis. These results indicate that PMN possess specific recognition sites for LXA4 which may mediate its actions."
https://openalex.org/W1524030768,"We have studied a series of insulin receptor molecules in which the 3 tyrosine residues which undergo autophosphorylation in the kinase domain of the beta-subunit (Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163) were replaced individually, in pairs, or all together with phenylalanine or serine by in vitro mutagenesis. A single-Phe replacement at each of these three positions reduced insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of solubilized receptor by 45-60% of that observed with wild-type receptor. The double-Phe replacements showed a 60-70% reduction, and substitution of all 3 tyrosine residues with Phe or Ser reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation by greater than 80%. Phosphopeptide mapping each mutant revealed that all remaining tyrosine autophosphorylation sites were phosphorylated normally following insulin stimulation, and no new sites appeared. The single-Phe mutants showed insulin-stimulated kinase activity toward a synthetic peptide substrate of 50-75% when compared with wild-type receptor kinase activity. Insulin-stimulated kinase activity was further reduced in the double-Phe mutants and barely detectable in the triple-Phe mutants. In contrast to the wild-type receptor, all of the mutant receptor kinases showed a significant reduction in activation following in vitro insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation. When studied in intact Chinese hamster ovary cells, insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular substrate pp185 in the single-Phe and double-Phe mutants was progressively lower with increased tyrosine replacement and did not exceed the basal levels in the triple-Phe mutants. However, all the mutant receptors, including the triple-Phe mutant, retained the ability to undergo insulin-stimulated Ser and Thr phosphorylation. Thus, full activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is dependent on insulin-stimulated Tris phosphorylation of the kinase domain, and the level of autophosphorylation in the kinase domain provides a mechanism for modulating insulin receptor kinase activity following insulin stimulation. By contrast, insulin stimulation of receptor phosphorylation on Ser and Thr residues by cellular serine/threonine kinases can occur despite markedly reduced tyrosine autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1545688394,"Interactions between ATP and adenosine on the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and mobilization of intracellular calcium were investigated in the smooth muscle cell line DDT1 MF-2. Activation of adenosine A1 receptors with adenosine or cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) or of nucleotide receptors with ATP increased both Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation and intracellular calcium concentrations. The A1 receptor-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation (EC50 10 nM) was antagonized by the A1 antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) and by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PTX). ATP-stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation (EC50 21 microM) was attenuated, but still present, after PTX treatment. ATP and CPA had supraadditive effects on Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation and CPA increased ATP-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 3 nM, a concentration which per se had little or no effect on Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation. ATP (EC50 4 microM) and CPA (EC50 4 nM) both increased intracellular calcium levels. The effect of ATP was partially sensitive to PTX treatment, whereas the effect of CPA was blocked both by PTX and by DPCPX. Concentrations of ATP and CPA that by themselves were insufficient to raise intracellular calcium were able to do so when combined. The synergy between ATP and CPA on the mobilization of intracellular calcium was abolished after treatment of cells with PTX or when DPCPX was included in the experiment. Since ATP was metabolized by ecto-enzymes to ADP, AMP, and adenosine, we also examined whether adenosine formed from ATP could enhance the ATP effects on Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation. Indeed, the addition of the A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX or removal of endogenous adenosine by inclusion of adenosine deaminase in the experimental medium significantly attenuated the ATP response, and the two treatments did not have additive effects. The present study thus demonstrates that in a clonal cell line two types of receptors increase phospholipase C activity, but via different pathways; nucleotide receptors appeared to act via partially PTX-insensitive, and A1 receptors via PTX-sensitive G-proteins. ATP and CPA are not only able per se to induce formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and mobilize intracellular calcium, but they also act synergistically. Finally, it is demonstrated that endogenous adenosine, possibly formed from the rapid breakdown of ATP, can significantly enhance some ATP effects."
https://openalex.org/W2127671332,"Kinetoplast DNA is a network of interlocked minicircles and maxicircles. In situ hybridization, using probes detected by digital fluorescence microscopy, has clarified the in vivo structure and replication mechanism of the network. The probe recognizes only nicked minicircles. Hybridization reveals prereplication kinetoplasts (with closed minicircles), donut-shaped replicating kinetoplasts (with nicked minicircles on the periphery and closed minicircles in the center), and postreplication kinetoplasts (with nicked minicircles). Replicating kinetoplasts are associated with two peripheral structures containing free minicircle replication intermediates and DNA polymerase. Replication may involve release of closed minicircles from the center of the kinetoplast and their migration to the peripheral structures, replication of the free minicircles therein, and then peripheral reattachment of the progeny minicircles to the kinetoplast."
https://openalex.org/W2031604547,"Irish setter dogs affected with rod-cone dysplasia 1 have elevated levels of retinal cGMP resulting from deficient rod-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE) activity. We investigated the mRNAs coding for the three subunits of cGMP PDE and for the proteins involved in the activation/deactivation of this enzyme in the retinas of developing affected and control dogs. While the photoreceptor cells are viable in the diseased retinas, opsin, transducin alpha 1 and beta 1, 48 and 33 kd proteins, and cGMP PDE alpha and gamma mRNAs have normal transcript sizes and levels. In contrast, a different pattern of cGMP PDE beta mRNAs with lower than normal concentrations is present in the developing affected retinas prior to degeneration. Our observations suggest that an abnormality involving cGMP PDE beta expression is implicated in rod-cone dysplasia 1."
https://openalex.org/W1527780214,"Nuclei from bovine thymus contain a high level of partially latent protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1). More than 90% of this PP-1 is associated with the insoluble chromatin/matrix fraction and can be extracted with 0.3 M NaCl. The salt extract also contains three heat- and acid-stable inhibitory proteins of PP-1 that can be resolved on Mono Q. We have purified two of these nuclear inhibitors of PP-1 (NIPP-1a and NIPP-1b) until homogeneity. They are acidic proteins (pI = 4.4) with a molecular mass of 18 kDa (NIPP-1a) and 16 kDa (NIPP-1b) on SDS-PAGE. Judged from the larger molecular mass that was deduced from gel filtration (35 kDa), NIPP-1a and NIPP-1b appear to be asymmetric or dimeric proteins. The nuclear inhibitors totally inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP-1, but even at a 250-fold higher concentration they did not affect the activities of the other major serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP-2A, PP-2B, and PP-2C). NIPP-1a and NIPP-1b inhibited the catalytic subunit of PP-1 with an extrapolated Ki of about 1 pM, which is some three orders of magnitude better than the cytoplasmic proteins inhibitor 1/DARPP-32 and modulator. The nuclear inhibitors were not inactivated by incubation with protein phosphatases that inactivate inhibitor 1 and DARPP-32. Unlike modulator, they were not able to convert the catalytic subunit of PP-1 into a MgATP-dependent form. Remarkably, the extent of inhibition of PP-1 by NIPP-1b depended on the nature of the substrate. The phosphorylase phosphatase and casein phosphatase activities of PP-1 were completely blocked by NIPP-1b, whereas the dephosphorylation of basic proteins was either not at all inhibited (histone IIA) or only partially (myelin basic protein). These data may indicate that the acidic NIPP-1b is inactivated through complexation by basic proteins. Indeed, nonphosphorylated histone IIA antagonized the inhibitory effect of NIPP-1b on the casein phosphatase activity of PP-1. Our data show that the nucleus contains specific and potent inhibitory proteins of PP-1 that differ from earlier described cytoplasmic inhibitors. We suggest that these novel proteins may control the activity of nuclear PP-1 on its natural substrate(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2030380857,"Dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in heart demonstrate an important negative feedback property: they close, or inactivate, in response to prior Ca2+ entry. We now find that Ca2+ influx through one channel can selectively contribute to the inactivation of another adjacent channel, without a generalized elevation of bulk intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Intracellular application of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA greatly diminishes such negative interactions within Ca2+ channel pairs. These findings demonstrate that Ca2+ currents are controlled not only by intrinsic channel properties, but also by local diffusive interactions among neighboring channels. Such inhibitory coupling among channels provides a concrete example of localized Ca2+ signaling, long proposed to exist on the basis of theoretical calculations."
https://openalex.org/W1582699368,"Abstract We have investigated synthesis of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids in growth factor-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells. Those growth factors tested which act via tyrosine kinase-containing receptors (platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin growth factor I (IGF-I), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)) caused the rapid synthesis of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 and [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PtdIns is phosphatidylinositol) in [32P]P(i)-prelabeled cells and the appearance of an inositol lipid 3-OH kinase in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipates. In contrast, those growth factors tested which act via G-protein-coupled receptors (bombesin, vasopressin, prostaglandin E1) were unable to stimulate either of the above responses. Furthermore, while PDGF was able to increase the formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in streptolysin-permeabilized cells, guanosine 5'-3-(thio)triphosphate and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate were not. These results suggest that Swiss 3T3 cells possess the machinery for tyrosine kinase but not G-protein-mediated activation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-OH kinase; a situation which is the inverse to that recently described for human neutrophils. The tyrosine kinase-containing receptors differed markedly in their relative abilities to elevate the levels of [32P] PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (ranked in the order PDGF greater than or equal to IGF-I greater than EGF greater than bFGF), [32P]Ptd-OH (PDGF greater than EGF greater than bFGF; undetectable for IGF-I), and [32P]PtdIns4P (EGF greater than bFGF greater than PDGF; undetectable for IGF-I) in [32P]P(i)-prelabeled cells. These differences are epitomized by IGF-I, which was the joint most powerful stimulus for [32P] PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 formation, but was unable to stimulate a measurable accumulation of [32P]Ptd-OH (and hence, by deduction, was unable to stimulate phospholipase C). These results indicate that there is a differential ability among the tyrosine kinase-containing receptors present in a single cell to recruit phospholipase C and PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-OH kinase into their signalling complexes and further emphasizes the notion that the rapid synthesis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 may be a signalling event."
https://openalex.org/W1613877619,"Human placental 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has been purified with a new rapid procedure based on fast protein liquid chromatography, yielding quantitatively a homogeneous preparation with high specific activity catalyzing the oxidation of 7.2 mumol of estradiol/min/mg of enzyme protein at 23 degrees C, pH 9.2. This preparation was shown to have a subunit mass of 34.5 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis while having a molecular mass of 68 kDa by both Superose-12 gel-filtration and native pore gradient gel electrophoresis. When 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was expressed in HeLa cells or overproduced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, both from its cDNA encoding a protein of 34 kDa, the enzyme had the same migration in native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis as the purified one from human placenta and eluted from the Superose-12 column at the same elution volume. Moreover, all the above forms of this enzyme have similar specific activity. These results clearly demonstrate the identity of the three enzyme forms. The enzyme produced from the cDNA is expressed as a dimer, and its two subunits are identical. 17 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase subunit identity is thus proved. The NH2-terminal analysis revealed a unique sequence of Ala-Arg-Thr-Val-Val-Leu-Ile for the purified enzyme from placenta, further confirming the above conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2013961335,"The Thp deletion on mouse chromosome 17 is lethal when inherited from the mother, because it deletes the T-associated maternal effect (Tme) locus, the paternal copy of which is inactivated by genomic imprinting. We have found a paternally nonimprinted Tme variant in crosses of Thp females with Mus m. musculus males. The data are consistent with the existence of a single Tme-unlinked gene, Imprintor-1 (Imp-1), with two alleles, one of which only causes imprinting at the Tme locus. Imp-1 is unlinked to the gene for cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor and acts prezygotically. Although Tme and Igf2r were thought to be identical, they show different patterns of imprinting in interspecies hybrids. The apparent nonequivalence of the Igf2r gene and Tme results in occurrence of viable mice lacking an active Igf2r gene. These mice are bigger at birth than their normal littermates, in accord with the proposed function of the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1543127122,"Accumulation of the neurotoxin quinolinic acid within the brain occurs in a broad spectrum of patients with inflammatory neurologic disease and may be of neuropathologic significance. The production of quinolinic acid was postulated to reflect local induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by cytokines in reactive cells and inflammatory cell infiltrates within the central nervous system. To test this hypothesis, macaques received an intraspinal injection of poliovirus as a model of localized inflammatory neurologic disease. Seventeen days later, spinal cord indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and quinolinic acid concentrations in spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid were both increased in proportion to the degree of inflammatory responses and neurologic damage in the spinal cord, as well as the severity of motor paralysis. The absolute concentrations of quinolinic acid achieved in spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid exceeded levels reported to kill spinal cord neurons in vitro. Smaller increases in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and quinolinic acid concentrations also occurred in parietal cortex, a poliovirus target area. In frontal cortex, which is not a target for poliovirus, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was not affected. A monoclonal antibody to human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was used to visualize indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase predominantly in grey matter of poliovirus-infected spinal cord, in conjunction with local inflammatory lesions. Macrophage/monocytes in vitro synthesized [13C6]quinolinic acid from [13C6]L-tryptophan, particularly when stimulated by interferon-gamma. Spinal cord slices from poliovirus-inoculated macaques in vitro also converted [13C6]L-tryptophan to [13C6]quinolinic acid. We conclude that local synthesis of quinolinic acid from L-tryptophan within the central nervous system follows the induction of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, particularly within macrophage/microglia. In view of this link between immune stimulation and the synthesis of neurotoxic amounts of quinolinic acid, we propose that attenuation of local inflammation, strategies to reduce the synthesis of neuroactive kynurenine pathway metabolites, or drugs that interfere with the neurotoxicity of quinolinic acid offer new approaches to therapy in inflammatory neurologic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991170847,"Bradykinin (BK) excites a subset of dorsal root ganglion neurons by inducing an inward cation current (IBK) that strongly desensitizes and is accompanied by elevations in cGMP. We have examined the links between cGMP metabolism and IBK. The BK dose dependencies of IBK activation, desensitization, and cGMP production are comparable. Stimulation (with sodium nitroprusside [NP] or 8-bromo-cGMP [88r-cGMP]) or inhibition (with methylene blue, hemoglobin, and nitric oxide synthase [NOS] inhibitors) of cGMP levels did not mimic or diminish IBK. However, desensitization was affected by the following agents: first, desensitization was enhanced by NP and reduced by NOS inhibitors. Second, the effects of NOS inhibitors could be overcome by 8Br-cGMP or l-arginine. Third, 8Br-cGMP modification of desensitization required receptor occupancy. We conclude that the NO-cGMP pathway affects a component of IBK desensitization at the receptor or G protein level."
https://openalex.org/W1502674443,"Some of the acute actions of insulin may be mediated by an enzyme-modulating inositol phosphate glycan, produced by the insulin-sensitive hydrolysis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) that is structurally similar to a membrane protein anchor. An inositol glycan fragment from the structurally characterized Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein GPI anchor is evaluated for insulin-mimetic antilipolytic activity. The fragment specifically and dose-dependently inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. Like the effect of insulin, glycan-induced antilipolysis is blocked by the low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor imazodan (CI-914) and the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, suggesting that the activation of both cAMP phosphodiesterase and serine/threonine protein phosphatases are necessary. Moreover, this fragment causes a specific and dose-dependent inhibition of both microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) and cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) activity. Additionally, direct addition of the glycan to hepatocytes caused marked inhibition of glucose production from pyruvate. These results suggest that the direct modification of the activities of these two gluconeogenic enzymes by an inositol glycan may play a role in the inhibition of glucose output by insulin and provide the first evidence for the insulin-mimetic properties of a chemically characterized inositol glycan."
https://openalex.org/W1501459706,"The primary (alpha 1) subunit of purified skeletal muscle dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels is present in full-length (212 kDa) and truncated (190 kDa) forms which are both phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cA-PK) in vitro. In the present study, phosphorylation of the purified calcium channel by cA-PK followed by immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping revealed differential phosphorylation of the related 190- and 212-kDa forms. The 190-kDa form of the alpha 1 subunit was phosphorylated on three major and three minor tryptic phosphopeptides; the 212-kDa form was phosphorylated on all six of these phosphopeptides plus two that were unique. Time course experiments showed that a single site on the COOH-terminal portion of the full-length form of the alpha 1 subunit is most intensely and rapidly (within 10 s) phosphorylated. Phosphorylation occurs almost exclusively on this COOH-terminal site unless harsh conditions such as treatment with denaturing detergents are employed to expose phosphorylation sites within the 190-kDa segment of the molecule. Elution of phosphopeptides from the second dimension chromatograph followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antibody (anti-CP1) directed against the COOH-terminal amino acid sequence enabled us to identify this major phosphorylation site as serine 1854. The nearby consensus sites for cA-PK phosphorylation at serines 1757 and 1772 were phosphorylated only after denaturation or proteolytic cleavage. Phosphorylation of serine 1854 may play a pivotal role in the regulation of calcium channel function by cA-PK."
https://openalex.org/W1488752353,"Plasmid vectors capable of expressing the large and small subunits of the vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme were constructed and used to transform Escherichia coli. Conditions for the induction of the dimeric enzyme or the individual subunits in a soluble form were identified, and the capping enzyme was purified to near homogeneity. Proteolysis of the capping enzyme in bacteria yields a 60-kDa product shown previously to possess the mRNA triphosphatase and guanyltransferase activities (Shuman, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11960-11966) was isolated and shown by amino acid sequence analysis to be derived from the NH2 terminus of D1R. The individual subunits lacked methyltransferase activity when assayed alone. However, mixing the D1R and D12L subunits permitted reconstitution of the methyltransferase activity, and this appearance in activity accompanied the association of the subunits. In contrast, mixing the D12L subunit with the D1R-60K proteolytic fragment failed to yield methyltransferase activity or result in a physical association of the two proteins. These results demonstrate that the methyltransferase active site requires the presence of the D12L subunit with the carboxyl-terminal portion of the D1R subunit. Furthermore, since the mRNA triphosphatase and guanyltransferase active sites reside in the NH2-terminal domain of the D1R subunit, and the methyltransferase activity is found in the carboxyl-terminal portion of this subunit and D12L, there must be at least two separate active sites in this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1574422260,"A modified rat cytochrome P450c27, whose mitochondrial targeting signal had been replaced by a possible microsomal targeting signal of bovine cytochrome P450c17, was expressed in yeast. The modified P450c27 hemoprotein was correctly localized on yeast microsomes and exhibited the P450c27-dependent monooxygenase activity by addition of bovine adrenodoxin (ADX) and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase (ADR). Considering the previous observation that P450c27 with its own mitochondrial targeting signal was imported into yeast mitochondria (Akiyoshi-Shibata, M., Usui, E., Sakaki, T., Yabusaki, Y., Noshiro, M., Okuda, K., and Ohkawa, H. (1991) FEBS Lett. 280, 367-370), it is now suggested that the destination of P450c27 to either mitochondria or microsomes in yeast depends solely on the amino-terminal targeting signal. In addition, the modified P450c27 was simultaneously expressed in yeast with mature forms of bovine ADX and ADR. The recombinant yeast produced the P450 on the microsomes and mature forms of ADX and ADR in the cytoplasm, and showed the monooxygenase activity. Accordingly, a novel type of functional electron transport chain has been established between the cytoplasm and the microsomes in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1593923401,"p21ras plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation. The molecular mechanisms implicated are unknown. We report that the injection of oncogenic Lys12 Ras into Xenopus laevis oocytes promoted the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) after a lag of about 90 min. MAP kinase activity was 10-fold higher 4 h after injection of oncogenic Lys12 Ras than after injection of nononcogenic Gly12 Ras. The stimulated MAP kinase activity remained at a plateau for at least 18 h. Maximal stimulation was obtained with 5 ng of Lys12 Ras, which is similar to the amount that elicits germinal vesicle breakdown. DEAE-Sephacel chromatography of extracts from Lys12 Ras-injected oocytes showed one peak of MAP kinase. MAP kinase activation by Lys12 Ras was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase (p42). As previously shown, the S6-kinase II (likely pp90rsk), which is activated in vitro by MAP kinase, was also activated by oncogenic Lys12 Ras. Lys12 Ras with an additional mutation (Glu38) in the effector region that binds GTPase-activating protein (GAP) did not promote MAP kinase or S6 kinase activations. Thus, GAP may be involved downstream to Ras in these activation processes. Our results indicate that the Ras-GAP complex promotes MAP kinase activation in oocytes. This supports the idea that Ras-GAP controls MAP kinase, a kinase implicated in the action of various stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1479859897,"A series of peptides derived from the primary sequence of the B-chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was analyzed for their ability to inhibit the binding of 125I-PDGF-AA and 125I-PDGF-BB to PDGF alpha-receptors and PDGF beta-receptors, respectively. A 13-amino acid peptide (ANFLVWEIVRKKP), corresponding to amino acids 116-121 and 157-163 in PDGF B-chain, was found to compete with binding to both alpha- and beta-receptors. Modification of this peptide on the tryptophan residue increased its receptor competing activity. The peptide was found to be a receptor antagonist, since it inhibited dimerization and autophosphorylation of PDGF receptors. When analyzed on intact cells, the peptide was found to have, in addition to the specific inhibitory effect at the receptor level, a nonspecific inhibitory effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation. Our study has identified two regions in PDGF that are of importance for receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1484845583,"RNA triphosphatase, RNA guanylyltransferase, and RNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase activities are associated with the vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme, a heterodimeric protein containing polypeptides of M(r) 95,000 and 31,000. Although the RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase domains have been localized to a M(r) 59,000 fragment of the capping enzyme large subunit, the location of the methyltransferase domain within the protein and the catalytic role of individual subunits in methyl group transfer remain unclear. In the present work, through the study of methyltransferase activity of truncated forms of capping enzyme translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we have localized the methyltransferase domain to a complex consisting of the small subunit and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the large subunit. The M(r) 31,000 subunit translated alone was not sufficient for methyltransferase activity. This requirement for both subunits may explain the tight physical association of the two polypeptides in vivo. We have recreated the association of the large and small enzyme subunits in vitro through the translation of synthetic mRNAs encoding the two polypeptides. Study of the ability of deleted versions of the large subunit to bind the small subunit, as detected by co-immunoprecipitation, defined a 347-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region of the large subunit that was sufficient for heterodimerization. Colocalization within the large subunit of the methyltransferase and subunit association domains suggests that dimerization of the subunits may be required for methyltransferase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1547681415,"Myosin light chain phosphatase associated with smooth muscle myosin (MAPP) was isolated from chicken gizzard. The MAPP was tightly associated with myosin and was not dissociated from myosin under the physiological ionic conditions. The phosphatase was dissociated from myosin in the presence of high MgCl2, i.e. 80 mM MgCl2. The binding site of the enzyme on the myosin molecule was the subfragment-2 region, since the enzyme did bind to the myosin rod and heavy meromyosin but not to the subfragment-1 affinity column. MAPP was purified with a heparin-Sepharose 6B column, and two activity peaks were obtained, i.e. MAPP I and MAPP II. The major activity peak, MAPP I, was further purified to homogeneity by thiophosphorylated myosin light chain-Sepharose 4B column chromatography. MAPP I was a tetramer composed of four 34-kDa subunits. The enzyme preferentially dephosphorylated the beta-subunit of phosphorylase kinase and was strongly inhibited by the heat- and acid-stable protein phosphatase inhibitor-1, whereas it was partially inhibited by the inhibitor-2. The IC50 (concentration of inhibitor giving 50% inhibition) value for the inhibition of the enzyme by okadaic acid was 70 nM which was about eight times higher than skeletal muscle type-1 and 390 times higher than type-2 protein phosphatase. These results demonstrate that the MAPP I is a type-1-like protein phosphatase, although the properties are not the same as type-I phosphatase. The properties of the myosin-associated phosphatase were distinct from the phosphatases reported previously, although some properties were similar to smooth muscle phosphatase-IV. Therefore, it is concluded that MAPP I is a novel smooth muscle protein phosphatase. Since it strongly associated with smooth muscle myosin, it is likely that MAPP I is responsible for the dephosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1555849435,"Phosphorylation of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels in neurons by protein kinase C slows Na+ channel inactivation and reduces peak Na+ currents. Na+ channels purified from rat brain and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles under conditions that restore Na+ channel function were rapidly phosphorylated by protein kinase C on their 260-kDa alpha subunit. The phosphorylation reaction required Ca2+, diolein, and phosphatidylserine for activation of protein kinase C, and the rate of phosphorylation of reconstituted Na+ channels was 3- to 4-fold faster than for Na+ channels in detergent solution. Phosphorylation was on serine residues in three distinct tryptic phosphopeptides designated A, B, and C. Up to 2.5 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of Na+ channel. Following maximum phosphorylation by protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase was able to incorporate more than 2.25 mol of phosphate per mol of Na+ channel indicating that these two kinases phosphorylate distinct sites. However, prior phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase prevented phosphorylation of phosphopeptide B indicating that both kinases phosphorylate the site in this peptide. Phosphopeptide B shown here to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C and phosphopeptide 7 previously shown to be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase co-migrate on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps and evidently are identical. The reduction in peak Na+ currents caused by both protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase may result from phosphorylation of this single common site."
https://openalex.org/W1610898109,"A 55-kDa form of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (ATP:phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.67) was purified 10,166-fold from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The purification procedure included solubilization of microsome membranes with 1% Triton X-100 followed by chromatography with DE52, hydroxylapatite I, Q-Sepharose, Mono Q, and hydroxylapatite II. The procedure resulted in a nearly homogeneous 55-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase preparation. The 55-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and the previously purified 45-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase differed with respect to their amino acid composition, isoelectric points, and peptide maps. Furthermore, the two forms of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase did not show an immunological relationship. Maximum 55-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity was dependent on magnesium (10 mM) or manganese (0.5 mM) ions and Triton X-100 at the pH optimum of 7.0. The activation energy for the reaction was 12 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was labile above 30 degrees C. The enzyme was inhibited by thioreactive agents, MgADP, and calcium ions. A detailed kinetic analysis of the purified enzyme was performed using Triton X-100/phosphatidylinositol-mixed micelles. 55-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity followed saturation kinetics with respect to the bulk and surface concentrations of phosphatidylinositol and followed surface dilution kinetics. The interfacial Michaelis constant (Km) and the dissociation constant (Ks) for phosphatidylinositol in the Triton X-100 micelle surface were 1.3 mol % and 0.035 mM, respectively. The Km for MgATP was 0.36 mM. 55-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase catalyzed a sequential reaction mechanism as indicated by the results of kinetic and isotopic exchange reactions. The enzyme bound to phosphatidylinositol before ATP and released phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate before ADP. The enzymological and kinetic properties of the 55-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase differed significantly from those of the 45-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. This may suggest that the two forms of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase from S. cerevisiae are regulated differentially in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2131155800,"The rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores stimulated with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) has required superfusion or stopped-flow techniques to resolve the kinetics of Ca2+ mobilization and made it difficult to determine whether the InsP3 receptor desensitizes during prolonged stimulation. Here we have overloaded the intracellular Ca2+ stores of permeabilized rat hepatocytes by incubating them with ATP and 45Ca2+ in the presence of pyrophosphate, which precipitates Ca2+ within the lumen of the stores. Subsequent ATP removal initiated slow 45Ca2+ efflux that followed zero-order kinetics, allowing us to examine the effects of InsP3 over a prolonged time course. InsP3 produced a concentration-dependent increase in the 45Ca2+ efflux rate that was sustained for several min. The rate rapidly returned to the unstimulated level after the addition of decavanadate, a competitive antagonist of InsP3 at its receptor. Prior incubation with a submaximal concentration of InsP3 (1 microM) did not affect the subsequent enhanced rate of 45Ca2+ efflux stimulated by a higher, but still submaximal, concentration of InsP3 (3 microM). We conclude that prolonged exposure to InsP3 does not desensitize the InsP3 receptor and that intrinsic receptor desensitization cannot provide an explanation for the quantal responses to InsP3 observed in several cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1530653684,"Lysine 356 has been implicated by protein modification studies as a fructose-2,6-bisphosphate binding site residue in the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase domain of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Kitajima, S., Thomas, H., and Uyeda, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13995-14002). However, Lys-356 is found in the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain (Bazan, F., Fletterick, R., and Pilkis, S. J. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 9642-9646). In order to ascertain whether Lys-356 is involved in fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase catalysis and/or domain/domain interactions of the bifunctional enzyme, Lys-356 was mutated to Ala, expressed in Escherichia coli, and then purified to homogeneity. Circular dichroism experiments indicated that the secondary structure of the Lys-356-Ala mutant was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. The Km for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the Ki for the noncompetitive inhibitor, fructose 6-phosphate, for the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase of the Lys-356-Ala mutant were 2700- and 2200-fold higher, respectively, than those of the wild-type enzyme. However, the maximal velocity and the Ki for the competitive product inhibitor, inorganic phosphate, were unchanged compared to the corresponding values of the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, which exhibits substrate inhibition, there was no inhibition by substrate of the Lys-356-Ala mutant. In the presence of saturating substrate, inorganic phosphate, which acts by relieving fructose-6-phosphate and substrate inhibition, is an activator of the bisphosphatase. The Ka for inorganic phosphate of the Lys-356-Ala mutant was 1300-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. The kinetic properties of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase of the Lys-356-Ala mutant were essentially identical with that of the wild-type enzyme. The results demonstrate that: 1) Lys-356 is a critical residue in fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase for binding the 6-phospho group of fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 2,6-bisphosphate; 2) the fructose 6-phosphate binding site is responsible for substrate inhibition; 3) Inorganic phosphate activates fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase by competing with fructose 6-phosphate for the same site; and 4) Lys-356 is not involved in 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase substrate/product binding or catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1490924416,"Abstract The oncogenic E7 proteins of human papilloma virus (HPV 16) and of cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV) have been purified from an expression system in Escherichia coli. The proteins as purified from E. coli contain one tightly bound Zn(II) ion per molecule. The metal site shows facile exchange with either Cd(II) or Cu(I). The HPV 16 E7 maximally bound one Cd(II) or two Cu(I) ions, while the CRPV E7 bound two Cd(II) or three Cu(I) ions. The Cd(II) and Cu(I) E7 molecules exhibited optical transitions in the ultraviolet suggestive of metal:thiolate coordination. E7 proteins from HPV 16 and CRPV contain 7 and 8 cysteines/molecule, respectively. Reaction of the E7 proteins with the sulfhydryl reagent, dithiodipyridine, revealed that all the cysteinyl sulfurs are present in the reduced thiol state. Cu(I)-E7 molecules are luminescent with maximal emission at 570 nm. The observed emission at room temperature is indicative of metal coordination within a compact protein environment shielded from solvent interactions. The emission maxima occurs at the same wavelength (570 nm) as Cu(I)-cysteinyl sulfur clusters in Cu(I)-metallothioneins. The single Zn(II) atom in each protein can be removed from E7 in the presence of EDTA. The resulting apoE7 molecules remain soluble and can be partially reconstituted with Cd(II) to regain the ultraviolet charge transfer transitions."

Heart homogenate was separated into various subcellular fractions by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Various fractions were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, blotted to nitrocellulose, and GTP-binding proteins detected by incubating with [alpha-32]GTP. Three polypeptides of M(r) 23,000, 26,000, and 29,000 were specifically labeled with [alpha-32P]GTP in all the fractions examined and enriched in sarcolemmal membranes. The 23-kDa polypeptide was labeled to a higher extent with [alpha-32P]GTP than the 26- and 29-kDa polypeptides. A polypeptide of M(r) 40,000 was weakly labeled with [alpha-32P]GTP in the sarcolemmal membrane and tentatively identified as Gi alpha by immunostaining with anti-Gi alpha antibodies. Cytosolic GTP-binding proteins were labeled with [alpha-32P]GTP and their potential sites of interaction investigated using the blot overlay approach. A polypeptide of 32 kDa present in sarcolemmal membranes, intercalated discs, and enriched in heart gap junctions was identified as a major site of interaction. The low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins associated with the 32-kDa polypeptide through a complex involving cytosolic components of M(r) 56,000, 36,000, 26,000, 23,000, and 12,000. A monoclonal antibody against connexin 32 from liver strongly recognized the 32-kDa polypeptide in heart gap junctions, whereas polyclonal antibodies only weakly reacted with this polypeptide. The low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins associated with a 32-kDa polypeptide in liver membranes that was also immunologically related to connexin 32. These results indicate the presence of a subset of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins in a membrane-associated and a cytoplasmic pool in cardiac muscle. Their association with a 32-kDa component that is related to the connexins suggests that these polypeptides may be uniquely situated to modulate communication at the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1546945103,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) transduce external signals to the interior of the cell via a cytoplasmic kinase domain. We demonstrated previously that ligand-induced kinase activation of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) occurs via receptor oligomerization without propagation of conformational changes through the transmembrane (TM) domain (Lee, A. W., and Nienhuis, A. W. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 7270-7274). We have now examined the role of the different subdomains in the metabolic and signaling properties of CSF-1R. Two types of chimeric receptors have been utilized, Glyfms A, with the extracellular and TM domains of glycophorin A (GpA) and the cytoplasmic domain of CSF-1R, and Glyfms B, where only the extracellular domain originates from GpA. Glyfms A was found to exhibit a higher basal level of in vitro kinase activity, an increased associated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase activity and to support enhanced cellular mitogenesis, compared with wild-type CSF-1R or to Glyfms B. The constitutive activation of Glyfms A is consistent with the hypothesis that the TM domain may play a role in receptor oligomerization. Cross-linking with anti-GpA antibodies activated the kinase function of Glyfms B leading to an increase in PtdIns 3-kinase association and to the transmission of a mitogenic signal. Our results indicate that an activated kinase domain contains the major determinant for coupling with PtdIns 3-kinase, independent of extracellular and TM sequences and of ligand binding. Both chimeric receptors underwent internalization in the presence of anti-GpA antibodies but were not degraded, including the tyrosine-phosphorylated and kinase-active population. These results suggest that structural determinants in the extracellular domain must be important for targeting internalized receptors for lysosomal degradation."
