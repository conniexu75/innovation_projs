https://openalex.org/W1560037751,"Abstract At least four different protein fractions provided with aspartate aminotransferase activity can be isolated from pig heart cytoplasm. No difference is detected in the sedimentation coefficient, immunodiffusion properties, and primary structure (as studied by quantitative amino acid analysis and peptide mapping of tryptic digests) of the three main fractions, called, respectively, α, β, and γ in their order of increasing anodic mobility on starch gel electrophoresis. The three main fractions differ significantly in specific activity, kinetics of recombination of the apoenzyme with the coenzyme, and behavior in 8 m urea. The most visible difference among them is in the way in which the coenzyme is bound to the enzyme protein. In the α and β fractions, pyridoxal phosphate is bound mostly in an active mode, characterized by absorption peaks at 362 or 430 mµ (depending upon the pH) and by the capacity to transaminate reversibly with the amino acid substrates. In the γ form, most of the coenzyme is bound in a nonactive mode, characterized by an absorption peak at 340 mµ and by the incapacity to react with amino acid substrates. Upon aging, the α and β fractions lose some activity, while a portion of their coenzyme becomes bound in the inactive mode. Even after these changes have occurred, the various fractions maintain their electrophoretic individuality, which is also preserved after resolution and after treatment with concentrated urea. Electrophoretic analyses carried out on a water extract of a single heart taken immediately after the death of the animal reveal the presence of the various subforms; this indicates either that the various subforms exist as such in the living cell or, if they are artifacts, that they must be formed very early in the preparation and under extremely mild conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2048225608,"A new thymine-derived product was separated from DNA irradiated with utlraviolet light in vitro and in vivo. This compound was mistaken to be thymine homodiner (T=T) by other workers because it is chromatographically indistinguishable from T=T in most eluents. It has absorbancy maximums at 312, 312, and 300 millimicrons in neutral, pH 2, and pH 11 aqueous solutions, respectively. When it is irradiated in aqueous solution with wavelengths of 360 and 313 millimicrons its spectrum reverts to one similar to that of thymine. Therefore, at least three thymine-derived products can be detected in ultraviolet irradiated DNA, namely the homodimer, a material with absorbancy maximum at 312 millimicrons, and a ""minor"" product suggested by others to be a dimer of cytosine and thymine. In cells, the latter two are formed in aboult equal amounts. While these three products were shown to exist in the acid hydrolyzates of ultraviolet irradiated DNA, a material with absorbancy maximum at about 310 millimicrons was demonstrated to form in ultraviolet irradiated DNA without further treatment. The magnitude of this spectral increase varied directly with the incrcase in the adenine-thymine contents in the DNA as shlown by differential transmittance spectra of the irradiated Micrococcus lysodeikticus, calf thymus, Bacillus cereus, and Hemophilus influenzae DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1526423390,"Abstract The kinetics of hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester and of N-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester by subtilisins from the Carlsberg, Novo, and BPN' strains of Bacillus subtilis have been studied. The Km values for both substrates were similar for all three enzymes, but the Vmax values obtained with Carlsberg subtilisin were considerably higher than those obtained with the Novo and BPN' enzymes. The hydrolysis of benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester by Carlsberg subtilisin showed a sigmoid pH-velocity profile which could be fitted with a calculated titration curve for a single group with a pK' of 6.58 at 37° and 7.01 at 17°, giving a ΔHi of -7.3 kcal per mole at 0°. These data suggest that the enzyme requires a nonprotonated imidazole group for activity. Km for benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester showed little variation from pH 5.5 to 9.0, indicating that Km is probably a dissociation constant. Aromatic compounds such as indole, phenol, and hydrocinnamate were competitive inhibitors of the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester, but were noncompetitive inhibitors of the hydrolysis of benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester. Methyl butyrate, an extremely poor substrate of the subtilisins, was a competitive inhibitor of N-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester hydrolysis. The Ki values for phenol, indole, hydrocinnamate, and methyl butyrate were similar for all three subtilisins. N-Benzoyl-l-argininamide was not hydrolyzed by the subtilisins to a measurable extent, and N-acetyl-l-tyrosinamide was hydrolyzed at a rate at least 105 times slower than the corresponding ester. The subtilisins thus resemble trypsin and chymotrypsin with respect to the relative rates of cleavage of ester and amide substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1537707127,"Abstract The subcellular distribution of arylamidases in rat liver and rat kidney was studied. Lysosomes prepared from both tissues had the highest concentration of arylamidases. Different types of arylamidases have been found in the lysosomes and microsomes of these tissues. The lysosomal enzymes were inhibited by divalent metal ions, lost activity on storage, were inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, and were activated by dithiothreitol. The lysosomal enzymes from both tissues were most active against l-arginyl-β-naphthylamide. The microsomal enzymes from both liver and kidney were activated by divalent metal ions and were stable on storage. The kidney microsomal enzyme was not inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. The Co++-activated microsomal enzyme was most active against l-alanyl-β-naphthylamide."
https://openalex.org/W1588440265,"Malate dehydrogenases (diphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked) have been purified from Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Each enzyme preparation is homogeneous in its ultracentrifugational, electrophoretic, and immunochemical properties. Sephadex gel filtration studies show that the enzymes from the two Bacillus species are equal in size and that the enzymatically active forms are larger than the enzymatically active form of the E. coli malate dehydrogenase. Ultracentrifugal analyses of the native and acid-dissociated enzymes from B. subtilis and E. coli indicate that the former (mol wt 117,000) is composed of 4 subunits while the latter (mol wt 60,000) is composed of 2 subunits. Amino acid analyses and peptide mapping of tryptic digests of the former indicate that the subunits of B. subtilis enzyme are identical. There are some similarities in the amino acid compositions of the B. subtilis and E. coli enzymes, but the former is lacking both tryptophan and cysteine, while both amino acids are present in the latter enzyme. Corrected excitation and emission fluorescence spectra are presented which support the analytical values obtained for the tryptophan contents of these two enzymes. The malate dehydrogenase of B. stearothermophilus is more heat stable and has a higher optimum temperature for catalytic activity than the enzymes from the two mesophilic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1513093229,"Abstract The rate of exchange of iron from ethylenediaminetetraacetate has been studied. The substance initially formed has a spectral absorption maximum at 520 mµ. In time, this peak shifts to 470 mµ, characteristic of the transferrin-iron complex. These results suggest the initial formation of an EDTA-iron-transferrin complex. Kinetic studies as a function of ferric EDTA and of apotransferrin concentrations are consistent with such a mechanism. The rate of removal of iron from ferric transferrin was in the order EDTA g citrate g nitrilotriacetic acid. The latter two chelates, however, reached equilibrium more rapidly. The importance of steric effects, as well as stability constants, in the biological utilization of trace metals is emphasized."

https://openalex.org/W1530946118,"Abstract The inorganic pyrophosphatases isolated from the vegetative cells and spores of Bacillus subtilis proved to be similar in several physical and functional tests. These included amino acid composition, molecular weight, electrophoretic migration, stability, substrate specificity, metal requirements, and several kinetic parameters. The enzyme remains at a constant level from the end of exponential growth until shortly before forespores become refractile. Mn++, a metal specifically required for sporulation, has a marked effect on the levels of enzyme attained in the spore."
https://openalex.org/W2062350299,"Three patterns of electrical response were identified in the occipital cortex of rhesus monkeys making a differential discrimination: an input pattern that identifies which stimulus has been displayed; a reinforcement pattern that indicates whether the outcome of the differential response was rewarded or in error; and an intention pattern that occurs prior to the response and predicts which response the monkey is about to make. Neither the reinforcement nor the intention pattern is present while the monkeys perform at chance; at this time, only the differences due to input can be distinguished. These results suggest that more than simple input transmission is occurring in the primary visual mechanism. The influence of the experience of the organism is apparently encoded in the averaged electrical potentials recorded from the striate cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1521031864,"Abstract Rat liver alanine aminotransferase has been obtained in a homogeneous state according to ultracentrifugal, electrophoretic, and immunological criteria. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 114,000. No physical differences were detected in the enzyme prepared from normal and glucocorticoid-treated animals. The enzyme exhibited an absorption maximum at 430 mµ at pH 5.0 and at 335 mµ at pH 8.3. After conversion to the pyridoxamine form, a maximum at 325 mµ appeared. Reaction of the enzyme with amino-oxyacetate shifted the 430 mµ peak to 370 mµ. The enzyme appeared to exist in several closely related forms of slightly different mobility on acrylamide gel. In the absence of the reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol, a series of aggregated forms of the enzyme arose."

The erythrocytopoiesis induced by the Friend and Rauscher viruses can be inhibited in a hypertransfused polycythemic state. Like erythropoietin, the polycythemic virus can initiate erythropoiesis in this state. However, the mechanism by which the polycythemic virus initiates erythropoiesis in this state is not understood. These studies also show similarity of the Friend and Rauscher viruses in their erythropoietic response."
https://openalex.org/W1480168262,"Abstract Aspartase from Enterobacter aerogenes was found to have a molecular weight of approximately 180,000, and was cleaved by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate into four subunits. Active tetramer was regenerated by treating the mercury derivative with mercaptoethanol. A careful examination of velocity-concentration plots over a wide range of pH revealed evidence of homotropic substrate interactions which were pH-dependent. Some confirmatory evidence was obtained for nucleotide activation reported by other workers. The pH optimum and apparent Km at 30° were found to be 8.5 and 1.5 x 10-3 m. The aspartase used in these experiments possessed the highest specific activity yet reported."
https://openalex.org/W1488741230,"Abstract Treatment of dog thyroid slices with an enzyme present in the growth medium of Clostridium perfringens makes them unresponsive to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as measured by the oxidation of glucose-1-14C to 14CO2. This enzyme appears to be phospholipase C since (a) both the anti-TSH effect and the phospholipase activity are inseparable over a 240-fold purification, (b) both activities are inhibited by 5 x 10-4 m ethylenediaminetetraacetate and destroyed by boiling, and (c) the addition of excess phospholipid protects the thyroid from the enzyme. Phospholipase C appears to abolish the responsiveness to TSH by producing a specific alteration in the thyroid cell membrane, since thyroids treated with enzyme oxidize glucose at a normal rate in the absence of TSH and respond normally to acetylcholine, a substance previously shown to increase glucose oxidation in the thyroid."
https://openalex.org/W1995734996,"A comparison of the communicative gestures of vervets with those of other cercopithecines reveals both similarities and differences. Examples have been given of gestures (i) exhibited by all cercopithecines, (ii) rare or absent in vervets and common in several other species, (iii) demonstrated by vervets and a few other cercopithecines, and (iv) common in vervets and rare or absent in other members of the subfamily. Vervets, baboons, and rhesus monkeys have approximately the same number of visual signals in their behavioral repertoires—46, 42, and 49, respectively. Patas monkeys seem to have a smaller repertoire. Fifty-nine percent of the vervet patterns have also been described for rhesus monkeys, 63 percent for baboons, and 54 percent for patas. In cercopithecines, visual communicative patterns seem to be evolutionarily one of the most stable forms of behavior, in structural terms. Some of the greatest differences in communicative gestures are differences in the temporal aspects. In species of this subfamily, vocal patterns seem to vary more than visual signals. Greater structural differences in communicative gestures may be found in the Cercopithecinae when systematic field studies are made of some of the forest-dwelling species, about which we know very little."
https://openalex.org/W1593715644,"Abstract 1. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase was purified from the vegetative cells and spores of Bacillus cereus var. terminalis. The enzymes from the vegetative cell and the spore were found to have similar physical and catalytic properties. A mutant (strain 29) with only 2% of the level of enzyme activity in the vegetative cell also had a comparably low level in the spore. 2. The vegetative cell enzyme is inducible by inosine. Nevertheless, sporulation in the absence of inducer leads to high enzyme levels in the sporulating cell and spore, presumably due to endogenous changes during the stationary phase preceding spore development. The enzyme activity in mutant strain 29 appeared to be constitutive. 3. Spores of mutant strain 29 with only 3% of the level of enzyme activity of wild type spores germinated in response to inosine as rapidly and as completely as did the wild type spores."

https://openalex.org/W2015317352,"Three groups of monkeys were raised with different degrees of contact with their peers. The first group was allowed no contact, the second only visual and auditory contact, and the third was allowed complete and normal contact with their peers. Animals of all three groups were allowed to interact socially; they were then tested for their preference for monkeys raised under the same conditions or for monkeys raised under different conditions. Monkeys raised under the same conditions preferred each other, even if the stimulus animals were completely strange to the test monkey."

https://openalex.org/W1606254143,"Abstract Bovine plasminogen activator was isolated from a mixture of streptokinase and human plasminogen. The method of preparation was based on the difference in solubility between the activator and its precursors. The activator can be prepared from either crude or highly purified streptokinase and highly purified human plasminogen. The activator complex gave a single component in starch gel electrophoresis, in either lysine or e-aminocaproic acid buffers, and in immunochemical studies with a specific rabbit antibody to human plasminogen. However, the mobility of the activator was different from human plasmin, human plasminogen, or streptokinase both in starch gel electrophoresis and in immunoelectrophoresis. The activator can be dissociated into two components, apparently corresponding to streptokinase and human plasmin, by electrophoresis in starch gels. Gel diffusion analyses with specific antibody revealed that the activator was immunologically identical with both human plasmin and human plasminogen. In sedimentation velocity experiments, the activator showed a single component in e-aminocaproic acid buffers with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 5 S. In lysine buffers, activator showed some heterogeneity, but the sedimentation coefficient of the major component was found to be approximately 11 S. The apparent molecular weight of activator by sedimentation equilibrium methods, in e-aminocaproic acid buffers, was found to be approximately 150,000. In lysine buffers the apparent molecular weight in dilute solutions was found to be approximately 138,000, whereas in concentrated solutions the molecular weight was found to be approximately 308,000. These data suggest a possible monomer-dimer relationship which is concentration dependent. The dimer form appeared to be present when activator was dissolved in lysine buffers, in concentrated solutions only, whereas the monomer form was always found when activator was dissolved in e-aminocaproic acid buffers."

https://openalex.org/W1542601025,"Abstract Rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase is irreversibly inhibited by Be++. In the presence of those chelators which, together with Mg++, serve to stimulate the enzyme when preincubated in the absence of substrate, 1 g atom of Be++ is bound per mole of enzyme. Other procedures which were calculated to remove unknown inhibitory ions in the isolated enzyme (ethylenediaminetetraacetate, 8-hydroxyquinoline, passage over Dowex 50) also permit Be++ inactivation. Beryllium binding, which exhibits an activation energy of 19.9 kcal, prevents phosphorylation of dephospho-enzyme and dephosphorylation of phospho-enzyme. Exposure to 4 m urea facilitates Be++ inactivation and also results in removal of bound Be++ with partial recovery of activity. Be++ similarly affects phosphoglucomutases from shark and flounder muscle, rabbit liver, and Escherichia coli but not those from Micrococcus lysodeikticus or Bacillus cereus. Flounder enzyme, which is generally unstable, is much more readily denatured by urea than is rabbit enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1486337844,"Bovine carbonic anhydrase (carbonate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.1) was observed to act as a powerful competitive inhibitor of the reduction of cytochrome c by xanthine oxidase. Carbonic anhydrase did not compete with the substrates of xanthine oxidase or with electron acceptors other than cytochrome c. Ki for carbonic anhydrase was influenced by changes in dielectric constant, ionic strength, and pH in a manner which suggested that its interaction with xanthine oxidase was primarily based on electrostatic forces. Neither sulfonamide inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase nor the removal of zinc from carbonic anhydrase interfered with its ability to compete with cytochrome c, but heat denaturation completely destroyed its inhibitory capacity. A variety of proteins chosen at random were found unable to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c by xanthine oxidase, and carbonic anhydrase did not inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c by microsomal reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome c reductase. Human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase B did not substitute for the mixed bovine carbonic anhydrase. Ki for carbonic anhydrase was invariant with temperature in the range from 24.5° to 51°. The value of ΔF° for the association of carbonic anhydrase with xanthine oxidase was -11.7 kcal per mole, and the corresponding value of ΔS° was +59 e.u. per mole. The binding of 1 molecule of carbonic anhydrase appeared capable of preventing the binding of somewhat more than 1 molecule of cytochrome c to xanthine oxidase."

The major part of the calcium found in the isolated mitochondria was of extramitochondrial origin and was accumulated by this fraction during the homogenization of the tissue. A small amount of Ca++, however, appeared to accumulate in the mitochondria in vivo as a result of the action of parathyroid hormone. Usually there was an impaired uptake and retention of Ca++ by the mitochondria in vitro, but in some experiments the mitochondria exhibited a pattern of normal Ca++ transport, respiration, and respiratory control."
https://openalex.org/W1496063364,"Abstract A Ca++-dependent extracellular nuclease which degrades high molecular weight native and denatured deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid completely to nucleoside 3'-monophosphates has been partially purified from culture fluids of Bacillus subtilis. The enzyme is easily prepared and completely stable to storage for over a year. Degradation of DNA and RNA is predominantly exonucleolytic. The approximate ratio of exo- to endonucleolytic scissions by the enzyme of native phage λ DNA is 2 x 104, of single stranded circular M13 phage DNA it is 103, and of 23 S Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA it is 102. Hydrolysis of oligoribonucleotides terminated with a 3'-phosphate group occurs from the 3' end. Hydrolysis of oligoribonucleotides lacking a 3'-phosphate is 5- to 20-fold slower and is not exclusively from either the 3' or the 5' end. Denatured DNA appears to be degraded from the 5' end of the chain but a simultaneous attack from the 3' terminus cannot be excluded."

The input energy was held relatively constant for each of these microorganisms, but the capacitance and voltage were varied. Data are presented which show the degree of disinfection as a function of capacitance and voltage. In all cases, the degree of disinfection for a given input energy increases as both capacitance and voltage are lowered."

https://openalex.org/W1493826077,"As part of a study of the role of dipeptidases in Escherichia coli K-12, cells harvested from a peptone-glycerol medium were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and lysozyme or were subjected to osmotic shock following exposure to EDTA. Neither treatment causes the liberation into the medium of significant amounts of the enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycyl- l -leucine, glycyl- l -phenylalanine, l -leucylglycine, and l -phenylalanylglycine; the relative amount of enzymic activity toward each dipeptide that is released is almost identical with the extent of β-galactosidase leakage. The peptidases retained in both intact spheroplasts and osmotically shocked cells exist in a latent condition and their full activity is demonstrable only after further disruption of the spheroplasts by lysis or of the shocked cells by sonic disintegration. The β-galactosidase activity of shocked cells is very much higher than the activity of intact cells (assayed with o-nitrophenyl β- d -galactoside as substrate). Both intact spheroplasts and shocked cells, however, exhibit only slightly more peptidase activity than is seen when intact cells are tested under the same assay conditions. Thus, the factors responsible for the crypticity of the peptidases in intact bacterial cells remain operative in cells modified by treatment with EDTA and lysozyme or by subjection to osmotic shock."
https://openalex.org/W1593756863,"Abstract To obtain information concerning the factors that control the ability of Escherichia coli strain K-12 to hydrolyze glycyl-l-leucine, glycyl-l-phenylalanine, l-leucylglycine, and l-phenylalanylglycine, a study was made of the intracellular localization of the specific dipeptidases and of the effect of changes in cultural conditions on the dipeptidase content of the bacteria. Upon fractionation of cell extracts, significant activity only toward Leu-Gly is found in the ribosomal portion, while at least three peptidases can be shown to be present in the soluble portion: one, which is relatively insensitive to ethylenediaminetetraacetate, is activated by Co2+ and catalyzes the hydrolysis of Gly-Leu and Gly-Phe; the other two, both of which are EDTA-sensitive, differ in their response to Co2+ and to Mn2+, and in their action on Leu-Gly and Phe-Gly. All the dipeptidases are present in cells grown in peptone-containing media, and the specific activity values of each subcellular fraction, as well as the distribution of peptidase activity between the two fractions, are essentially constant whether the cells are harvested from exponential phase or stationary phase cultures. The dipeptidases are also found in extracts of cells grown in synthetic media devoid of peptone, and the fact that the specific enzymic activity toward each dipeptide is the same regardless of the composition of the growth medium and of the age of the culture indicates that the dipeptidases may be classified as constitutive enzymes. In intact bacteria, the dipeptidases exist in a partially latent condition, and the demonstrable activity of whole cells toward the dipeptides is subject to control by environmental factors, among which are the metal ion content and pH of the culture medium. Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that exposure of bacteria to a mixture of metallic salts (either during culture growth or after the attainment of the stationary phase) leads to the replacement of the metal component of active peptidases by a metal that is inhibitory to enzyme action in vivo; upon disruption of the bacteria, the inactive metal-peptidase complexes dissociate and the peptidases can regain activity. In cells that can form such metal-enzyme complexes, the peptidases are protected from inactivation by exogenous H+, while acid stability is lacking in cells grown in a metal-deficient medium. Among the metals usually present in culture media, Zn2+ appears to be the most important in regulating the peptidase activity of bacterial cells."
