https://openalex.org/W2000387713,"In a sentence reading task, words that occurred out of context were associated with specific types of event-related brain potentials. Words that were physically aberrant (larger than normal) elecited a late positive series of potentials, whereas semantically inappropriate words elicited a late negative wave (N400). The N400 wave may be an electrophysiological sign of the ""reprocessing"" of semantically anomalous information."

https://openalex.org/W2025704802,"At several points during the growth of a clone of human embryonic lung fibroblasts in vitro, 100 to 200 cells were removed at random and the proliferative potential of each cell was determined. At each sample point, a wide variation in remaining population doubling ability was observed among the individual cells and the distributions of doubling potentials were distinctly bimodal. Furthermore, the two cells arising from a single mitosis differed in their ability to proliferate by as many as eight population doublings (256-fold in the number of cells produced). The results suggest that a stochastic process is responsible for determining the limited proliferative potential of human embryonic lung fibroblasts."

The results reveal that stereopsis emerges at 3Â½ to 6 months of age, an outcome consistent with evidence for rapid postnatal development of the visual system."

These significant permeabilities should allow the peptides to fill the extracellular brain space with a half time of 3 to 11 minutes, as a result of a step increase in plasma concentration of unbound peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2033384960,"Concentrations of norepinephrine in cerebrospinal fluid are higher in schizophrenic patients, particularly in those with paranoid features, than in normal volunteer subjects of the same age. This observation supports recent reports of elevated concentrations of norepinephrine in specific brain areas adjacent to the cerebral ventricles of paranoid schizophrenic patients. Overflow of the amine from periventricular regions into the cerebrospinal fluid may reflect abnormally high release or diminished enzymatic destruction of norepinephrine in patients with schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W1985118752,"Characteristic potentiation of rat locomotion responses and acoustic startle reflexes that normally appear in the third postnatal week was absent in rats exposed to diazepam during the third week of gestation. Loss of these behaviors suggests a long-term effect that may result from changes in cellular development. Tissue undergoing neuronal differentation may be especially sensitive to drugs that act on the central nervous system, and the period in which differentiation occurs is perhaps critical for the induction of changes that are later expressed as altered behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2083080932,"Stereoisomers of the barbiturate anesthetic pentobarbital were applied to mouse spinal neurons growing in tissue culture. Intracellular recordings of neuronal membrane properties revealed that the (+) and (-) isomers caused direct changes in membrane potential and conductance on some but not all of the cells tested. The action of the (+) isomer was predominantly excitatory, whereas the (-) isomer produced predominantly inhibitory responses. The (-) isomer was considerably more effective in potentiating inhibitory responses to the transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. The results show that pentobarbital has multiple effects on neuronal excitability and demonstrate the presence of stereospecific sites of barbiturate action on central neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1989294287,"Acid extract of human placental tissue contain, by both radioimmunoassay and radioreceptor assay, beta-endrophin-like material. Half of this material will not go through a 5000-dalton filter and on Sephadex G-200 has a molecular size between 25,00 and 50,000 daltons. Of the material going through a 5000-dalton ultrafilter, 80 percent is excluded on Sephadex G-25 and held back, very slightly, on Bio-Rad P6, indicating a molecular size of approximately 4500 to 4800 daltons. Thus, placenta appears to have macromolecular precursors from which a beta-endorphin-like material is released, with a size approximately 12 amino acids longer than half of the pituitary hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2056432431,"The epithelium of the hamster trachea in organ culture undergoes hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia after exposure to the amphibole types of asbestos, crocidolite and amosite. These changes are inhibited when the synthetic vitamin A analog, retinyl methyl ether, is incorporated into the culture medium. These findings suggest a possible use for retinoids in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract disease associated with environmental exposure to asbestos."

We have examined the status of, and potential for, university-industry research consortia and research partnerships and the current and prospective roles of the federal government in stimulating such relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2044588534,"When unilamellar vesicles were administered subcutaneously in mice, the half-time for the destruction of the vesicles varied from 12 to 600 hours, depending on their composition. The vesicles tested consisted of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and certain sugar and amino-sugar derivatives of cholesterol. Vesicle with amino-sugar derivatives showed the greatest longevity and became localized with high specificity in aggregates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A substantial delay between the time that the vesicles broke open and the time that labels contained in the vesicles were excreted suggests that the vesicles undergo endocytosis before destruction."

https://openalex.org/W2081965227,"A new N-methylpurine riboside (doridosine), probably N1-Methylisoguanosine, was isolated from the digestive glands of a nudibranch. Doridosine produces prolonged hypotension and bradycardia in anesthetized rats, decreases the rate and the amplitude of contraction of guinea pig atria in vitro, and causes the heart rate in anesthetized mice to be reduced by 50 percent for many hours after which the animals recover completely."
https://openalex.org/W2009731382,"Twenty adjacent ganglion cells in cat retina were partially reconstructed from electron micrographs of serial thin sections. Cells were classified by size and by dendritic branching patterns as alpha, beta, or gamma cells. The alpha and beta cells were further subdivided by differences in the laminar distribution of their dendrites in the inner plexiform layer. The distribution of synaptic contacts on the cells was distinctive for each of the five major classes. Contacts on the alpha and beta cells were mainly on the dendrites in the sublamina in which a cell's major dendritic arborization was contained."

https://openalex.org/W2026565256,"Continuous intravenous infusion of ribose (200 milligrams per kilogram per hour) for 24 hours induced a marked stimulation of cardiac adenine nucleotide biosynthesis in unanesthetized and unrestrained rats that had been treated with isoproterenol subcutaneously (25 milligrams per kilogram). The diminution of adenine nucleotides characteristic for the action of high doses of isoproterenol was entirely prevented, and the incidence of the isoproterenol-induced myocardial cell damage was significantly reduced when ribose was administered. These results support the view that depletion of adenine nucleotides is involved in the development of cardiac necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081824500,"A wire-form miniature palladium-palladium oxide electrode has been fabricated for pH measurement. The electrode exhibits a super-Nernstian behavior and gives a mean pH response of 71.4 millivolts per [pH] (standard deviation, 5.2 millivolts). Uncorrected zero current potential values can be used to determine the pH value of the medium to within 0.012 pH. The electrode should find applications in biological, medical, and clinical studies."

https://openalex.org/W1984705591,"Gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry has been used to quantitate tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in fly ash collected from the stack of a typical commercial coal-fired power plant. No TCDD was detected in this fly ash, but minute traces may be present below the detection limit of 1.2 parts per trillion (by weight). This finding indicates that this type of fossil-fueled power plant is not a large source of this compound in environmental samples, in contrast to the conclusions presented in a recent industrial report."
https://openalex.org/W2018085269,"The commitment theory of human fibroblast aging predicts that 55 percent of cells will be nondividing at the middle to late stages of the replicative lifespan; in the present study, however, fewer than 10 percent were nondividing. The fact that no immortal diploid cells have yet been reported is also at odds with the theory. Available data on the variable life-span of clones and mass cultures, the dependence of longevity on population size, and the predominance of certain cell types at termination of a culture are compatible with simpler theories, which support the idea that the limited replicative life-span of diploid fibroblasts is a valid model for organismic aging."
https://openalex.org/W2014299013,"Studies of the effects of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on local cerebral glucose utilization by means of the carbon-14-labeled deoxyglucose method demonstrate a dose-dependent metabolic activation in the superficial layer of the superior colliculus in the rat. Apomorphine stimulated glucose utilization in a number of other cerebral structures, but only the effect in the superficial layer of the superior colliculus depended on an intact retinal input. This effect was present with the animal in the light or in the dark, but was abolished by enucleation, which left the effects in other cerebral structures unimpaired. Activation of the superficial layer of the superior colliculus appears, therefore, to be secondary to an action of apomorphine on dopaminergic systems within the retina."

https://openalex.org/W2047436797,Dimethyl sulfate and its hydrolysis product monomethyl sulfate have been found at concentrations as high as 830 parts per million in fly ash and in airborne particulate matter from coal combustion processes. This discovery poses a new environmental problem because of the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of these compounds.

Higher SOD activity was found in livers of mice having H-2b/A.BY, B10, and C3H.SW/haplotypes than in those of H-2a, H-2k and H-2d haplotypes. Segregation studies supported these correlations. In H-2 recombinant strains of mice, the genes influencing the liver SOD activity occur, as ascertained by mapping techniques, at or near the H-2D region of the major histocompatibility complex."
