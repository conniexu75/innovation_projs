https://openalex.org/W1983768860,"In rats a graded series of stressors produced progressively greater suppression of lymphocyte function, as measured by the number of circulating lymphocytes and by phytohemagglutinin stimulation of lymphocytes in whole blood and isolated cultures. This evidence suggests that stress suppresses immunity in proportion to the intensity of the stressor."
https://openalex.org/W1570978364,"A cytochrome P-450 from neonatal pig testicular microsomes was purified to homogeneity as judged by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and by double diffusion on agar against antiserum raised in rabbits against the protein. The enzyme shows both 17 alpha-hydroxylase (Vmax = 4.6 nmol of product/min/nmol of P-450, Km = 1.5 microM) and C17,20 lyase (Vmax = 2.6 nmol of product/min/nmol of P-450, Km = 2.4 microM) activities. Both activities require NADPH and a flavoprotein P-450 reductase; microsomal P-450 reductase from pig and rat livers was used in these studies. The enzyme possesses a single subunit of molecular weight 59,000 +/- 1,000 as determined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide with sodium dodecyl sulfate and by chromatography on sodium dodecyl sulfate-Sephadex. The enzyme is a glycoprotein and contains 8 nmol of heme/mg of protein and 40 nmol of phospholipid/mg of protein. All heme detected by pyridine hemochromogen is accounted for as P-450 by difference spectroscopy of the reduced P-450.carbon monoxide complex. This complex shows an absorbance maximum at 448 nm with no evidence of P-420. These studies raise the possibility that one microsomal protein (cytochrome P-450) may possess two enzymatic activities (hydroxylase and lyase)."
https://openalex.org/W1490687264,"Bone cells respond to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) for mineral mobilization and contain receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3. We report here the expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25 (OH)D3) metabolizing enzymes in primary cultures of human bone cells, as well as n a human osteosarcoma cell line. Human bone cells were obtained by enzyme digestion of the extracellular matrix of bone from iliac crest biopsies from 3 male patients without primary bone disease. These cells were plated (5 X 10(4)/min) in medium with 10% fetal calf serum and proliferated to confluence in 10-14 days. At confluence, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium. The cells were preincubated in this serum-free medium for 24 h prior to incubating them 2-4 h with [3H]25(OH)D3 (10-20 nM). The vitamin D metabolites synthesized during this incubation were extracted from the medium and cells with dichloromethane, then separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, followed by high performance liquid chromatography. The cells synthesized 1,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) with the specific activities of the 1- and 24-hydroxylases similar in magnitude to those in kidney cells in vitro. The enzymes could be regulated by external perturbations, in that the activity of the 1-hydroxylase was inhibited by preincubation of the cells for 8 h with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 nM), whereas the 24-hydroxylase was enhanced. Incubation of the cells in a low calcium medium (0.6 mM) depressed the 24-hydroxylase activity. We conclude: 1) normal human bone cells can produce 1,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 in vitro in amounts similar to kidney cells, suggesting a physiological significance and 2) this synthesis could account for the increase in osteoclast number in anephric patients with renal osteodystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2037959172,"The 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose technique was used to measure regional cerebral glucose utilization by human subjects during functional activation. Normal male volunteers subjected to one or more sensory stimuli (tactile, visual, or auditory) exhibited focal increases in glucose metabolism in response to the stimulus. Unilateral visual hemifield stimulation caused the contralateral striate cortex to become more metabolically active than the striate cortex ipsilateral to the stimulated hemifield. Similarly, stroking the fingers and hand of one arm with brush produced an increase in metabolism in the contralateral postcentral gyrus, compared with the homologous ipsilateral region. The auditory stimulus, which consisted of a monaurally presented factual story caused an increase in glucose metabolism in the auditory cortex in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. These results demonstrate that the technique is capable of providing functional maps in vivo related to both body region and submodality of sensory information in the human brain."

https://openalex.org/W1577257516,"Abstract We have recently developed an in vitro DNA synthesis system in which a synthetic heptaribonucleotide pairs with a unique site on a single-stranded fd DNA molecule and thereby primes the growth of new DNA strands from this single point (Huang, C.-C., and Hearst, J. E. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 103, 127-139). In this report, we use this system to investigate the mechanism by which various bacteriophage T4 DNA replication stimulate the T4 DNA polymerase. We find that with the accessory proteins present (the T4 gene 44/62 and 45 proteins), the DNA polymerase proceeds rather rapidly through the occasional hairpin helices which otherwise interrupt the progress of this enzyme along single-stranded DNA templates. By using a potent inhibitor of the 44/62 ATPase, ATP gamma S (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)), we have obtained data which suggest that ATP hydrolysis is required for the formation of a polymerase accessory protein-DNA template complex, and that this complex then persists, serving as a sliding clamp which greatly increases the strength of binding between a T4 DNA polymerase molecule and its 3'OH primer template end. The progress of the T4 DNA polymerase though hairpin helices in the DNA template is also stimulated by addition of the T4 helix-destabilizing protein (gene 32 protein). The effect of the 44/62 and 45 is independent of the effect of the 32 protein in this assay, and the rate of polymerase travel over the strongest hairpin helices is increased more than 40-fold in the presence of these four additional proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1510081009,"Abstract The biosynthesis of the HLA-DR antigens was studied in the B lymphoblastoid cell line BRI 8. Three chains, of molecular weights 33,000 (alpha), 31,000 (p31), and 26,000 (beta) were detected intracellularly in pulse-labeled cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-(HLA-DR) sera. The alpha and beta chains were inserted asymmetrically into the rough endoplasmic reticulum as transmembrane polypeptides with the majority of the polypeptide chains oriented in the lumen. At this stage, both chains carried high mannose oligosaccharide units which were processed to the complex form during subsequent intracellular transport to the cell surface. The Mr = 31,000 polypeptide was also glycosylated but was structurally distinct from the alpha chain and was probably oriented differently in the lipid bilayer, with a much greater proportion of its polypeptide chain exposed in the cytoplasm. It ws not, therefore, a precursor of the alpha chain. The mature HLA-DR antigens at the plasma membrane comprised polypeptides of Mr = 34,000 and 28,000. These chains corresponded to the processed alpha and beta chains. Although the Mr = 31,000 component was only detected intracellularly, it was not ruled out that some or all of it may have been processed and exposed on the cell surface with an apparent molecular weight indistinguishable from that of the alpha chain."

https://openalex.org/W2011148098,"A rapid laser scanning system was developed to map the spread of excitation in amphibian and mammalian hearts stained with fluorescent dye. Isochronic maps of conduction were constructed by timing the upstroke of the optical action potential; 128 sites could be scanned in 4 milliseconds. The accuracy of this technique was verified by recording simultaneously from 16 unipolar electrodes placed in different areas of the heart. Conducted action potentials in normal frog heart propagated at 0.1 meter per second. Propagation of action potentials was also monitored in ischemic cat heart, in which both driven and arrhythmic action potential upstrokes could be tracked. The results suggest that this system is capable of scanning the normal and abnormal spread of electrical activity in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2085651395,"Among inadequately immunized laboratory animals dying of rabies, a small but consistent proportion succumb after an incubation period shorter than that of any of the unvaccinated controls1–3,7 and this phenomenon has been termed ‘early death’. It has also been shown that, after immunosuppression either with cyclophosphamide or by thymectomy and irradiation4, rabies-infected animals survive longer with decreased incidence of paralysis. It appears that ‘early death’ also occurs in humans who have been treated (unsuccessfully) with vaccine, with or without accompanying serum therapy5–7, after exposure to rabies. Collectively, these studies suggest that there is a immunopathological component in rabies virus infection. We have therefore investigated a model of lethal rabies infection in immunosuppressed mice and have concluded that B lymphocytes or antibody specific for rabies play a part in the causation of early death. Accordingly the immune response to rabies has a dual role8, sometimes favouring survival but sometimes enhancing the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1568516045,"The steady state concentration ratios of [3H]methylamine and [14C]SCN- were measured to determine the pH gradient and electrical potential, respectively, across the membrane of purified, intact, neurosecretory vesicles from bovine posterior pituitary. The intravesicular pH was 5.8 when the medium pH was 7. Varying the external pH had only a small effect on the intravesicular pH and resulted in a change in the pH gradient. Extrapolation to zero pH gradient yielded a value of 5.5 for the intravesicular pH. When the medium pH was 7, the pH gradient collapsed in the presence of ammonium sulfate or the combination of nigericin and K+. Measurement of the thiocyanate distribution across the vesicle membrane suggested the existence of an inside negative membrane potential. Mg2+ ATP caused a marked shift in the potential to +50 mV (inside positive) without altering the intravesicular pH. This shift was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. The possible roles of the large pH gradient and membrane potential in the storage of peptide hormones and their secretion is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2078352345,"We describe a method for generation of homogeneous cell populations that each arise from clonal expansion of cells at a discrete stage of differentiation within a single lineage. We have used this to produce continuously propagatable lymphocyte clones. Each clone represents a cell at a progressive stage of thymus-dependent cellular differentiation. These cloned cells bear stable surface membrane glycoproteins characteristic of precursor cells and mature progeny; conditions allowing maximal cloning efficiencies for each cell type (10-85%) have been established. Mature lymphocyte clones continue to express specialized function and provide material for biochemical analysis of T lymphocyte functions; one fully differentiated clone from the ""inducer"" lymphocyte set synthesizes a molecule that activates other lymphocytes to secrete immunoglobulin. This activity is associated with a highly purified molecule having a molecular weight of 45,000 daltons and an isoelectric point of approximately 6.0. This molecule, together with clones of precursor and mature T lymphocytes, may provide a system to further study the mechanisms of gene activation during cellular differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2040051140,"A single injection of the melanotropin analog [4-norleucine, 7-D-phenylalanine]-alpha-melanotropin into frogs (Rana pipiens) caused near maximum darkening of the skins of the frogs for at least 6 weeks. Injections of the natural hormone alpha-melanotropin or of the analog [Nle4]-alpha-melanotropin also caused darkening, but this effect lasted only a few days. Morphological examination of the skins of frogs injected with [Nle4, D-Phe7]-alpha-melanotropin revealed that both dermal and epidermal melanophores were dispersed during the entire 6-week period. In vitro [Nle4, D-Phe7]-alpha-melanotropin also causes prolonged darkening of the skin of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. In the absence of the melanotropin, skins previously darkened with the analog could be lightened by removal of calcium from the incubation medium but could then be redarkened by adding calcium. The cycle could be repeated indefinitely without addition of melanotropin. These results demonstrate the role of calcium in receptor signal transduction and the prolonged biological effects of [Nle4, D-Phe7]-alpha-melanotropin long after its removal from the assay medium."
https://openalex.org/W1545130210,"The possibility that hormone-induced changes in the synthesis of individual proteins may serve as initiating events for the rapidly evolving glucocorticoid-induced metabolic suppressions in rat thymus cells was examined. Synthetic rates of about 2500 individual proteins were screened using giant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Dexamethasone induces large, rapid increases in the rates of synthesis of at least three and more subtle increases in another three proteins. Increases in the rates of synthesis of four of these six proteins occur within 15 to 45 min. The time course suggests that changes in the synthesis of some or all of these four proteins may serve to generate the rapidly evolving hormone-induced inhibition of glucose transport. More slowly emerging changes in two other proteins parallel the latter metabolic effects of decreased mitochondrial ATP production and increased nuclear fragility. Cordycepin, an inhibitor of new mRNA processing, prevents the dexamethasone-induced increases in protein labeling. Also, when used alone, cordycepin selectively slows the synthesis of those early proteins that can be induced by dexamethasone, suggesting that the mRNAs coding for the early induced proteins have unusually short half-lives. Short-lived mRNAs for such putative regulatory proteins may allow the cell to respond rapidly to changing needs. Preliminary experiments using giant gel separations of subcellular fractions indicate that two of the induced proteins co-purify with crude plasma and nuclear membrane fractions. None of the induced proteins was detected in gel separations of mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1577785183,"Lysosomes incubated with leucine methyl ester accumulate leucine against a steep concentration gradient. In the presence of 140 mM KCl, the cation exchange ionophore nigericin inhibits lysosomal leucine accumulation by 40-60%; in the presence of 250 mM sucrose, however, the ionophore stimulates leucine accumulation by 30-40%. The effects of nigericin suggest that leucine accumulation is inhibited by the alkalinization of, and is stimulated by the acidification of, the lysosomal interior. Mg.ATP stimulates leucine accumulation by more than 40% and partially protects against the inhibitory effects of nigericin in the presence of 10-40 mM KCl. In 140 KCl, nigericin abolishes the effects of Mg.ATP on leucine accumulation. The stimulatory effect of Mg.ATP is not exerted immediately but requires several minutes for maximal development; conversely, when the cofactor Mg2+ is removed after a period of incubation with Mg.ATP, the stimulating effect of Mg.ATP is not lost immediately but dissipates over a time course of several minutes. Protonophores, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, block the effect of Mg.ATP, although they do not alter the extent of leucine accumulation in the absence of Mg.ATP. The stimulation of leucine accumulation by Mg.ATP appears to be due to intralysosomal acidification. The results thus provide support for the presence of an ATP-dependent proton pump in the lysosomal membrane."

In multiple sclerosis patients that were heterozygous for these determinants, G1m(1) concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was greatly increased-reflected by an increased ratio of G1m(1)-in comparison with that of patients with other neurological disorders. These results suggest that in the heterozygous multiple sclerosis patients, most of the plasma cells in the central nervous system that secrete oligoclonal immunoglobulin G preferentially synthesize G1m(1) IgG1 molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2078520570,"The ability of vertebrate skeletal muscle to contract more vigorously than normal in the presence of potentiating agents depends on the initial length of a muscle cell. Other factors such as the intracellular calcium ion transient, temperature, chemical nature of the potentiating agent, and the ratio of intrinsic twitch to tetanic force influence the degree of contractile potentiation but cannot account for the length dependence. At least part of a muscle cell seems normally less than fully active during contractions not only at short lengths but also at optimal sarcomere lengths."

Fluorescence measurements indicated the presence of two intermediate enzyme-substrate complexes, i.e. at least a three-step mechanism. The disappearance of the characteristic cephem chromophore, which reflects nucleophilic attack at the beta-lactam carbonyl group, correlated with the second step. These results show that an intermediate species with a covalently altered substrate occurs on the reaction path prior to the last step which includes release of product. This intermediate is most likely an acyl-enzyme. The data have been analyzed numerically and the derived rate constants are in accord with the steady state parameters."

The interaction of C1q with heart mitochondrial membranes was shown to be readily saturable, specific for C1q, and reversible upon addition of unlabeled C1q or increasing salt concentrations. Scatchard plots of the binding data were biphasic and yielded association constants on the order of 1 X 10(10) and 1 X 10(9) M-1 and binding capacities of approximately 0.16 and 0.24 nmol of C1q/mg of mitochondrial protein. The binding of C1q to isolated cardiac-derived mitochondrial membranes is implicated in the antibody-independent activation of the classical complement pathway by cellular membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2049081229,"Tsud (ref. 1) is an alloantigen on mouse suppressor T cells, coded for by a gene downstream from the immunoglobulin locus on chromosome 122. We now report a second T-cell alloantigen, Tindd, which is closely linked to Tsud. Both antigens may be products of a family of genes coding for conserved, non-antigen binding site regions of T-cell receptors. Tindd is defined by a monoclonal BALB/c (Igh-1a) anti-C.AL-20 (Igh-1d) antibody and is expressed preferentially on Lyt 1+2−3− peripheral lymphoid cells, whereas Tsud is expressed on Lyt 1−2+3+ suppressor cells. The interpretation that these determinants represent antigen binding molecules is in part based on the antibody-mediated induction of cell function. In vivo treatment of C.AL-20 animals with anti-Tsud antiserum at day 4 suppresses the primary immune response to sheep red blood cells (SRBCs)3–5. Pretreatment with limiting dilutions of anti-Tindd antibody induces cyclic waves of either suppression or enhancement of the plaque-forming cell response. The genes coding for these determinants have now been mapped in inbred congeneic mice having recombination events in or near the immunoglobulin locus. Monoclonal anti-Tindd antibodies precipitate a group of polypeptides of molecular weights (MWs) 62,000, 45,000 and 17,000 from 35S-methionine-labelled spleen cells activated with concanavalin A (Con A) whereas the polypeptides associated with the Tsud specificity have MWs 69,000, 45,000 and 25,000. The differences in molecular weights and contrast in the Lyt phenotype of cells expressing these antigens suggest they are separate molecules and may imply discrete isotypes of T-cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1482315617,"A nonspecific solubilization of the intracytoplasmic membrane proteins from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides has been achieved in the absence of detergents. Following removal of the photopigments and phospholipids by acetone/methanol extractions, the protein is quantitatively solubilized in 6 M guanidine thiocyanate which is subsequently exchanged by dialysis for 7 M urea. A urea-soluble protein fraction is obtained which represents 80% of the initial protein and qualitatively contains all the polypeptides of the membrane resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the exception of the reaction center polypeptides M and L, and the 35.2-kilodalton species. Fractionation of the urea-soluble polypeptides on a Sepharose CL-6B column resolves into separate fractions the two major low molecular weight polypeptides identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Further examination of these fractions by isoelectric focusing and electrophoresis at pH 4.5 in the presence of 8 M urea reveals the presence of three major species each of which has been purified to homogeneity by a combination of ion exchange chromatography and preparative electrophoretic techniques. It is believed that these three major polypeptides are components of the light-harvesting pigment-protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1534070776,"A beta-lactamase was purified to an apparently homogeneous state from Streptomyces cacaoi. The molecular weight calculated from the mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 34,000. pI was 4.7 and the optimal pH was 6.5. The optimum temperature was found to be between 40 degrees C and 45 degrees C, but the enzyme lost activity above 50 degrees C. N-Bromosuccinimide was the strongest inhibitor among the reagents tested, followed by iodine. p-Chloromercuribenzoate showed a weak inhibitory effect. Diisopropylfluorophosphate and sodium chloride did not show any inhibitory effect on the enzyme. The beta-lactamase catalyzed the hydrolysis of methicillin and cloxacillin at two-thirds to one-third the rate of benzylpenicillin. On the other hand, the enzyme hydrolyzed cephalosporins and 7-methoxycephalosporin only slowly. With benzylpenicillin as a substrate, the Km increased sharply with decreasing pH and the pK alpha estimated from the Km versus pH curve was 6.5 to 7.0. In contrast, with cloxacillin as a substrate, the Km showed a minimum at pH 7.5. The Vmax changed with pH in a bell-shaped curve in the case of benzylpenicillin, but the Vmax for cloxacillin changed only within a small range. In addition, the ratio of the hydrolysis rate of benzylpenicillin and cloxacillin at 30 degrees C and 20 degrees C (V30 degrees/V20 degrees) was found to be 1.23 and 1.55, respectively. These results indicate that the S. cacaoi beta-lactamase behaves differently toward benzylpenicillin and cloxacillin, although both are penicillins. S. cacaoi seems to release beta-lactamase into the culture medium soon after its biosynthesis without retaining it in the membrane and the soluble fraction. The possible relationships between beta-lactamases from Streptomyces and those from pathogenic bacteria are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1481200093,"Nitration or acetylation of tyrosine residues of human plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) with tetranitromethane or N-acetylimidazole resulted in a selective loss of its inhibitory activity. While the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-inhibitory activities were unaffected, all of the elastase inhibiting activity was lost. Comparative amino acid analyses of the native inhibitor and the chemically modified derivatives revealed no differences in the amino acid compositions with the exception that in the case of the tetranitromethane-treated material there were losses in the tyrosine content which could be accounted for by the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine. Nitration of alpha 1-PI.trypsin, alpha 1-PI.chymotrypsin, and alpha 1-PI.elastase complexes with excess tetranitromethane indicated that complex formation protected the binding site of the inhibitor for elastase, but not for trypsin or chymotrypsin. Quantitative estimation of the number of nitrotyrosine residues in the alpha 1-PI isolated from the complexes has shown that one tyrosine residue was protected from nitration. Competition studies have also indicated that the elastase inhibitory site is different from that of trypsin or chymotrypsin, although the possibility of overlapping sites could not be disregarded."

Histone 5, found as an additional major histone of avian erythrocytes, is not detected in the frog erythrocytes. Three minor components of the bullfrog erythrocytes, which are not present in the avian erythrocytes, have been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and characterized by amino acid analysis, NH2-terminal analysis, tryptic peptide mapping, and immunological techniques. H1B extracted with 5% HClO4 along with H1A has a very similar amino acid composition and tryptic peptide map to H1o, a subfraction of lysine-rich histones found in nondividing mammalian cells. Microcomplement fixation also shows that H1B and bovine liver H1o share some common antigenic determinants. R1, a basic protein having a ratio of basic/acidic amino acids of 2.0 and 20 mol % lysine, is distinguished from any chromosomal proteins characterized so far on the basis of electrophoretic mobility and amino acid composition. On the other hand, R2 is identified as protein A24 on the basis of its electrophoretic mobility, amino acid composition, and tryptic peptide map. Since H1o and protein A24 are considered to be involved in the inhibition of DNA replication and RNA synthesis, respectively, H1o-like protein and protein A24 in the frog erythrocyte lacking H5 may have central roles in genetic inactivation during erythrocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1574324874,"The characterization of the three major membrane polypeptides indicated to be subunits of the light-harvesting bacteriochlorophyll-protein complexes of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides is described. Molecular weight determinations of the three polypeptides have been performed by sedimentation analysis and electrophoretic mobility and the values obtained were in agreement with each other as well as with those derived from compositional studies. NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid determinations were performed for each of the species; two of the polypeptides produces no reaction with dansyl chloride and were concluded to have blocked amino termini. In each instance, the data were consistent with each of the polypeptides being a single, pure species. Further characterization of the proteins was accomplished by amino acid compositional analysis and peptide mapping of tryptic and chymotryptic digestions of the polypeptides. The number of peptides obtained from the digestions was in agreement with the amino acid compositional data. Two of the polypeptides, 15B and 15C, which possess very similar molecular weights, identical carboxyl termini and apparently blocked amino termini were shown by amino acid analysis and peptide mapping to be structurally discrete species, although related.

These cobalamin-deficient cells exhibited a normal replication time of 12 h, provided that the medium contained excess folate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. The cells responded poorly, however, to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate unless exogenous cobalamin was added. A cobalamin dependency was also observed when low levels of folate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate were used. With 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, optimal stimulation of growth was observed with free and transcobalamin-II-bound cobalamin at 4,000 pM and 2 pM, respectively. Under cobalamin-replete conditions, cells contained 2,000 to 4,000 molecules of cobalamin/cell, and in the deficient state, this value declined to less than 10 molecules/cell; optimal replication on 5-methyltetrahydrofolate required approximately 180 molecules/cell. Cobalamin-deficient cells cultured in the absence of folate reached an arrested state from which limited replication could be induced by the addition of aquacobalamin; normal replication was induced by aquacobalamin plus 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Results of this investigation are interpreted in terms of the requirement for tetrahydrofolate in cell replication and the production of this compound from folate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (via cobalamin-independent pathways) and from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (via the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthetase)."
