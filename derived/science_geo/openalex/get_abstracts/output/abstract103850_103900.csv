https://openalex.org/W1996180957,"Although the mechanism of mammalian apoptosis has not been elucidated, a protease of the CED-3/ICE family is anticipated to be a component of the death machinery. Several lines of evidence predict that this protease cleaves the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to a specific 85 kDa form observed during apoptosis, is inhibitable by the CrmA protein, and is distinct from ICE. We cloned a ced-3/ICE-related gene, designated Yama, that encodes a protein identical to CPP32 beta. Purified Yama was a zymogen that, when activated, cleaved PARP to generate the 85 kDa apoptotic fragment. Cleavage of PARP by Yama was inhibited by CrmA but not by an inactive point mutant of CrmA. Furthermore, CrmA blocked cleavage of PARP in cells undergoing apoptosis. We propose that Yama may represent an effector component of the mammalian cell death pathway and suggest that CrmA blocks apoptosis by inhibiting Yama."
https://openalex.org/W2004078164,"The serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the Akt proto-oncogene is catalytically inactive in serum-starved primary and immortalized fibroblasts. Here we show that Akt and the Akt-related kinase AKT2 are activated by PDGF. The activation was rapid and specific, and it was abrogated by mutations in the Akt Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The Akt activation was also shown to depend on PDGFR beta tyrosines Y740 and Y751, which bind phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) upon phosphorylation. Moreover, Akt activation was blocked by the PI 3-kinase-specific inhibitor wortmannin and the dominant inhibitory N17Ras. Conversely, Akt activity was induced following the addition of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate to Akt immunoprecipitates from serum-starved cells in vitro. These results identify Akt as a novel target of PI 3-kinase and suggest that the Akt PH domain may be a mediator of PI 3-kinase signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2062899906,"It is not known whether the variability of neural activity in the cerebral cortex carries information or reflects noisy underlying mechanisms. In an examination of the reliability of spike generation using recordings from neurons in rat neocortical slices, the precision of spike timing was found to depend on stimulus transients. Constant stimuli led to imprecise spike trains, whereas stimuli with fluctuations resembling synaptic activity produced spike trains with timing reproducible to less than 1 millisecond. These data suggest a low intrinsic noise level in spike generation, which could allow cortical neurons to accurately transform synaptic input into spike sequences, supporting a possible role for spike timing in the processing of cortical information by the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W1976621716,"Nuclear hormone receptors comprise a superfamily of ligand-modulated transcription factors that mediate the transcriptional activities of steroids, retinoids, and thyroid hormones. A growing number of related proteins have been identified that possess the structural features of hormone receptors, but that lack known ligands. Known as orphan receptors, these proteins represent targets for novel signaling molecules. We have isolated a mammalian orphan receptor that forms a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor. A screen of candidate ligands identified farnesol and related metabolites as effective activators of this complex. Farnesol metabolites are generated intracellularly and are required for the synthesis of cholesterol, bile acids, steroids, retinoids, and farnesylated proteins. Intermediary metabolites have been recognized as transcriptional regulators in bacteria and yeast. Our results now suggest that metabolite-controlled intracellular signaling systems are utilized by higher organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2082776443,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway is thought to play an important role in the actions of neurotrophins. A small molecule inhibitor of the upstream kinase activator of MAP kinase, MAP kinase kinase (MEK) was examined for its effect on the cellular action of nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. PD98059 selectively blocks the activity of MEK, inhibiting both the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases in vitro. Pretreatment of PC-12 cells with the compound completely blocked the 4-fold increase in MAP kinase activity produced by NGF. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 2 μM PD98059, with maximal effects at 10-100 μM. The tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated MAP kinase was also completely blocked by the compound. In contrast, the compound was without effect on NGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the pp140trk receptor or its substrate Shc and did not block NGF-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. However, PD98059completely blocked NGF-induced neurite formation in these cells without altering cell viability. These data indicate that the MAP kinase pathway is absolutely required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in PC-12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079721061,"In mice lacking the interleukin-2 receptor beta chain (IL-2R beta), T cells were shown to be spontaneously activated, resulting in exhaustive differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and the appearance of high serum concentrations of immunoglobulins G1 and E as well as autoantibodies that cause hemolytic anemia. Marked infiltrative granulocytopoiesis was also apparent, and the animals died after about 12 weeks. Depletion of CD4+ T cells in mutant mice rescued B cells without reversion of granulocyte abnormalities. T cells did not proliferate in response to polyclonal activators, nor could antigen-specific immune responses be elicited. Thus, IL-2R beta is required to keep the activation programs of T cells under control, to maintain homeostasis, and to prevent autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2030410903,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neuropsychiatric disease associated with CAG repeat expansion within a widely expressed gene that causes selective neuronal death. To understand its normal function, we have created a targeted disruption in exon 5 of Hdh (Hdhex5), the murine homolog of the HD gene. Homozygotes die before embryonic day 8.5, initiate gastrulation, but do not proceed to the formation of somites or to organogenesis. Mice heterozygous for the Hdhex5 mutation display increased motor activity and cognitive deficits. Neuropathological assessment of two heterozygous mice shows significant neuronal loss in the subthalamic nucleus. These studies show that the HD gene is essential for postimplantation development and that it may play an important role in normal functioning of the basal ganglia."

https://openalex.org/W1971987125,"Despite the importance of blood platelets in health and disease, the mechanisms regulating their formation within megakaryocytes are unknown. We generated mice lacking the hematopoietic subunit (p45) of the heterodimeric erythroid transcription factor NF-E2. Unexpectedly, NF-E2-/- mice lack circulating platelets and die of hemorrhage; their megakaryocytes show no cytoplasmic platelet formation. Though platelets are absent, serum levels of the growth factor thrombopoietin/MGDF are not elevated above controls. Nonetheless, NF-E2-/- megakaryocytes proliferate in vivo in response to thrombopoietin administration. Thus, as an essential factor for megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production, NF-E2 must regulate critical target genes independent of the action of thrombopoietin. These findings provide insight into the genetic analysis of megakaryocyte maturation and thrombopoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W2042544913,"A molecule isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived cats has been chemically characterized and identified as cis-9,10-octadecenoamide. Other fatty acid primary amides in addition to cis-9,10-octadecenoamide were identified as natural constituents of the cerebrospinal fluid of cat, rat, and human, indicating that these compounds compose a distinct family of brain lipids. Synthetic cis-9,10-octadecenoamide induced physiological sleep when injected into rats. Together, these results suggest that fatty acid primary amides may represent a previously unrecognized class of biological signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2007535582,"The vertebrate hedgehog-related gene Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in ventral domains along the entire rostrocaudal length of the neural tube, including the forebrain. We show here that SHH induces the differentiation of ventral neuronal cell types in explants derived from prospective forebrain regions of the neural plate. Neurons induced in explants derived from both diencephalic and telencephalic levels of the neural plate express the LIM homeodomain protein Isl-1, and these neurons possess distinct identities that match those of the ventral neurons generated in these two subdivisions of the forebrain in vivo. A single inducing molecule, SHH, therefore appears to mediate the induction of distinct ventral neuronal cell types along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the embryonic central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2087022458,"Progesterone is shown here to be produced from pregnenolone by Schwann cells in peripheral nerves. After cryolesion of the sciatic nerve in male mice, axons regenerate and become myelinated. Blocking either the local synthesis or the receptor-mediated action of progesterone impaired remyelination. Administration of progesterone or its precursor, pregnenolone, to the lesion site increased the extent of myelin sheath formation. Myelination of axons was also increased when progesterone was added to cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. These observations indicate a role for locally produced progesterone in myelination, demonstrate that progesterone is not simply a sex steroid, and suggest a new therapeutic approach to promote myelin repair."
https://openalex.org/W2037122000,"The solution structure of the specific complex between the high mobility group (HMG) domain of SRY (hSRY-HMG), the protein encoded by the human testis-determining gene, and its DNA target site in the promoter of the müllerian inhibitory substance gene has been determined by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. hSRY-HMG has a twisted L shape that presents a concave surface (made up of three helices and the N- and C-terminal strands) to the DNA for sequence-specific recognition. Binding of hSRY-HMG to its specific target site occurs exclusively in the minor groove and induces a large conformational change in the DNA. The DNA in the complex has an overall 70 degrees-80 degrees bend and is helically unwound relative to classical A- and B-DNA. The structure of the complex reveals the origin of sequence-specific binding within the HMG-1/HMG-2 family and provides a framework for understanding the effects of point mutations that cause 46X,Y sex reversal at the atomic level."
https://openalex.org/W2020386376,"Kidney bean purple acid phosphatase (KBPAP) is an Fe(III)-Zn(II) metalloenzyme resembling the mammalian Fe(III)-Fe(II) purple acid phosphatases. The structure of the homodimeric 111-kilodalton KBPAP was determined at a resolution of 2.9 angstroms. The enzyme contains two domains in each subunit. The active site is located in the carboxyl-terminal domain at the carboxy end of two sandwiched beta alpha beta alpha beta motifs. The two metal ions are 3.1 angstroms apart and bridged monodentately by Asp164. The iron is further coordinated by Tyr167, His325, and Asp135, and the zinc by His286, His323, and Asn201. The active-site structure is consistent with previous proposals regarding the mechanism of phosphate ester hydrolysis involving nucleophilic attack on the phosphate group by an Fe(III)-coordinated hydroxide ion."
https://openalex.org/W2087562877,"The production of neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in rat skeletal muscle was found to depend on muscle activity. The amounts of NT-4 messenger RNA present decreased after blockade of neuromuscular transmission with alpha-bungarotoxin and increased during postnatal development and after electrical stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. NT-4 immunoreactivity was detected in slow, type I muscle fibers. Intramuscular administration of NT-4 induced sprouting of intact adult motor nerves. Thus, muscle-derived NT-4 acted as an activity-dependent neurotrophic signal for growth and remodeling of adult motor neuron innervation. NT-4 may thus be partly responsible for the effects of exercise and electrical stimulation on neuromuscular performance."

https://openalex.org/W2059208699,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds replicators in the yeast S. cerevisiae in a manner consistent with it being an initiator protein for DNA replication. Two-dimensional (2D) gel techniques were used to examine directly initiation of chromosomal DNA replication in temperature-sensitive orc mutants. Unlike in wild-type cells, in orc2-1 and orc5-1 mutant cells, only a subset of replicators formed active origins of DNA replication at the permissive temperature. At the restrictive temperature, the number of active replicators was diminished further. Using a genetic screen, CDC6 was identified as a multicopy suppressor of orc5-1. 2D gel and biochemical analyses demonstrated that Cdc6p interacted functionally and physically with ORC. We suggest that ORC and Cdc6p form a prereplication complex at individual replicators and therefore cooperate to determine the frequency of initiation of DNA replication in the genome."

However, methods are required that can efficiently transform the limited signals from such probes into high-resolution images. An algorithm has now been developed that produces highly accurate images of fluorescent probe distribution inside cells with minimal light exposure and a conventional light microscope. This method provides resolution nearly four times greater than that currently available from any fluorescence microscope and was used to study several biological problems."
https://openalex.org/W1994012787,"Phylogenetic hypotheses provide a context for examining the evolution of heterotrophic lifestyles. The lichen lifestyle, which is the symbiotic association of fungi with algae, is found in various representatives of Dicaryomycotina, both Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. A highly resolved parsimony analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequences suggests at least five independent origins of the lichen habit in disparate groups of Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Because lichen associations arose from parasitic, mycorrhizal, or free-living saprobic fungi, neither mutualism nor parasitism should be construed as endpoints in symbiont evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2014407412,"A classical model for studying the effects of extracellular matrix is to culture cells inside a three-dimensional collagen gel. When surrounded by fibrillar collagen, many cell types decrease the production of type I collagen, and the expression of interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1; MMP-1) is simultaneously induced. To study the role of the collagen-binding integrins α1β1 and α2β1 in this process, we used three different osteogenic cell lines with distinct patterns of putative collagen receptors: HOS cells, which express only α1β1 integrin, MG-63 cells, which express only α2β1 integrin, and KHOS-240 cells, which express both. Inside collagen gels, α1(I) collagen mRNA levels were decreased in HOS and KHOS-240 cells but not in MG-63 cells. In contrast, MMP-1 expression was induced in KHOS-240 and MG-63 cells but not in HOS cells. Transfection of MG-63 cells with α2 integrin cDNA produced cell clones overexpressing α2β1 integrin. Transfection of MG-63 cells with α2 integrin cDNA in an antisense orientation reduced the expression level of α2 integrin. These cell clones showed induction and reduction of mRNA levels for MMP-1, respectively. HOS cells normally lacking α2β1 integrin were forced to express it, and this prevented the down-regulation in the levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA when cells were grown inside collagen gels. The data indicate that the level of MMP-1 expression is regulated by the collagen receptor α2β1 integrin. The down-regulation of collagen α1(I) is mediated by another receptor.

Integrin α2β1 may compete with it and thus be a positive regulator of collagen synthesis. The integrins are a large family of transmembrane proteins, which form heterodimers and mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions (Hynes, 1992Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). Three integrins, α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1, have been proposed to be responsible for anchoring cells to collagenous matrices. The role of α1β1 and α2β1 integrins as the major cellular collagen receptors has been well documented, whereas in many cell lines α3β1 integrin is not a collagen receptor. Integrin subunits α1 and α2 contain an I-domain of about 190 amino acids, which is thought to be essential for binding to collagen (Kern et al., 1994Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Denatured collagen can be recognized by cells via RGD-binding integrins, whereas collagen binding by α1β1 and α2β1 integrins require a native conformation (Gullberg et al., 1992Gullberg D.

Given the fact that the role of integrins as signaling receptors has been established, α1β1 and α2β1 integrin heterodimers are the major candidates to mediate the well known cellular responses to extracellular collagen, i.e. decreased collagen gene expression and induction of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)1( 1The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseHOShuman osteogenic sarcoma cellsTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinasesPBSphosphate-buffered saline.) production (Grinnell, 1994Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Cells surrounded by matrix are also able to reorganize collagen fibrils, which is seen as the contraction of matrix (Grinnell, 1994Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar and references therein). Fibroblasts cultured inside floating or anchored three-dimensional collagen matrices are supposed to mimic dermis or scars and granulation tissue, respectively (Grinnell, 1994Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The regulation of MMPs by matrix receptors may also have great importance for cancer cell invasiveness. The role of α2β1 integrin in the reorganization of collagenous matrix is well documented (Shiro et al., 1991; Klein et al., 1991aKlein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T.

Cells were collected by centrifugation, exposed to a saturating concentration of monoclonal antibody against α2 integrin (12F1) (Pischel et al., 1987Pischel K.D. Hemler M.E. Huang C. Bluetein H.G.

Cells were washed twice with PBS containing NaN3 and suspended in the same buffer. To measure the amount of α2 integrin on the cell surfaces, the fluorescent excitation spectra were analyzed by using a FACScan apparatus (Becton Dickinson). Control samples were prepared by treating the cells without primary antibodies.

Integrin α1β1 is not usually detectable, although its expression can be induced, e.g. with cytokines (Santala and Heino, 1991Santala P. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23505-23509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HOS cells express both α1β1 and α3β1 integrins, whereas α2β1 integrin expression is below the detection level (Santala et al., 1994Santala P. Larjava H. Nissinen L. Riikonen T. Määttä A. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also used a third cell line KHOS-240, a Kirsten sarcoma virus transformed variant of HOS, which has all three putative integrin-type collagen receptors (Santala et al., 1994Santala P. Larjava H. Nissinen L. Riikonen T. Määttä A. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cultured inside collagenous matrices, only KHOS-240 cells showed fibroblast-like alterations in the expression of MMP-1 and collagen α1(I) (induction of MMP-1 and a 90% decrease in collagen α1(I) mRNA levels; Fig. 1). This observation is in accordance with the fact that fibroblasts and KHOS-240 cells have a similar pattern of integrin-type collagen receptors. Inside collagen gels, HOS cells showed markedly decreased mRNA levels (80%) for collagen α1(I), whereas no MMP-1 mRNA wes detected (Fig. 1). In MG-63 cells, there were no alterations in the mRNA levels of α1(I) collagen. MG-63 cells cultured in monolayer already expressed some MMP-1, and its expression was increased when the cells were grown in collagen gels (2-8-fold range in three measurements; Fig. 2 and 3). Thus, in these three cell lines, collagen α1(I) expression was down-regulated only when α1β1 integrin was present, and the induction of MMP-1 expression was seen only when α2β1 integrin was present.Fig. 2Northern blot analysis of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and TIMP-1 expression in MG-63 wild type (wt) and α2 integrin cDNA-transfected cells (sa2). MG-63 cells were transfected with sense-oriented α2 integrin cDNA in the pAWneo2 expression vector. A, the cells were grown in monolayer or inside collagen gels before isolating total RNA. 20 or 30 μg of cellular RNA was separated in 1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for MMP-1, TIMP-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). B, autoradiograms were quantified with Microcomputer Imaging Device, and the values were corrected for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To get direct evidence about the role of α2β1 integrin in the regulation of MMP-1 expression, we specifically up- or down-regulated α2 integrin levels in MG-63 cells. We created a permanent MG-63 cell clone constantly overexpressing α2 integrin by transfecting cells with a cDNA construct containing the entire coding sequence of α2 integrin (Riikonen et al., 1995Riikonen T. Koivisto L. Vihinen P. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this cell clone, the cell surface level of α2 integrin was 5-fold higher than in wild type cells when measured by flow cytometry (not shown). Recent studies have shown that integrins might be sensitive to down-regulation by antisense strategies (Lallier and Bonner-Fraser, 1993Lallier T. Bonner-Fraser M. Science. 1993; 259: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Instead of using oligonucleotides, we constructed a plasmid containing the α2 integrin cDNA in antisense orientation. This construct gave a continuous expression of an approximately 4.5-kilobase antisense mRNA in two MG-63 cell clones. In these clones, the expression level of α2 integrin protein was decreased (to 10% of control; not shown) as were the corresponding mRNA levels (about 50% of control; Fig. 3). Interestingly, in these two clones the ratio of antisense mRNA/α2 integrin mRNA were different (1 and 6), suggesting that they had different copy numbers of the antisense cDNA. The α2 integrin mRNA level, however, seemed to be the same even if the amount of antisense mRNA increased (Fig. 3). The levels of α2 integrin mRNA were strongly (6-fold) up-regulated when the cells were inside collagen gels (Fig. 3). Similar phenomena have been previously described with melanoma cells and fibroblasts (Klein et al., 1991aKlein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In antisense transfected cell clones grown in collagen gels, α2 integrin mRNA levels were also elevated, although they remained at a lower level than in control cells (35-50% of controls). Simultaneously with the increase in α2 integrin mRNA levels, the amount of antisense mRNA decreased (Fig. 3). In the MG-63 cell clone overexpressing α2 integrin MMP-1, mRNA levels were 9-fold higher than in wild type cells when the cells were cultured in monolayer (Fig. 2). Inside collagen gels, the difference was 6-fold (Fig. 2). In both antisense transfected cell clones, the basal level of MMP-1 was lower than in control cells (5-50% of control; Fig. 3). MMP-1 mRNA levels were elevated in antisense clone cells inside collagen gels, which is in accordance with the fact that the antisense construct could not entirely block the induction of α2 integrin by collagen. The data indicate that in MG-63 cells, elevated expression of α2 integrin enhances the expression of MMP-1, and diminished expression of α2 integrin leads to its down-regulation. In a second set of experiments, α2 integrin was overexpressed in HOS cells. The expression of α2 integrin on the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometric measurements (not shown). Inside collagen gels, the level of the 4.5-kilobase plasmid-derived α2 mRNA was surprisingly elevated (Fig. 4), suggesting that the increased α2 integrin mRNA levels are partially due to increased stability of the mRNA. In HOS cells overexpressing α2 integrin, MMP-1 was detected in only two out of five experiments (not shown), suggesting that in HOS cells MMP-1 expression is also regulated by another factor more strongly than by α2 integrin. Many cell types produce, concomitantly with MMP-1, its specific inhibitor, TIMP-1 (see Birkedahl-Hansen et al., 1993Birkedahl-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedahl-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In α2 integrin overexpressing MG-63 cells, TIMP-1 mRNA levels were decreased (Fig. 2). This suggests that α2 integrin elicited up-regulation of MMP-1 expression may result in increased pericellular collagenase activity. In α2β1 integrin positive wild type MG-63 cells, collagen α1(I) mRNA levels were not down-regulated, indicating that α2β1 integrin is probably not the receptor mediating suppression of collagen synthesis by collagenous matrix. The data suggest that the unidentified receptor responsible for this phenomenon may not be expressed in MG-63 cells, making α1β1 integrin one of the candidate molecules. Therefore, it was not surprising that in MG-63 cells up-regulation or down-regulation of α2 integrin did not result in any dramatic changes in collagen mRNA levels (Fig. 2). In both antisense and sense transfected cell clones, there was some increase in the basal level of collagen synthesis that was considered to be nonspecific. In contrast to MG-63 cells, HOS cells responded to collagenous matrix by diminished collagen synthesis (Fig. 1). In HOS cells overexpressing α2 integrin, the levels of collagen α1(I) mRNA elevated in response to collagen matrix (Fig. 4). This elevation was seen in all experiments, but was not always as prominent as in Fig. 4. Two integrin-type collagen receptors, α1β1 and α2β1 heterodimers, mediate the interaction of cells with collagenous matrices. To investigate the role of α2β1 integrin in the regulation of MMP-1 and collagen α1(I) expression, we used cDNA transfections to specifically up- and down-regulate its expression at the cell surface. The use of anti-integrin antibodies would have given indirect evidence about the role of integrins. That approach, however, would have been controversial because anti-integrin antibodies might either block integrin function or simulate ligand binding and activate signal transduction. Furthermore, anti-integrin α chain antibodies alone are usually ineffective and can only be used to potentiate the effect of anti-β1 antibodies (Klein et al., 1991aKlein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T.

Previous studies with migrating keratinocytes (Saarialho-Kere et al., 1993Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J.E. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin.

U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8856-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have shown the regulation of MMP-1 after cell-collagen interactions. Here, we show that the amount of α2β1 integrin at the cell surface regulates the expression level of MMP-1 in response to collagen. Under different physiological conditions, the level of α2β1 integrin expression is not constant but can be up-regulated by growth factors and malignant transformation (Heino and Massagué, 1989Heino J. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21806-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Dedhar and Saulnier, 1990Dedhar S. Saulnier R. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In melanoma cells, the α2 integrin subunit was originally described as the melanoma progression antigen (Klein et al., 1991bKlein C.E. Steinmayer T. Kaufmann D. Weber L. Brocker E.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); also, the ability to contract collagen gels (an α2β1 integrin-related function) separates aggressive melanoma clones from less invasive clones (Klein et al., 1991aKlein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In osteogenic HOS cells, transformation with either a chemical mutagen, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, or Kirsten murine sarcoma virus induces α2 integrin expression (Santala et al., 1994Santala P. Larjava H. Nissinen L. Riikonen T. Määttä A. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rhabdomyosarcoma cells, the forced expression of α2 integrin leads to an invasive cell phenotype (Chan et al., 1991Chan B.M.C. Matsuura N. Takada Y. Zetter B.R. Hemler M. Science. 1991; 251: 1600-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The observation that α2β1 integrin-related signals regulate the expression of MMP-1 reveals a putative invasion mechanism and explains why α2β1 integrin seems to be important for cancer cells. Furthermore, this observation provides the basis for new specific strategies to prevent invasion by malignant tumors. Previous studies have shown that treatment of fibroblasts with RGD peptides, anti-α5β1 integrin antibodies, and fibronectin fragments induces the expression of MMPs (Werb et al., 1989Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Howley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Transformation can, however, down-regulate the expression of α5β1 integrin (Plantefaber and Hynes, 1989Plantefaber L.C. Hynes R. Cell. 1989; 56: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) or inhibit its activity (Akiyama et al., 1990Akiyama S.K. Larjava H. Yamada K.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1601-1607PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, α5β1 integrin is probably not involved in the regulation of MMP-1 expression in transformed cells. Moreover, the forced overexpression of α5β1 integrin prevents the malignant behavior of Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting that α5β1 integrin might function as a tumor suppressor (Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1990Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In addition to MMP-1, other genes are regulated by signals generated by integrin-type collagen receptors. Our data suggest that α2 integrin itself is positively regulated by collagenous matrix, whereas collagen α1(I) is down-regulated in cells surrounded by collagen. The suppression in collagen gene expression was seen in α1β1 positive-α2β1 negative HOS cells, suggesting that α1β1 integrin rather than α2β1 integrin mediates the signals required. In HOS cells the overexpression of α2β1 heterodimer not only prevented the down-regulation of collagen α1(I) mRNA levels but even elevated them. The molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is not clear. Previous studies have suggested that the regulation of collagen synthesis in cells inside collagenous matrices is a complex phenomenon involving both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (Eckes et al., 1993Eckes B. Mauch C. Huppe G. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 128-133Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Due to the fact that in α1β1 negative-α2β1 positive MG-63 cells, the altered expression of α2β1 integrin did not have any significant effect on collagen gene expression, we suggest that α2β1 integrin is a positive regulator of collagen synthesis by competing with a “negative regulator” collagen receptor, possibly α1β1 integrin. Inhibition of the down-regulation of collagen synthesis by overexpression of α2 integrin suggests that the accumulation of collagen in tissues can also be regulated by the expression pattern of different collagen receptors. In a progressive fibrotic skin disorder (scleroderma), there are alterations in the expression of integrin-type collagen receptors (Ivarsson et al., 1993Ivarsson M. McWhirter A. Black C.M. Rubin K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 216-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that in scleroderma cells the ratio of α1β1 integrin/α2β1 integrin is decreased and that these cells show reduced response to collagenous matrix (Ivarsson et al., 1993Ivarsson M. McWhirter A. Black C.M. Rubin K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 216-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is in full accordance with our observations. Signal transduction via integrins has been associated with protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Schaller and Parsons, 1994Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A specific focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) is claimed to be directly linked to integrins, and it is a strong candidate to be one of the first components in the cascade (Schaller and Parsons, 1994Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the regulation of MMP-1 by cell-collagen interactions can be prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinases (Sudbeck et al., 1994Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that different collagen receptors might generate distinct signals, having opposite effects on cell behavior (Fig. 5). It is an important challenge for future research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms giving rise to the specificity of signals generated by different matrix receptors. We thank Drs. M. Hemler, A.

The 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) of Saccharopolyspora erythraea, which synthesizes the aglycone core of the antibiotic erythromycin A, has been modified by repositioning of a chain-terminating cyclase domain to the carboxyl-terminus of DEBS1, the multienzyme that catalyzes the first two rounds of polyketide chain extension. The resulting mutant markedly accelerates formation of the predicted triketide lactone, compared to a control in which the repositioned domain is inactive. Repositioning of the cyclase should be generally useful for redirecting polyketide synthesis to obtain polyketides of specified chain lengths."

Previous studies have indicated that Drosophila dpp uses similar signaling complexes and strictly requires the punt and thick veins receptors to transduce the signal across the membrane. Here, we show that the schnurri (shn) gene is required for many aspects of dpp signaling. Genetic epistasis experiments indicate that shn functions downstream of the dpp signal and its receptors.

We have now observed that another nuclease activity, UV endonuclease III, is similarly not detected in XP-D cells and is inseparable from the AP endonuclease I activity.

UV radiation is probably the most extensively used model system for investigating the biological consequences of DNA damage. When DNA is exposed to radiation at wavelengths near its absorption maximum of 260 nm, a large number of damages are formed, the most prevalent being cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (Loeber and Kittler, 1977Loeber G. Kittler L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1977; 25: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These dimers are chemically stable and are corrected either by nucleotide excision repair or in some cell types by enzymatic photo reversal (Boyce and Howard-Flanders, 1964Boyce R.P.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)1( 1The abbreviations used are: XPxeroderma pigmentosumPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyrpS3ribosomal protein S3.) is a rare, autosomal recessive disease that is clinically characterized by hypersensitivity to ultraviolet radiation and a large increase in the frequency of sunlight-induced skin carcinomas or malignant melanomas (Kraemer et al., 1984Kraemer K.H.

This abnormality apparently manifests itself through a higher than normal ability of XP-D cells to host cell-reactivated depurinated SV40 DNA (Kudrna et al., 1979Kudrna R.D. Smith J. Linn S. Penhoet E.E. Mutat. Res. 1979; 62: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). (As expected, on the other hand, in the same study, XP-D cells displayed inefficient host cell reactivation of UV-irradiated SV40 DNA.) The abnormality of the AP endonuclease activity in XP-D cells is peculiar, however, since XP-D cells are known to carry mutations in the gene for a DNA helicase activity (Weber et al., 1990Weber C.A. Salazar E.P. Stewart S.A. Thompson L.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We now report that this AP endonuclease activity is inseparable from activities acting upon UV-irradiated DNA, one of which cleaves a phosphodiester bond within a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer. Moreover, these activities are apparently associated with ribosomal protein S3, a protein located on the external surface of the 40 S ribosomal subunit, which assembles onto preribosomal particles in the nucleus (Hadjiolov, 1985Hadjiolov A.A.

The T4 endonuclease (Ser) construct was originally obtained from Drs. J. K. de Riel and K. Valerie (VA Commonwealth University). It has a W128S substitution due to substitution of an AGT for a TGG codon, a substitution that also generates a unique SpeI site in the ptac-denV plasmid construct. MPC-11 cells were split 1:2 daily in suspension medium containing 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 0.02 M Hepes (pH 7.2), and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol. F-65 diploid human fibroblasts were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C in 150-cm2 flasks. XP fibroblasts were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. GM 3714 normal lymphoblasts and GM 2485A XP-D lymphoblasts were grown in RPMI 1640 medium using roller bottles in the dark. Depurination of PM2 DNA was carried out at 70°C in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5), 100 mM NaCl for 10 min so as to generate 1.5 AP sites per DNA duplex. PM2 DNA was UV-irradiated in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.02% glycerol at 2.5 J/m2/s for the times indicated with a Westinghouse germicidal lamp (G15T8). As a comparison, a total dose of 525 J/m2 produces approximately 2 sites sensitive to E. coli endonuclease III per PM2 DNA duplex (Demple and Linn, 1982Demple B. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas 23 J/m2 produces roughly 2 cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers per molecule (Snapka and Linn, 1981Snapka R.M. Linn S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A filter-binding assay with nitrocellulose filters and covalently closed, circular (form I) PM2 DNA was used to monitor endonuclease activity. Standard reaction mixtures (100 μl) for UV endonuclease activity contained 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 70 mM KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 3 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μM (nucleotide residues) UV-irradiated PM2 [3H]DNA. AP endonuclease assays were similar except that depurinated PM2 [3H]DNA was substrate. Reactions were incubated for the indicated times at 37°C and then terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.3 M K2HPO4 (pH 12.4), which partially denatures the PM2 DNA. To detect total DNA by total denaturation, 100 μl of 0.3 M K2HPO4 (pH 13.2) was added. A sample of the reaction mixture was also spotted directly onto the filter for determining the total amount of DNA present. After 5 min, the samples were neutralized with 50 μl of 1 M KH2PO4 (pH 4.0), and then 100 μl of 5 M NaCl was added. This treatment results in the renaturation only of form I DNA. Each sample was finally diluted to 3 ml with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 1 M NaCl and filtered through a Schleicher and Schuell nitrocellulose filter to selectively retain the denatured DNA. The filters had been previously equilibrated with the same buffer. After being washed with 5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 1 M NaCl and then with 5 ml of 0.3 M NaCl, 0.02 M sodium citrate, the filters were dried and counted by liquid scintillation. The average number of nicks introduced per PM2 genome was calculated from the percentage of total PM2 [3H]DNA bound to each filter assuming a Poisson distribution of endonucleolytic sites (Kuhnlein et al., 1976Kuhnlein U. Penhoet E.E. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 1 unit of rpS3 endonuclease activity specifically introduces 1 fmol of nicks into depurinated or heavily UV-irradiated DNA per min at 37°C. 1 unit of T4 UV endonuclease produces 1 fmol of alkali-labile sites in DNA containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers as measured in Table IV.Table IVEffect of alkali and T4 UV endonuclease (Ser) on cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers exposed to UV endonuclease III 96 liters of culture (1.1 × 1011 cells) in logarithmic growth were harvested and resuspended in a final volume of 200 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.7 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5.0% sucrose, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and then the suspension was immediately sonicated five times for 15 s with a Branson sonifier and a large probe. After adjustment to a final concentration of 0.3 M KCl with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, the extract was further sonicated four times for 15 s, then gently stirred for 2 h at 0°C and centrifuged twice at 12,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded onto a DE-52 DEAE-cellulose column (5 × 16 cm), which had been equilibrated with 0.4 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol to remove nucleic acids, and then the column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 100 ml/h. Flow-through fractions (400 ml), which had significant UV absorbance at 280 nm, were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). The dialysate was loaded onto a 1.2-liter phosphocellulose column, which was equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 50 ml/h. It was washed with the same buffer, and flow-through fractions, which contain UV endonuclease III, were collected. UV endonucleases I and II were eluted from this column with a 4-liter linear gradient from 0 to 1.2 M KCl in buffer A (see Kim and Linn, 1989Kim J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 96 liters of culture (1.1 × 1011 cells) in logarithmic growth were harvested 8 liters at a time, washed once with PBS,1 frozen as a pellet in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C for up to 30 days. The total collection of cells was thawed and resuspended in a final volume of 200 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.7 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5.0% sucrose, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and then the suspension was immediately sonicated five times for 15 s with a Branson sonifier and a large probe. After adjustment to a final concentration of 0.3 M KCl with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer B), the extract was further sonicated four times for 15 s, then gently stirred for 2 h at 0°C and centrifuged twice at 12,000 rpm for 20 min with a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (5 × 16 cm), which had been equilibrated with 0.4 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol to remove nucleic acids, and then the column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 100 ml/h. Flow-through fractions, which had significant UV absorbance at 280 nm, were dialyzed against buffer B and loaded at a flow rate of 50 ml/h onto a 1.2-liter phosphocellulose column, which was equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with the same buffer, and fractions that contained UV endonuclease III were collected (UV endonucleases I and II could be also eluted from this column with a 4-liter linear gradient from 0 to 1.2 M KCl in buffer B (see Fig. 1)). The phosphocellulose fraction was loaded onto a 400-ml second DEAE-cellulose column, which had been equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with buffer B and then eluted with a 1.2-liter linear gradient from 5 to 200 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.1) in 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Enzyme eluted at 90 mM potassium phosphate, and active fractions were pooled. To the dialysate (164 ml) was added 26.8 g of ammonium sulfate with constant stirring on ice; then, after 10 min, it was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g at 4°C. To the supernatant was added 40 g of ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected as above and dissolved in buffer B to a final volume of 8 ml. The above material was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 column (140 ml, bed volume), which had been equilibrated with 25 mM potassium phosphate, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Activity separated into 2 peaks, which eluted after 64 and 106 ml. The second peak was dialyzed against 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.1), 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer C). It was subsequently found that all of the activity elutes in the position of the second peak if 0.7 M ammonium sulfate is included in the elution buffer. A 0.5-ml hydroxyapatite column was equilibrated with buffer C, and the dialysate was applied to the column; then, the column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient from 5 to 300 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.1) in buffer C and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. UV endonuclease III activity eluted at 70 mM potassium phosphate, and active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C. Log phase normal F65 fibroblast cells (40 T-150 flasks) or XP-D fibroblast cells (15 T-150 flasks) were harvested by scraping, rinsed with PBS, resuspended, sonicated, and centrifuged as described for the purification of the murine enzymes (Kim and Linn, 1989Kim J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected and loaded onto a 4-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 0.4 M NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.005% Triton X-100 to remove nucleic acids. Flow-through fractions (39 ml for normal and 15 ml for XP-D cells) from the DEAE-cellulose column, which had significant UV absorbance at 280 nm, were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% Triton X-100 (buffer B) and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (15 ml for normal and 8 ml for XP-D cells), which had been equilibrated with buffer B and then washed with the same buffer. UV endonuclease III activity flowed through the column. A steep gradient from 0 to 1.2 M KCl in buffer B was applied to elute UV endonucleases I plus II for comparison. GM 3714 normal lymphoblast cells (5.6 liters of culture, 6.7 × 109 cells), GM 2485A XP-D lymphoblast cells (5.6 liters, 3.7 × 109 cells), or MPC-11 cells (4.8 liters, 3.7 × 109 cells) were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and then resuspended in 5 volumes of TE sucrose buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1.0 mM EDTA, and 0.25 M sucrose). The cells were lysed by homogenization in a Waring blender three times for 10 s at maximum power, and then the blender was rinsed with an additional 5 ml of TE sucrose buffer. Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation (Anderson and Friedberg, 1980Anderson C.T. Friedberg E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 875-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and then the supernatant was collected by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 12,500 rpm for 30 min to remove mitochondria and finally dialyzed against 40 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM KCl, 0.05% Triton, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Dialysates containing about 10 mg of protein from normal and XP-D lymphoblast cells were each loaded onto 5-ml phosphocellulose columns, which were equilibrated with 40 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM KCl, 0.05% Triton, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Flow-through fractions were collected, and, as a reference, UV endonucleases I and II were eluted from the columns with a buffer containing 1.2 M KCl, 40 mM Tris (8.0), 10 mM KCl, 0.05% Triton, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Reactions for incision (100 μl) contained 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 70 mM KCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 μM depurinated PM2 [3H]DNA, and endonucleases as indicated. Incubation was at 37°C, and the reactions were stopped by heating for 5 min at 70°C. Duplicate aliquots of 10 μl were removed to determine the extent of endonuclease incision. Reactions for DNA synthesis (200 μl) contained 70 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 9 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 7 mM MgCl2, 90 μM each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, 85 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP (500 cpm/pmol), 2.6 nmol of the incised PM2 [3H]DNA, and E. coli DNA polymerase I. Incubation was at 37°C, and aliquots of 50 μl were removed at 10-min intervals, chilled on ice, and then mixed with 200 μl of 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate and 50 μl of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin prior to precipitation with 0.7 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were filtered onto Whatman GF/C filters, washed with 50 ml of 1 N HCl, 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate and then dried with 5 ml of 95% ethanol. Radioactivity retained on the filter was measured by double isotope counting using liquid scintillation with Betamax (West Chem) fluor. [32P,uracil-3H]Poly(dA-dT) was prepared, and uracil DNA glycosylase was assayed as previously described (Kim and Linn, 1988Kim J. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 1 unit of the glycosylase releases 1 pmol of uracil per min from phage PBS2 DNA at 37°C. AP endonuclease activity was measured as described above; 1 unit of activity produces 1 fmol of nicks specifically into AP DNA per min at 37°C. Reaction mixtures containing 50 μM [uracil-3H]poly(dA-dT) were incubated for 20 min at 37°C to produce approximately 1 pmol of AP sites. After enzyme inactivation for 5 min at 70°C, the reactions were placed on ice and brought to 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 70 mM KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 3 mM EDTA, and AP endonucleases were added. After the enzyme reaction, the products were spotted onto Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper (27 × 45 cm) and chromatographed as previously described (Kim and Linn, 1988Kim J. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NdeI and BamHI restriction sites were introduced at the beginning and the end of the rpS3 cDNA, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis from pGEM2-S3-15 (Chan et al., 1990Chan Y.L. Devi K.R. Olvera J. Wool I.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into the T7 RNA polymerase expression vector, pT7-7 (Tabor and Richardson, 1985Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar) using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites to produce pT7-7S3. Then, pT7-7S3 was introduced into E. coli strain BL21plysS. 10 liters of cells were grown to a density of A600 = 0.5 and then induced by the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mM for 4-5 h at 37°C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) with 0.5 M KCl and protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), sonicated 6 × 30 s with a Branson sonicator and the large probe on ice, and then centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer C plus 0.5 M KCl. The flow-through was dialyzed overnight against buffer C plus 0.1 M KCl and loaded onto an S-Sepharose column. Ribosomal protein S3 was eluted with a gradient of 0.1-1 M KCl in buffer C. The fractions containing rpS3 (0.50-0.55 M KCl) were pooled, concentrated 20-fold using an Amicon apparatus, and loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography-Superose 12 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with buffer C plus 0.1 M KCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer. Fractions of 0.3 ml each were collected, and the activity eluted after 14 ml. When extracts from cultured murine or human cells (data not shown) are passed through phosphocellulose, three peaks of activity, which nick heavily UV-irradiated DNA, are observed (Fig. 1). The two peaks of activity which bind to phosphocellulose, and UV endonucleases I and II, were purified and characterized previously (Kim and Linn, 1989Kim J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flow-through activity, which we called UV endonuclease III, is the subject of this report. We have now purified UV endonuclease III by chromatography upon DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, sephacryl S-200, hydroxyapatite, heparin-agarose, and S-Sepharose followed by sucrose gradient sedimentation. The final preparation has a specific activity of roughly 33,000, a value that is comparable with 38,000 and 29,000 obtained for UV endonucleases I and II, respectively, from the same cells (Kim and Linn, 1989Kim J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout the purification procedure, the activity was inseparable from the AP endonuclease activity present in the phosphocellulose flow-through fraction,2( 2J. Kim and S. Linn, unpublished results.) previously designated as AP endonuclease I (Kuhnlein et al., 1976Kuhnlein U. Penhoet E.E. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1985046771,"Mammalian somatic angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1, ACE) consists of two highly homologous (N- and C-) domains encoded by a duplicated gene. We have identified an apparent single-domain (67 kDa) insect angiotensin converting enzyme (AnCE) in embryos of Drosophila melanogaster which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Km, 365 μM), removes Phe-Arg from the C terminus of bradykinin (Km, 22 μM), and is inhibited by ACE inhibitors, captopril (IC50 = 1.1 × 10−9 M) and trandolaprilat (IC50 = 1.6 × 10−8 M). We also report the cloning and expression of a Drosophila AnCE cDNA which codes for a single-domain 615-amino acid protein with a predicted 17-amino acid signal peptide and regions with high levels of homology to both the N- and C-domains of mammalian somatic ACE, especially around the active site consensus sequence. Northern analysis identified a single 2.1-kilobase mRNA in Drosophila embryos, and Southern analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA indicates that the insect gene is not duplicated. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the AnCE protein is a secreted enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and is inhibited by captopril (IC50 = 5.6 × 10−9 M) and trandolaprilat (IC50 = 2 × 10−8 M). The evolutionary significance of these results is discussed. Mammalian somatic angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1, ACE) consists of two highly homologous (N- and C-) domains encoded by a duplicated gene. We have identified an apparent single-domain (67 kDa) insect angiotensin converting enzyme (AnCE) in embryos of Drosophila melanogaster which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Km, 365 μM), removes Phe-Arg from the C terminus of bradykinin (Km, 22 μM), and is inhibited by ACE inhibitors, captopril (IC50 = 1.1 × 10−9 M) and trandolaprilat (IC50 = 1.6 × 10−8 M). We also report the cloning and expression of a Drosophila AnCE cDNA which codes for a single-domain 615-amino acid protein with a predicted 17-amino acid signal peptide and regions with high levels of homology to both the N- and C-domains of mammalian somatic ACE, especially around the active site consensus sequence. Northern analysis identified a single 2.1-kilobase mRNA in Drosophila embryos, and Southern analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA indicates that the insect gene is not duplicated. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the AnCE protein is a secreted enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and is inhibited by captopril (IC50 = 5.6 × 10−9 M) and trandolaprilat (IC50 = 2 × 10−8 M). The evolutionary significance of these results is discussed."

Low pH treatment results in centrifugal movement of E2, the receptor-binding subunit, centripetal movement of E1 to narrow the central cavity initiating the formation of an E1 trimer, and the extension of the E1 fusion sequence toward the target membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2091724639,"Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) express both type I and type II receptors for transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). These cells respond to TGFβ1 but are relatively refractory to another isoform of TGFβ, termed TGFβ2. TGFβs are thought to signal through receptor complexes composed of type I and/or type II receptors, both of which appear to be functional serine-threonine kinases. The TGFβ type III receptor, on the other hand, does not seem to have any direct signaling capacity. We have now stably transfected BAECs with the type III receptor cDNA. These cells displayed surface expression of the type III receptor protein, as determined by cross-linking with iodinated TGFβ1 and immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the type III receptor protein. Transfected BAECs exhibit increased responsiveness to TGFβ2 by several different criteria including an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein and inhibition of migration and proliferation. Thus, the type III receptor protein may play a role in presenting TGFβ2 to the type II receptor and increase responsiveness to TGFβ2 to a level comparable to that of TGFβ1.

The TGFβ type III receptor is the most abundant TGFβ receptor subtype in most cells (16Segarini P.R. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M.

Cloning of the cDNA encoding the type III receptor, a transmembrane proteoglycan, revealed a short highly conserved cytoplasmic domain with no apparent signaling motif (25Lopez-Casillas F.

Consequently, the type III receptor and its soluble secreted ectodomain may act as reservoir molecules for ligand retention or presentation of TGFβ to the signaling type I and type II receptors. Consistent with this, stable transfection of recombinant rat type III receptor in myoblasts resulted in increase in binding of TGFβ1 to the type II receptor (26Wang X.-F. Lin H.-Y. Ng-Eaton E.

Although most of the biological activities are shared among TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3, there are some differences. TGFβ1 and β3 elicit their effects at about 100-fold lower protein concentration compared to TGFβ2 in certain cell types that lack type III receptor. Indeed vascular endothelial cells and hematopoietic progenitor cell lines that lack type III receptor are relatively resistant to TGFβ2 (17Segarini P.R. Ziman J.M. Kane C.J.M. Dasch J.R. J. Biol.

Expression of type III receptor in L6E9 myoblasts that endogenously lack the protein results in enhanced binding of TGFβ2 to the type II receptor and suggests interactions between the types II- and III-binding sites (33Lopez-Casillas F.

Based on the structural features of the type III receptor and the observation that cells that lack this receptor still respond to TGFβ, the role of type III receptor is most likely in modulating the TGFβ isoform response (16Segarini P.R. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. Endrocrinology. 1989; 3: 261-272Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Ohta M. Greenberger J.S. Anklesana R. Bassols A. Massague J.

Our laboratory has spent several years characterizing the TGFβ responses of vascular endothelial cells, comparing the effects of TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3 on bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). TGFβ1 and TGFβ3 profoundly inhibit BAEC proliferation and migration, while TGFβ2 has little or no effect. To test the hypothesis that the type III receptor regulates the binding of TGFβ2 to the signaling receptors and increases the TGFβ2 responsiveness in BAECs, we generated stable transfectants of BAECs expressing the type III receptor cDNA in both the sense and antisense orientations. We now present changes in BAEC responsiveness to TGFβ2 that are comparable to TGFβ1 effects when type III receptors are present. Human TGFβ1 and porcine TGFβ2 were purchased from R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis. Iodinated TGFβ1 was obtained from Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA. Bovine type I collagen was isolated and purified as described (35Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 94: 179-187Google Scholar, 36Madri J.A. Furthmayr H.

Tissue culture plates were coated with type I collagen at a concentration of 12.5 μg/ml. The vector used for transfection of the type III receptor into bovine aortic endothelial cells was obtained from Wang and co-workers (26Wang X.-F. Lin H.-Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.H. Cell. 1991; 51: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Basically the HindIII fragment of the rat type III receptor cDNA (R3-OFF) was subcloned into pcDNA I NEO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) which is under the control of the cytomegalovirus transcriptional promoter and the SV40 origin of replication. In addition, two other constructs were generated by subcloning a 3.9-kilobase EcoRI fragment from the rat type III receptor cDNA (a gift from J. Massague, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY) into the pSV7d expression vector (38Truett M.A. Blacher R. Burke R.L. Caput D. Chu C. Dina D. Hartog K. Kuo C.H. Masarz F.R. Merryweather J.P.

The orientation of the EcoRI fragment was checked by restriction digests with AflIII and SalI. Thus the rat type III receptor cDNA was subcloned into pSV7d in both the sense and antisense orientations. A control vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing the neomycin resistance marker was cotransfected into the cells along with the type III receptor cDNA subcloned into the pSV7d. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cultured according to Madri and Furthmayr (36Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Human Pathol. 1980; 11: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For the transfection experiments, cells were plated on 60-mm dishes at subconfluence. The cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 25 μg of lipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) per plate and incubated with serum-free media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for several hours before growth media was added. Selection for transfectants with 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out 48 h after the transfection. Neomycin -resistant colonies were selected using cloning rings and expanded before analysis for surface expression of the receptors. The assay was a modification of our earlier studies (32Merwin J.R. Newman W. Beall L.D. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar, 39Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers grown on 35 mm, 1.5% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates were washed with cold binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified essential media, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and then allowed to equilibrate with binding buffer for 30 min at 4°C on a rotating platform. The buffer was aspirated, and 250 μl of ice-cold binding buffer containing 100 pM125I-labeled TGFβ1 (220 μCi/μg) was added to each 35-mm dish and incubated on a rotary platform at 4°C for 3 h. After washing at 4°C, ice-cold binding buffer lacking bovine serum albumin was added to the plates. 5 μl of 27 mM disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) was added to each plate. The plates were swirled immediately after addition of the disuccinimidyl suberate. The dishes were allowed to shake on the rotary platform for 15 min. The medium was removed and washed several times with binding buffer before lysis with Laemmli loading buffer containing 30 μl of 1 mM dithiothreitol. The cell lysate was boiled and electrophoresed according to Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Linear gradient resolving gels of 5-10% polyacrylamide were constructed with a 3.5% stacking gel. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm ™-MP at −80°C. The films were developed using a Kodak X-OMAT M20 processor (Kodak). Cells plated on 100-mm dishes were washed with PBS containing 0.2 mM calcium chloride and 2 mM magnesium chloride and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 1 mg of NHS-Long Chain Biotin (Pierce) in 2 ml of PBS containing calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 0.05% Triton X-100, 120 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.7. The cell lysates were spun at 14,000 revolutions/min in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates obtained from 125I-TGFβ1 cross-linking experiments and surface biotinylation experiments were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-type III receptor and anti-type II receptor; gifts from F. Lopez-Casillas, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York and H. Y. Lin, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, respectively) overnight on a rotary shaker. 50 μl of protein-A Sepharose CL 4B (Pharmacia) was added to the cell lysate and further incubated for 2 h before spinning the beads down and washing the Sepharose beads with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (TBS-T) several times. The beads were resuspended in sample loading buffer and boiled for several minutes before loading onto the gel. Cell protein was extracted with 0.05% Triton X-100 and 120 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, normalized for total protein using the bicinchonic acid assay (Pierce), and electrophoresed through a 10% non-reducing polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), blocked with 8% nonfat milk in PBS, and incubated with mouse anti-bovine PAI-1 IgG (American Diagnostica Inc.) at 1:750 dilution and then goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega, Madison, WI) at 1:10 000 dilution. The blot was developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Corp.) with Hyperfilm™-MP. Bands were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer (Molecular Dynamics Scanner, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell extracts were normalized for cell protein using the bicinchonic acid assay and then electropheresed in a 10% acrylamide gel. The gel was then washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h followed by two 20-min washes in water. The gel was then overlaid on a thin agar gel with final concentrations of 4% nonfat milk, 0.1 M Tris-,HCl pH 8.0, 8 μg/ml plasminogen, 1.25% agar. The gel and overlay were incubated at 37°C until the generated plasmin had diffused throughout the entire gel, and all the casein was degraded except where PAI-1 was located. The gels were then examined and photographed with darkfield illumination. Collagen I-coated bacteriological cultures dishes were washed with PBS before the addition of cell suspension (1 × 104 cells/dish). The cells were allowed to attach to the coated dishes for several hours. At this point, fresh medium with or without TGFβ was added to the cultures. The medium and factors were replaced once again on the third day. Cell numbers were determined by lifting the cells off the culture dishes with trypsin/EDTA and counting quadruplicate samples using a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics Inc, Hialech, FL). The mean number of cells/dish was then calculated. Cell migration was evaluated as described previously (41Pratt B.M. Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 117: 349-354PubMed Google Scholar, 42Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Tucker A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cells plated within fences located in the center of the cultures achieved confluence (about 6 h), migration was induced by the removal of the fences and the cells migrated outward in a radial fashion. After 6 days, the cultures were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin. Cultures were stained with Ham's hematoxylin. Net increase in surface area covered was assessed using the NIH Image Program. Maximum response was obtained from untreated control BAECs, and this was defined as 100% relative migration. In order to screen for potential clones expressing the TGFβ type III receptor, we incubated the BAEC transfectants with radioiodinated TGFβ1, added chemical cross-linker, and resolved the labeled receptor by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as in previous studies (32Merwin J.R. Newman W. Beall L.D. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows two predominant TGFβ-binding proteins on the surface of the control BAECs (lane 1). BAECs transfected with pcDNA 3 containing the neomycin resistance marker (lane 3) exhibited a similar binding profile. By relative migration and comparison with other culture models, these bands correspond to TGFβ bound to the type I receptor (65 kDa) and the type II receptor (85 kDa) complexes. Introduction of the TGFβ type III receptor cDNA in the forward orientation led to the expression of type III receptor protein in the BAECs (lane 5). The TGFβ type III receptor migrated as a diffuse band of 280-330 kDa. The identity of the molecules within the diffuse band in the BAECIIIR cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the TGFβ type III receptor protein (lane 6). Furthermore, introduction of the TGFβ type III receptor cDNA in the reverse orientation (pIIIRAS) profoundly reduced the surface expression of both the type I and type II receptors (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Our initial immunoprecipitation studies in Fig. 1 showed very little type II receptor protein co-immunoprecipitated with the type III receptor protein similar to the results reported by Moustakas and co-workers (34Moustakas A. Lin H.-Y. Henis Y.I. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when they precipitated type III receptor protein from Rat-1 cells. Therefore, to verify that negligible levels of type II receptor were associated with the type III receptor, we carried out immunoprecipitation reactions with antibodies to the type II receptor protein also. Immunoprecipitation of BAEC(V) cell lysates, which had been cross-linked to iodinated TGFβ1, with antibodies to the TGFβ type II receptor, co-precipitated the type I receptor (Fig. 2, lane 2). Immunoprecipitation of these lysates with the type IIIR antibodies did not precipitate any protein (Fig. 2, lane 3), indicating the absence of the TGFβ type IIIR protein in these cells. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of BAECIIIR OE cell lysates with antibodies to the type II receptor co-precipitated a significant amount of the type III receptor protein (Fig. 2, lane 5) as well, indicating a complex formation between the TGFβ type III and type II receptor proteins in the BAECIIIR cells. Nonetheless, incubation with anti-type III receptor antibody still failed to co-precipitate type II receptor complexes. Secondly, we carried out immunoprecipitation reactions using cell lysates that had been surface-biotinylated. Control BAECs, BAEC(V), and BAECIIIR OE cells were surface biotinylated and equal amounts of cell lysate incubated with antibodies to the type III receptor protein. The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and ECL detection system. Several protein bands were detected only in BAECIIIR OE cells as shown in Fig. 3. Bands in the region of 280 kDa are likely to represent the type III receptor, while the other bands noted in this immunoprecipitation are likely to represent surface molecules that co-precipitated with the type III receptor. Hence, immunoprecipitation with both 125I-TGFβ-labeled cell lysates and biotinylated lysates indicated that BAECIIIR OE cells were indeed expressing the type III receptor protein. The effects of varying doses (0.5, 5.0, and 25 ng/ml) of TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 on PAI-1 protein levels and enzyme activity in BAECs were examined by immunoblotting and reverse zymography. Both PAI-1 protein and activity were differentially regulated by TGFβ1 and TGFβ2. As illustrated by the immunoblotting technique in Fig. 4A, these amounts of TGFβ1 dose-dependently increased steady state PAI-1 protein levels while TGFβ2 was ineffective. These results were confirmed by reverse zymography as illustrated in Fig. 4B, that is, TGFβ1 increased steady state PAI-1 activity levels at all concentrations tested, while TGFβ2 did not. The data above indicated that TGFβ1, but not TGFβ2, could induce PAI-1 protein in BAECs. We then re-examined this issue in BAECs that expressed transfected type III receptor. Cultures transfected with vector plasmid alone responded to TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 in a way that was consistent with untransfected cultures, although the vector itself seemed to decrease basal PAI-1 protein levels (top two panels, Fig. 5). In BAECIIIR OE cells, both TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 enhanced PAI-1 protein to essentially equal extents (third panel, Fig. 5). In contrast, BAECIIIR AS cells transfected with the type III receptor cDNA in the reverse orientation were unresponsive to both TGFβ isoforms (bottom panel, Fig. 5). Notably, PAI-1 protein in the untreated BAECIIIR AS cells was the highest among all the cell lines tested. Our laboratory previously reported that TGFβ1 inhibited the migration rate of BAECs, whereas TGFβ2 had a very modest effect (32Merwin J.R. Newman W. Beall L.D. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we repeated migration assays with control and transfected cells to see if there were any differences in the responsiveness to the two TGFβ isoforms. Similar to the earlier results, TGFβ1, but not TGFβ2, inhibited migration in BAECs and in cultures transfected with vector plasmid alone (Fig. 6). However, with BAECIIIR OE cells, both TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 equally inhibited the migration rates of these cells while BAECIIIR AS cells were refractory to both TGFβ isoforms. Previous studies (32Merwin J.R. Newman W. Beall L.D. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar) also demonstrated differences in BAEC proliferation responses to TGFβ1 and TGFβ2. TGFβ1 potently reduced proliferation of BAECs, whereas TGFβ2 had no effect. In agreement with our PAI-1 and migration studies, when we examined the proliferative response in BAECIIIR OE cells, the cells were inhibited by both TGFβ isoforms (data not shown). Our results so far indicated that the expression of TGFβ type III receptor protein in BAECs increased their responsiveness to TGFβ2 by three separate criteria: proliferation, PAI-1 protein, and migration assays. TGFβ2 gave comparable results to TGFβ1. When an equal amount of unlabeled TGFβ1 was combined with 125I-TGFβ1, binding to the TGFβ type III receptor was not affected (Fig. 7, lane 2) whereas a 10-fold excess of unlabeled TGFβ1 showed a 70-80% reduction (Fig. 7, lane 3). Similar results occurred with analogous amounts of unlabeled TGFβ2, although it appeared to have a slightly higher affinity for transfected type III receptor binding sites (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5). BAECs endogenously express both type I and type II receptors for TGFβ, respond well to TGFβ1, but are relatively refractory to TGFβ2. Expression of transfected type III receptor protein allowed BAECs to now respond to TGFβ2 in terms of PAI-1 protein levels, migration, and proliferation assays. These results indicate that type III receptor protein expression increases the responsiveness to TGFβ2 in BAECs that do not normally respond to treatment with TGFβ2. Our binding studies agree well with previous observations made by Wang and co-workers (26Wang X.-F. Lin H.-Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.H. Cell. 1991; 51: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and Lopez-Casillas and co-workers (25Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) when they transfected type III receptor cDNA into L6E9 myoblast cell lines lacking the TGFβ type III receptor protein. In contrast, however, BAEC transfectants containing the type III receptor cDNA in the reverse orientation displayed a dramatic reduction in the surface expression of both type I and type II receptors as assessed by radioligand binding and cross-linking, and were refractory to both TGFβ1 and TGFβ2. Therefore, our results indicate that complete down-regulation of the TGFβ type III receptor could alter the surface expression of the TGFβ type II and type I receptors in a fashion that is not yet well understood. The expression of the type III receptor protein increases the responsiveness of BAECs to TGFβ2. TGFβ2 has a lower affinity for the cell surface type II receptor (KD ~ 500 pM) than does TGFβ1 or TGFβ3 (KD ~ 25-50 pM) (5Massague J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 43ten Dijke P. Iwata K.K. Goddard C. Peihler C. Canalis E. McCarthy T.L. Centralla M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4473-4479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this effect is direct physical interaction between the type II and type III receptor proteins on the cell surface. Once TGFβ2 binds to the type III receptor it could then couple more effectively to the type II receptors. Indirect evidence from our studies with iodinated TGFβ1 indicate that immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled BAECIIIR OE cell lysates with antibodies to the type III receptor did not co-precipitate much ligand-bound type II receptor. However, immunoprecipitation with anti-type II antibodies co-precipitated a significant amount of the type III receptor protein as well as the type I receptor protein. Differences with these two antibodies may reflect the overexpression of the type III receptor protein relative to the type II and type I receptor proteins on the surface of the BAECIIIR OE cells and suggest that a large fraction of the type III receptors in this situation may not associate with the other receptor types. Therefore, we suggest that there may be two kinds of complexes: 1) complexes composed of TGFβ, type II, and type I receptors and 2) complexes composed of TGFβ and all three cell surface components. Expression of the type III receptor may specifically promote TGFβ2 access to type II receptor thus overcoming the low affinity binding of TGFβ2 to type II receptors. It is also possible that TGFβ2 binding to the type III receptor elicits a conformation change in the TGFβ2 molecule that more favorably associates with type II receptor. Unbound TGFβ1 might approximate such a conformation better than unbound TGFβ2. Recent studies by Qian and co-workers (44Qian S.W. Burmester J.K. Merwin J.R. Madri J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6290-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using domain swapping experiments suggest that the different potencies of TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 map to a 42-amino-acid region that includes the longest α-helix in the monomer. The availability of these chimeric TGFβ molecules will enable us to identify which portion of the molecule is responsible for interacting with the TGFβ receptors. The recent crystallography studies of TGFβ2 (45Daopin S. Piez K.A. Ogawa Y. Davies D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 46Schlunegger M.P. Grutter M.G. Nature. 1992; 358: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) will also assist in our understanding of the important residues required for interaction with the receptors. Large vessel endothelial cells such as BAECs and small vessel endothelial cells such as rat fat pad capillary endothelial cells differ in the expression of the TGFβ type III receptor protein (32Merwin J.R. Newman W. Beall L.D. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). BAECs lack the type III receptor protein and are refractory to TGFβ2 whereas rat fat pad capillary endothelial cells contain the type III receptor protein and are inhibited by TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 in proliferation studies (32Merwin J.R. Newman W. Beall L.D. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the differences in the surface expression of the type III receptor protein in these two populations of endothelial cells may well modulate their responsiveness to TGFβ2. These data are consistent with the concept that cells regulate their responsiveness to TGFβ isoforms by modulation of their TGFβ receptors. Although the type III receptor does not appear to play a direct role in signaling, recent findings from McAllister et al.(47McAllister K.A. Grog K.M. Johnson D.W. Gallione C.J. Baldwin M.A. Jackson C.E. Helmhold E.A. Markel D.S. McKinnon W.C. Murrel J. McCormick M.K. Pericak-Guttmache A.E. Letarte M. Marchuk D.A. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) suggest that defects in a related TGFβ-binding protein, endoglin, which does not have direct signaling activity as well, is the cause of hereditary hemeorrhagic telangiectasia type I, an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by multisystemic vascular dysplasia and recurrent hemeorrhage. Hence although large vessel endothelial cells lack the type III receptor, perhaps the type III receptor plays an important role in early stages of vascular growth in microvessel endothelial cells. Future experiments will be directed toward down-regulating the expression of endogenous TGFβ type III receptor in cultured microvascular endothelial cells by using the antisense construct to determine its effect in in vitro angiogenesis.

The initial identification of these genes was allowed by screening of expression libraries with polyclonal antisera prepared against deglycosylated mucins from a variety of sources. A notable feature of these clones was that they contained tandem repeats of sequences coding for Thr- and Ser-rich regions, which appear to correspond to the highly glycosylated domains of mucins (Lesuffleur et al., 1994Lesuffleur T.

The stomach mucosa was scraped, homogenized in distilled water (Ultra-turrax, Jankee and Kunkel, Stauffer, Germany), and centrifuged (1 h, 48,000 × g). The supernatant was heated for 1 h in a boiling water bath and further centrifuged (1 h, 48,000 × g). The resultant supernatant was dialyzed against distilled water for 2 days at 4°C and lyophilized (crude gastric extract). Scraped colonic mucosa was homogenized in acetone, dried at room temperature, and then passed through a sieve (200-mesh) in order to obtain a thin dry powder. One rabbit (L56) was immunized with the crude gastric extract in Freund's complete adjuvant according to the protocol previously reported (Zweibaum et al., 1975Zweibaum A. Oriol R. Dausset J. Marcelli-Barge A. Ropartz C. Lanset S. Tissue Antigens. 1975; 6: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The immunized rabbit was of the A+ phenotype (Zweibaum and Steudler, 1969Zweibaum A. Steudler V. Nature. 1969; 223: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in order to avoid the presence of anti-blood group A antibodies. The immune serum was further absorbed with the colonic mucosal dry acetone powder to remove non-gastric-specific antibodies and stored in aliquots at −20°C. The absorbed immune serum is referred to as L56/C. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on frozen cryostat sections of tissues and HT29-MTX cells as described earlier (Lesuffleur et al., 1990Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6334-6343PubMed Google Scholar). For ELISA, microtiter plates (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with native or deglycosylated mucins isolated from the culture medium of HT29-MTX cells (20 μg/ml), KLH, and peptide-KLH conjugates (20 μg/ml in PBS). Native and deglycosylated MTX mucins were prepared as described elsewhere (Gambs et al., 1993Gambs G. de Bolós C. Andreu D. Franc C. Egea G. Real F.X. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The peptides tested correspond to MUC1 (VTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAHG), MUC2 (PTTTPISTTTVTPTPTPTGTQT), MUC3 (HSTPSFTSSITTTETTS), MUC4 (TSSASTGHATPLPVTD), MUC5AC (TTSTTSAPTTS), and MUC6 (SFQTTTTYPTPSHPQTTLP and TSLHSHTSSTHHPEVPT) tandem repeat sequences. MUC5B was not included because it does not contain a conserved tandem repeat. The peptide synthesis and the coupling to KLH were performed as described previously (Gambs et al., 1993Gambs G. de Bolós C. Andreu D. Franc C. Egea G. Real F.X. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Reactive sites were blocked with 1% gelatin for 1 h at 37°C. Serial dilutions of the L56/C serum in PBS containing 1% BSA were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the antigen-coated wells. After washing with PBS-Tween, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) (0.5 μg/ml) was added for 1 h at 37°C. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using 4-methylumbelliferyl-phosphate (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) at 1 mg/ml diluted in triethanolamine buffer, pH 9.5, and fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor 2300 fluorescence measurement system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from postconfluent HT29-MTX cells (day 21 after seeding) as described previously (Lesuffleur et al., 1990Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6334-6343PubMed Google Scholar). A λZAP-cDNA library was constructed using 5 μg of mRNA as template and amplified once according to instructions in the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was kindly provided by E. Navarro and T. Adell (Institut Municipal d'Investigació Mèdica, Barcelona, Spain). The host strain was Escherichia coli XL1 blue. The library was plated in soft agar at a density of 30,000 plaque-forming units/150-mm plate. Plates were incubated at 37°C until plaques began to appear, then overlaid with isopropylβ-D-thiogalactopyranoside-saturated nitrocellulose membranes and incubated for an additional 3 h. The filters were removed and blocked with 3% BSA. For the immunoscreening, L56/C antibodies were used at a 1:50 dilution and preabsorbed for 1 h with 1% BSA and XL1 blue cells, lysed or killed by UV light (each XL1 blue preparation corresponding to a pellet of 50 ml overnight culture for 50 ml of diluted serum). After primary incubation with absorbed L56/C serum for 3 h at room temperature and washing, filters were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:1000 (Dako). After washing, positive plaques were identified by detection of alkaline phosphatase activity with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate alkaline phosphatase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and purified by successive rounds of screening. Using helper phage R408, the pBluescript® plasmids containing positive cDNA were released from λZAP phage, and transferred into XL1 blue for storage and sequencing. The clone L31 was sequenced in its entirety on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method while the other clones were partially sequenced. Sequencing was performed with double-stranded plasmid and T7 DNA polymerase kit, according to the recommended procedure (Pharmacia, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). The primers used were the T3 sequence and a 20-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CCCAAAAGGGTCAGTGCTGC-3′) in pBluescript for the 5′ and 3′ end sequences, respectively, and 11 pairs of oligonucleotides (both sense and antisense) corresponding to positions 237-255, 464-484, 821-840, 1155-1173, 1413-1431, 1674-1693, 1906-1925, 2184-2203, 2459-2478, 2698-2717, and 2954-2973 in the L31 sequence. The oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. PCR-mate or purchased from Bioprobe (Bioprobe, Montreuil sous Bois, France). The sequencing difficulties due to the high (G+C) concentration of the insert were solved by the use of 7-deaza-GTP (Pharmacia). Enzymatic pauses were suppressed using a lower quantity of DNA template (1 μg/reaction). Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data was performed using Bisance (Dessen et al., 1990Dessen P. Fondrat C. Valencien C. Mugnier C. Cabios. 1990; 6: 355-356PubMed Google Scholar) and the Wisconsin GCG package on the HGMP-RC computer (Risavy et al., 1992Risavy F.R. Bishop M.J. Gibbs G.P. Williams G.W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes was conducted as described previously (Pinkel et al., 1986Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples of normal human tissues as described previously (Chomczynski and Sacci, 1987Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA (15 μg) was denatured in loading buffer containing formamide and formaldehyde, fractionated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Poly(A)+ RNA isolation from HT29-MTX and HT29-FU cells, electrophoretic separation, and Northern blotting were as reported previously (Lesuffleur et al., 1993Lesuffleur T. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Swallow D. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Real F.X. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 771-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All membranes were prehybridized and hybridized according to previously used conditions (Lesuffleur et al., 1993Lesuffleur T. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Swallow D. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Real F.X. Zweibaum A.

Actin was detected with cDNA probe pA2 (Cleveland et al., 1986Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. McDonald R.J. Cowan N.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1986; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNAs using Hybond N+ filters (Amersham) was carried out following standard procedures, as recommended by the manufacturer. The final stringent wash was done with 0.1 × SSC at 65°C. The relative sizes of the fragments were determined by comparison with Raoul markers (Appligene, Durham, United Kingdom), which were probed with 32P-labeled PUC18 for their detection. The antiserum L56/C was tested by indirect immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of the panel of normal gastric and colonic mucosa samples. The antiserum showed strong reactivity with mucus droplets of mucus-secreting cells in all normal gastric samples tested (Fig. 1a). In contrast no reactivity was observed with colonic goblet cells (Fig. 1b). Mucus droplets in HT29-MTX cells showed strong reactivity (Fig. 1c). Since these antibodies were not prepared against purified gastric mucins and the epitopes that they recognize had not been identified, reactivity of the antiserum against native and deglycosylated mucins isolated from HT29-MTX cells, and against the tandem repeat peptide-KLH conjugates (see “Materials and Methods”), was analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, the antibodies recognize both native and deglycosylated mucins purified from HT29-MTX cells. In contrast, they do not react with the synthetic peptides corresponding to the mucin tandem repeats. These results suggested that the antiserum L56/C contains antibodies that are reactive either with epitopes outside the tandem repeat domains of the MUC1-MUC6 apomucins or reactive with a new apomucin. The antiserum L56/C was therefore used to screen approximately 300,000 recombinants of the HT29-MTX cDNA library, and 37 positive clones were isolated. Of these, 18 clones were related, as determined by hybridization analysis (data not shown). The size of the inserts varied from 3,310 to 300 bp. The sequence of the largest clone, named L31, was determined in its entirety on both strands and is given in Fig. 3. Other clones used in this study (L18, L10, L21, L34, and L17) were partially sequenced, manually or automatically, and correspond to L31 sequence from position 337, 790, 1216, 1279, and 1507 to 3′ end, respectively. The L31 cDNA sequence is 3,310 bp long with a 70% (G+C) content and ends with a 22-bp poly(A) tail. Comparison with other cDNA sequences from mucins showed that the L31 sequence is very similar (98.6% of identity) to clone NP3a (nucleotide 273 to the 3′ end) isolated from a nasal polyp cDNA library by Meerzaman et al., 1994Meerzaman D.

The comparison revealed 14 insertions, 3 deletions, 7 inversions, and 9 substitutions (presented in Fig. 3) all along the L31 sequence. Each deletion involved a single nucleotide, while insertions involved one to three nucleotides. These differences were confirmed on both strands by at least three sequencing reactions with dGTP or deaza-GTP. Some of the differences detected were assessed by digestion with restriction enzymes (Fig. 4). In each case the fragment number and sizes were as predicted from the L31 sequence.Figure 4:Analysis of L31 restriction fragments. A, restriction maps showing sites for five enzymes, AccIII, BamHI, BglI, MslI, and NaeI, within the EcoRI-KpnI L31 insert (3342 bp), were predicted from sequence analysis. The sites that are absent in the NP3a sequence are indicated with ●, and sites that are present in the NP3a but not in L31 are represented by ▲. The vertical bar corresponds to sites present in both sequences. B, L31 insert (lane2) was digested by BamHI (lane3), BglI (lane4), NaeI (lane5), MslI (lane7), and AccIII (lane8). Fragments were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Their sizes were determined by comparison with λBstEII (Biolabs, Beverley, MA) (lane1) and the 100-base pair ladder (Pharmacia) (lane6) molecular weight markers. Note that all the fragments have the expected size; partial digestion with NaeI is due to site preference (Biolabs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The open reading frame of L31 cDNA encodes a 1042-amino acid polypeptide rich in cysteine (9.2%) (Fig. 5). Comparative analysis of L31 and NP3a deduced amino acid sequences shows 83.5% identity (Fig. 5). Large identical regions (>98%) alternate with four smaller regions with a low level of identity (<12.6%). The regions that diverge result from nucleotide insertions and deletions that introduce several shifts in the reading frame and are shown in Fig. 5. There is one additional amino acid in each of the first two domains, and a 74-amino acid extension of the carboxyl-terminal region; the first in-frame stop codon (TGA) is located at position 3129-3131 because of the nucleotide insertions and deletions. The untranslated sequence of clone L31 is therefore shorter. Immunoblot analysis of bacterial lysates revealed that the electrophoretic mobilities of the fusion proteins expressed in XL1 blue by clones L31, L18, L10, L21, or L17 were in good agreement with that expected if the first stop codon is at position 3129-3131 (data not shown). The changes in reading frame led to notable differences in the deduced amino acid composition of non-conserved regions. In particular, there is an increased number of Cys residues all along the L31 sequence, 15 out of 16 being located in the non-conserved regions (Fig. 5). A number of other nucleotide changes were detected and in 6/10 cases led to amino acid substitutions in Arg codons. The deduced amino acid sequence of L31 contains 12 potential N-glycosylation sites, 10 of which are present in clone NP3a. The TTVGPTTVGS tandem repeats described by Meerzaman et al., 1994Mee"
https://openalex.org/W2049583989,"Two tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways exist for activation of the respiratory burst by polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) immunoglobulin G Fc receptors. Direct ligation of FcγRII activates the respiratory burst, but ligation of the glycan phosphoinositol-linked FcγRIIIB does not. Instead, this receptor and the integrin complement receptor CR3 synergize in activation of the respiratory burst (Zhou, M.-J., and Brown, E. J. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 125, 1407-1416). Here we show that direct ligation of FcγRII leads to activation and Triton X-100 insolubility of the Src family kinase Fgr, without effect on the related myeloid Src family member Hck. In contrast, adhesion of PMN via FcγRIIIB leads to activation and Triton X-100 insolubility of Hck but not Fgr. The exclusive association of FcγRIIIB with Hck activation and Triton insolubility is not solely a result of its glycan phosphoinositol anchor, since decay accelerating factor (CD55), another prominent glycan phosphoinositol-anchored PMN protein, is associated with Fgr insolubility to a greater extent than Hck. Ligation of decay accelerating factor, with or without coligation of CR3, does not activate the PMN respiratory burst. Coligation of FcγRIIIB with FcγRII overcomes the pertussis toxin inhibition of H2O2 production in response to direct ligation of FcγRII. These data support the hypothesis that activation of Hck upon FcγRIIIB ligation has a role in generation of the synergistic respiratory burst.

Binding of immune complexes to cell receptors for immunoglobulin is a powerful stimulus to activation of phagocytes. Immune complex binding to these cells leads to activation of effector functions of host defense such as phagocytosis, secretion, cytokine synthesis, and the production of toxic oxygen metabolites, which occurs as a result of NADPH oxidase assembly (1Rosales C. Brown E.J. Abramson J.S. Wheeler J.G. The Neutrophil. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 23-62Google Scholar). The cloning of several members of the immunoglobulin Fc receptor family over the past several years has tremendously enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms for the functions of these immunologically important receptors. Identification of receptors within the family which associate with a second transmembrane protein, called the γ chain, and realization that the γ chain is itself a member of a family of proteins known to be involved in tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction has further enhanced understanding of Fc receptor-mediated cell activation. The two Fcγ receptors expressed on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN),1( 1The abbreviations used are: PMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyteFcγRIIIgG Fc receptor, type 2FcγRIIIIgG Fc receptor, type 3CR3complement receptor type 3DAFdecay accelerating factor, CD55mAbmonoclonal antibodyPTpertussis toxinMesmorpholinoethanesulfonic acid.) FcγRII and the glycan phosphoinositol (GPI)-linked form of FcγRIII (FcγRIIIB) are distinct within this family for their failure to associate with the γ chain, suggesting alternative mechanisms for cell activation by these receptors. Nonetheless, even FcγRII appears to activate tyrosine kinases and to be phosphorylated on tyrosine during immune complex-mediated cell activation (2Connelly P.A. Farrell C.A. Merenda J.M. Conklyn M.J. Showell H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). FcγRII has been found to associate with specific Src family kinases, including Fgr in PMN, and to activate syk kinase (3Agarwal A. Salem P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol.

In contrast, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction from the PMN FcγRIIIB. This receptor is unique among Fc receptors, since it is expressed on the plasma membrane by a GPI anchor, rather than as a transmembrane protein. It has no association with the γ chain, which associates with the transmembrane form of FcγRIII expressed in NK cells and macrophages, and has no intracytoplasmic domain for direct association with cytosolic signal transduction cascades. Indeed, whether FcγRIIIB mediates signal transduction at all remains controversial. Many effects of immune complexes on PMN appear to be mediated exclusively by FcγRII (9Anderson C.L. Shen L.

Cross-linking of FcγRIIIB can lead to an increase in intracytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), although the mechanism for this effect is unclear (13Kimberly R.P. Ahlstrom J.W. Click M.E. Edberg J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1239-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, GPI-linked proteins in several cell types have been associated with membrane domains rich in Src family tyrosine kinases (14Brown D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and evidence has been presented recently for an association of PMN FcγRIIIB with tyrosine kinase activity (15Zhou M.-J. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 16Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5826-5835PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role for FcγRIIIB in PMN activation remains uncertain. Recently, we have developed an assay system which allows a more detailed investigation of the contribution of individual PMN Fcγ receptors to signal transduction leading to generation of a respiratory burst (15Zhou M.-J. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have used PMN adhesion to surfaces coated with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to individual receptors to assess their contribution to cell activation. We have found that direct ligation of FcγRII leads to a respiratory burst, whereas direct ligation of FcγRIIIB does not. Instead, FcγRIIIB cooperates with the PMN integrin CR3 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18) to generate what we have termed a synergistic respiratory burst. In the synergistic respiratory burst, the two membrane receptors have distinct roles. Ligation of CR3 immobilizes FcγRII to the adherent plasma membrane by a cytoskeleton-dependent mechanism, and ligation of FcγRIIIB induces appropriate tyrosine kinase activation in proximity to the immobilized FcγRII. Thus, FcγRII is required in addition to CR3 and FcγRIIIB for the synergistic respiratory burst. In the current work, we have examined the nature of the Src family kinases activated by ligation of the two Fcγ receptors. We have found that FcγRII and FcγRIIIB immobilized on the adherent PMN surface by direct ligation lead to the activation and Triton X-100 insolubility of different Src family kinases. FcγRII is associated with activation and translocation of Fgr to the Triton-insoluble cell fraction; and FcγRIIIB is associated with Hck activation and translocation. The exclusive association of FcγRIIIB with Hck activation is not a property of all GPI-linked proteins in PMN, since immobilization of decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) leads primarily to Fgr activation at the adherent membrane. Moreover, DAF cannot substitute for FcγRIIIB in synergistic activation of the respiratory burst. From these data we conclude that ligation of FcγRII and FcγRIIIB activate and translocate distinct Src family members in PMN. We hypothesize that the functional consequence of the activation and translocation of distinct kinases is the existence of two separate signal transduction pathways for activation of the PMN respiratory burst by immune complexes.

Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRPG) was 145 mM NaCl, 4.86 mM KCl, 1.22 mM MgSO4, 5.7 mM Na2HPO4, 0.54 mM CaCl2, and 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4. Reaction mixture (RM) consisted of 37.5 μM scopoletin, 1.25 mM NaN3, 1.25 units/ml HPO in KRPG.

MBS buffer was 25 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. Other reagents were obtained from standard sources as described previously (28Zhou M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Human PMN were isolated by dextran sedimentation and two-step Hypaque density centrifugation as described (29Zhou M. Todd III, R.F. Van de Winkel J.G.J. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3030-3041PubMed Google Scholar). PMN were obtained from a β2 integrin-deficient (leukocyte adhesion-deficient, LAD) patient followed at Baylor College of Medicine. This patient has been characterized as having the complete deficiency phenotype. Expression of FcγRII and FcRγIII on this patient's cells was normal, whereas CR3 was undetectable (not shown). The patient's blood and a normal control were transported and the PMN prepared as described (30Gresham H.D. Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 96-Well tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with protein A and then mAb IgG essentially according to the method of Berton et al.(31Berton G. Laudanna C. Sorio C. Rossi F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), with modifications as described (28Zhou M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The microwell H2O2 assay was adapted from the method of De la Harpe and Nathan (32De la Harpe J. Nathan C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 78: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), as modified by Berton et al.(31Berton G. Laudanna C. Sorio C. Rossi F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Data were collected and analyzed exactly as described previously (28Zhou M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In each experiment, data were averaged from triplicate wells, which generally varied from each other by ≤10%. Unless otherwise stated, H2O2 accumulation was measured after 60 min of PMN incubation in wells. PMN at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in KRPG were pretreated with 5 μg/ml of Fab or 2.5 μg/ml of F(ab′)2 of various mAb at 4°C for 15 min. Without washing, PMN were added to antibody coated plates containing RM (28Zhou M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For treatment with pharmacologic agents, PMN were preincubated with herbimycin at 10 μg/ml and then added to RM containing the same concentration of the indicated agent. To pretreat PMN with pertussis toxin, cells in KRPG were incubated with 2 μg/ml of pertussis toxin at 37°C for 75 min. In experiments examining the effects of cytochalasin, PMN were pretreated with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin D and added to RM containing no additional drug. In all experiments, control PMN were incubated with an identical concentration of nonaqueous diluent as the PMN receiving any drug. 5 × 106 PMN in KRPG with 0.1 mM Na3VO4 were allowed to adhere to mAb-coated six-well plates at 4°C for 10 min and then at 37°C for 15 min. The nonadherent cells were removed by washing with cold MBS buffer. The adherent cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in MBS buffer on ice for 8 min, following which the plate was rinsed with kinase buffer containing 0.1 mM Na3VO4 and 0.2% Triton X-100 once. In situ tyrosine phosphorylation was performed by adding 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μM cold ATP in 500 μl of kinase buffer at room temperature for 15 min. For immunoprecipitation, following washing with the kinase buffer three times, the cell residuals were solubilized with solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4) at 4°C for 60 min with shaking. The lysates were diluted with solubilization buffer without SDS and then precleared with protein A-Sepharose at 4°C for 2 h. The precleared lysate was incubated with anti-Fgr, -Hck, or -phosphotyrosine IgG captured by protein A-Sepharose at 4°C for 2 h. The Sepharose mixture was washed once with solubilization buffer and then six times in the same buffer without deoxycholate, SDS, and protease inhibitors. The Sepharose-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (33Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Fgr and Hck were activated by adhesion, PMN were allowed to adhere to surfaces coated with various mAb for 15 min at 37°C. After MBS buffer extraction, supernatant was collected and the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction solubilized in solubilization buffer as above. Both the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fgr or anti-Hck. Following immunoprecipitation, the immune complexes were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer at room temperature containing 20 μg of poly(Glu,Tyr) (Glu:Tyr ratio 4:1, Sigma) for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 6 μl of 10% phosphoric acid and centrifugation. The supernatants were spotted onto Whatman 3MM cellulose filter paper (1.5 × 1.5 cm), and the filters were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid four times, 5 mM phosphoric acid, and 80% acetone once each. After air-drying the filters, the 32P incorporation was measured by scintillation counting. Alternatively, the supernatants were loaded into the sample bucket of a phosphocellulose unit (Pierce) and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In experiments in which the Triton X-100-insoluble cell fraction was immunoprecipitated with PY20, cell residuals were incubated with kinase buffer containing 10 mM unlabeled ATP at room temperature for 15 min prior to solubilization and immunoprecipitation. Following PMN adhesion on mAbs and bovine serum albumin-coated plates, the adherent cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in KRPG buffer with protease inhibitors on ice for 5 min. The cell residuals were lysed by solubilization buffer with 0.2% SDS. The recovered lysates were precipitated by adding 5 volumes of cold acetone and kept at −20°C for 30 min. After centrifugation at top speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4°C for 10 min, the pellets were washed with 80% acetone twice and allowed to air-dry. The precipitated proteins were dissolved by SDS-sample buffer with 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 2 mM EDTA and separated by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated overnight in blocking buffer (PBS Tween and 3% bovine serum albumin) and then with anti-Hck and anti-Fgr polyclonal IgG at 1:1000 at room temperature for 4 h. The membranes finally were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A and developed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). Our previous studies have shown distinct roles for the two PMN Fcγ receptors in activation of the respiratory burst. PMN adhesion to an FcγRII ligand leads to a respiratory burst, whereas the GPI-linked FcγRIIIB is required for the synergistic respiratory burst, but is incapable of activation of the NADPH oxidase on its own. Nonetheless, our previous data demonstrate that both pathways are inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors and suggest that FcγRIIIB ligation is associated with tyrosine kinase activity (15Zhou M.-J. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To begin to understand tyrosine kinase function in the two pathways, we examined activation of two predominant PMN Src family kinases, Fgr and Hck, upon ligation of PMN Fcγ receptors. As assessed by phosphorylation of poly(Glu,Tyr), ligation of FcγRII led to Fgr activation, whereas ligation of FcγRIIIB led to Hck activation (Fig. 1A). Fgr activation has been associated previously with FcγRII ligation in PMN (4Hamada F. Aoki M. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ligation of either HLA or CR3 did not lead to a detectable increase in the activity of either kinase. Total Fgr activity increased approximately 6.5-fold (average of two determinations) in cells adherent via FcγRII compared with ligation of HLA, and total Hck activity increased more than 20-fold upon FcγRIII ligation (Fig. 1A). A small amount of Fgr kinase activity could be detected in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction in PMN incubated on the control surfaces. However, neither Fgr nor Hck kinase activity was detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction from PMN adherent via HLA or CR3. After either FcγRII or FcγRIIIB ligation, kinase activity was increased in both Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble cell fractions. Thus, Fgr kinase activity was stimulated by ligation of FcγRII; Hck activity was stimulated by ligation of FcγRIIIB. Src family kinases often associate with the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton upon activation, and Src-induced oncogenic transformation may require cytoskeletal association (34Liebl E.C. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2417-2428PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that important kinase substrates are encountered through translocation to the cytoskeleton. Since Triton X-100 insolubility may reflect this translocation to the cytoskeleton, we examined the differences in the Triton X-100 solubility of Fgr and Hck upon receptor ligation. PMN were adhered to mAb-coated surfaces, briefly solubilized with Triton X-100, and the cell residue analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Figs. 1B and 2). Hck was present in the Triton X-100- insoluble cell fraction if, and only if, PMN were adherent to anti-FcγRIIIB (Fig. 2A). Whether or not anti-CR3 also was present on the adherent surface made no difference for Hck localization, even though respiratory burst activation only occurs when both antibodies are present. Fgr was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction only when FcγRII was ligated on the adherent surface (Fig. 2B). Unlike FcγRIIIB, ligation of a different GPI-linked protein, DAF, led predominantly to Fgr localization in the Triton X-100-insoluble residue. When cells were adherent to anti-CR3 alone, no Fgr or Hck protein was detectable. Specific activity of Fgr and Hck was estimated in both the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions after FcγR ligation by comparing kinase activity (Fig. 1A) to protein concentration as estimated from the Western blots (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, although active Fgr or Hck was present in both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble compartments, the specific activity of both kinases was 6-7-fold greater in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction after appropriate receptor ligation (Fig. 1C). Presumably, this reflects the fact that not all Triton X-100-soluble kinase has been activated by receptor ligation. To examine the phosphorylation patterns in the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions after FcγRII or FcγRIIIB ligation, an in situ kinase assay was performed after extraction of adherent PMN with Triton X-100. After addition of [32P]ATP to the Triton X-100-insoluble residue adherent to the immune complex-coated surfaces, phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were examined by immunoprecipitation of the products of the in vitro kinase assay with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, PY20, after solubilization with a more stringent detergent (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). As shown in Fig. 3, phosphotyrosine-containing proteins with molecular mass of ~55-60 kDa were the major products of the in vitro kinase assay when PMN were adherent to either an anti-FcγRII- or an anti-FcγRIIIB- coated surface. Under the same conditions, these phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were not detected from PMN adherent to anti-HLA- or anti-CD47-coated surfaces. Importantly, no tyrosine kinase activity was found in PMN adherent to an anti-CR3-coated surface (Fig. 3), even though FcγRII is present in the Triton X-100-insoluble material (15Zhou M.-J. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and CR3 participates in the synergistic respiratory burst. No reproducible kinase activity was found in anti-FcγRII or anti-FcγRIIIB immunoprecipitates from unstimulated, nonadherent PMN (data not shown). The autophosphorylated Triton X-100-insoluble material also was immunoprecipitated with monospecific antibodies against several Src family kinases. No radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated by antibodies to Yes, Fyn, Src, or Lck from PMN adherent to any surface (data not shown). Phosphorylated proteins from lysates of PMN adherent to an anti-FcγRIIIB coated surface were specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-Hck, but not by anti-Fgr (Fig. 4). As described previously (26Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 35Lock P. Ralph S. Stanley E. Boulet I. Ramsay R. Dunn A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4363-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the autophosphorylated Hck appeared as a doublet. Conversely, a phosphorylated band was immunoprecipitated by anti-Fgr, but not by anti-Hck from the lysate from an anti-FcγRII-coated surface. When autophosphorylated lysates from an anti-HLA coated surface were precipitated by both anti-Hck and anti-Fgr, no phosphorylated bands were identified, consistent with the minimal kinase activity associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble material remaining from PMN adherent to this substrate (see Fig. 1A and 3). To determine whether Hck was the predominant tyrosine kinase associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble material from FcγRIIIB ligation and Fgr the predominant kinase associated with FcγRII ligation, poly(Glu,Tyr) phosphorylation was assayed. When lysates from anti-FcγRIII coated surface were immunoprecipitated with anti-Hck, the anti-Hck immune complexes displayed marked tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 5). Minimal tyrosine kinase activity could be immunoprecipitated by PY20 after anti-Hck preclearing. In contrast, anti-Fgr precipitated almost no poly(Glu,Tyr) phosphorylating activity from the PMN adherent via FcγRIIIB. When lysates from anti-FcγRII-coated surface were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fgr and anti-Hck, the anti-Fgr immune complexes contained 80% of the tyrosine kinase activity. There was very little detectable Hck tyrosine kinase activity from lysates from anti-FcγRII coated surfaces (Fig. 5). Immunoprecipitates with PY20 after anti-Fgr preclearing contained minimal kinase activity toward poly(Glu,Tyr). Thus, we concluded that Hck accounted for almost all the Triton X-100-insoluble tyrosine kinase activity associated with FcγRIIIB ligation, and Fgr accounted for the kinase activity associated with FcγRII ligation. These data suggest that Hck specifically associates with the Triton-insoluble cell fraction from cells adherent via FcγRIIIB, and Fgr kinase specifically associates with the Triton-insoluble cell fraction following adhesion via FcγRII. To determine whether the apparent exclusive association of Hck activity with FcγRIIIB ligation was true for all GPI-linked PMN proteins, PMN were allowed to adhere to anti-DAF-coated surfaces and Triton X-100-insoluble kinase activity determined (Fig. 5). Unlike PMN adherent to anti-FcγRIIIB, cells adherent to anti-DAF showed more Fgr than Hck activity. The signal transduction involved in activation of the respiratory burst by direct ligation of FcγRII or by synergy between FcγRIIIB and CR3 differ in several respects, including sensitivity to pertussis toxin (PT) and cytochalasin D (15Zhou M.-J. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Direct ligation of FcγRII activates H2O2 production, which is inhibited by PT (Fig. 6A); activation of the synergistic respiratory burst is unaffected by PT. Because our previous studies suggested that the role for CR3 in the synergistic respiratory burst was to immobilize FcγRII in proximity to FcγRIIIB, we tested whether direct ligation of FcγRII and FcγRIIIB together could activate the synergistic respiratory burst, by taking advantage of the PT sensitivity of the respiratory burst generated by direct ligation of FcγRII. PT inhibited the respiratory b"

The occurrence of a basalt-free, highly differentiated crust is in accord with recent models of the planet's thermal evolution and suggests that Mercury has retained a hot interior as a result of a combination of inefficient mantle convection and minimal volcanic heat loss."

A brief treatment of defolliculated oocytes with sphingomyelinase (Staphylococcus aureus) was sufficient to induce maturation as measured by H1 kinase activity and germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Pretreatment with cycloheximide inhibited sphingomyelinase-induced GVBD demonstrating a requirement for protein synthesis. Microinjection of ceramide or sphingosine, potential products of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, were capable of inducing GVBD in the absence of hormone. Metabolic labeling studies suggested the conversion of sphingosine to ceramide was necessary for sphingosine-induced GVBD. Additionally, fumonisin b1, an inhibitor of sphingosine N-acyltransferase, blocked sphingosine-induced GVBD demonstrating that ceramide is the more proximal biologically active metabolite. Treatment of oocytes with progesterone, the physiological inducer of oocyte maturation, resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the mass of ceramide and decrease in the mass of sphingomyelin through activation of a Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase. These observations suggest that the generation of ceramide from sphingomyelin is part of the signal transduction pathway activated in response to progesterone and that the increase in ceramide is likely to be functionally important in resumption of the meiotic cell cycle.

Metabolic labeling studies suggested the conversion of sphingosine to ceramide was necessary for sphingosine-induced GVBD. Additionally, fumonisin b1, an inhibitor of sphingosine N-acyltransferase, blocked sphingosine-induced GVBD demonstrating that ceramide is the more proximal biologically active metabolite. Treatment of oocytes with progesterone, the physiological inducer of oocyte maturation, resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the mass of ceramide and decrease in the mass of sphingomyelin through activation of a Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase. These observations suggest that the generation of ceramide from sphingomyelin is part of the signal transduction pathway activated in response to progesterone and that the increase in ceramide is likely to be functionally important in resumption of the meiotic cell cycle."

Deconvolution of this peak indicated that the SP module consists of two domains that unfold independently. At pH below 3.8, a second peak appeared at extremely high temperature corresponding to the unfolding of the two interacting epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains. This second peak occurred at a temperature about 20°C lower in rPC than in PC indicating that the EGF domains in the recombinant protein are less stable. The isolated 6-kDa γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) fragment as well as a 25-kDa Gla-(EGF)2 fragment both exhibited a sigmoidal fluorescence-detected denaturation transition in the same temperature region as the SP domains, but only in the presence of Ca2+. In 2 mM Ca2+, the first heat absorption peak in both intact proteins became biphasic, indicating Ca2+-induced structural changes.

At 90-100°C, above the melting temperature of DNA, it unlinks circular DNA. This DNA unlinking reaction mimics negative supercoiling by gyrase but is ATP-independent.

This is illustrated in Fig. 1 by varying the ratio of M13 ssDNA to pBR322 dsDNA (lanes 3-5). In the absence of M13 ssDNA at 95°C, topoisomerase V unlinks relaxed pBR322 and, like gyrase, produces moderately supercoiled topoisomers (lane 3). The inhibition is proportional to the ssDNA:dsDNA weight ratio (approximately 50% at the 1:1 ratio), and is the same whether the enzyme is preincubated with ssDNA or dsDNA (not shown). Hence the enzyme reversibly binds to ssDNA and dsDNA without preference for either one. This result indicates that during prolonged incubation at very high temperature covalently closed plasmid molecules would break, denature, and become inhibitory for topoisomerase V. To prevent ssDNA from inhibiting topoisomerase V, we searched for agents that would allow topoisomerase V activity but block its binding to ssDNA. Betaine (38Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C.

Our data indicate that one of the unaccounted physiological roles of betaine may be prevention of nonspecific protein-nucleic acid interactions. Fig. 1 and our previous data (15Slesarev A.I.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3295-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that betaine and glutamate minimize inhibitory interaction of topoisomerase V with ssDNA and that thermal degradation of DNA is decreased at high salt concentration. We further determined that the optimal concentrations of betaine and potassium glutamate are 1.1 and 1.5 M, respectively (data not shown). Under these conditions at temperatures in the range 100-122°C, topoisomerase V unlinks relaxed DNA in 90 s (Fig. 2). Electrophoretic mobility of the products obtained at 100°C and 116-122°C coincides with that of native negatively supercoiled pBR322. The mobility of products obtained at temperatures between 100°C and 116°C is higher and reaches maximum at 108°C. Degradation of the substrate dsDNA (lane 2) is minimal even at 110°C due to the high salt concentration. However, approximately 50% of the unwound product (lane 9) degraded during incubation and migrated as a highly diffuse band ahead of the intact DNA circles (not shown). At 122°C the band corresponding to intact unwound circles is still visible, although the degradation of DNA is substantial (lane 14). Although DNA degradation was minimal at 110°C for these experiments, it was more extensive for longer incubation periods (data not shown). The composition of the unlinked complexes, assayed by electron microscopy, is shown in Fig. 3. The principal product in the sample with the highest electrophoretic mobility consists of pairs of concatenated ssDNA circles linked once (isolated ssDNA circles and degraded molecules are also present). From these data we estimated that the rate of DNA unlinking at 108°C is about 4 cycles/s/enzyme monomer, or about 16 times faster than the rate of DNA relaxation at 90°C (15Slesarev A.I. Lake J.A. Stetter K.O. Gellert M. Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of samples with lower electrophoretic mobility showed that they lacked singly linked circles; instead, the DNA formed small clumps (not shown), indicating incomplete unlinking (41Di Capua E. Engel A. Stasiak A. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We conclude that topoisomerase V can reduce the linking between complementary strands down to a single link. Whether topoisomerase V can completely unlink complementary strands is not known since isolated ssDNA circles that can be observed may result from nicking the second strand. We used formamide to study the relationship between DNA denaturation and the ability of topoisomerase V to maximally unlink DNA. Fig. 4 shows that lowering the melting temperature of DNA by formamide decreases the temperature TU at which the enzyme maximally unlinks DNA. Our interpretation of the results is shown in the model in Fig. 5. At temperatures below the DNA melting temperature, topoisomerase V relaxes dsDNA. At higher temperatures, when closed circular DNA melts, it creates regions of positive supercoiling in which dsDNA is stabilized against further melting. Topoisomerase V can relax this positive superhelicity, i.e. decrease the linking number, and allow the DNA to melt further. At temperatures near TU (108°C under the conditions of Fig. 2), DNA can melt completely in the absence of positive supercoiling and the enzyme allows the singly linked molecule to be obtained. At still higher temperatures, a minimum amount of positive supercoiling is required for any duplex formation. Since dsDNA is the substrate for topoisomerase V, it cannot reduce the linking number below this minimum and such DNA migrates in the gel more slowly than the singly linked one. Our analysis of topoisomerase V activity suggests that positive superhelicity can stabilize the duplex form of DNA even at temperatures up to 122°C. Whether reverse gyrase can create sufficient superhelicity to stabilize genomic DNA in vivo at such high temperature remains unknown (28Kozyavkin S.A. Krah R. Gellert M. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Slesarev A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11081-11089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this represents a potential mechanism for maintaining the naked DNA duplex at extremely hot conditions. Construction of an in vitro system for unlinking of circular DNA at temperatures above 100°C makes it possible to start to identify those factors responsible for DNA stabilization inside hyperthermophiles. The ability of topoisomerase V to unlink DNA at high temperature may make it extremely useful for thermal cycling processes in which topological constraint inhibits normal enzymatic processes.

The mechanism whereby Mo-MuLV causes T lymphocyte leukemia or lymphoma after this long latent period is not well understood.

The trans-activation of specific cellular genes by the Mo-MuLV LTR is independent of the physical location of either element, occurring regardless of whether the LTR is integrated (endogenous) or transiently expressed (exogenous), or whether the responsive cellular gene is integrated or transiently expressed.

Hopkins N. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 158-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The U3 region of BL/VL3 viral LTR has the ability to induce cellular suppressor factors, and generate intracellular immunity against itself and other MuLVs (9Gorska-Flipot I. Huang M. Cantin M.

We report here that infection of Balb or HeLa cells with Mo-MuLV, or transfection with vectors expressing regions of the viral LTR, results in induction of transcription factor AP-1 activity, as assayed on electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). This activation of AP-1 results in increases in transcription of a number of cellular genes, including collagenase IV, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also called JE), and c-jun, all of which contain TRE (TPA responsive element) consensus sequences in their promoters. Subgenomic portions of the murine leukemia virus containing the LTR are sufficient to produce activation of transcription factor AP-1. The transient co-transfection of an LTR-expressing vector together with chimeric genes containing a collagenase promoter with an AP-1 binding consensus sequence driving the reporter gene CAT results in increases of CAT activity. Site-specific mutagenesis of this TRE binding site prevents binding of the LTR-induced complex and induction of the reporter gene. EMSAs performed in the presence of anti-Jun or anti-Fos Family antibodies demonstrate that the AP-1 complex induced by Mo-MuLV consists of Jun/Fos heterodimers. Balb/c-3T3 cells and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The mouse fibroblast Balb/c-3T3 cell line and the Moloney MuLV-infected Balb/c-3T3 cell line MoBalb (13Flyer D.C.

The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Sigma). HeLa cells stably infected with the pZip-Neo-SV(X) vector were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum, 0.5 mg of Geneticin/ml, and glutamine plus antibiotics as above. Geneticin and TPA were obtained from Sigma. Poly(dI-dC), acetyl-CoA, staurosporine, and okadaic acid were obtained from Sigma. [14C]Chloramphenicol was obtained from DuPont NEN. Total cellular RNA was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate/phenol RNA extraction (13Flyer D.C. Burakoff S.J. Faller D.V. Nature. 1983; 305: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), quantified, separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to BioBlot-supported nitrocellulose (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Hybridizations were carried out at 42°C in 50% formamide for 18 h. The filters were washed sequentially in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS and in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, at room temperature and at 42°C, respectively. Autoradiograms were scanned for quantitation, using an LKB laser densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). [α-32P]-Labeled DNA Probes-Purified fragments of c-jun, c-fos, MCP-1, collagenase IV, and β-actin cDNA were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primer synthesis (14Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). Murine β-actin, c-fos, and MCP-1 (JE) DNA probes have been described previously (15Mundschau L.J. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The c-jun probe was a 1.7-kb PstI fragment of murine c-jun, The c-fos fragment was a 1.1-kb EcoRI/SalI fragment of murine c-fos, and the MCP-1 probe was a 0.75-kb fragment of murine MCP-1 (JE). The collagenase IV probe was a 2.2-kb EcoRI fragment purchased from ATCC, and the actin probe was a 0.7-kb PstI fragment of murine β-actin. The collagenase IV RNA probe was made from pGEM T7 promoter using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Transient transfections were performed using the DEAE-dextran method (16Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at 3 × 106 the day before transfection. Five μg of CAT-containing reporter plasmids were transfected together with 5 μg of LTR vector or control plasmid. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with TPA at 25 ng/ml, and harvested for CAT assay 2 h later. Total cell extracts were made by the freeze-thaw method and the supernatants were used for CAT assay. The CAT activity was quantitated in extracts as described (17Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with the pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (0.5 μg/transfection) and cytofluorometric analysis of β-galactosidase activity were performed to normalize for the transfection efficiency, as described (3Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19691-19694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pZip-Neo-SV(X) is a vector developed and provided by C. Cepko (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), which contains the 5′ LTR of Mo-MuLV and 5′ genomic sequences up to base 739 (using the nucleotide numbering system of Shinnick (18Shinnick T.M. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.C. Nature. 1981; 293: 543Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar)), the 3′ region of Mo-MuLV from bases 7200 and including the 3′ LTR, and also Mo-MuLV bases from 5407 to 5766. In addition, this vector also contains the prokaryotic gene from transposon Tn5, which confers resistance to neomycin, the pBR322 origin of replication, and the SV40 origin of replication. For stable transfections, the retroviral vector pZip-Neo-SV(X) was transfected into a canine cell amphotropic packaging line (DAMP) and filtered supernatants containing packaged vector were used to infect Balb/c3T3 and HeLa cells. Neomycin-resistant colonies were selected and cloned. LTR-containing vectors pML4, pXF-MoA, and pGUXDP have been previously described and are shown in Fig. 1. pGUXDP has a deletion of 27 (nucleotide 96-122) and 75 base pairs (nucleotide 145-219) within the LTR U3 region (see Fig. 1). The vector pCollCAT-73 was the generous gift of P. Angel (19Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The MCP-1 promoter-CAT genes were the generous gift of A. J. van der Eb (20Timmers H.T.M. Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. van der Eb A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mutation of the AP-1-binding site in pCollCAT-73 to create the plasmid pmutcollCAT-73 was performed using two synthetic oligonucleotides of 18 bases in length, encompassing the HindIII site on pCollCAT-73 to the XbaI site at +74. The 5′ primer contained a complete HindIII site, and the 3′ primer contained a complete XbaI site. The fragment containing the mutation was generated by synthesizing two overlapping fragments, denaturing and then annealing. Complementary strands were synthesized from the overhangs of the two annealed fragments, and ligation and transformation of bacteria were carried out. The mutation was confirmed by chain termination DNA sequencing (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52232) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were isolated by the method of Andrews and Faller (22Andrews N.K. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed for 20 min on ice with 10 μg of total nuclear protein in 20 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 nM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide labeled with T4 kinase (Promega). The DNA-protein complexes were separated from the unbound probe on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR film for 18 h. The sequence of the AP-1 consensus binding site oligonucleotide was 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ and 3′-GCGAACTACTCAGTCGGCCTT-5′. The transversion mutant oligonucleotide used for competition experiments was 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTACGCCGGAA-3′ and 3′-GCGAACTACTCATGCGGCCTT-5′. The antibodies used in the EMSA, polyclonal rabbit antisera against all Jun family members, JunB and JunD, and polyclonal rabbit antibody against c-Fos, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA) or were the generous gifts of Dr. Thomas Rothstein. We have shown that stable infection of Balb/c-3T3 cells with Mo-MuLV (MoBalb cells) results in the induction of transcripts for specific cellular genes, including MCP-1 and collagenase IV, and an increase in their respective protein products (3Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19691-19694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).3( 2S.-Y. Choi and D. V. Faller, manuscript submitted for publication.) MCP-1 is known to be regulated by the transcription factor AP-1. The expression of two other genes also inducible by AP-1, collagenase IV, and c-jun, were also examined in MoBalb cells. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that transcript levels for collagenase IV were elevated 13-fold and transcript levels for c-jun were elevated 15-fold in cells containing the Mo-MuLV genome (not shown in Fig. 2). We have previously shown that the entire leukemia virus is not required for trans-activation of cellular genes, including MCP-1 (3Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19691-19694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine whether the Mo-MuLV LTR alone could activate collagenase IV and MCP-1, the packaged defective retroviral vector pZip-Neo-SV(X), which contains two LTRs but no structural viral sequences, was used to infect Balb cells. After neomycin selection, the resulting cells had two copies of the Mo-MuLV LTR stably integrated in their genomes. The expression of collagenase IV mRNA was elevated 14-fold in Balb/c-3T3 cells with integrated Mo-MuLV LTRs, compared to the expression of the control gene β-actin. Expression of MCP-1 mRNA was elevated 5-fold by the presence of the Mo-MuLV LTR (Fig. 2). Stable expression of the Mo-MuLV LTR into Balb cells resulted in over 60-fold increases in c-jun mRNA (Fig. 3). Induction of specific cellular gene transcripts by the Mo-MuLV LTR was not restricted to murine cells. Integration of the Mo-MuLV LTR into HeLa cells resulted in a 14.7-fold increase in c-jun mRNA levels (Fig. 3). In contrast, the levels of other gene transcripts, including c-fos, did not increase significantly in response to the Mo-MuLV LTR.Figure 3:RNA blot analysis of c-jun and c-fos transcripts in Balb and HeLa cells expressing the Mo-MuLV LTR. Total cellular RNA (20 μg) from Balb cells or HeLa cells untreated or stably infected with pZip-Neo-SV(X) was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized with labeled c-jun or c-fos probes, then stripped and reprobed for β-actin.

Chimeric plasmids containing 5′-flanking (regulatory) regions of the human collagenase IV gene or the MCP-1 gene ligated the chloramphenicol transferase (CAT) gene were used as reporters for LTR trans-activation. Plasmid pCollCAT-73 contains the 7-base pair (−73 to −67) TPA-responsive element (TRE), which constitutes a binding site for transcription factor AP-1 (19Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 23Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The plasmid pMCPCAT-2600 contains 2500 base pairs of 5′-regulatory sequence, including two putative AP-1 binding sites. The plasmid containing the provirus pMoV9 and the CAT reporter plasmids pCollCAT-73 or pMCPCAT-2600 were co-transfected into Balb/c-3T3 cells. The co-transfection of pMoV9 and pCollCAT-73 resulted in nearly 50-fold trans-activation of the CAT activity, and the co-transfection of pMoV9 and pMCPCAT-2600 resulted in 33-fold trans-activation of CAT activity (Fig. 4). The viral LTR alone was as potent as the entire proviral genome in inducing trans-activation of the collagenase promoter in transient expression assays. In experiments using pCollCAT-73 as reporter gene, CAT activity was increased over 10-fold when the plasmid pML4, containing a single LTR, was co-transfected (Fig. 5A). Reporter genes with mutations in the AP-1 binding site were employed to determine if this binding site was required for trans-activation by the viral LTR. The vectors pCollCAT-71, in which the first two bases of the TRE consensus site are deleted, and pmutcollCAT-73, which contains a transversion of the last two bases of the binding site (CA to AC) were used as reporter genes in co-transfections with the vector pML4. Co-transfection of the viral LTR did not result in trans-activation of CAT activity from these TRE-mutant promoters (Fig. 5, A and B). These experiments demonstrated that the TRE consensus site, which serves as binding site for transcription factor AP-1, was required for trans-activation by the LTR. To determine whether the presence of the LTR increased AP-1 binding activity in the cell, EMSAs for AP-1 DNA binding activity were performed using proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts incubated with a radiolabeled TRE consensus oligo. HeLa cell lines stably infected with a deleted retroviral vector containing two Mo-MuLV LTRs were also used for preparation of nuclear proteins. Cellular transcription factor AP-1 DNA binding activity was greatly augmented in the cells containing stably integrated Mo-MuLV LTRs (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). To demonstrate that this DNA binding activity to the TRE consensus oligo was specific, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled TRE consensus or mutant oligo was incubated with the nuclear extracts. The wild-type AP-1 binding site-containing oligo competed efficiently for binding activity (lanes 3 and 6), while the same amount of unlabeled mutated TRE-site oligo (CA to AC transversion) could not compete away the binding (lanes 4 and 7). As a control, TPA, a known activator of AP-1 DNA binding activity, was used to stimulate the HeLa cells (lane 5). The DNA binding complexes stimulated by both TPA and Mo-MuLV LTR showed similar patterns on EMSA, both complexes could be competed away by unlabeled wild-type AP-1 oligos, and neither of the complexes were competed away by incubation with the cold TRE-mutant oligo containing the CA to AC transversion (lanes 4 and 7). Because c-jun transcription was strongly induced by the LTR in the absence of increases in c-fos transcription, the components of the AP-1 complex induced by the LTR was investigated. Antibodies against Fos and Jun were preincubated with the nuclear extracts to examine whether the binding of the AP-1 complex in the nuclear extracts to the TRE oligo could be interfered with by the presence of the antibodies. The LTR-induced AP-1 DNA binding to the TRE probe was almost completely inhibited by the anti-pan-Jun antibody, while preincubation of the nuclear extracts with anti-JunB or anti-JunD did not result in any interference with AP-1 binding to the TRE-specific probe, suggesting that the LTR-induced AP-1 DNA binding complex contained c-Jun protein (Fig. 7, A and B). The ability of the anti-JunB or anti-JunD antibodies to interfere with the ability of their respective ligands to participate in AP-1 complex formation was demonstrated by their inhibition of AP-1 complex formation induced by TPA treatment (Fig. 7B). Preincubation of a polyclonal antibody against c-Fos with nuclear extracts from both HeLa cells treated with TPA and HeLa cells containing the stably integrated Mo-MuLV LTR induced a supershift on EMSA, indicating that c-Fos was also a component of the LTR-induced DNA binding complex (Fig. 7C). We have previously demonstrated that mutations of the LTR which prevent the generation of a polymerase III transcript from the LTR render it incapable of trans-activation of cellular genes (3Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19691-19694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 To determine the specificity of the induction of AP-1 activity by the Mo-MuLV LTR, wild-type and mutant LTRs were co-transfected into HeLa cells. Nuclear extracts were made from these transient transfectants and then tested for their ability to enhance AP-1 DNA binding activity. pXF-MoA, which contains the wild-type LTR, has been shown to strongly activate a co-transfected pCollCAT-73 vector (3Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19691-19694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 Plasmid pGUXDP, which contains an LTR with a mutation within the U3 region and does not generate a transcript, has been shown to have no trans-activating ability for MHC or MCP-1 genes (3Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19691-19694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extract made from pXF-MoA-transfected HeLa cells showed a 5-fold induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity, in comparison to extracts from control HeLa cells (Fig. 8). Nuclear extracts made from pGUXDP transfectants, however, demonstrated no trans-activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity. Thus, the trans-activation ability of the LTR correlates with the ability to activate AP-1 DNA binding activity. The expression of integrated, cellular AP-1 inducible genes could be induced by even transient expression of the Mo-MuLV LTR. Collagenase IV mRNA was elevated 8-fold in Balb cells transiently transfected with pMoV9, compared to cells transfected with a control plasmid not containing an LTR. The expression of the β-actin gene was unaffected (Fig. 9, lanes 1 and 2). As a control, treatment with TPA was also used to stimulate collagenase IV mRNA expression (Fig. 9, lane 3). These findings demonstrate again that induction of the expression of specific cellular genes by the MoMuLV LTR is independent of the location of either the LTR or the responsive gene. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine and the protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid have been reported to affect TPA induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity. To study the effect of staurosporine or okadaic acid on LTR induction of AP-1 activity, electrophoretic mobility shift assays for AP-1 binding activity were performed using HeLa cell nuclear extract incubated with a radiolabeled AP-1 consensus oligo. HeLa cell lines containing a stably integrated Mo-MuLV LTR (pZip-Neo-SV(X)) were also used for preparation of nuclear proteins. As expected, AP-1 DNA binding activity was greatly augmented in the cells containing an integrated Mo-MuLV LTR. After treatment with staurosporine for 6 h, however, the induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity by the LTR was reduced by 50% (Fig. 10A, lanes 2 and 3). Basal expression of the AP-1 complex in control cells not expressing the LTR was not affected by staurosporine (not shown). The TPA induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity was also reduced by 50% after the same treatment with staurosporine (Fig. 10A, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid increased basal expression and the enhanced induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity by the Mo-MuLV LTR (Fig. 10B, lanes 1 and 2). We have previously demonstrated that infection of human or murine cells with murine leukemia viruses rapidly increases the transcription and expression of a number of genes belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and involved in T-lymphocyte activation, including the Class I MHC antigens (1Flyer D.C.

Faller D.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2417-2425PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have reported that the LTR of Moloney murine leukemia virus encodes a trans-activator which induces transcription and expression of MHC Class I genes, T cell activation antigens, and certain cytokine genes. The portion of the LTR responsible for trans-activation was mapped by deletions to lie within the U3 region (3Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19691-19694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that a transcript is initiated by RNA polymerase III within the U3 region, and its presence correlates with the trans-activating activity.2 The studies reported herein confirm and extend these findings to another group of cellular genes, and define a transcription complex and cis-acting promoter element required for this trans-activation. Trans-activation of the distinct set of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-inducible genes by the Mo-MuLV LTR reported here is independent of the physical location of the genes or of the LTR, occurring whether the LTR is integrated in the genome or transiently expressed, and whether the responsive cellular genes or gene promoters are integrated or transiently expressed.

Photoaffinity labeling of this enzyme was saturable (half-maximal, 30 μM) and could be specifically inhibited by AZT, AZT monophosphate, thymidine, and thymidine monophosphate. Photolabeling of rat liver microsomal membranes was also done, and several membrane proteins that interact with AZT monophosphate were identified.

For the clinical treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and human herpesvirus infections, nucleoside-based compounds are the major drugs employed (1Herdewijn P. Antiviral Res. 1992; 19: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Due to the ability of these viruses to generate drug-resistant strains in humans, the development of new antiviral drugs and a basic biochemical and pharmacological understanding of their properties remains a critical priority in treating these infections (1Herdewijn P. Antiviral Res. 1992; 19: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Larder B.A. Darby G. Richman D.D. Science. 1989; 243: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 3Coen D.M. Antiviral Res. 1991; 15: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One way to achieve this is to understand the structural and catalytic properties of the target enzymes involved in the metabolism of these drugs. To aid in accomplishing this for HIV-related enzymes, we report the synthesis of a photoaffinity analog of 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (AZT).1( 1The abbreviations used are: AZT3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidineHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusAZddU3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyuridine5N3AZddU5-azido-3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyuridineTKthymidine kinaseHSVherpes simplex virusAZTMPAZT monophosphateTMPthymidine monophosphate5N3AZddUMP5N3AZddU monophosphateFAB-MSfast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy5N3dUMP5-azido-deoxyuridine monophosphate.) Nucleotide photoaffinity analogs of 2-azidopurines, 8-azidopurines, and 5-azidouridine derivatives have proven to be very useful in the identification and biochemical characterization of nucleotide-utilizing enzymes (4Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This photoaffinity approach has recently been applied to the study of wild-type and drug-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinases (TKs) using a TMP analog, 5-azido-deoxyuridine monophosphate (6Rechtin T.M.

Long term administration of AZT in patients with AIDS has led to bone marrow suppression and other cytoxic effects (7Fischl M.A Richman D.D. Grieco M.H. Gottlieb M.S. Volderbing P.A. Laskin O.L. Leedom J.M. Groopman J.E. Mildvan D. Schooley R.T. Jackson G.G. Durack D.T. Phil D. King D. AZT Collaborative Working GroupN. Engl. J.

Science. 1989; 243: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). It has been frequently observed that AZT administration results in a large intracellular accumulation of AZT monophosphate (AZTMP) in lymphocytes, presumbably due to the low affinity of AZTMP for TMP kinase (8Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. St. Clair M.H. Weinhold K. Rideout J.L. Freeman G.A. Lehrman S.N. Bolognesi D.P. Broder S. Mitsuya H. Barry D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8333-8337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Besides the effects on the inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase activity (8Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. St. Clair M.H. Weinhold K. Rideout J.L. Freeman G.A. Lehrman S.N. Bolognesi D.P. Broder S. Mitsuya H. Barry D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8333-8337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), this accumulation of AZTMP has recently been linked to the inhibition of several viral and cellular enzymes and processes. Addition of AZTMP has been shown to inhibit UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transport in Chinese hamster ovary-derived Golgi membranes, which explained an observed decrease in protein glycosylation in AZT-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Hall E.T. Yan J.-P Melancon P. Kuchta R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AZTMP has also been reported to inhibit HIV integrase activity and may be implicated in potential HIV integrase mutations in AZT-resistant HIV strains (10Mazumder A. Cooney D. Agbaria R. Gupta M. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5771-5775Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Additionally, the effects of AZTMP on associated mitochondrial toxicities and inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ are poorly understood but are likely to contribute to AZT-associated myopathies (11Dalakas M.C. Illa I. Pezeshkpour G.H. Laukaitas J.P. Cohen B. Griffin J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1098-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 12Lewis W. Gonzalez B. Chomyn A. Papoian T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As an aid to characterizing the effects of AZT on the inhibition of HIV replication and its role in cellular toxicities, we report the synthesis of 5-azido-3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyuridine (5N3AZddU), a potential photoaffinity analog of AZT and other structurally related nucleoside drugs. The effects of 5N3AZddU on HIV-1 replication in a human T cell line are reported, and the photoaffinity properties of the monophosphate derivative (5N3AZddUMP) are described using HSV-1 thymidine kinase and rat liver microsomal membranes. Solvents, reagents, and AZT were purchased from Aldrich and Sigma. 3′-Azido-2′,3′-dideoxyuridine (AZddU) was synthesized as described previously (13Lin T.S. Mancini W.R. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The HIV strain I391-4 was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, AIDS Program, NIAID, NIH; from Dr. Douglas Richman (14Gingeras T.R. Prodanovich P. Latimer T. Guatelli J.C. Richman D.C. Barringer K.J. J. Infect Dis. 1991; 164: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Melting points were obtained on a Thomas-Hoover capillary apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a General Electric 300-MHz spectrometer using Me2SO-d6 as the solvent and internal standard. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 475 spectrophotometer, and UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1201 spectrophotometer. FAB-MS analyses were performed on a Kratos M50 with a fast atom bombardment ionization probe in thioglycerol by Dr. Jackson O. Lay (National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR). TLC was done on Whatman F254 silica gel plates, and 70-270 mesh silica gel was used for silica gel chromatography. A solution of 3′-β-O-methanesulfonyl-5′-O-trityl-2′-dideoxyuridine (1, 350 mg, 0.64 mmol) prepared as described previously (13Lin T.S. Mancini W.R. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was dissolved in 10 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, and NOBF4 (370 mg, 3.2 mmol) was added at room temperature for 10 min. The nitration reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of H2O. The reaction solution was poured into ice water with stirring, and the resulting precipitate was filtered and dried. An analytical sample was obtained as a crystallization from CH3OH/H2O (325 mg, 85%). UV λmax (CH3OH) 302 nm (pH 1), 322 nm (pH 12); 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) 2.50-2.70 (m, 2H, 2′-H), 3.22 (s, 3H, CH3SO2O), 3.55-3.75 (m, 2H, 5′-H), 4.32 (m, 1H, 4′-H), 5.31 (m, 1H, 3′-H), 6.10 (m, 1H, 1′-H), 7.10-7.48 (m, 15H, trityl), 9.45 (s, 1H, 6-H), and 12.10 (s, 1H, 3-NH, D2O exchangeable); m.p. 114-117°C. Compound 2 (500 mg, 0.84 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of CH3OH, followed by the addition of 10 ml of 0.3 M HCl and 4 g of granular zinc. The reaction solution was stirred until the UV absorbance of the sample indicated a λmax of 264 (pH 1) or 290 nm (pH 12). The product solution was separated from the zinc metal and neutralized with NH4OH (yields 70-84%). UV λmax (CH3OH) 264 nm (pH 1), 290 nm (pH 12); 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) 6.95 (s, 1H, 6-H); m.p. 123-126°C. A mixture of compound 3 (320 mg, 0.57 mmol) and lithium azide (170 mg, 3.4 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (15 ml) was heated at 85-90°C for 1.5 h. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to dryness. The pure product was obtained by silica gel chromatography using ethyl acetate/benzene (1:1) as an eluent (220 mg, 76%). UV λmax (CH3OH) 264 nm (pH 1) and 290 nm (pH 12); m.p. 89-92°C. A suspension of compound 4 (280 mg, 0.55 mmol) in 5 ml of 80% acetic acid was heated at 85-90°C for 30 min, after which the solution was evaporated in vacuo to a solid. The product was purified by silica gel chromatography using chloroform/methanol (4:1) as an eluent (120 mg, 82%). UV (aqueous) λmax 264 nm (pH 1), 290 nm (pH 12); IR (KBr) 2090 cm−1 (azido); 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) 4.35 (m, 1H, 3′-H) and 6.95 (s, 1H, 6-H); FAB-MS 269 (M+1). Compound 5 (100 mg, 0.37 mmol) in 2 ml of 2 N HCl was stirred at 0°C for 15 min. A diazonium intermediate was generated by the addition of NaNO2 (34 mg, 0.49 mmol). After stirring for 2 min at O°C, 4 ml of 4 M NaN3 was added with rapid stirring. The reaction was stirred for 5 min at O°C and for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction solution was neutralized with NH4OH and concentrated under reduced pressure. The product was purified by silica gel chromatography using chloroform/methanol (4:1) as an eluent (89 mg, 82%). UV (CH3OH) λmax 287 nm (disappears after UV photolysis); 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) 2.50-2.70 (m, 2H, 2′-H), 3.55-3.75 (m, 2H, 5′-H), 3.82 (m, 1H, 4′-H), 4.38 (m, 1H, 3′-H), 5.40 (s, 1H, 5′-OH), 6.10 (m, 1H, 1′-H), 7.82 (s, 1H, 6-H); IR (KBr) 2100-2000 cm−1 (azido); FAB-MS 333 (M+K) m.p. 63-66°C. Synthesis of [32P]5-Azido-3′azido-2′,3′-dideoxyuridine monophosphate-Partially purified HSV-1 thymidine kinase (10 μg), 0.5 μmol 5N3AZddU, 40 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/μmol, ICN Biomedicals) in a total of 0.15 ml was incubated at 37°C for 20 min (6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ATP (2 μmol) was added for 5 min prior to column purification. The resulting [32P]5N3AZddUMP was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously for other 5-azidouridine nucleotides (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). [32P]5N3dUMP was synthesized as described previously (6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For photolabeling studies of HSV-1 TK, 10 μg of DE-52 purified TK (6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 40 mM KCl was incubated with the indicated concentration of [α-32P]5N3AZddUMP for 10 s. The sample was then irradiated for 90 s with a hand-held UV lamp (254 nm UVP-11, Ultraviolet Products, Inc.) at a distance of 3 cm. For competition experiments, varying concentrations of non-radiolabeled competitors were incubated in the reaction mixture for 20 s prior to the addition of photoprobe. All reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 10 min, and pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The protein was resuspended in a solublization mixture and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Dried gels were autoradiographed for 0.5-3 days. The intensity of the bands corresponding to TK on the autoradiographs were determined by laser densitometry (Bio-Rad model GS-670 imaging densitometer). Rat liver microsomes were prepared as described previously (15Drake R.R. Igari Y. Lester R. Elbein A.D. Radominska A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity reactions included rat liver microsomal membranes (120 μg), 30 μM [α-32P]5N3AZddUMP, 60 mM HEPES, pH 6.5, 3 mM MgCl2, and 3 mM saccharolactone in 50 μl. Photoirradiation and analysis of the samples were similar to that described above for HSV-1 TK and also have been previously described (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Drake R.R. Igari Y. Lester R. Elbein A.D. Radominska A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytotoxic effects of the compounds on uninfected cells were determined by incubation of H9 cells with drug concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 μM. The concentration of drug required to kill 50% of the H9 cells (CD50) was determined using a soluble tetrazolium dye, Alamar blue, as directed by the manufacturer (Alamar, Sacramento, CA). For anti-HIV assays, H9 cells (3 × 106) grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum were infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB or strain I391-4 (14Gingeras T.R. Prodanovich P. Latimer T. Guatelli J.C. Richman D.C. Barringer K.J. J. Infect Dis. 1991; 164: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) at a p24 concentration of 5 × 105 pg/ml (16Moyer M.P. Gendelman H.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and treated with different concentrations of drug (0.1-5.0 μM). The levels of HIV replication were determined by harvesting supernatants at 4, 8, and 12 days postinfection using HIV-p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate assays according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Incstar, Stillwater, MD). The general protocol for the synthesis of 5-azidouridine nucleotides has been a C-5 nitration reaction, reduction to the 5-amine, followed by a sodium azide exchange reaction via a diazonium ion intermediate (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Evans R.K. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To obtain the desired 5N3AZddU target compound (6), this same general synthetic strategy was used in combination with protocols commonly used for the synthesis of anti-HIV 3′-azido-nucleoside compounds (13Lin T.S. Mancini W.R. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as outlined in Fig. 1. The presence of the 3′ and 5′ azido groups of 5N3AZddU was confirmed by IR spectra. Each 5-substituted compound also had the characteristic loss of the H-5 signal and the doublet to singlet conversion at H-6 by 1H NMR. The UV spectrum of 5N3AZddU (λmax = 287 nm) is characteristic of a 5-azidouridine compound (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, UV irradiation of this derivative leads to a loss in absorbance and is indicative of a photoreactive 5-azidouridine group (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Evans R.K. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). FAB-MS analysis was necessary to confirm the final products due to instability of the 3′- and 5-azides in solid form. Maximal stability of these compounds was obtained by storing them at −20°C in methanol.Figure 2:UV Spectrum of 5-azido-3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyuridine. The UV spectrum of 5N3AZddU was determined (-UV) (0.06 μmol) followed by irradiation of the compound for 60 s with a 254 nm UVS-11 lamp and another recording (+UV).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The metabolism of AZT to the pharmacologically active AZT-triphosphate requires an initial phosphorylation by cytosolic thymidine kinase, followed by an apparent rate-limiting phosphorylation step by thymidylate kinase (8Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. St. Clair M.H. Weinhold K. Rideout J.L. Freeman G.A. Lehrman S.N. Bolognesi D.P. Broder S. Mitsuya H. Barry D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8333-8337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). To study these enzyme activities and demonstrate the use of 5N3AZddU as a photoaffinity analog, the multifunctional HSV-1 thymidine kinase was used. This enzyme has been previously studied with azido-nucleotide photoprobes (6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and it is known to possess distinct thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase activities (18Chen M.S. Walker J. Prusoff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10747-10753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, AZT has been previously shown to be a substrate of this enzyme (19Black M.E. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11618-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, a [32P]5N3AZddUMP photoprobe was synthesized following incubation of HSV-1 TK, 5N3AZddU, and [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Materials and Methods.” It has been previously reported that the thymidine and TMP sites overlap and are shared in HSV-1 TK with nucleosides having higher affinity than nucleotide monophosphates (18Chen M.S. Walker J. Prusoff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10747-10753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was also observed with studies using HSV-1 TK and the photoreactive TMP analog, 5N3dUMP (6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects that varying concentrations of thymidine, TMP, AZT, and AZTMP had on photoincorporation of [32P]5N3AZddUMP into HSV-1 TK were determined as shown in Fig. 3(A and B). The concentration of inhibitor required to reduce photoincorporation by 50% (ICP50) was determined to be 7 μM for AZT and 80 μM for AZTMP (Fig. 3B). As expected if this photolabeling was active site-directed (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), saturation of photoincorporation was observed with increasing concentrations of [32P]5N3AZddUMP (half-maximal, 30 μM) as shown in Fig. 3C. In a previous study using [32P]5N3dUMP and HSV-1 TK, half-maximal saturation of photoincorporation of this analog was 6 μM, and the ICP50 values for thymidine and TMP were 1.5 and 12.5 μM, respectively (6Rechtin T.M. Black M.E. Mao F. Lewis M.L. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7055-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thymidine and TMP had similar inhibitory effects on [32P]5N3AZddUMP photoincorporation into HSV-1 TK (Fig. 3A). For comparison, the inhibitory effects that AZT and AZTMP had on photoincorporation of [32P]5N3dUMP are presented in Fig. 3D. The derived ICP50 values of 0.7 μM for AZT and 130 μM for AZTMP (from Fig. 3D) indicate that AZT is an effective inhibitor of HSV-1 TK photolabeling with [32P]5N3dUMP or [32P]5N3AZddUMP, although AZTMP has relatively poor affinity for the TMP site of HSV-1 TK. A previous report has indicated that AZTMP can inhibit UDP-GlcNAc transport in Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Hall E.T. Yan J.-P Melancon P. Kuchta R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we have also been interested in the transport of UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-glucose in rat liver microsomal membranes (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Drake R.R. Igari Y. Lester R. Elbein A.D. Radominska A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), [32P]5N3AZddUMP was used to photolabel rat liver microsomes in the presence of different competing nucleotides and UDP-sugars (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4(lane 1), a protein of 130 kDa was photolabeled with [32P]5N3AZddUMP and was competively inhibited by 0.2 mM AZTMP (lane 4). Because one mechanism for UDP-sugar translocation is UMP antiport (20Bossuyt X. Blanckaert N. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the effects of UMP and UDP-sugars on photoincorporation of [32P]5N3AZddUMP into the 130-kDa protein were examined. The presence of UMP completely inhibited photolabeling of the 130-kDa protein, whereas the presence of 0.2 mM UDP-Glc (lane 6) or 0.2 mM UDP-GlcNAc (lane 8) led to a 3-fold reduction in [32P]5N3AZddUMP photoincorporation. For comparison, the same rat liver microsomes were photolabeled with the UDP-glucuronic acid analog, [32P]5N3UDP-GlcUA, as described previously (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Drake R.R. Igari Y. Lester R. Elbein A.D. Radominska A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4(lane 10), photolabeling with [32P]5N3UDP-GlcUA resulted in photoincorporation of the 130-kDa protein, and, as previously reported, the 50-54-kDa UDP-glucuronosyltransferases were involved in liver detoxification reactions (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Drake R.R. Igari Y. Lester R. Elbein A.D. Radominska A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [32P]5N3AZddUMP also photolabeled a 50-kDa protein (lane 1) that was competively inhibited by AZTMP (lanes 4 and 5). Because AZT is known to be glucuronidated in human liver microsomes by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (21Zhu Z. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Williams G.J. Colby C.B. Sommadossi J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 929-938PubMed Google Scholar), photolabeling of the 50-kDA protein by [32P]5N3AZddUMP may indicate that this analog can be used to study the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases involved in AZT detoxification. The photoaffinity data suggest that 5N3AZddUMP is mimicking AZTMP in isolated enzyme systems. An important question to answer was whether 5N3AZddU could mimic AZT or its uridine equivalent AZddU (22Lin T.S. Guo J.Y. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Xiang J.N. Prusoff W.H. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Doshi K.J. Gallo J.M. Boudinot F.D. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1989; 17: 590-594PubMed Google Scholar) in HIV-infected cells. Structurally, 5N3AZddU could potentially mimic AZT or AZddU as an anti-HIV compound. For comparative purposes, the anti-HIV effects of AZT, AZddU, and 5N3AZddU were determined in the human T lymphocyte-derived H9 cell line infected with HIV-1 strains IIIB and I391-4 (a strain shown to have intermediate resistance to AZT (14Gingeras T.R. Prodanovich P. Latimer T. Guatelli J.C. Richman D.C. Barringer K.J. J. Infect Dis. 1991; 164: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). The degree of inhibition was assayed using HIV p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates. At the titers tested, only low levels of HIV replication were detected at days 4 and 8 postinfection, even in the absence of drugs (data not shown). Therefore, a representative result determined at 1 μM concentrations of each compound at 12 days postinfection is described in Table I. Under these conditions, 5N3AZddU was 53- and 10-fold less effective than AZT at inhibiting HIV-IIIB and HIV-I391-4 replication, respectively. When compared with AZddU, 5N3AZddU was 10-fold less effective at inhibition of HIV-IIIB replication, although it was better than AZddU for inhibition of HIV-I391-4 replication. 5N3AZddU, AZT, and AZddU had few cytotoxic effects on H9 cells at concentrations up to 300 μM. The anti-HIV-1 properties and cellular metabolism of 5N3AZddU are currently being further characterized, but these initial studies suggest that 5N3AZddU can mimic the metabolism of AZT and AZddU in HIV-1-infected cells.Table IComparison of cytotoxic and antiviral activities of AZT, AZddU, and 5N3AZddU The possible detrimental clinical effects of long term administration of AZT in patients infected with HIV-1 are now becoming clear. However, the underlying biochemical and cellular causes of these effects are largely uncharacterized. In this report, we have demonstrated that the photoaffinity analogs 5N3AZddU and [32P]5N3AZddUMP mimic the biological activities of AZT and AZTMP and validate a new approach to characterizing nucleoside/nucleotide drug metabolizing enzymes. As a model drug-metabolizing enzyme, we have used HSV-1 TK for several reasons. Because it possesses both thymidine and thymidylate kinase activities, two reactions that are critical in AZT metabolism, characterization of [32P]5N3AZddUMP photolabeling of HSV-1 TK indicates the utility of this approach for studying the cellular TKs and thymidylate kinases. As shown in Fig. 3, AZTMP has a poor affinity for HSV-1 TK, similar to that reported for AZTMP and cellular thymidylate kinase (8Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. St. Clair M.H. Weinhold K. Rideout J.L. Freeman G.A. Lehrman S.N. Bolognesi D.P. Broder S. Mitsuya H. Barry D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8333-8337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Determination of the HSV-1 TK amino acids covalently cross-linked with [32P]5N3AZddUMP may aid in defining the molecular basis for the weak affinity of thymidylate kinases for AZTMP. Additionally, HSV-1 TK is being widely used as a toxin gene in combination with ganciclovir for gene therapy approaches to treating glioma and other cancers (24Ram Z. Culver K.W. Walbridge S. Blaese R.M. Oldfield E.H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 83-88PubMed Google Scholar, 25Culver K.W. Blaese R.M. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 174-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated in T cells transfected with HSV-1 TK that the addition of acyclovir leads to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication (26Caruso M. Klatzmann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The process of HSV-1 TK expression in lymphocytes and its effect on nucleotide and AZT metabolism is poorly understood, and it is currently being studied with the aid of 5N3AZddU and related photoaffinity analogs. Photolabeling of the rat liver microsomes with [32P]5N3AZddUMP led to the identification of a 130-kDa protein that was specifically labeled. Because this photolabeling was inhibited by UMP, the proposed antiport molecule of some UDP-sugar translocators (20Bossuyt X. Blanckaert N. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), this may indicate a role for this 130-kDa protein in UDP-sugar translocation in the microsomal membranes. Using [32P]5N3AZddUMP to photolabel microsomes prepared from the human T lymphocyte H9 cell line, a similar protein of 130-kDa mass was identified with similar photolabeling inhibition properties by competing nucleotides (data not shown). We are currently characterizing the inhibition properties of AZT and AZTMP on the inhibition of UDP-glucuronic acid transport and other UDP-sugars in rat liver and H9 microsomes. Combined with the UDP-sugar photoaffinity analogs (5Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), these studies suggest that [32P]5N3AZddUMP could be utilized to identify putative UDP-sugar transporters and other membrane-associated enzymes that interact with AZTMP. One of the original purposes of this study was to determine whether 5N3AZddU had anti-HIV activity comparable with AZT or similar thymidine analogs, and, if it did, could it be used to study cellular and viral enzymes involved in nucleoside drug metabolism? At least in the human T lymphocyte cell line used in this study, the cytotoxicity effects of 5N3AZddU were no different than AZT of AZddU. Regarding inhibition of HIV replication, the results presented in Table I confirmed our hypothesis in that 5N3AZddU does effectively inhibit HIV-1 replication at micromolar concentrations, although at 10-50-fold higher concentrations than clinically characterized drugs like AZddU and AZT. Because the HIV p24 antigen assay used did not permit rigorous characterization of 5N3AZddU metabolism as it relates to key features of viral replication, additional studies using HIV reverse transcriptase assays and isolation of metabolites in HIV-infected cells are currently in progress.
