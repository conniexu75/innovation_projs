The procedure described leads to the isolation of polymerase that is homogeneous by ultracentrifuge analysis and is free of detectable ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease activities. Other enzyme activities that have been found to be absent from such preparations include inorganic pyrophosphatase, nucleoside diphosphokinase, DNA polymerase, nucleoside triphosphatase, polynucleotide phosphorylase, and polyriboadenylate polymerase. 2. Under the conditions used, the enzyme showed a single moving boundary of an s20,w of approximately 11 S in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Molecular weight determined by the sedimentation equilibrium method is approximately 370,000. The amino acid composition of the enzyme has been determined. 3. Once RNA synthesis has started from a template, subsequent addition of another variety of DNA hardly displaces the enzyme from the initial enzyme-DNA complex. 4. The enzyme does not catalyze pyrophosphorolysis of free RNA. In contrast, small but detectable pyrophosphorolysis of RNA from RNA-DNA hybrids has been demonstrated. 5. It has been calculated that there are approximately 1200 molecules of RNA polymerase per E. coli cell. This amount can account for the synthesis of only 10% of the total cellular RNA."

Hypophysectomy abolishes the response to sodium depletion, whereas whole pituitary gland injections partially restore it. The response cannot be restored by injections of either adrenocorticotropin or growth hormone, nor by adrenocorticotropin plus thyroxin. The pituitary gland must secrete a hormone or possibly several hormones which are necessary for the adrenal gland to respond to sodium depletion."

https://openalex.org/W1639044722,"Abstract Specific S- and N-acetylations of the protein by two model substrates, acetyl phosphate and P-nitrophenyl acetate, have been related to the catalytic activity of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase in the following manner. 1. DPN facilitates the S-acetylation of the dehydrogenase with acetyl phosphate but inhibits the reaction with p-nitrophenyl acetate. 2. The S-acetyl enzyme compound is more labile at pH 7.0 than simple thioesters such as S-acetyl glutathione or S-acetyl coenzyme A. Denaturation increases the stability of the S-acetyl enzyme, suggesting that labilizing groups such as histidine have been removed from the active center. 3. In the presence of DPN the S-acetyl enzyme is rapidly deacylated by transfer of the acyl group to Pi or arsenate. Neither DPN nor Pi alone induces this rapid deacylation. 4. At pH 8.5, a specific lysine residue is acetylated by an S-N transfer reaction. The N-acetyl group is enzymatically inert in that it cannot be removed by addition of DPN and Pi or arsenate. 5. The lysine moiety is not readily acetylated in the presence of DPN, and conversely the N-acetylated enzyme binds less DPN. This suggests that the lysine moiety is involved in the coenzyme-enzyme interaction. 6. A number of experiments involving S-N transfer and dual acetylation of both the cysteine and lysine residues indicates that the S and N sites are in close proximity, although not near neighbors on a peptide chain. 7. The above observations have been fitted into a general proposal for the mechanism of catalysis by this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1552254328,"Abstract The spectroscopic measurements of the kinetics and spectra of the enzyme-diphosphopyridine nucleotide compound of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from yeast have been described. A total of 3.5 moles of diphosphopyridine nucleotide are bound to the enzyme (molecular weight, 145,000) as determined by spectrophotometric measurements and direct titration. The ΔE370 on adding diphosphopyridine nucleotide to the enzyme in phosphate buffer is 4.9 cm-1 mm-1. A temperature-dependent enhancement of diphosphopyridine nucleotide binding by phosphate and arsenate was observed. Bicarbonate counteracts the effects of these anions. The inequality of the diphosphopyridine nucleotide binding sites is indicated by the biphasic kinetics for compound formation, differential reactivity to paramercuribenzoate or acetyl phosphate, and selective reactivity in the over-all oxidation reaction. With the use of special spectroscopic techniques it has been possible to measure simultaneously the formation of the enzyme-diphosphopyridine nucleotide compound and the formation of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide in the overall oxidation of glyceraldehyde and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. These studies indicate that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate facilitates diphosphopyridine nucleotide binding and that only a small fraction of the total enzyme-diphosphopyridine nucleotide compound could be involved in the oxidation reaction. The major portion of the enzyme-coenzyme complex has kinetic patterns which are incompatible with the possibility that the compound is an active intermediate in the catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1505659597,"Abstract The potassium-activated, pyridine nucleotide-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase from yeast has been purified to the stage of homogeneity as judged by ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has been crystallized, although this is not a recommended step in purification because loss of catalytic activity is thereby incurred. At least three separable, active fractions were obtained with the large-scale purification procedure presented in this report. However, only one major fraction was found when precautions were taken to minimize proteolysis. The purified aldehyde dehydrogenase has a molecular weight of 200,000."

The destruction of homologous cells induced by lymphocytes is similar to the primary cytopathic effect in virus diseases. Nuclei of immune lymphocytes proved to exert the same destructive effect on target cells as that of intact immune lymphocytes2,3."

The reductive pathway, which yields 4-hydroxylaminoquinoline-l-oxide (4HAQO), was thought to be essential for its carcinogenic mechanism2,3. There have been reports of the interaction of 4NQO or 4HAQO with DNA in vitro4–6 and in vivo7. This communication deals with the correlation between carcinogenicity and in vivo interaction with DNA by 4NQO derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W2092086621,"The foot-and-mouth disease virus RNA polymerase complex was dissociated from cellular membranes with deoxycholate in the presence of dextran sulfate. The soluble polymerase complex was active in the cell-free synthesis of virus-specific RNA; solubilization of the complex permitted direct analysis of the cell-free reaction mixtures without recourse to RNA extraction. A major RNA-containing component found early during cell-free incubation ranged from approximately 140 to 300S. The final major products of the cell-free system were 37S virus RNA, 20S ribonuclease-resistant RNA, and a 50S component containing RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1482575527,"Abstract Sections of the main electric organ of Electrophorus were stimulated electrically to elicit a discharge, and slices were cut by a rapid sampling guillotine during and after different times of discharge. Kinetic measurements of adenine nucleotides, creatine phosphate, and inorganic phosphate showed that a disappearance of creatine phosphate occurred within a few seconds of the onset of discharge. The levels of ATP were maintained approximately constant by the high activity of creatine phosphokinase, and marked increases of ADP and AMP were not observed until after the end of a 60-sec discharge period, when the creatine phosphate reserves were depleted. Phosphofructokinase activity, as depicted by changes in the phosphofructokinase mass action ratio [fructose-di-P x ADP/fructose-6-P x ATP], increased during discharge but showed a further large but transient increase during recovery, especially after discharge times greater than 40 sec. The initial activation of phosphofructokinase was caused by the early rise of inorganic phosphate, but thereafter the change of the phosphofructokinase mass action ratio followed closely the changes of ADP and AMP. The results show that the duration and magnitude of the increased glycolytic flux after electric discharge of the organ are controlled by the rapid activation and deactivation of phosphofructokinase, which is turned on and off by feedback from the energy-utilizing reactions of the sodium pump."

We have described a system in which growing bacteria in glass capillaries filled with nutrient agar are counted as the capillaries move through a narrow beam of light. Increased counts after incubation indicate the presence of viable organisms in the original sample; the equipment can detect colonies when they grow to a diameter of 8 microm. Aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative organisms can grow in the capillary environment. The sensitivities of several organisms to antibiotics were determined by adding antibiotics to the agar before the capillaries were filled."

https://openalex.org/W2042994688,"Synthetic phylloquinone was resolved into cis and trans isomers by thin-layer chromatography. The two isomers had identical ultraviolet spectra characteristic of vitamin K(1) and were differentiated by nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy on the basis of the displacement of the peak corresponding to the olefinic methyl group in the naphthoquinone side chain. Studies on the restoration of electron transport coupled to phosphorylation in irradiated preparations of Mycobacterium phlei showed that only the trans isomer was active with substrates linked to nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide. The purified trans phylloquinone was enzymatically converted to the cis isomer. Under similar conditions, cis vitamin K(1) gave rise to the trans-naphthoquinone. The natural naphthoquinone of M. phlei vitamin MK(9)(II-H) was similarly resolved into cis and trans isomers."
