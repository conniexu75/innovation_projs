To identify substrates for ATM and the related kinases ATR and DNA-PK, we optimized in vitro kinase assays and developed a rapid peptide screening method to determine general phosphorylation consensus sequences. ATM and ATR require Mn2+, but not DNA ends or Ku proteins, for optimal in vitro activity while DNA-PKCs requires Mg2+, DNA ends, and Ku proteins. From p53 peptide mutagenesis analysis, we found that the sequence S/TQ is a minimal essential requirement for all three kinases. In addition, hydrophobic amino acids and negatively charged amino acids immediately NH2-terminal to serine or threonine are positive determinants and positively charged amino acids in the region are negative determinants for substrate phosphorylation. We determined a general phosphorylation consensus sequence for ATM and identified putative in vitro targets by using glutathioneS-transferase peptides as substrates. Putative ATM in vitro targets include p95/nibrin, Mre11, Brca1, Rad17, PTS, WRN, and ATM (S440) itself. Brca2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and DNA-5B peptides were phosphorylated specifically by ATR, and DNA Ligase IV is a specific in vitro substrate of DNA-PK.

Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Cells derived from AT patients exhibit a variety of abnormal responses to ionizing irradiation (IR), such as checkpoint alterations in the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle and radiosensitivity with increased chromosomal breakage and telomere fusions (2Morgan S.E.

The G1 checkpoint abnormality results from a quantitative defect in p53 induction (4Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J.

The gene that is mutated in AT, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated), encodes a 370-kDa protein with a carboxyl-terminal sequence homologous to the catalytic domain of phosphotidylinositol 3-kinases (7Hunter T.

A family of gene products with similar sizes and sequences has been identified, including the yeast proteins rad3p, Mec1p, Tel1p, Tor1p, Tor2, and the mammalian proteins mTor/FRAP, DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase), ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related kinase) and TRAP (7Hunter T.

In mammalian cells, ATR and DNA-PK also appear to be involved in DNA-damage response pathways (15Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 16Zakian V.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 685-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 17Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). For example, several lines of evidence suggest primary roles of DNA-PK are in DNA-repair and V(D)J recombination (17Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). ATR is considered the mammalian counterpart of yeast rad3 and Mec1p, two proteins involved in DNA damage responses (18Carr A.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We had previously demonstrated that ATM deficiency results in suboptimal increases in p53 protein levels after IR and that ATM is required for optimal IR-induced (but not UV-induced) phosphorylation of serine 15 of p53 protein (4Kastan M.B.

Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The ability to express the full-length ATM cDNA in mammalian cells and construction of a kinase-dead ATM mutant led to the demonstration that ATM is abona fide protein kinase that is capable of phosphorylating serine 15 of p53 protein (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IR and the DNA strand-breaking agent, neocarzinostatin, but not UV irradiation, enhances the specific activity of the ATM kinase (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a model in which ATM acts as a kinase upstream of p53 in the response of mammalian cells to DNA strand breakage. However, p53 dysfunction cannot account for the majority of the phenotypic abnormalities in AT patients and AT cells (2Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, radiation sensitivity and the defects in S phase and G2/M checkpoint control in response to IR in A-T appear to be independent of the p53 regulation by ATM (2Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell.

Given the pleiotropic features of AT and the apparent cell-type specificity in subcellular localization of ATM, we were interested in identifying additional physiologic substrates for the ATM kinase. In order to better understand the kinase, we first examined cofactor requirements for optimal ATM kinase activity and compared these requirements to those of the related mammalian protein kinases, ATR and DNA-PK. Subsequently, we compared and contrasted the in vitro substrate sequence specificity of these three kinases using GST-linked peptides and mutagenesis analysis. A general consensus motif for ATM was thus developed and several new putative substrates were identified from protein data base searches. Putative targets identified included Brca1, Rad17, PTS, and p95 (nibrin). Thus, characterization of the ATM kinase and elucidation of in vitro targets will lead to further insights into ATM function and AT biology. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. GM0536 lymphoblast cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 15% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method. For GST fusion peptide expression vectors, complementary oligonucleotides encoding desired peptides (14 amino acids) were cloned into theBamHI/SmaI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digests and DNA sequencing. The GST peptides were expressed in BL2/(CDE3). After isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactoside induction for 3 h (1 mm final concentration), GST peptide fusion proteins was recovered by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0. Eluted protein pools were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated by Centricon-10 (Amicon Co.). In vitro kinase assays for ATM and ATR were performed as described earlier (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were prepared from 293T cells which had been transfected with 10 Î¼g of either ATM or ATR by resuspending cells in modified TGN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 Ã protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cleared supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma) and protein A/G-agarose, the beads were washed with TGN buffer followed by TGN buffer plus 0.5 mLiCl, and two washes with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmMnCl2). Finally, the immunoprecipitant was resuspended in 50 Î¼l of kinase buffer containing 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP and 1 Î¼g of GST fusion substrate. The kinase reaction was conducted at 30 Â°C for 20 min and stopped by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoprecipitated Flag-ATM or Flag-ATR was confirmed by Western blotting with Î±-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized and quantitated on PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In some reactions, either supercoiled (pBluescript II KS, Stratagene) or linearized DNA (pBluescript II KS cut with EcoRI) was added. For endogenous ATM kinase reactions, endogenous ATM was immunoprecipitated with ATM monoclonal antibody (D16.11) in M buffer (phosphate-buffered slaine, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Ã protease inhibitor mixture). After washing with M buffer and kinase buffer,in vitro kinase reactions were carried out according to procedures described above. The purified DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 were generous gifts from Dr. S. Yoo and Dr. W. S. Dynan, Medical College of Georgia. The DNA-PK in vitro kinase reaction was performed as described previously (25Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate potentially distinctive biochemical properties of the ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK kinases, we examined the cofactor requirements for their optimal activities. It had been previously reported that ATM and ATR required exogenous Mn2+ for optimal in vitrokinase activity (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). In contrast, DNA-PK has been reported to require Mg2+ as well as the presence of DNA ends and the DNA-binding proteins Ku70 and Ku80 for optimal activity (25Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). However, since ATM specific activity increases in cells following exposure to ionizing radiation (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) or introduction of double strand DNA breaks (21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), it was possible that ATM or ATR kinase activities are enhanced by the presence of DNA ends and that this dependence was absent in ourin vitro assays. For example, it was conceivable that the use of Mn2+ in these assays decreased the dependence of ATM and ATR on DNA ends. Conversely, it was conceivable that the requirement of the use of DNA ends and/or Ku proteins in DNA-PK activity assays abrogated a need for Mn2+ addition in thesein vitro assays. In order to test these possible scenarios, in vitro kinase assays with all three enzymes were performed using epitope-tagged ATM and ATR immunoprecipitated from transfected cells and biochemically purified DNA-PK as the kinase sources and GST-p53 (1â101) recombinant protein as a substrate. Kinase-inactive forms of ATM and ATR were used as controls in the assay to ensure that these activities were intrinsic. ATM and ATR kinases were dependent on the addition of exogenous Mn2+ (Fig. 1 A), while DNA-PK activity was not altered by the addition of Mn2+ (Fig. 1 D). The addition of supercoiled or linearized DNA to these reactions did not alter the activity of ATM or ATR, but consistent with previous observations (25Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), the double strand DNA ends provided by linearized DNA significantly enhanced the activity of DNA-PK (Fig. 1 B). The addition of either of these exogenous DNA sources did not relieve the dependence of ATM and ATR on exogenous Mn2+ (data not shown). It remained theoretically possible that these overexpressed ATM and ATR proteins had different cofactor requirements than would be seen for the normal endogenous proteins because of changes in molar ratios of ATM/ATR and cofactors. In addition, it was possible that immunoprecipitated ATM/ATR could be already contaminated with DNA or might have lost cofactors such as Ku proteins during immunoprecipitation. Therefore we re-examined both the Mn2+dependence and DNA-end dependence using endogenous ATM. In order to circumvent the concerns about potential loss of cofactors or prior DNA contamination, we also immunoprecipitated the endogenous ATM under very mild conditions without stringent washing (0.5 mLiCl2) and assessed the kinase activity either in the presence of added linearized DNA or with the addition of ethidium bromide, a DNA intercalator which is known to interfere with protein-DNA interaction (26Schroter H. Maier G. Ponstingl H. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3867-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The activity of endogenous ATM was still dependent on the addition of exogenous Mn2+ and neither the exogenous addition of DNA ends nor the presence of ethidium bromide to inactivate potential contamination from endogenous DNA had any effect on its activity (Fig. 1 C). DNA-PK activity is enhanced by the presence of DNA ends via Ku-dependent association with the DNA and Mn2+is not required for its activity in in vitro kinase assay (25Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). To further clarify potential distinctions between ATM/ATR and DNA-PK and to rule out the possibility that Mn2+ might replace the requirement of DNA-PK activity for DNA ends or for the Ku70/80 cofactors, the in vitro activities of purified DNA-PKcs or DNA-PK holoenzyme containing Ku components were re-examined. Although DNA-PKcs alone has a basal level of activity toward GST-p53 (1â101), this activity was not enhanced by the addition of either Mn2+ or DNA ends (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, the activity of the DNA-PK holoenzyme was remarkably enhanced by DNA ends (approximately 10 times of basal level) and the addition of Mn2+ had no effect on the DNA-PK activity either in the presence or absence of exogenous DNA. Thus, ATM and ATR kinases are distinguishable in vitro from DNA-PK in their lack of dependence on DNA ends and their requirement for Mn2+ for optimal activity. Studies on other kinases have suggested that the nature and sequence of the amino acids surrounding the target phosphorylation site can play a critical role in modulating recognition of a substrate by a kinase (28Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We wished to clarify amino acids that affect the ability of ATM to phosphorylate a substrate and to then use this information to try to identify other physiologic substrates. Short peptide sequences containing target amino acids have commonly been used as in vitro substrates for kinases. We had previously found that linkage of a short peptide sequence to a GST tag provided a betterin vitro substrate for ATM than a short peptide alone (data not shown). This approach also provided an easy way to generate and purify the peptide of interest. Thus, beginning with the known in vivo and in vitro target, serine 15 in p53, we attempted to determine which amino acids surrounding Ser-15 in p53 were important modulators of phosphorylation by ATM. Wild type and mutated GST-conjugated p53 peptides containing 14 amino acids surrounding Ser-15 were generated and used as in vitro kinase substrates for ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK. Changes in some of the amino acids surrounding serine 15 had a dramatic effect on the ability of these kinases to phosphorylate the GST-p53 peptides, while others had little effect (Fig. 2, A and B). For example, peptides in which glutamine at position 16 was replaced with alanine, glycine, or asparagine were very poor substrates for all three of these kinases. Thus, as has previously been reported for DNA-PK (29Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), this result suggests that a glutamine adjacent to the target serine is also critical for substrate recognition by ATM and ATR. When the target serine at position 15 was mutated into threonine, the amount of phosphorylation was reduced to 13, 53, and 36% compared with the wild-type sequence for ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK, respectively. Thus, all three kinases appear to have a preference for phosphorylating serine over threonine. All three kinases poorly phosphorylated peptides with the substitutions Asp-12, Arg-12, Lys-12, Lys-13, Lys-14, and Arg-14, while the Gln-12, Ala-12, Ala-13, Ala-14, Gln-14, and Asp-14 peptides were efficiently phosphorylated. These results indicate that hydrophobic amino acids at positions Nâ3 and Nâ1 and negatively charged amino acids at Nâ1 are positive determinants for substrate recognition by these kinases. In contrast, positively charged residues (Lys-11, Lys-12, Arg-12, Lys-13, Lys-14, Arg-14, Lys-17, and Lys-19) surrounding the SQ appear to have a significant negative influence on substrate phosphorylation. Although many of the amino acid substitutions had similar effects on all three of these kinases, some of the target manipulations resulted in differential effects. Peptides with Gln-10, Lys-17, Leu-17 substitutions remained relatively good substrates for ATM and ATR, but were very poor substrates for DNA-PK (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that the positions Nâ5 and N+2 are more important for substrate recognition by DNA-PK than for ATM and ATR. Most of the amino acid substitutions had similar effects on ATM and ATR, although the substitutions Ala-12, Ala-13, Gln-14, and Asp-14 appeared to result in differential quantitative effects on in vitro ATM and ATR activity (Fig. 2). One exception to this was the virtual abrogation of ATM activity by valine substitution for leucine at Nâ1 with no obvious affect on ATR activity (data not shown). Thus, ATM, but not ATR, may discriminate between valine and other hydrophobic amino acids at the position Nâ1. Further validation of this putative general consensus target sequence for ATM came from examination of a previously reportedin vitro substrate for ATM, PhasI (21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). An amino acid sequence around Ser-94 in PhasI contains hydrophobic amino acids at Nâ3 and Nâ1 as well as an SQ motif. As predicted, a GST-Ser-94 PhasI peptide proved to be an excellent in vitro substrate for ATM (Fig. 3). From the above results, we defined (P/L/I/M)X(L/I/D/E)SQ as a preliminary phosphorylation site motif of ATM for screening of putative substrates. Using the preliminary consensus sequence generated from the p53 Ser-15 peptide mutational analysis and the Ser-94 sequence of PhasI, we searched a protein data base for potential ATM substrates. Since the occurrence of this motif is not uncommon, many potential targets were identified. We initially evaluated the ability of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK to phosphorylate the peptide sequences of 36 proteins (Table I), many of which were chosen because of potential physiological relevance to the AT phenotype. Only a fraction of the peptides tested were highly phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 3). These included Rad17, p95, Mre11, Brca1, PhasI, WRN, ATM (Ser-440, a potential autophosphorylation site), and a recently cloned sequence localized to an LOH site on chromosome 3p21.3 (which we call PTS for âputative tumor suppressorâ). Using ATM kinase-inactive form as a negative control, we confirmed that the phosphorylations of these substrates are intrinsic (data not shown). Since some peptides containing sequences which fit the general consensus sequence were not phosphorylated, other amino acid sequence determinants must also be involved in determining the substrate specificity for the ATM kinase and continued characterization of these substrates should allow further refinement of the recognition sequence.Table IAmino acid sequences and relative phosphorylation by ATM kinase family members of the GST peptides tested in Fig. 3Accession numberProtein nameAmino acid sequencesSerine No.Relative phosphorylationATMATRDNA-PK%p04637p53SVEPPLSQETFSDL15100100100p53VLSPLPSQAMDDLM37931132NP_0040864EBP1 (PhasI)EPPMEASQSHLRNS94786610NP_002476p95TPGPSLSQGVSVDE343193145p49959Mre11(SQ1)QQLFYISQPGSSVV264204810Mre11(SQ2)FSVLRFSQKFVDRV386<117<1Mre11(SQ3)RARALRSQSEESAS531<113<1Mre11(SQ4)SASRGGSQRGRAFK590<1NDaND, not determined.NDMre11(SQ5)SSSKIMSQSQVSKG648<1NDNDNP_001265Chk1(SQ1)NVKYSSSQPEPRTG31714582Chk1(SQ2)VQGISFSQPTCPDH345117320AAC36334Rad17(SQ1)TWSLPLSQDSASEL6468173397Rad17(SQ2)ASELPASQPQPFSA65691106525AF091214Wrn (SQ1)TIGMHLSQAVKAGC129210335AF091214Wrn (SQ2)EKAYSSSQPVISAQ1141254914U76308ATRTVEPIISQLVTVLL1333<110<1X16416c-AblYPGIDLSQVYELLE446<18<1NP_000042ATMPLLMILSQLLPQQR44033557ATMYKVVPLSQRSGVLE2761322<1Z46973PIâ3KDLLMYLSQLVQALK397<1150<1U64105p115-RhoGEFRLRPLLSQLGGNSV899<115<1L13939Î²-AdaptinCRAPEVSQHVYQAY9355222U43746Brca2KVSPYLSQFQQDKQ2156<1132<1M81735DNA PoL-Î´LPCLEISQSVTGFG717<117<1U87269p120E4FAPEPPVSQELPCSR35511302U14680Brca1(SQ1)SASLFSSQCSELED12982386Brca1(SQ2)DCSGLSSQSDILTT1387423536Brca1(SQ3)SSEYPISQNPEGLS146683312L07590PP2ALLHIPVSQFKDADL61<134<1D79987Cut1GASPVLSQGVDPRS16159205AF040703PTS (123F2)WETPDLSQAEIEQK611114033X63071DNA 5BQPEPPVSQSEISEP72314515X83441DNA LIG-IVDLKLGVSQQTIFSV13253648U24186RPA34kD (SQ1)FPAPAPSQAEKKSR33<15<1RPA34kD (SQ2)IVPCTISQLLSATL52<131<1RPA34kD (SQ3)TGNVEISQVTIVGI72<18<1U81504Î²3A adaptinELKPVLSQG109262244U72066CtIPDPGADLSQYKMDVT66412122a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab We also tested the ability of DNA-PK and ATR to phosphorylate these GST peptides and several distinctions between substrates recognized by these three kinases were apparent in the assays (Fig. 3). In general, ATM and ATR tended to recognize the same substrates, although quantitative differences were apparent in most cases. For example, even though ATR appears to be a much weaker kinase than ATM for most substrates tested (â¼10â20-fold lower activity), ATR exhibited greater activity than ATM for two sites in Rad17 and also demonstrated good activity against sites from Brca2 and DNA-5B. The latter two peptides were very poor substrates for both ATM and DNA-PK and the second SQ in Rad17 was not a good substrate for DNA-PK (Fig. 3). Conversely, peptides containing sequences from ligase IV and the region surrounding Ser-37 of p53 were highly phosphorylated by DNA-PK, but were not good substrates for ATM. From these approaches, we have developed a preliminary consensus target sequence which is recognized by ATM and we have identified a group of proteins containing goodin vitro target sites for ATM which warrant further investigation as potential valid in vivo targets of ATM (Fig. 4). Identification of physiologic substrates for cellular kinases is a daunting, but critically important, aspect of understanding biological processes. It had previously been demonstrated that p53 protein is a physiologic target of the ATM kinase (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), but most of the physiologic abnormalities in AT patients and AT cells are not attributable to defects in signaling to p53. Thus, it is clear that there must be other physiologic targets of this kinase. Building upon our previous work (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), we clarified the optimal conditions forin vitro measurements of ATM kinase activity. These experiments demonstrated significant differences in the co-factor requirements of ATM and ATR compared with the related kinase, DNA-PK. In particular, ATM and ATR require Mn2+, but not DNA ends or Ku proteins, for optimal in vitro activity while DNA-PKcs requires Mg2+, DNA ends, and Ku proteins. Optimization ofin vitro conditions to evaluate these three kinases allows us to then use these in vitro assays for initial screening of potential physiologic targets of these enzymes. To determine a phosphorylation consensus motif and identify new putative substrates of kinases, we developed a GST peptide screening method which allows us to easily make a lot of peptides to test. There are several advantages to the method we used. First, it appears that the GST peptides are much better than small synthetic peptides asin vitro substrates and it is easier and less expensive to make the oligonucleotides and clone them into the GST plasmid than to synthesize every peptide of interest. Second, easy alteration of the sequence of the oligonucleotides attached to the GST linker allows us to quickly and easily define a general consensus target motif and simultaneously identify the putative phosphorylation site for each target. Third, comparing the abilities of the three related kinases to phosphorylate each of these substrates in vitro can provide unexpected clues about how they differ in in vivo function and provides potential distinctions between the enzymes if inhibitors of these kinases are to be developed. As examples of insights which were not predictable a priori, our in vitro data suggests that Rad17 may be a physiologic substrate for ATR and not DNA-PK and that ligase IV may be a physiologic substrate for DNA-PK and not ATM or ATR. This latter possibility is particularly intriguing because of the recently described role for ligase IV in V(D)J recombination events that also involve DNA-PK (30Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J.M. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H.L. Davidson L. Kangaloo L. Alt F.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Building upon the preliminary consensus target sequence for ATM generated from the p53 Ser-15 mutagenesis work, we were then able to identify some new potential substrates for ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK including Rad17, Brca1, Brca2 p95, PTS, PhasI, WRN, DNA-5B, and ligase IV. These targets represented the first screen of potential substrates and additional proteins with reasonable ATM target sites are continuing to be evaluated. It should be noted that the consensus target sequences we characterized should be considered as guidelines rather than concrete rules. However, it does appear that glutamine at position N+1 appears is absolutely required for activity of this kinase family and that nearby hydrophobic amino acids, especially at positions Nâ3 and Nâ1, are important determinants. It is noted that since substitution of threonine for serine had only a quantitative effect on phosphorylation by all three enzymes, it is entirely conceivable that threonine could replace serine as the targeted amino acid in certain protein targets. AT, with mutations in the ATM gene, and NBS, with mutations in the p95/nibrin gene, share many phenotypic abnormalities, including chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity, and defects in cell cycle checkpoints in response to IR (31Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 32Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R622-R625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that ATM phosphorylates a p95 peptide (Ser-343) and a Mre11 peptide (Ser-264) in vitro, suggesting that ATM may regulate the function of p95Â·Mre11Â· Rad50 repair complex in response to DNA damage. Other potential targets that we identified in our screens such as Brca1, could uncover other roles for ATM in DNA repair processes. Patients with heterozygous germline mutations in theBRCA1 gene have a markedly increased risk of developing breast cancer (33Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K.

Additionally, it appears that Brca1 participates both in transcription as a transcription factor and DNA repair through association with Rad51/Brca2 (39Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D.

It is noteworthy that Brca1 can form foci with the p95Â·Mre11Â·Rad50 complex after ionizing radiation and formation of these foci is dramatically reduced in HCC1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in Brca1 (41Zhong Q.

The function of the mammalian Rad17 protein is currently unknown, but data from yeast implicate this protein in DNA damage checkpoint control (42Bao S. Shen X. Shen K. Liu Y. Wang X.F.

Elucidation of whether this is a physiologic target of either the ATM or ATR kinases may shed additional light on regulation of mammalian DNA repair processes. Finally, since ATM kinase activity is enhanced by DNA breakage (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D.

This in vitro peptide screening method will prove most useful if it results in the identification of valid in vivotargets of these kinases. Several of the peptide substrates described above have been further evaluated as large peptides (greater than 100 amino acids). A number of these larger peptides remained excellentin vitro substrates, including the sites identified in Rad17, Brca1, and p95 (data not shown). The putative target site in p95 has been further demonstrated to be a valid in vivo target of the ATM kinase. 2D-S. Lim, Kim, S. T., Xu, B., Maser, R. S., Lin, J., Petrini, J. H. J., and Kastan, M.

This demonstrates that the screening approach elucidated herein can identify valid kinase targets and follow-up in vivo studies of thesein vitro targets may identify further bona fidetargets of this kinase family. Such studies would provide invaluable insights into understanding AT and signaling pathways that potentially involve ATM and related kinases. We thank Dr. T. M.

https://openalex.org/W1562122315,"The hormone insulin is stored in secretory granules and released from the pancreatic Î²-cells by exocytosis1. In the consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, ATP is generated by mitochondrial metabolism, promoting closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, which depolarizes the plasma membrane2,3. Subsequently, opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) which constitutes the main trigger initiating insulin exocytosis1,3,4. Nevertheless, the Ca2+ signal alone is not sufficient for sustained secretion. Furthermore, glucose elicits a secretory response under conditions of clamped, elevated [Ca2+]c (refs 5, 6). A mitochondrial messenger must therefore exist which is distinct from ATP7,8. We have now identified this as glutamate. We show that glucose generates glutamate from Î²-cell mitochondria. A membrane-permeant glutamate analogue sensitizes the glucose-evoked secretory response, acting downstream of mitochondrial metabolism. In permeabilized cells, under conditions of fixed [Ca2+]c, added glutamate directly stimulates insulin exocytosis, independently of mitochondrial function. Glutamate uptake by the secretory granules is likely to be involved, as inhibitors of vesicular glutamate transport suppress the glutamate-evoked exocytosis. These results demonstrate that glutamate acts as an intracellular messenger that couples glucose metabolism to insulin secretion."

TheEscherichia coli ZntR protein, a homologue of MerR, has recently been shown to mediate Zn(II)-responsive regulation ofzntA, a gene involved in Zn(II) detoxification. To determine whether the MerR DNA distortion mechanism is conserved among MerR family members, we have purified ZntR to homogeneity and shown that it is a zinc receptor that is necessary and sufficient to stimulate Zn-responsive transcription at the zntA promoter. Biochemical, DNA footprinting, and in vitro transcription assays indicate that apo-ZntR binds in the atypical 20-base pair spacer region of the promoter and distorts the DNA in a manner that is similar to apo-MerR. The addition of Zn(II) to ZntR converts it to a transcriptional activator protein that introduces changes in the DNA conformation. These changes apparently make the promoter a better substrate for RNA polymerase. We propose that this zinc-sensing homologue of MerR restructures the target promoter in a manner similar to that of other stress-responsive transcription factors.

However, like many transition elements, zinc is also harmful at elevated concentrations. Zinc starvation and zinc toxicity both lead to transcription of a number of recently characterized Escherichia coli genes that encode Zn(II) uptake or export proteins. The znuABC operon in E. coli encodes three proteins involved in Zn(II) uptake (1Patzer S.I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Thezur gene, which encodes a zinc-responsive homologue of the Fur (ferric uptake regulation) protein, mediates regulation of this operon. When Zn(II) levels in the media fall to a critical point, Zur is proposed to de-repress transcription of the znuABCoperon. In contrast, when Zn(II) levels in the cell are too high, a separate Zn(II) efflux system is activated. In this system, thezntR gene has been shown to be essential for Zn-induced expression of the zinc-exporter, ZntA (2Brocklehurst K.R. Hobman J.L. Lawley B. Blank L. Marshall S.J. Brown N.L. Morby A.P.

Several mechanisms for stress-responsive transcriptional control are known in microbial systems (6Dai X. Rothman-Denes L.B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), however few have been established at the molecular level for essential metals such as zinc. Only a handful of Zn(II)-responsive metalloregulatory proteins have been identified in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems (7O'Halloran T.V.

We investigated this question using tools developed to probe the regulatory mechanism of MerR. Suboptimal spacing (19 bp) between the â35 and â10 promoter elements is a key feature of the merT promoter (PT) regulated by MerR (30Lund P. Brown N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5517-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is at the heart of the DNA distortion mechanism. Promoters regulated by members of the MerR family typically have spacer elements longer than the consensus length of 17 bp which makes them poor substrates for RNA polymerase (RNAP) (31deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record Jr., M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MerR controls transcription of the mer genes while bound to the spacer region at a palindrome located between the â35 and â10 sites of PT (21O'Halloran T. Walsh C. Science. 1987; 235: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Several members of the MerR family are also known to bind in the spacer regions of their target promoters, including SoxR (32Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Amabile Cuevas C.F. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), TipAL (33Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Thompson C.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3183-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), BmrR (34Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Mta (35Baranova N.N. Danchin A. Neyfakh A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the MerR DNA distortion mechanism, the transition from repression to activation involves several alterations in the local DNA structure. A series of specific distortions are proposed to make the promoter a more optimal substrate for RNAP (Fig. 1) (24Frantz B. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4747-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Ansari A.Z. Chael M.L. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1992; 355: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 37Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Evidence for these conformational changes comes from both physical studies and comparison of nuclease cleavage patterns for repressed and activated states of the MerRÂ·DNA complex. The DNase I cleavage pattern observed for the MerRÂ·DNA complex is very similar to that observed for the CAPÂ·DNA complex (37Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Inspection of the CAPÂ·DNA complex crystal structure reveals that sites of cleavage are immediately 3â² to the DNA distortion sites. These distortion sites are two 40Â° kinks in the DNA which widen the exposed minor groove and bend the DNA toward the CAP protein (37Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). These results led to a model in which apo-MerR bends the DNA toward itself, producing two kinks in the DNA structure that appear as hypersensitive bands within the protected region in DNase I footprinting experiments (see Fig. 1 A). Addition of Hg(II) to MerR relieves these bends at the two kink sites, resulting in a loss of the DNase I hypersensitive bands. This model was corroborated by phase bend studies that confirmed bending of the DNA toward the protein for apo-MerR and a relaxation of these bends by Hg-MerR (37Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Studies of E. coli RNAP with MerR and the meroperator further corroborate this mechanism. RNAP is able to bind to the â35 site of PT with apo-MerR bound, however the â10 site remains inaccessible (22O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). RNAP binds adjacent to apo-MerR in this closed complex. In the DNA distortion mechanism, Hg(II) binding to MerR leads to underwinding of the DNA (36Ansari A.Z. Chael M.L. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1992; 355: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), resulting in a Cu-OP hypersensitive site at the center of the operator (24Frantz B. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4747-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In vivo methylation and permanganate footprinting are also consistent with a change in the conformation of the RNAPÂ·MerR complex (39Heltzel A. Lee I.W. Totis P.A. Summers A.O. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9572-9584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One effect of this underwinding, which is different from unbending, is to bring the â35 and â10 sites into proper alignment for RNAP binding to both simultaneously so that transcription can proceed (Fig. 1 B). The underwinding may also facilitate the energetics of strand separation, a requisite step in open complex formation (37Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, underwinding and the relaxation of bending act together to remodel the promoter, making it a better substrate for RNAP and dramatically increasing the transcription initiation rate (28Ansari A.Z. O'Halloran T.V. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 369-386Google Scholar). In order to delineate which mechanistic aspects are conserved among MerR family members (40Hidalgo E. Ding H. Demple B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1544-1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have examined the mechanism that ZntR employs in transcriptional regulation of zntA. Protein/DNA footprinting and in vivo transcriptional assays reveal that, like MerR, ZntR functions primarily as a transcriptional activator, but it only weakly, if at all, represses expression of the zntAgene. Our results are consistent with a ZntR mechanism in which a series of MerR-like DNA unbending and underwinding steps restructure the promoter, allowing efficient transcription of zntA. All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard procedures (44Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and all cloning was carried out in the E. coli strain DH5Î±. The zntR gene was cloned from the E. coli chromosome using the primers ZntR N-terminal (5â²-CTA GTG GAG TAC ATA TGT ATC GCA TTG G-3â²) and ZntR C-terminal (5â²-GTA ATC CTG CGG ATC CAA AAA ATC AAC AAC C-3â²). The 461-bp PCR fragment was digested with NdeI andBamHI and inserted into pET11c (Novagen) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting overexpression plasmid (pET11cZntR) was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The cells were grown in 9 liters of Luria Bertani broth with shaking at 37 Â°C and induced with 400 Î¼m IPTG at A 600 = 0.6. The cells were harvested by centrifugation 2.5 h after IPTG induction and then stored at â80 Â°C. The pelleted cells were frozen and thawed three times (45Johnson B.H. Hecht M.H. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and then resuspended in 250 ml of Tris buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the protein in the supernatant was precipitated with 45% (NH4)2SO4. The precipitated protein was then resuspended in 10 ml of Tris buffer A and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. The crude protein extract was subsequently loaded onto a Heparin column equilibrated with Tris buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT). Following elution with a NaCl gradient, the protein fractions were collected and (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 1.2 m. The protein was then loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose High Performance hydrophobic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Tris buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm DTT). The protein was eluted with a decreasing salt gradient, coming off at 0.5â0.3 m(NH4)2SO4, and the protein-containing fractions were concentrated to 2 ml. As a final purification step, the protein was loaded onto a High Load Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Tris buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT). The ZntR fractions were concentrated to â¼1â2 ml and showed a single band on overloaded SDS-PAGE gels. Protein was stored at â80 Â°C in Tris buffer D with 5% glycerol. The molecular mass of ZntR (calculated: 16179.3 Da with first Met) was found by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (PerSpective Biosystems Voyager-DE) to be 16178.1 Da using a sinapinic acid matrix with myoglobin as the calibration standard. A calculated extinction coefficient for the apo-protein (6700 1/M) at 280 nm (46Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 6 m guanidine-HCl was used to standardize the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The Bradford assay was found to overestimate the ZntR concentration by 2.65 when using IgG as the standard. With this correction factor, protein concentrations were routinely determined by the Bradford assay. Metal concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). To prepare Zn-ZntR, 2â4 equivalents of ZnSO4 was added to 10â20 Î¼m ZntR in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1â2 mm DTT in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell. The solution was stirred at 4 Â°C for 30 min and then washed three times with buffer to remove excess metal. Zn-ZntR was also prepared under anaerobic conditions in a glove box. The ultrafiltration method was the same as the aerobic procedures, however the buffer used was 50 mmphosphate, pH 7.8, with no thiol reductant. The zntA promoter was cloned from the E. coli chromosome using the primers Znt1 (5-GCG CTC TCT GAA TTC GTT GGC GCT TC-3â²) and Znt2 (5-GCC ATC ATC AGG ATC CGC GTA ATC AGC G-3â²). The 644-bp fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and inserted into pUC19 (New England Biolabs) digested with the same enzymes creating pUC19Znt. Two more primers (Zntfoot1â5â²-GCT GCG CAA CTG TTG GGA AGG GC-3â² and Zntfoot2â5â²-GAG AGA GTT GGC GCC CGG GAA CAT GCG-3â²) were then used for PCR with pUC19Znt to clone out a smaller portion of the promoter. The 486-bp PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI andAvaI and inserted into pUC19 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pUC19Zntfoot, was used for labeling in the footprinting assays. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially dividing cells of strain DH5Î± using the Qiagen RNeasy RNA isolation kit. Cells induced with zinc were exposed to 1 mmZnSO4 for 1 h prior to RNA isolation. Primer ZntA:PE1 (5â²-GCT TTC TTG CCG TGA TTG TCA GG-3â²), labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), was used with 10 Î¼g of total RNA for primer extension analysis. Primer and RNA were heated to 65 Â°C for 5 min, quenched on ice, added to a reaction mixture of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs), and placed at 42 Â°C for 1 h. Sequencing of pUC19Znt was carried out using labeled primer ZntA:PE1 as directed in the CircumVent Thermal Cycle Dideoxy DNA Sequencing Kit (New England Biolabs). Primer extension and sequencing samples were run together on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea, 1.2Ã TBE sequencing gel. To label the non-template strand of the promoter, pUC19Zntfoot was digested withBamHI, labeled with [Î±-32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and then digested with EcoRI. To label the template strand, the fragment was digested first with EcoRI, labeled, and then digested second with BamHI. In each case, the labeled fragments were purified by gel electrophoresis. DNase I footprinting reactions were carried out in 50 Î¼l of footprinting buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 100 mm K-glutamate, 1 mmDTT, 100 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 Î¼g/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1 Î¼m TPEN, 5% glycerol). Labeled DNA, ZntR, ZnSO4, and RNAP were added to the reaction mixture in sequential order with a 5-min incubation at 37 Â°C after each addition. The mixture was then incubated for 30 min at 37 Â°C before DNase I digestion. The dinucleotide initiator UpA (100 Î¼m) and ATP, GTP, and UTP (10 Î¼m) were added 15 min before DNase I digestion. All RNAP complexes were also challenged with heparin (50 Î¼g/ml) prior to DNase I digestion. 2.5 Î¼l of 20 nm DNase I was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate for 1 min at 37 Â°C. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 175 Î¼l of DNase I stop solution (560 mm NH4OAc, 30 Î¼g/ml yeast tRNA, 86% EtOH) and then was precipitated on dry ice for > 30 min. The pellets were washed with 70% EtOH, dried under vacuum, and then resuspended in loading buffer (0.5Ã TBE, 80% formamide, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, 0.05% bromphenol blue). The samples were loaded onto a 7% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 m urea and 1.2Ã TBE. The same DNA fragment was also cleaved in a Maxam-Gilbert guanine-specific reaction (44Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for use as a DNA sequence ladder. After drying, the gel was applied to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The signals were digitized and analyzed using the ImageQuant Version 1.2 program (Molecular Dynamics). KMnO4footprinting reactions were carried out in 20 Î¼l of footprinting buffer minus salmon sperm DNA and glycerol and with 0.5 mmDTT instead of 1 mm. Incubation times were the same as described above for DNase I footprinting. RNAP complexes were challenged with 50 Î¼g/ml heparin before the addition of KMnO4. The KMnO4 procedures are the same as described previously (22O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Phenylphenanthroline footprinting procedures were the same as described previously with a few modifications (24Frantz B. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4747-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in 20 Î¼l of footprinting buffer minus salmon sperm DNA and with 1 mm mercaptopropionic acid instead of DTT. Incubation times were the same as described above for DNase I footprinting. Ten microliters of 10 mmCuSO4 and 10 Î¼l of 10 mm5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline were mixed together and immediately diluted to 400 Î¼l with H2O. One microliter of the diluted Cu-phenanthroline mixture and 1 Î¼l of 100 mmmercaptopropionic acid were added to the protein/DNA solution and incubated for 4â5 min at room temperature. One microliter of 56 mm 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline was added, and the mixture was incubated for 4â5 min longer. Three microliters of 3m NaOAc and 60 Î¼l of EtOH were added to the reaction, and the DNA was precipitated on dry ice > 30 min. Preparation and electrophoresis of the precipitated DNA are the same as described above for DNase I footprinting. Transcription template was prepared using the (â48) and (â47) pUC sequencing primers (New England Biolabs) and the plasmid pUC19Zntfoot. To label the template, [Î±-32P]dATP was incorporated into the DNA fragment during the PCR reaction. The PCR fragment was then digested with BbvI to make a 171-bp fragment, gel purified, and quantitated by comparison with DNA standards stained with ethidium bromide. Transcription run-off experiments were carried out in 20 Î¼l of chelexed footprinting buffer minus salmon sperm DNA. The TPEN concentration was 10 Î¼m rather than 1 Î¼m as used in the footprinting assays. Procedures were the same as described previously (22O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Two nanomolar labeled DNA was used in the reaction rather than 4â6 nm, 5 Î¼Ci of [Î±-32P]UTP was used rather than 10 Î¼Ci, and the reaction was terminated with 200 Î¼l of stop buffer (10 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 100 Î¼g/ml RNA) prior to phenol-chloroform extraction. The samples were loaded onto the same type of sequencing gel used in the footprinting assays, and the signals were digitized in the same manner as the footprinting gels. RNA levels in each lane were determined relative to the lanes with RNAP alone, whereas the labeled DNA was used to normalize the DNA loading for each lane. The Zn titration transcription results were fitted to a sigmoidal function using the Igor Pro Version 2.04 software program (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Fig. 2 shows an SDS-PAGE gel of different steps in the ZntR purification process. A 9 liter prep typically yielded â¼180 mg of pure protein. The purified protein was found by ICP-AES to contain less that 0.05 Zn/monomer and less than 0.05 Cu/monomer. Zn-ZntR was easily prepared by adding excess Zn(II) to ZntR in aerobic buffer containing DTT. The protein was found to bind 0.9 Â± 0.3 Zn/monomer. In aerobic buffer without DTT present, the complex was unstable and precipitated. In anaerobic conditions with 2 equivalents of Zn added but no DTT present, the protein bound 2.1 Â± 0.4 Zn/monomer. To map the start of transcription and determine the approximate location of essential promoter elements, primer extension analysis of the zntA transcript was carried out (Fig. 3). While Brocklehurst et al. (2Brocklehurst K.R. Hobman J.L. Lawley B. Blank L. Marshall S.J. Brown N.L. Morby A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) have recently reported a primer extension analysis ofzntA, in our hands, the start of transcription appears to occur one base 5â² to the previously reported result. We find that thezntA start of transcription mapped to a T rather than an A (see Fig. 3 and Ref. 2Brocklehurst K.R. Hobman J.L. Lawley B. Blank L. Marshall S.J. Brown N.L. Morby A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The previous primer extension results were presumably obtained using a temperature of 37 Â°C for the reverse transcription reaction (44Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) while our reverse transcription was carried out at 42 Â°C to reduce possible secondary structure that can abort termination of the cDNA before reaching the 5â² end of the transcript. Possibly, this temperature difference results in a slightly truncated primer extension product at 37 Â°C as compared with 42 Â°C. Alternatively, there may be two different transcripts formed upon induction of zntA. We did observe a slightly shorter primer extension product in a faint band below the primary product (Fig. 3 and other data not shown). Resolution of these competing hypotheses awaits further experimentation. A transcription start site at the T shown in Fig. 3 is consistently observed in our experiments. The footprinting results for both strands of PzntA are shown in Fig. 4. On the template s"

To investigate the precise role of lipocortin 1 in regulating the lipopolysaccharide-induced signal transduction pathways, we generated stable RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines expressing decreased and increased lipocortin 1 protein. Several RAW 264.7 clones with increased lipocortin 1 protein levels showed constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which was down-regulated following lipopolysaccharide treatment. Conversely, clones with decreased lipocortin 1 protein expression showed prolonged extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, following lipopolysaccharide activation. Lipocortin 1 specifically regulates the components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, since changes in lipocortin 1 protein expression had no affect on the related mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Lipocortin 1 modulated upstream components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway and associated with the adaptor protein growth factor binding protein. The downstream consequences of altered extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity were independent of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B.

Annexins are ubiquitous and expressed in diverse organisms (1Raynal P. Pollard H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 2Morgan R.O. Fernandez M-P.

They are structurally homologous proteins with a highly conserved 70-amino acid repeat sequence. This comprises the core domain, which confers both the calcium and phospholipid binding properties of annexins. The diverse biological activities are dictated by the N-terminal domain, which is variable in both length and sequence (4Crompton M.R. Moss S.E. Crumpton M.J. Cell. 1998; 55: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Annexins are cytosolic or associated with the membrane or the cytoskeleton in a calcium-dependent manner. Their precise functions are unclear; however, they have been implicated in a broad range of cellular functions, including signal transduction, DNA replication, cell transformation, ion channel formation, and apopotosis (5Moss S. Nature. 1995; 378: 446-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lipocortin 1 is one of the more extensively studied annexins. It is a steroid-regulated protein and thus implicated in some of the beneficial actions of glucocorticoids including inhibition of cell proliferation, anti-inflammatory effects, the regulation of cell differentiation (6Flower R.J. Rothwell N.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and, more recently, membrane trafficking (7Diakanova M. Gerke V. Ernst J.

Decreased inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression (13Wu C-C. Croxtall J. Perretti M. Bryant C. Thiemermann C. Flower R. Vane J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Bryant C.E. Perretti M. Flower R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is believed to be important in the antiendotoxic action of lipocortin 1. Another effect of lipocortin 1 is the inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase 2 activity and hence arachidonic acid and lysophospholipid generation (6Flower R.J. Rothwell N.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which may explain some of its anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative functions. Lipocortin 1 is a substrate for protein kinase C and protein-tyrosine kinases; this, coupled with multiple phosphorylation sites and calcium and phospholipid binding properties, may be indicative of a role in signal transduction as a means to effecting its pleiotropic physiological roles. The N-terminal domain of lipocortin 1 possesses a region with sequence similarity to a SH21 recognition domain. Thus lipocortin 1 may function in signaling complexes with proteins containing SH2 domains, although there is little evidence to support this theory (15Croxtall J.D. Choudhury Q. Flower R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, the role of lipocortin 1 in LPS-mediated signal transduction in RAW 264.7 macrophages was assessed to discover how lipocortin 1 modulates cellular responses to LPS and protects against endotoxic shock. The major cell surface receptor for LPS on macrophages is the 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidyl inositol membrane-anchored glycoprotein CD14 (16Kiehen T.L. Blecha F. Immunopharmacology. 1995; 29: 187-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recent work also suggests a role for the Toll-like receptor in the initial LPS signal transduction events (17Yang R-B. Mark M. Gray A. Huang A. Hong Xie M. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W. Gurney A. Godowski P. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Subsequent events are not well defined, but strong evidence indicates a role for protein-tyrosine kinases in LPS signaling (18Sweet M. Hume D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Following LPS-activation, numerous proteins become phosphorylated, including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family: p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and -2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (19Geng Y. Zang B. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6692-6700PubMed Google Scholar, 20Geppert T.D. Whitehurst C.E. Thompson P. Beutler B. Mol. Med. 1994; 1: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hambleton J.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that each of these kinases play a pivotal role in expressing a number of proinflammatory molecules in macrophages (23Pouliot M. Baillargeon J. Lee J. Cleland L. James M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4930-4937PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rose D. Winston B. Chan E. Riches D. Gerwins P. Johnson G. Henson P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3433-3438PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first study of the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family by the annexin lipocortin 1. The putative downstream consequences of modulating these signaling cascades by altering lipocortin 1 protein levels are also important. LPS activates the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB in macrophages via the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IÎºB proteins. Many proinflammatory genes have NF-ÎºB recognition sequences in their promoters, including inducible nitric-oxide synthase (25Xie Q.W. Kashibara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interleukin-1 (26Dinarello C.A. Ryan J.L. Morrison D.C. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 105-144Google Scholar), interleukin-6 (27McCallum R.E. Hill M.R. Ryan J.L. Morrison D.C. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 145-164Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor Î± (28Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 10: 411-452Crossref Scopus (1809) Google Scholar), which together contribute to the pathophysiology of endotoxic shock. Some of these responses have been shown to be modulated by the action of lipocortin 1. Dexamethasome-induced lipocortin 1 has been shown to inhibit LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and subsequent nitric oxide production (13Wu C-C. Croxtall J. Perretti M. Bryant C. Thiemermann C. Flower R. Vane J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Bryant C.E. Perretti M. Flower R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, rats treated with a lipocortin 1 N-terminal peptide are protected against LPS-mediated endotoxic shock (13Wu C-C. Croxtall J. Perretti M. Bryant C. Thiemermann C. Flower R. Vane J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe the effects of altered lipocortin 1 expression on LPS-induced activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK. The p38 and JNK responses to LPS are unchanged by alteration of lipocortin 1 protein levels. Increased expression of lipocortin 1 protein results in constitutive activation of ERK, which is inhibited following LPS activation. Conversely, reduced lipocortin 1 protein expression leads to prolonged ERK activity following LPS-activation. Similar patterns of activation and inhibition are seen with the ERK-regulating kinase MEK, suggesting that lipocortin 1 acts on upstream components of this pathway. Modulation of early tyrosine phosphorylation events and the association of lipocortin 1 with Grb 2 also suggest a putative role for lipocortin 1 in proximal signaling events in the ERK cascade. The downstream consequences of the lipocortin 1-mediated changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation do not appear to involve changes in the nuclear translocation of the NF-ÎºB. Total RNA was isolated from murine skin samples (Micro-scale Total RNA Separator Kit; CLONTECH). Full-length lipocortin 1 cDNA was amplified from murine RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: forward, 5â²-TAC TTC TCT AAA AAT GGC AAT; reverse, 3â²-CAG AAT ATT TTA ACA AAA TAA at an annealing temperature of 57 Â°C. The lipocortin 1 cDNA was subcloned into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. After verification of the sequence the lipocortin 1 cDNA was cloned into the pRc/RSV eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) in either the sense or antisense orientation. The plasmids were cultured overnight, and DNA was purified using Wizard Maxipreps (Promega), cesium-banded, and dialyzed to remove endogenous LPS prior to transfection. LPS-responsive RAW 264.7 cells were cloned and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Cells were placed in serum-free medium and then transfected for 24 h using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) and 5 Î¼g of plasmid DNA. Cells were grown in complete medium for a further 24 h prior to splitting and subsequent dilution cloning in medium containing 500 Î¼g/ml G418. Clones were selected and expanded prior to characterization of lipocortin 1 expression using Western blot analysis and ELISA assays. Expression of lipocortin 1 in the transfected cells was serum-dependent; therefore, all studies were performed using the same batch of serum. Since the levels of lipocortin 1 expression are critical to this study, the protein expression was measured by Western blot and ELISA. In addition, cell surface levels of lipocortin were assessed in order to ensure that changes in expression were reflected in this pool, which is thought to be important in the biological function of this protein (10Perretti M. Flower R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 992-999PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wu C-C. Croxtall J. Perretti M. Bryant C. Thiemermann C. Flower R. Vane J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Bryant C.E. Perretti M. Flower R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cell surface lipocortin 1 was removed using an 1 mm EDTA wash containing protease inhibitors PMSF (1 mm), pepstatin A (0.5 Î¼g/ml), and leupeptin (0.5 Î¼g/ml). Total cell lysates were prepared in buffer containing 10 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100 with the same combination of protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis for lipocortin 1 was performed using samples with equivalent protein concentration, as described previously (13Wu C-C. Croxtall J. Perretti M. Bryant C. Thiemermann C. Flower R. Vane J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), using sheep anti-human lipocortin 1 antibody (a gift from J. Croxtall) at a concentration of 1:50,000. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric analysis of the Western blots was performed, and data are expressed as -fold changes in optical density. To further determine the levels of lipocortin 1 expression, a crude ELISA was developed. ELISA cell surface washes were prepared as for Western blot analysis and coated for 18 h at 4 Â°C onto 96-well plates (Falcon). After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk powder for 1 h at 37 Â°C, lipocortin 1 levels were detected using the sheep anti-human lipocortin 1 antibody at a concentration of 1:2000. Following incubation with anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000), lipocortin 1 was detected using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and the color reaction was read at an OD of 492 nm. Optical density readings were normalized to viable cell number as assessed by cell counting using trypan blue exclusion. Cells were seeded at 3 Ã 104 cells/35-mm plate and grown for 4 days in normal growth medium or medium supplemented with G418 for the transfected cell lines. At 4 days, cells were harvested and counted microscopically using a hemocytometer. Multiplication rate (r) and population doubling times (PDT) were calculated using the following equations, where nH is the number of cells harvested at 96 h (t 2) andnI is the number of cells seeded at time zero (t 1). r=3.32(lognHâlognI)/(t2ât1)(Eq. 1) PDT=1/r(Eq. 2) All experiments were counted in duplicate, and data represent three separate experiments. Cells were lysed on ice in buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3V04, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mm NaF, 40 mmNa4P2O7, and 0.5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. After clearing by centrifugation, ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 Â°C, using a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) immobilized on protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in PBS. Kinase assays were conducted by incubating immunocomplexes in 30 Î¼l of kinase buffer containing 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 Î¼m ATP, and 7.5 Î¼g of myelin basic protein (MBP) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 Î¼l of 2Ã Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. 5-Î¼l samples were resolved by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) prior to probing with an antibody to phosphorylated MBP (Upstate Biotechnology). The phosphorylated substrate was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots from four separate experiments were quantified using Kodak 1D software. For the neutralizing antibody studies, cells were incubated with antisera to lipocortin 1 or sheep serum (1:60 dilution) for 4 h prior to cell lysis (13Wu C-C. Croxtall J. Perretti M. Bryant C.

Protein kinase activity of p38 was measured in affinity precipitates of p38 bound to recombinant GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 (29McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Van Horn S. Lee J.C. Livi G.P.

Stimulated cells were lysed on ice in buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mmEDTA, 20 mm NaF, 2.5 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. Whole cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and added to 1 Î¼g of GST-MAPKAP kinase-2/GSH-Sepharose and circulated for 2 h at 4 Â°C. The bead complexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl, 5 mmÎ²-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3V04, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The bead complexes were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 Â°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 Î¼l of 4Ã Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved by 11% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried, and the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 was detected using autoradiography. Autoradiographs from four separate experiments were quantified using Kodak 1D software. The activity of JNK was quantified as for p38 activity except that cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin and circulated with recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged truncated N terminus of cJun (GST-c-Jun-(5â89)) immobilized on GSH-Sepharose (30Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Nuclear pellets were prepared from LPS-activated cells. Cells (3 Ã 106) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 Î¼l of buffer 1 (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 10 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.1 mmdithiothreitol; 0.5 mm PMSF; and 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) and put on ice to swell for 15 min. After the addition of 25 Î¼l of 10% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, the samples were vortexed for 10 s and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 s. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50 Î¼l of buffer 2 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 0.4 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) and, after light vortexing, were extracted on ice for 15 min. The extract was sonicated on ice for 30 s and then centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant containing the nuclear fraction was stored at â70 Â°C. The oligonucleotide sequences (Promega) were as follows. Murine intronic k-chain ÎºB site was 5â²-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGC C (NF-ÎºB consensus), and AP1 consensus was 5â² TTC CGG CTG ACT CAT CAA GCG. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). EMSAs were performed in 10 Î¼l of reaction mixture containing 5 Î¼g of nuclear extract, 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)Â·poly(dI-dC), and 0.2 ng of DNA probe. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After the addition of 1 Î¼l of gel-loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 40% glycerol), the reaction products were analyzed on 4% acrylamide gel, and the radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. To check for binding specificity to NF-ÎºB, two competition reactions were set up with either 1.75 pmol of cold NF-ÎºB oligonucleotide or 1.75 pmol of cold AP1 oligonucleotide. Autoradiographs from four separate experiments were quantified using Kodak 1D software. MEK activity was measured in vitro using histidine-tagged substrates following immunoprecipitation of the kinase. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA plus the same complement of protease and phosphatase inhibitors used for the ERK assay. Following centrifugation to clear the insoluble material, lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-MEK precoupled to protein G-Sepharose for 90 min at 4 Â°C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation, washed four times in lysis buffer, and then incubated for 15 min at 30 Â°C in 30 Î¼l of buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 15 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 Î¼mATP, 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP, 1 Î¼g of wild type ERK, and 200 Î¼m epidermal growth factor receptor peptide substrate. The reaction was terminated on ice, and a proportion of the sample was assayed for peptide phosphorylation by ion exchange chromatography, while the remaining sample was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiographic film. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by LPS (1 Î¼g/ml) was detected by immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (TCS). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 1 mmEGTA; 1 mm PMSF; 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin; 1 mmNa4P2O7; 25 mm NaF. Proteins were resolved by 5â15% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 3% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS followed by incubation with 4G10 (1 Î¼g/ml) for 4 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-T), the membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted at 1:3000 for 1 h at room temperature. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Grb 2-associating proteins were isolated from untreated and LPS-activated cells using GST-Grb 2 fusion protein coupled to GSH-Sepharose. Cells were lysed in the buffer used for phosphotyrosine assays and cleared by centrifugation. Lysates were circulated with GST-Grb 2/GSH-Sepharose at 4 Â°C for 2 h. The bead complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed four times in lysis buffer, and boiled in 2Ã Laemmli sample buffer for 8 min. Proteins were resolved and detected as for the phosphotyrosine assay. The same blots were reprobed with sheep antiserum to lipocortin 1 as described previously. To further confirm the association between lipocortin 1 and Grb 2, immunoprecipitation of lipocortin 1 was conducted. Depletion of Grb 2 in lysates subjected to serial lipocortin 1 immunoprecipitation was conducted due to the close proximity of Grb 2 to the immunoglobulin light chain on blots of the immunoprecipitated complex. Lysates were prepared as above and circulated with the sheep antisera to lipocortin 1 coupled to protein G-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 Â°C. Four rounds of immunodepletion were conducted. The whole cell lysates and depleted lysates were denatured by boiling in 2Ã Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, Grb 2 was detected using rabbit antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and lipocortin 1 was detected as descrbed previously. Data were analyzed using Instat software. One-way analysis of variance was used for all statistical analysis with the exception of the r and PDT data, for which unpaired Student's t tests were conducted. Significance was taken atp < 0.05. After transfection, 10 antisense, 32 sense, and 7 control cell lines were selected by G418 resistance. Western blot analysis of lipocortin 1 expression in both the biologically relevant cell surface washes and the total cell lysates were used to identify the under- and overexpressing cell lines for expansion and analysis. Three cell lines transfected with antisense cDNA and three transfected with sense cDNA that showed marked under- or overexpression of lipocortin 1 were selected. All control cell lines produced equal levels of lipocortin 1 in amounts equivalent to untransfected RAW cells. Representative blots of both cell surface and total cellular lipocortin in over- and underexpressing cell lines with the respective densitometric analysis from 13 Western blots are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. As expected, the differences in lipocortin 1 expression between the cell lines were reflected and, interestingly, more striking, in the biologically relevant cell surface pool lipocortin 1, thus indicating that the altered cellular expression levels are conferred onto the cell surface, a pool that may be crucial to the study of the function of lipocortin 1. A crude ELISA for lipocortin 1 was developed to further verify the protein expression. The overexpressing cells showed an increase in lipocortin 1 expression of 181%, and the antisense cell line showed a slight decrease of 20% (compared with control cells). Subsequent experiments were conducted on several clones demonstrating the maximum change in lipocortin 1 expression to ensure that the results obtained were not artifactual. Lipocortin 1 is antiproliferative in a number of cell lines (6Flower R.J. Rothwell N.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To determine whether the changes generated in lipocortin 1 expression were biologically relevant, proliferation of the cell lines was assayed by growth curve analysis. Multiplication rate and population doubling times were calculated (see Table I). Cells with increased levels of lipocortin 1 had a significantly reduced multiplication rate of 0.66 generations/24 h, compared with 0.98 generations/24 h for cells transfected with the control plasmid. Increasing the levels of lipocortin 1 also significantly prolonged the population doubling time from 24.7 h in the control cells to 36.4 h. Cells with reduced levels of lipocortin 1 had a slightly higher multiplication rate (1.11 generations/24 h) and a reduced population doubling time (22.3 h), but these were not found to be statistically significant.Table ICellular proliferation of RAW macrophages transfected to over- and underexpress lipocortin 1CellsMultiplication ratePopulation doubling timeRAW0.95 Â± 0.1225.1 Â± 1.6CV0.98 Â± 0.124.7 Â± 2.1R1A1.11 Â± 0.1622.3 Â± 3.3kF1A0.66 Â± 0.0536.4 Â± 2.9 Open table in a new tab LPS (1 Î¼g/ml) affected ERK/MAPK activity in all cell lines (Fig. 2 A).

In order to further characterize the biochemical nature of the bacteriocin, both peptides were isolated which together are responsible for the antimicrobial activity. The first, LtnA1, is a 3,322 Da 30-amino acid peptide and the second component, LtnA2, is a 29-amino acid peptide with a mass of 2,847 Da. Conventional amino acid analysis revealed that both peptides contain the thioether amino acid, lanthionine, as well as an excess of alanine to that predicted from the genetic sequence of the peptides. Chiral phase gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry of amino acid composition indicated that both LtnA1 and LtnA2 containd-alanine residues and amino acid sequence analysis of LtnA1 confirmed that the d-alanine results from post-translational modification of a serine residue in the primary translation product. Taken together, these results demonstrate that lacticin 3147 is a novel, two-component, d-alanine containing lantibiotic that undergoes extensive post-translational modification which may account for its potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria.

One subclass of these antimicrobial peptides comprises the lantibiotics, which are produced by many different strains of Gram-positive organisms, including the lactic acid bacteria (1****Google Scholar, 2Sahl H-G Bierbaum G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Lantibiotics are distinguished from other bacteriocins in that they undergo extensive post-translational modification, with modifications of serine, threonine, and cysteine residues being particularly common. Typically, the hydroxy amino acids (Ser and Thr) are selectively dehydrated to form dehydroalanine (Dha)1 and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), respectively (3Gross E. Morrell J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 4634-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The resultant Î±,Î²-unsaturated residues may then undergo Michael addition reactions with the thiol group of specific cysteine residues to form lanthionine (Lan) and Î²-methyl-lanthionine (MeLan), the characteristic features of these peptides (1****Google Scholar). The precise role of these lanthionine residues remains unclear, but they have been shown to contribute to enhanced stability under extreme temperatures (4Hurst A. Perlman D. Laskin A.I.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 827-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and have also been implicated in increased tolerance to acids (6De Vuyst L. Vandamme E.J. De Vuyst L. Vandamme E.J. Bacteriocins of Lactic Acid Bacteria. Blackie Academic and Professional, 1994: 151-221Crossref Google Scholar) as well as in resistance to proteolytic activities (7Bierbaum G. Szekat C. Josten M. Heidrich C. Kempter C. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Appl. Eviron. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 385-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best known lantibiotic is nisin which contains five lanthionine rings. This lantibiotic is well characterized at the biochemical and molecular level and has found widespread application as a biopreservative in the food industry (8Delves-Broughton J. Food Tech. 1990; 44: 100-117Google Scholar). In addition to lanthionine, other unusual modified amino acids such as 2-oxobutyrate (9Kellner R. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Sahl H.-G. Jung J. Nisin and Novel Lantibiotics. ESCOM Scientific Publishers BV, Leiden1991: 141-158Google Scholar), 2S,8R-lysinoalanine (10Fredenhagen A. MaÌrki F. Fendrich G. MaÌrki W. Gruner J. van Oostrum J.

Gillessen D. Kamiyama T. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1988; 71: 1924-1929Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and d-alanine (12Skaugen M. Nissen-Meyer J. Jung G. Stevanovic S. Sletter K. Inger C. Mortvedt A. Nes I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27183-27185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been identified in certain lantibiotic peptides. Identification of d-alanine in the lantibiotic lactocin S is of particular interest in that it was the first reported example of the incorporation of a d-amino acid in a ribosomally synthesized prokaryotic peptide (12Skaugen M. Nissen-Meyer J. Jung G. Stevanovic S. Sletter K. Inger C. Mortvedt A. Nes I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27183-27185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the genetic sequence predicted serine residues in certain positions in the propeptide, whereas d-alanine was detected in the mature peptide, suggesting the conversion was the result of a more complex mechanism than a simple isomerase conversion froml-alanine. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, the authors proposed a model for stereoinversion based on the Î±-epimerization sequence (13Bycroft B.W. Nature. 1969; 224: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and on the stereoinversion involved in lanthionine formation (14Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 481-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, thed-alanine residues are thought to be introduced by a two-step Î±-carbon stereoinversion in which serine is initially dehydrated in the same manner as in the first step of lanthionine formation. The resultant dehydroalanine residue is then further modified by an unidentified stereospecific hydrogenating enzyme or enzyme system. This study involved the purification and biochemical characterization of the novel two-component antimicrobial peptide lacticin 3147 (15McAuliffe O. Ryan M.P. Ross R.P. Hill C. Breeuwer P. Abee T. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented allow the two peptides to be ascribed to two genes, ltnA1 and ltnA2 (previously described asltnA and ltnB) in a gene cluster contained within a large conjugative plasmid pMRC01 (16Dougherty B.A. Hill C. Weidman J.F. Richardson D.R. Venter J.C. Ross R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cluster contains a number of open reading frames with homology to genes known to be involved in lantibiotic biosynthesis, including twolanM genes associated with dehydration and lanthionine formation. Moreover, a complex array of post-translational modifications of lacticin 3147 are demonstrated, which includes serine to d-alanine conversion, dehydration of serines and threonines, lanthionine formation, and leader peptide cleavage. Taken together, these results reveal a two-peptide bacteriocin with a highly modified structure, which may account for its potent antimicrobial action against a wide variety of Gram-positive bacteria (17Ryan M.P. Meaney W.J. Ross R.P. Hill C. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2287-2290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ryan M.P. Rea M.C. Hill C. Ross R.P. Appl. Env.

Ross R.P. Hill C. Harrington D. J. Dairy Sci. 1998; 82: 10-22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The producing strain L. lactis DPC3147, as well as the sensitive indicator strains L. lactis HP and L. lactis AM2 were maintained by weekly subculture in M17 (Difco, Detroit, MI) supplemented with 0.5% lactose (LM17) and all strains were stocked at â70 Â°C in 40% glycerol. For production of bacteriocin activity, a modified tryptone/yeast extract medium (15McAuliffe O. Ryan M.P. Ross R.P. Hill C. Breeuwer P. Abee T. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used from which hydrophobic components which interfered in subsequent purification procedures had been removed by adsorption to the chromatographic medium XAD-16 (Sigma-Aldrich, Dublin, Ireland). Bacteriocin activity was assayed after each step using L. lactis HP as the indicator strain and the method previously described by McAuliffe et al. (20McAuliffe O. Hill C. Ross R.P. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In order to locate complementary activity, 10-Î¼l aliquots of putative A1 fractions were cross-tested with isolated peptide A2 and vice versa. To demonstrate complementary activity, 10-Î¼l aliquots of isolated fractions, A1, A1â², and A2 were each dispensed into separate, triangularly arranged agar wells formed in an agar plate which had previously been seeded with the sensitive indicator strain L. lactis AM2. Synergistic activity between the peptides was indicated by a zone of inhibition between the wells, while activity from individual peptides was observed as a zone around a well on the side facing away from all other fractions. An overnight culture of the producing strain, L. lactis DPC3147 was inoculated into 8 liters of modified tryptone-yeast broth. The inoculated medium was incubated overnight at 30 Â°C and the cells were subsequently removed by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a column (3 Ã 23 cm) containing a 50-g bed of XAD-16 resin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a flow rate of 15 ml/min and the column was then washed with 2 liters of 40% aqueous ethanol (pH 6). The bacteriocin was subsequently eluted with 1 liter of 70% propan-2-ol adjusted to approximately pH 2 by the addition of HCl. The propan-2-ol was removed by rotary evaporation and the resultant bacteriocin preparation was fractionally precipitated with the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to a final saturation of 30% at 4 Â°C. Following gentle stirring overnight at 4 Â°C, the precipitated bacteriocin was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 30 min and resuspended in 20 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7). This concentrated preparation was desalted on a column (5 Ã 30 cm) with a bed volume of 25 g of XAD-2 resin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and the bacteriocin was again eluted in 70% propan-2-ol/HCl (pH 2), with subsequent concentration by rotary evaporation yielding approximately 4 ml of crude preparation. Aliquots of 2 ml were then applied to a C18 reverse phase (RP)-HPLC column (Nucleosil ODS II, 4.6 Ã 250 mm) previously equilibrated with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The column was subsequently developed in a gradient of 30 to 60% propan-2-ol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected manually and assayed for activity. The two fractions, A1 and A2, containing the bacteriocin activity were concentrated separately by rotary evaporation and each fraction was then reapplied to the C18 RP-HPLC column. A gradient of 40 to 46% propan-2-ol (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 30 min was applied to further fractionate the A1 component while fraction A2 was developed in a gradient of 44 to 50% propan-2-ol (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 30 min. The procedure was repeated until homogenous, biologically active peaks were obtained. To facilitate protein sequencing, peptide samples containing dehydrated amino acids were first modified essentially by the method of Meyer et al.(22Meyer H.E. Heber M. Eisermann B. Korte H. Metzger J.W. Jung G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly samples containing sufficient material for sequencing (100 to 200 pmol) were dissolved in 15 Î¼l of a freshly prepared solution containing 280 Î¼l of ethanol, 200 Î¼l of H2O, 65 Î¼l of 5 m aqueous NaOH solution, and 60 Î¼l of 1-propanethiol (all from Merck, Damstadt, Germany). The samples were heated under an inert gas atmosphere (Ar) at 50 Â°C for 1 h in a heated block, diluted 1:1 in glacial acetic acid, and sequenced (as described below) without further treatment. Peptides for digestion were dissolved in 50 Î¼l of a solution of 1% acetic acid adjusted to pH 8.5 with ammonia solution and 1 to 2 Î¼l of enzyme (dissolved in H2O) was added to give a final enzyme to peptide ratio of 1:25. Digestions were incubated for 16 to 18 h at 35 Â°C in a heated block and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 Î¼l of trifluoroacetic acid. Reactions were controlled by simultaneously digesting appropriate synthetic peptides possessing the required sites for digestion (EMC, TuÌbingen, Germany). All enzymes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were of sequencing grade quality. Electrospray ionization (ES)-mass spectra were accumulated and analyzed on a VG Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) outfitted with Mass-Lynx software (Micromass). Samples were introduced in the liquid phase in a continuous stream of 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.05% formic acid at flow rates of 5â30 Î¼l/min, either from a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) or a model 232XL autosampler (Gilson-Abimed) connected to a HPLC pump. For HPLC-MS experiments, samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 45 Î¼l/min after separation through a HPLC column (100 Ã 1-mm Nucleosil ODS II: Grom, Herrenberg, Germany) connected to an Integral microanalytical workstation (PE-Biosystems, Germany); the HPLC separation was achieved using appropriate binary gradients of water and acetonitrile, each containing either 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or 0.1% formic acid. All mass spectra were collected in the positive mode using cone voltages between 25 and 65 V. Automated Edman degradation-based amino acid sequence analysis was performed using a model 477A pulsed liquid-gas phase protein sequencer coupled on-line to a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer (both from PE-Biosystems). Samples to be sequenced were applied to a trifluoroacetic acid pretreated glass fiber filter coated with 15 Î¼l of Biobrene Plus (PE-Biosystems) and were both subjected to Edman degradation as well as analyzed using the manufacturers chemicals, standard microcartridge protocols and software. For the visualization of propanethiol-modified residues (S-propyl-cysteine and 3-methyl-S-propyl-cysteine), the standard analyzer gradient was elongated for a further 8 min. Peptides for amino acid analysis were hydrolyzed in an inert gas atmosphere (N2) in 6 m HCl at 110 Â°C for 16 h in sealed glass vials. Following subsequent removal of HCl under vacuum, the amino acid composition of the samples was determined after ortho-phthaldialdehyde derivatization by a previously described method specifically optimized for the identification of Lan and MeLan (23Sahl H.-G. Grossgarten M. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Brandis H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In order to quantitate Pro (for which the above method is unsuitable), hydrolysates prepared as above were analyzed on a model 420 derivatizer connected to an on-line narrow bore model 130A phenythiocarbamoyl-derivative analyzer and model 920A data analysis module (all from PE-Biosystems) using the manufacturers chemicals, protocols, and software. The enantiomeric purity of amino acids was determined by gas chromatography (GC)-MS by a previously described method (24Gerharolt J. Nicholson G.J. Hodges R.S. Smith J.A. Peptides: Chemistry, Structure, and Biology. Escom Scientific Publishers BV, Leiden1994: 241-243Crossref Google Scholar). The peptides were hydrolyzed in DCl/D2O at 110 Â°C for 24 h prior to derivatization and analysis. We previously reported the partial purification of lacticin 3147, a broad spectrum bacteriocin produced by L. lactis DPC3147 (15McAuliffe O. Ryan M.P. Ross R.P. Hill C. Breeuwer P. Abee T. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final RP-FPLC step of that procedure allowed the identification of two subunits, both of which were required for full biological activity. In the present study, we applied a modified purification protocol, which was successfully used to separate and isolate the lacticin 3147 subunits. The peptides obtained were subsequently subjected to detailed biochemical characterization. A 30% saturation ammonium sulfate fractionation proved particularly valuable to both concentrate and further purify the bacteriocin peptides. A further deviation from the previous purification procedure was the replacement of C18 RP-FPLC with C18 RP-HPLC which provided enhanced resolution of the peptides. LtnA2, the more hydrophobic of the two bacteriocin components eluted at approximately 54% propan-2-ol, whereas LtnA1 was comparatively more hydrophilic and eluted at approximately 44% propan-2-ol (Fig. 1). Concomitant with the separation of the two peptides, a significant loss in activity was observed when each were assayed individually against the indicator strain, L. lactis HP. However, as observed previously, complementation of fraction A1 with fraction A2 resulted in recovery of full activity (Fig. 1). Repeated chromatographic separation by HPLC revealed that LtnA1 activity correlated to two individual peaks as characterized by a variation in their respective retention times. The individual peaks were designated LtnA1 and LtnA1â², respectively (Fig. 1). By contrast, LtnA2 activity corresponded to an apparently single homogenous peak. Interestingly, when each of these components were assayed against the sensitive strain, L. lactis AM2, LtnA1 produced a significant zone of inhibition, whereas either LtnA1â² or LtnA2 alone remained inactive. However, both LtnA1 and LtnA1â² were capable of complementing LtnA2 when 10 Î¼l of each were placed in wells in close proximity to 10 Î¼l of LtnA2, as indicated by a zone of inhibition between them. No complementary activity was observed between LtnA1 and LtnA1â². All three active fractions were further characterized by a number of biochemical techniques. Both forms of LtnA1, as well as LtnA2 were hydrolyzed under vacuum for 16 h in 6m HCl and then derivatized withortho-phthaldialdehyde whereupon, they were subjected to amino acid analysis by RP-HPLC (with the exception of the Pro values which were determined by the alternative phenythiocarbamoyl-based procedure). The resulting analyses for LtnA1 (similar results were obtained for LtnA1â²) and LtnA2 are summarized in Table I. In addition to representatives of the usual amino acids, we detected the modified residues, Lan and MeLan in both peptides. Interestingly, amino acid analyses suggested that both peptides contained significantly more alanine than would be predicted from the translated gene sequences (Fig. 2); LtnA1 contained at least one additional residue while LtnA2 contained two additional residues of alanine.Table IAmino acid composition of LtnA1 and Ltn2Amino acidLtnA1LtnA2PredictedaPredicted from the gene sequences.DetectedPredictedaPredicted from the gene sequences.DetectedAla23.446.4Cys4NDbND, not detected.3NDAsp/Asn43.811.0Glu/GlncAcid hydrolysis results in conversion of Asn and Gln into Asp and Glu, respectively.11.600Phe11.000Gly22.800His10.800Ile0032.7Lys11.010.9Leu22.111.0Met10.300ProdPro was detected only using the PTC method.0032.9Arg0011.0Ser30.730.1Thr4082.8Val0000TrpeTrp is destroyed upon acid hydrolysis.3ND0NDTyr11.010.6Lan/MeLan03.202.9a Predicted from the gene sequences.b ND, not detected.c Acid hydrolysis results in conversion of Asn and Gln into Asp and Glu, respectively.d Pro was detected only using the PTC method.e Trp is destroyed upon acid hydrolysis. Open table in a new tab The configurations of the amino acids detected in the hydrolysates of LtnA1 and LtnA2 were also characterized by chiral-phase GC coupled to MS. Surprisingly, while most of the amino acids were present as the expected l-isomer, a considerable proportion (approximately 33%) of the Ala content of both LtnA1 and LtnA2 was found to be present as the d-isomer (data not shown). From the results, it could be determined that LtnA1 contains one residue ofd-alanine while LtnA2 contains two such residues. Control hydrolysates of the lantibiotic gallidermin (25Kellner R. Jung G. Horner T. Zahner H. Schenell N. Entian K.-D. GoÌtz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 53-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided standards for the unusual amino acids Lan and MeLan and demonstrated that Ala was not artifactually undergoing racemization during either hydrolysis or the analysis. Edman degradation of LtnA1 and LtnA1â² revealed several interesting features. Initial attempts to sequence the native peptides failed to yield interpretable results and so purified peptides were subjected to 1-propanethiol derivatization which enabled sequencing through to residues 16 and 18 for LtnA1 and LtnA1â² respectively. The results of this analysis yielded the following sequences: XXXNXFALXDYWGNNG andXXXNXFALXDYWG-NNGAW (for LtnA1 and LtnA1â², respectively), where X represents an unidentified amino acid. From previous experience and utilizing an extended HPLC gradient we were able to detect peaks with retention times corresponding to either S-propylcysteine or 3-methyl-S-propylcysteine for several of these unidentified residues which are consistent with the presence of Lan, MeLan, Dha, or Dhb residues in these positions. Furthermore, at position 7 where either a Ser or Dha residue was expected from the gene sequence (Fig. 2), an Ala residue (Fig. 3) was identified, consistent with the additional Ala residue indicated from the amino acid analyses. By contrast, sequence analysis of both native and chemically modified LtnA2 failed to yield sequence data, apparently due to the absence of a free N terminus. The predicted LtnA2 prepeptide (Fig. 2) contains a putative âdouble glycineâ cleavage site (P1 = Gly, P2 = Gly) followed by a Thr residue at position P'1, which can be further dehydrated to give Dhb. Since Î±,Î²-unsaturated amino acids are unstable when located at the N terminus (1****Google Scholar), the sequencing results are consistent with cleavage at the predicted site (Fig. 2), the result of which would be the formation of a LtnA2 peptide with a modified N terminus analogous to that found in other lantibiotics such as Pep5 (9Kellner R. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Sahl H.-G. Jung J. Nisin and Novel Lantibiotics. ESCOM Scientific Publishers BV, Leiden1991: 141-158Google Scholar). In an attempt both to localize the predicted d-Ala residues and to gather sequence data for LtnA2, the peptide was digested separately with either trypsin or Î±-chymotrypsin, however, both enzymes failed to digest the peptide even at enzyme to peptide ratios of 1:5. Since both sides of the trypsin cleavage site are surrounded by potentially modified residues, it is possible the modified peptide is no longer a suitable substrate for trypsin. Similarly, HPLC-purified, fully reduced LtnA2 proved to be an unacceptable substrate for Î±-chymotrypsin. The mass spectra for the purified peptides are shown in Fig. 4. From the multiply charged ions detected, the masses estimated for LtnA1 was 3,322.34 Â± 0.80 Da, while the mass of LtnA2 was estimated to be 2,847.47 Â± 0.53 Da. As indicated above, two forms of LtnA1 exist which differ slightly in their hydrophobicity. To further investigate this phenomenon, each of the two species, LtnA1 and LtnA1â² which differ slightly in their hydrophobicity were studied using an alternative HPLC buffer system (0.1% formic acid) which provided a considerably improved separation as well as increased MS sensitivity. With this system, it was observed that although both LtnA1 and LtnA1â² have identical masses, each form appears to vary in its susceptibility to dehydration. From the respective mass chromatograms, we calculated that more than 98% of LtnA1 is 6-fold dehydrated, while approximately 33% of the LtnA1â² sample contains an additional dehydration (Fig. 5).FIG. 5HPLC-ES-MS analysis of: A,LtnA1; B, LtnA1â²; and C,LtnA2. Peptides were separated by HPLC and eluted peaks were detected and characterized by on-line ES-MS. The chromatograms shown represent the raw total ion chromatogram and the inset at the left of each spectrum shows the mass spectra for the respective eluted peaks. The peak integration values shown as aninset at right were calculated from integration of the mass chromatograms, the specific masses used for the generation of the mass chromatograms (not shown) are indicated in the left column of each table. Values above peaks indicate relative retention time. The boxed area in each case was used to generate the mass spectra.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Following the observation that LtnA1 exists in various states of dehydration, we also checked preparations of LtnA2 for this microheterogeneity. Although we could separate a small additional peak with apparent increased hydrophilicity, analysis of the masses of the two forms revealed a difference of 16 Da, both the mass and characteristic earlier elution of this peak suggest oxidation of the peptide. In the example given in Fig. 5, 14.74% of the total peptide was in the oxidized form but unfortunately, it was not possible to separate sufficiently the oxidized form for further biological characterization. In this study, we reveal that the two-component antimicrobial peptide lacticin 3147 undergoes a series of complex post-translational modifications including conversion of serine residues tod-alanine and the formation of lanthionine bridges. This is a very significant finding given that this is only the second instance of d-alanine occurring in ribosomally synthesized peptide and the first instance of it in a two-component biologically active peptide. The bacteriocin acts by selectively dissipating the membrane potential of target cells through the formation of pores allowing cell leakage of potassium and inorganic phosphate (15McAuliffe O. Ryan M.P. Ross R.P. Hill C. Breeuwer P. Abee T. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence and compositional analysis, in addition to mass spectrometry, the structural genes for lacticin 3147 can now be positively assigned to ltnA1 and ltnA2, two small open reading frames contained at the start of the larger of two divergent gene clusters encoded on the conjugative plasmid pMRC01. Interestingly, three larger open reading frames follow these structural genes in the cluster, two of which, ltnM1 andltnM2, share homology to modification genes involved in dehydration/lanthionine formation. These putative modification genes are separated by the open reading frame, ltnT, which probably encodes an ABC-transporter based on data base homologies. This transporter contains a proteolytic domain which is probably involved in the cleavage of the leader peptides during export. Indeed, the results obtained allow us to assign the cleavage site of the leader peptide in both structural components (Fig. 2). One striking feature of the structural analyses of LtnA1 and LtnA1â² is the identification of an additional Ala, both in the amino acid compositional analysis and during N-terminal sequencing of position 7 of the peptide; the genetic sequence clearly encodes a Ser residue at this position (16Dougherty B.A. Hill C. Weidman J.F. Richardson D.R. Venter J.C. Ross R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Indeed, this is only the second instance where such a substitution has been reported in a ribosomally synthesized prokaryotic peptide. Analysis of component amino acid chirality demonstrates that one of the three Ala residues is present as thed-isomer, while all other common amino acids are present as the l-isomer. The lantibiotic lactocin S (12Skaugen M. Nissen-Meyer J. Jung G. Stevanovic S. Sletter K. Inger C. Mortvedt A. Nes I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27183-27185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has also been reported to contain d-Ala which has been proposed to arise from the stereospecific hydrogenation of Dha which is formed from the dehydration of a gene-encoded Ser residue, although the mechanism and enzyme(s) responsible are still unknown. Thus, we propose that by analogy to lactocin S, position 7 of LtnA1 is occupied byd-Ala, although the more complicated but unlikely possibility that this residue is in the l-configuration and that one of the additional two gene-encoded l-Ala residues has been converted to d-Ala by an unidentifiedl-Ala isomerase cannot be excluded. While the Xresidues corresponding to some of the serine and threonine residues have yet to be positively identified, they most likely exist as dehydrated derivatives, given that both lanthionine andd-alanine which have been demonstrated to exist in both peptides, probably require a dehydrated intermediate for their formation. In addition, the calculated mass for the predicted LtnA1 peptide (3,430.88 Da), assuming that it contains six dehydrations (â108.06 Da), four of which are necessary precursors for the formation of Lan/MeLan, and a single residue of alanine formed by the hydrogenation of a Dha (+2 Da) is 3,324.82 Da. This value is in reasonable agreement with the measured mass of 3,322.34 Â± 0.80 Da, although not so close that we can rule out the possibility of further minor modifications. A further interesting feature of LtnA1 production is the identification of two species, LtnA1 and LtnA1â², which differ slightly in their relative hydrophobicity. In addition, these forms differ with respect to their biological activity, in that while both can be complemented by LtnA2, the LtnA1 form possesses an independent antimicrobial activity, while the purified LtnA1â² form is inactive. As observed in Fig. 1, a higher concentration of LtnA1 appears to be required to give inhibition on its own, compared with that required to give complementary activity with LtnA2, as implied by the smaller circle encompassing the zone of inhibition formed by LtnA1 alone. Further analysis of the LtnA1 and LtnA1â² fractions also revealed another significant difference in that the LtnA1â² peptide is apparently more susceptible to dehydration, with approximately 38% of LtnA1â² being 7-fold dehydrated. While, such distinguishing features point to some structural difference between the two forms of LtnA1, it is also important to highlight the similarities between LtnA1 and LtnA1â². Both forms complement LtnA2, have identical masses and sequence (at least to Gly16) as well as similar amino acid composition (data not shown). One hypothesis which offers an explanation for these results is that a differing thioether bridging pattern exists in the two forms. Such a feature would explain the similarities in mass and sequence between the two peptides, yet could also allow for differences in hydrophobicity between two forms with different tertiary structures. This could also account for their characteristic biological activities. Analysis of LtnA2 demonstrates that, in addition to Lan/MeLan, it also contains several noteworthy features. First, LtnA2 possesses a blocked N terminus. Since the gene sequence for LtnA2 encodes a Thr residue in the position just after the putative cleavage site, it would appear that this hydroxy amino acid is dehydrated during post-translational modification of LtnA2. After cleavage of the leader peptide, the addition of water followed by deamination should take place, as has been proposed for the N-terminal located Î±,Î²-unsaturated residues resulting in formation of a 2-oxobutyryl group in analogy to that found in lantibiotics such as Pep5 (9Kellner R. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Sahl H.-G. Jung J. Nisin and Novel Lantibiotics. ESCOM Scientific Publishers BV, Leiden1991: 141-158Google Scholar). Hence, the inability to generate N-terminal sequence from LtnA2 may be explained by this reaction and tends to confirm the previously postulated cleavage site for the leader peptide. Second, amino acid analysis demonstrated that LtnA2, like LtnA1 contains an excess of Ala residues (Ala = 6) over that predicted from the gene sequence (Ala = 4) and chiral phase analysis demonstrated that two of these additional Ala residues are present as the non-natural d-isomers. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties encountered in digesting the peptide, we were unable to further localize the position of the residues. Furthermore, from the mass determined for the peptide, additional predictions can be made for the structure of LtnA2. The mass determined (2,847.84 Â± 0.33 Da) is in extremely close agreement to that of a LtnA2 peptide (initial predicted mass 2,987.46 Da) which undergoes 7-fold dehydration (â144.08 Da), contains three Lan/MeLan residues (no mass change) and two additional residues of Ala replacing two Dha residues (+4 Da), and possesses a 2-oxobutyryl group at the N terminus (+1 Da) to give a peptide with a calculated mass of 2,848.45 Da. In addition, because of this close agreement between calculated and experimentally determined mass, other modifications are unlikely. In contrast to LtnA1, careful examination of the peptide in HPLC-ES-MS experiments suggested that LtnA2 is isolated in a single state of dehydration. We did observe a small amount of material (about 15%) which elutes in a manner suggesting that it is more hydrophilic than the main peak. However, unlike LtnA1, this peak has a mass which is 16 Da greater than the main peak, suggesting oxidation of the molecule. Since LtnA2 does not contain Met, the next most likely explanation for this observation would be that there is some limited oxidation of one of the other thioether-containing residues (i.e. Lan or MeLan); the lantibiotic, actagardine contains such a MeLanO residue, the origin of which remains obscure (26Zimmermann N. Metzger J.W. Jung G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). While lanthione groups have previously been demonstrated in cytolysin (27Booth M.C. Bogie C.P.

Moreover, chiral phase GC analysis has demonstrated that d-alanine is present in both components of the bacteriocin. The presence of these residues, in addition to the formation of dehydrated residues and lanthionine rings, may account for the broad antimicrobial inhibitory spectrum associated with lacticin 3147. Such modifications are undoubtedly enzymatic and are forming a main focus of our future research into this system. This may uncover unique activities which could be harnessed as a tool(s) toward the development of novel biologically active peptides in the future. We express our gratitude to G.

Crkl binds to BCR/ABL through its N-terminal SH3 domain and is known to interact with several signaling proteins that have been implicated in integrin signaling, including Cbl, Cas, Hef-1, and paxillin. We have previously shown that overexpression of Crkl enhances adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins through Î²1 integrins. In this study, the effects of Crkl on spontaneous and chemokine-directed migration of the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 were examined. Full-length, SH2-, and SH3(N)-domain deletion mutants of Crkl were expressed transiently as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein. Successfully transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The ability of these cells to migrate across a fibronectin-coated membrane, either spontaneously or in response to the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1Î±, was determined. Cells expressing green fluorescent protein alone were not distinguishable from untransfected or mock transfected Ba/F3 cells. However, Ba/F3 cells overexpressing full-length Crkl were found to have an increase in spontaneous migration of 2.8 Â± 0.6-fold in seven independent assays. The enhancement of migration required both the SH2 domain and the N-terminal SH3 domain. Migration in response to stromal-derived factor-1Î± was not significantly enhanced by overexpression of Crkl. Overexpression of Crkii also augmented spontaneous migration but to a lesser degree than did Crkl. Because the SH2 domain was required for enhanced migration, we looked for changes in phosphotyrosine containing proteins coprecipitating with Crkl, but not Crkl ÎSH2, after integrin cross-linking. Full-length Crkl, but not CrklÎSH2, coprecipitated with a single major tyrosine phosphoprotein with anM r of approximately 120 kDa, identified as Cbl. The major Crkl SH3-binding protein in these cells was found to be the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G. Interestingly, overexpression of C3G also enhanced migration, suggesting that a Cbl-Crkl-C3G complex may be involved in migration signaling in Ba/F3 cells. These data suggest that Crkl is involved in signaling pathways that regulate migration, possibly through a complex with Cbl and C3G.

The Crkl gene was originally identified by ten Hoeve et al. (1ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar) and found to have an overall amino acid homology of 60% to Crkii, one of two proteins generated through alternative splicing of the human Crk proto-oncogene. Both Crkl and Crk are related to v-Crk, the oncogene in the avian retrovirus CT10. Crkl has been shown to be involved in a number of signaling pathways, including pathways activated by T cell stimulation, integrin cross-linking, and hematopoietic cytokine receptor activation (2Arai A.

Although the function of Crkl remains unknown, several investigators have shown that Crkl interacts with signaling proteins previously linked to the control of cytoskeletal functions. In particular, both the Crkl and Crk SH3 domains bind to an overlapping set of cellular target proteins in vitro, including c-ABL, C3G, EPS15, DOCK180, and SOS, and the Crkl and Crk SH2 domains also share in vitro binding to c-Cbl, Cas, Hef-1, and paxillin (18Astier A.

Overexpression of Crkl in hematopoietic cells enhances integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated surfaces (2Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Uemura N. Salgia R. Ewaniuk D.S. Little M.T. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations led us to examine the role of Crkl in cell migration, an event that requires coordination of cellular polarization, membrane extension, formation of cell-substratum attachments, contractile force, traction, and release of rear attachment sites. Although cell adhesion to the substratum is required for migration it is not sufficient, and it is likely that important signals regulating migration come from many different sources including integrins, cytokine receptors, chemokine receptors, and others. The results indicate that Crkl is involved in the regulation of migration, likely involving an interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G.DISCUSSIONCell migration is a fundamentally important process that is not well understood at the level of signal transduction. During development, many precursor cells migrate in response to specific stimuli such as a gradient of chemoattractant molecules. In addition, numerous cells of the adult organism are also capable of extensive migration, particularly cells involved in wound healing and those of the hematopoietic and immune systems. Migration involves a carefully orchestrated series of events that allows cells to extend a cellular protrusion, attach to extracellular matrix proteins through integrins or other adhesive molecules, move in the direction of attachment, and simultaneously detach at the trailing edge (42Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Whereas much is known about the events regulating changes in actin structure during cell movement, little is known about the signals from integrins or other receptors that initiate migration.Members of the Crk family have previously been shown to participate in signaling pathways activated by integrins and have been further linked to the control of adhesion and migration (2Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Astier A. Manie S.N. Law S.F. Canty T. Haghayghi N. Druker B.J. Salgia R. Golemis E.A.

A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).1 For example, after integrin cross-linking in hematopoietic cells, Crkl is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds through its SH2 domain to other cellular tyrosine phosphoproteins (29Uemura N. Salgia R. Ewaniuk D.S. Little M.T. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The SH3 domains of Crk and Crkl bind constitutively to an overlapping set of cellular proteins that have also been linked in some cases to integrin signaling, including c-ABL, DOCK180, and C3G (17Uemura N. Salgia R. Li J.L. Pisick E. Sattler M. Griffin J.D. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either Crkii or Crkl has been shown to increase short-term integrin-mediated adhesion of 32D and Ba/F3 hematopoietic cells to fibronectin-coated surfaces (2Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Uemura N. Salgia R. Ewaniuk D.S. Little M.T. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Crkii, but not Crkl, has also been linked to migration (44Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Klemke et al. (44Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) showed that Crkii-Cas complexes correlated with enhanced migration of the FG-M carcinoma cell line and that dominant-negative mutants of either CrkII or Cas inhibited spontaneous migration of this cell line. Thus, it is likely that both Crkl and CrkII participate in signal transduction initiated by Î² integrins and, as adapter proteins, may serve to link or transport critical signaling molecules that regulate adhesion and possibly migration.The goal of the current studies was to develop a model system in which the effects of specific signaling proteins activated by Î²1 integrins could be studied in hematopoietic cells. Compared with more commonly used fibroblastic or epithelial cell lines, hematopoietic cells display higher levels of motility and migration using in vitro assays. The Ba/F3 cell line was selected for this study because its expression of integrin receptors and other adhesion molecules is well characterized.2 Cross-linking of Î²1 integrins on Ba/F3 cells was found to cause rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Crkl and association of Crkl with other tyrosine phosphoproteins, notably Cbl. Although Crkii is also expressed at high levels in Ba/F3 cells, compared with Crkl, Crkii was only minimally tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin cross-linking and was less involved in forming new protein-protein complexes. Transient overexpression of intact Crkl enhanced spontaneous migration on fibronectin-coated surfaces but not on uncoated surfaces. The role of the SH2 and SH3 domains of Crkl were further explored by creating specific deletion mutants and transiently overexpressing these mutants as GFP fusion proteins in Ba/F3 cells. Interestingly, deletion of the SH2 domain resulted in loss of the migration-enhancing properties of intact Crkl but did not, at least at the levels of expression achieved in the present studies in Ba/F3 cells, generate a dominant-negative mutant. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal, but not the C-terminal, SH3 domain both resulted in loss of the migration-enhancing effects of Crkl and reduced spontaneous migration below control levels. However, the effects of overexpressing Crkl were limited to spontaneous migration, because after the addition of a strong chemoattractant, the chemokine SDF-1Î±, overexpression of Crkl or Crkl mutants had no additional affects.The results presented here suggest that Crkl plays a similar role in Ba/F3 cells to that of Crkii in epithelial carcinoma cells (44Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). As shown here, overexpression of Crkii in Ba/F3 cells also enhanced migration, but to a substantially less degree than did Crkl. These results suggest that Crkl may be more significantly involved in integrin signaling and migration in hematopoietic cells, whereas Crkii is more important in non-hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, overexpression of Crkl, but not Crkii, has been reported to transform fibroblasts (45Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 46Senechal K. Halpern J. Sawyers C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Overall, our results significantly extend the understanding of the functions of Crkl and provide additional evidence that Crkl is involved in signaling pathways that involve integrins.Potential mechanisms to explain the migration-enhancing effects of Crkl were explored by identifying the major cellular proteins that associate with the CrklÎSH2 domain after integrin ligation and by overexpression studies of some of the known proteins that constitutively bind to the Crkl SH3 domains. The major Crkl SH2-binding phosphoprotein was identified as Cbl, a proto-oncogene with multiple YXXP phosphorylation sites that serve as CrklÎSH2-binding sites (47Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar). v-Cbl is the transforming gene of the Cas NS-1 virus, which causes lymphomas in mice (48Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Cbl is the mammalian homologue of the Sli-1 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans that is involved in negative regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (49Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the Cbl locus in mice results in hyperplasia of T cells, extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, and ductal hyperplasia of mammary tissue (50Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G. Venter D.J. Barnett L. Bertoncello I. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that Cbl directs ubiquitination and degradation of ligand-internalized epidermal growth factor receptors in mammalian cells, whereas v-Cbl induces epidermal growth factor receptor recycling to the surface (51Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar).Cbl has also been associated with integrin signaling and the cytoskeleton. Cbl is prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin-mediated adhesion in many cell types (27Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Uemura N. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14320-14326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 52Ojaniemi M. Langdon W.Y. Vuori K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is localized to the cytoplasm and has been shown to interact directly with several cytoskeletal proteins, although the significance of these interactions is unclear (53Robertson H. Langdon W.Y. Thien C.B. Bowtell D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Oncogenic forms of Cbl abrogate anchorage dependence of fibroblasts for proliferation (52Ojaniemi M. Langdon W.Y. Vuori K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After integrin ligation, Cbl forms complexes with other proteins involved in cytoskeletal functional regulation, including Src and PI3K (54Ojaniemi M. Martin S.S. Dolfi F. Olefsky J.M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3780-3787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the role of Cbl in regulating migration is unclear. In our study, overexpression of Cbl in Ba/F3 cells did alter short-term adhesion or spontaneous migration, although Cbl is already a relatively abundant protein in these cells. The association and activation of PI3K by Cbl may provide a pathway that links Crkl to adhesion and migration, and further studies are warranted to explore this possibility.A second well known target of the Crkl SH2 domain is Cas, which is likely to be involved in integrin signaling and regulation in some cell types. Cas was discovered as a Crk-binding protein, and has multiple YXXP motifs for binding Crk SH2 domains. Like Cbl, Cas functions as a docking protein after integrin ligation, interacting with 14â3-3 proteins (53Robertson H. Langdon W.Y. Thien C.B. Bowtell D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 55Liu Y. Liu Y.C. Meller N. Giampa L. Elly C. Doyle M. Altman A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7095-7101PubMed Google Scholar). In transient expression assays, Crk-Cas complexes have been shown to activate c-Jun kinase through activation of p21 rac (56Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In these cells, activation of Rac was believed to occur through DOCK180, which was brought to Cas by Crkii (41Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Homologues of DOCK180 in both Drosophila melanogaster (Myoblast City) and C. elegans (ced-5) have also been linked to the formation of cell extensions, migration, or both (57Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac is frequently associated with enhanced migration and adhesion and would explain the enhanced migration of cells transiently overexpressing Crkl (41Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y.

However, DOCK180 is not expressed at detectable levels in Ba/F3 and many other hematopoietic cell lines, suggesting that either a related protein exists or that there are other pathways involved. Of note, v-Crk does not activate Rac in PC12 cells but does activate Rho, thereby inducing cell spreading and focal adhesion formation (58Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. de Graaf P. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner J.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Overexpression of another Crkl SH3-binding protein, C3G, did enhance spontaneous migration but only when expressed with Crkl. C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small G protein Rap1, also known as smg p21 or Krev-1, originally identified as an anti-oncogenic protein capable of reversing the morphologic transformation of fibroblasts by v-Ki-Ras (59Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Rap1 is likely to antagonize Ras by competition with the effector domain. Binding of either Crk or Crkl SH3 domains to C3G has been shown to activate the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G (36Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), possibly by inducing translocation to the membrane or other sites. The functions of C3G and Rap1 are incompletely understood, but both have been associated with adhesion or migration. C3G is tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin stimulation in normal cells (35de Jong R. van Wijk A. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C3G can interact directly with Cas through the SH3 domain of Cas, in addition to an indirect interaction through Crk or Crkl (60Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rap1 has been shown to be activated during cell adhesion, and the basal Rap1 activity is cell density-dependent (32Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, direct links between C3G, Rap1, and the regulation of adhesion or migration have not been reported. The results presented here suggest that additional studies on the role of C3G and Rap1 and integrin signaling, adhesion, and migration are warranted.Overall, the present report suggests that Crkl plays a prominent role in mediating integrin-mediated signals in hematopoietic cells and further suggest that the functions of Crkl and Crkii are, at least in part, distinct. In non-hematopoietic cells, integrin-induced formation of Cas-Crk complexes activates migration, possibly through bringing DOCK180 to the cytoskeleton or membrane (44Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, Cbl-Crkl complexes predominate, but downstream signals are unclear. C3G is proposed as one pathway that can induce migration through this complex. Crkl is likely to link C3G to Cbl after integrin cross-linking, because Cbl is the predominant target of the Crkl SH2 domain in hematopoietic cells. In cells transformed by tyrosine kinase oncogenes such as p210BCR-ABL, Crkl and Cbl are constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and form a permanent complex independent of integrin activation (17Uemura N. Salgia R. Li J.L. Pisick E. Sattler M. Griffin J.D. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). This complex is likely to contribute to the abnormal adhesion and migration exhibited by BCR/ABL transformed hematopoietic cells. Crkl is a 39-kDa adapter protein containing one SH2 and two SH3 domains. The Crkl gene was originally identified by ten Hoeve et al. (1ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar) and found to have an overall amino acid homology of 60% to Crkii, one of two proteins generated through alternative splicing of the human Crk proto-oncogene. Both Crkl and Crk are related to v-Crk, the oncogene in the avian retrovirus CT10. Crkl has been shown to be involved in a number of signaling pathways, including pathways activated by T cell stimulation, integrin cross-linking, and hematopoietic cytokine receptor activation (2Arai A.

When epitope-tagged NHE3 was stably expressed in NHE-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, a sizable fraction was found in recycling endosomes. This system was used to analyze the mechanism of endocytosis of NHE3. Immunofluorescence and radiolabeling experiments showed that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis using hypertonicity, acid treatment, or K+ depletion inhibited internalization of NHE3. Moreover, transient transfection of an inhibitory mutant of dynamin (DynS45N) blocked the clathrin-mediated uptake of transferrin, as well as the endocytosis of NHE3. In ileal villus cells, endogenous NHE3 was also found to co-purify with isolated clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby confirming their association in native tissues. The role of COP-I subunits in the intracellular traffic of NHE3 was evaluated usingldlF cells, which bear a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Îµ-COP subunit. At the permissive temperature, NHE3 distributed normally, whereas at the restrictive temperature, which induces rapid degradation of Îµ-COP, NHE3 was still internalized, but its subcellular distribution was altered. These results indicate that endocytosis of NHE3 occurs primarily via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles and that normal intracellular trafficking of NHE3 involves an Îµ-COP-dependent step.

Na+/H+ exchange is electroneutral and is therefore driven by the combined chemical gradients of Na+and H+. NHE plays an important role in the maintenance of intracellular pH (pH i) and in the regulation of cell volume. In epithelial cells, where the exchangers are particularly abundant, they are essential for the vectorial transport of salt and water. To date, six mammalian NHE isoforms have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). NHE1 is widely expressed and is generally considered to be the âhousekeepingâ isoform primarily responsible for pH i homeostasis. NHE2â5 have a more restricted tissue distribution, whereas NHE6 is ubiquitous and present in mitochondria. Of these, NHE2 and NHE3 are predominantly epithelial isoforms, which are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney (2Wang Z. Orlowski J. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

NHE1 is located almost entirely in the basolateral side of the cell (8Bookstein C. DePaoli A. Xie Y. Niu P. Musch M.W. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. J. Clin.

Interestingly, unlike NHE1 and NHE2 which are expressed primarily at the plasma membrane, immunolocalization experiments have revealed a significant intracellular pool of NHE3. In native epithelia (16Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J.

These direct immunolocalization studies confirmed earlier suggestions that NHE was also present and functional in endomembranes. Fractionation studies in conjunction with either transport (17Sabolic I. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1245-F1253PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hilden S.A. Ghoshroy K.B. Madias N.E. Am. J.

Na+/H+ exchange in these endomembranes was reported to be amiloride-resistant (19van Dyke R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C943-C954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a characteristic of the NHE3 isoform. An intracellular pool of antiporters may provide a source for the rapid mobilization of transporters to the plasma membrane in response to stimulation, thereby affording the cell a powerful and versatile mechanism for regulating NHE3 activity. Indeed, chronic acidosis, prolonged hyperosmolarity, and responsiveness to angiotensin II have been shown to increase plasmalemmal NHE3 activity, with minimal increase in mRNA expression (22Laghmani K. Borensztein P. Ambuhl P. Froissart M. Bichara M. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Paillard M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Ambuhl P. Amemiya M. Danczkay M.

Contrib. Nephrol. 1993; 101: 19-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Shuttling of NHE3 between the plasmalemmal and endosomal pools may well be responsible for this effect. Despite the apparent importance of NHE3 internalization and recycling, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. This is due in large part to the difficulties involved in discerning the internal and superficial pools of NHE3 in epithelial systems, which are also rather refractory to transfection. The partition of NHE3 in an intracellular vesicular compartment was replicated when NHE3 was heterologously transfected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (25D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F.

While exchangers were present and active at the plasma membrane, a sizable fraction was found in a juxtanuclear vesicular complex that co-localized with internalized transferrin and with cellubrevin, hallmarks of the recycling endosomal compartment. By transfecting a modified NHE3 bearing an external epitope, Kurashimaet al. (26Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were able to quantify the fraction of exchangers in endomembranes and to monitor their traffic. They found that NHE3 is internalized continuously and that recycling to the surface is responsible for maintaining a constant number of plasmalemmal transporters. Several mechanisms are utilized to internalize plasma membrane proteins, including clathrin-mediated coated vesicle formation (27Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), generation of caveolae (28Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol.

Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar), and actin-dependent macropinocytosis. The pathway(s) utilized by NHE3 have not been defined. The purpose of the current study was to identify the mechanism(s) that mediate NHE3 internalization and to analyze the factors required for recycling of the internalized exchangers to the plasma membrane. To this end, we used cells heterologously transfected with rat NHE3 that was externally tagged with a triple HA epitope. Pharmacological and transfection experiments indicate that NHE3 is largely internalized via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. The presence of NHE3 in coated vesicles was confirmed in intestinal cells from rabbits, implying that clathrin is also involved in NHE3 internalization in native epithelia. Nigericin, rhodamine-conjugated human transferrin (Tfn), and the acetoxymethyl ester of 2â²7â²-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The plasmid containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP) was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to clathrin, adaptor proteins 1 and 2 (AP-1 and AP-2), and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the heavy chain of clathrin and the influenza virus HA epitope (YPYDVPDYAS) were from ICN and Babco (Richmond, CA), respectively. The anti-NHE3 antibody (Clone 2B9) was a kind gift from Dr. D. Biemesderfer (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Cy3-labeled IgG were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and goat anti-mouse I125-labeled IgG from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Ficoll 400 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and sucrose was from Fisher. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 10 KCl, 8 sodium phosphate, 2 potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Na+-rich solution contained (in mm): 117 NaCl, 1.66 MgSO4, 1.36 CaCl2, 5.36 KCl, 25 HEPES, 5.55 glucose. Na+-free,N-methyl-d-glucammonium solution was made by equimolar substitution of NaCl byN-methyl-d-glucammonium-Cl. All solutions were nominally bicarbonate-free, titrated to pH 7.4, and were adjusted to 290 Â± 10 mosm with the major salt. AP-1 is a cell line derived from wild-type CHO cells that are devoid of endogenous Na+/H+exchanger activity (31Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 267: C1158-C1165Crossref Google Scholar). AP1/NHE3â²38HA3 cells are AP-1 cells stably transfected with rat NHE3 containing a triple HA tag in the first extracellular loop following residue 38 (26Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J.

AP1/NHE3â²38HA3 cells and ldlF cells were grown in Î±-minimal essential medium (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) containing 25 mm NaHCO3 and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). AP-1 cells were incubated in a humidified environment containing 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. ldlF cells were grown at 34 Â°C. To induce the mutant Îµ-COP phenotype, these cells were incubated at 39 Â°C for 8â12 h prior to assay. Cultures were re-established from frozen stocks regularly and cells from passages 3 to 20 were used for the experiments. The cDNAs encoding wild-type dynamin I and the S45N mutant (DynS45N) subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector were a gift of Dr. S. Schmid (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). To facilitate detection by immunostaining, both dynamin constructs were HA-tagged at the amino terminus. Rat NHE3â²38HA3 subcloned into the pCMV vector has been described previously (26Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All vectors were transformed into DH5Î± E. coli, grown in Luria broth with the appropriate selection antibiotics, and purified using commercially available kits (Qiagen Maxiprep, Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For transient expression experiments, cells were grown to 30â40% confluence on 25-mm glass coverslips. The vectors of interest were co-transfected with pEGFP at a 10:1 ratio, which enabled us to positively identify the transfectants. All cells were transfected at 37 Â°C, with the exception of the ldlF cells, which where maintained at the permissive temperature of 34 Â°C throughout the transfection protocol. Immunofluorescence and microfluorimetry were performed 24â48 h post-transfection. Three different procedures were used to prevent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Hypertonic challenge was performed according to Hansen et al. (35Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Briefly, the normal growth medium was replaced with HEPES-buffered medium supplemented with 0.45 m sucrose for 15 min at 37 Â°C, prior to estimation of NHE3 distribution. A second procedure, involving depletion of intracellular K+, was modified from Hansen et al. (35Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J.

Cells were washed three times with K+-free medium (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 g/liter d-glucose), then shocked for 5 min with hypotonic K+-free solution (1:1 K+-free medium:H2O) at room temperature. Cells were washed 3-fold with K+-free medium and allowed to incubate in the same medium for an additional 15 min at 37 Â°C. Acid treatment was also used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (35Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In this case the cells were treated with Na+ medium supplemented with 5 mm acetic acid, pH 5.0, for 10 min at room temperature prior to the assay, which was carried out in the same medium. To localize total NHE3 or to verify the expression of dynamin by immunofluorescence, the cells were washed three times with PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 20 min. Incubation with anti-HA antibody (1/1000) for 1 h at room temperature was followed by extensive washes with PBS, blocking for 1 h with 10% goat serum, and then incubating for 1 h with 1/1000 goat Cy3 anti-mouse antibody. The coverslips were mounted using Dako Fluorescence Mounting Medium. To assess internalization of the antiporter, intact NHE3â²38HA3-expressing cells were incubated for 45â60 min at 37 Â°C with anti-HA antibody (1/1000) in HEPES-buffered medium supplemented with 10% goat serum. Unbound antibody was removed by extensive washes with cold PBS, and the cells were then fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and labeled with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody as above. Where specified, incubation with the primary anti-HA antibody was performed at 4 Â°C, followed by varying times of internalization in the absence of added antibody. To assess recycling of Tfn receptors, cells grown on 25-mm coverslips were first incubated in serum-free HEPES-buffered medium for at least 30 min to deplete endogenous Tfn. Next, the cells were incubated with 20 Î¼g/ml rhodamine-conjugated human Tfn for 45â60 min at 37 Â°C. Unbound Tfn was washed extensively with PBS and the cells were fixed for 45 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted as described above. Cells were visualized using the 100Ã objective of a Leica DM1RB fluorescence microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a Micromax cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ), operated from a Dell computer using Winview software (Princeton Instruments). Digitized images were cropped using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.). All images are representative of at least three separate experiments. Quantitation of recycling of NHE3â²38HA3 was performed using I125-labeled anti-mouse IgG. AP1/NHE3â²38HA3 cells were grown to 80â90% confluence on six-well plastic dishes. The cells were then incubated at 4 Â°C for 1 h or at 37 Â°C for the time periods indicated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1/1000) in medium supplemented with 10% goat serum. Internalization was terminated by extensive washes with ice-cold PBS wash buffer (PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2and 1 mm MgCl2), and the preparation was blocked by incubation with wash buffer supplemented with 10% goat serum for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The cells were then labeled with mouse I125-IgG (0.8 Î¼Ci/ml) for 1 h at 4 Â°C, followed by removal of unbound I125-IgG by extensive washing with ice cold wash buffer. Last, the cells were eluted from the culture dish with 1 ml of 2 m formic acid. Cells exposed only to I125-IgG without prior incubation with anti-HA antibody were used as background controls. Radioactivity was counted using a 1282 Compugamma LKB Î³ counter. Data were analyzed using Microcal Originâ¢ and are presented as means Â± S.E. Significance was assessed using Student's t test. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) were isolated from rabbit liver and from ileal villus cells by differential centrifugation using a protocol adapted from Campbell et al. (37Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Linder R. Cells J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1994: 525-530Google Scholar). This method initially yields crude clathrin-coated vesicles that are ideally suited for further purification using a sucrose gradient. Following this protocol, highly enriched CCV (80â90% pure) are obtained (38Linder R. Cells J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1994: 525-530Google Scholar). The major contaminants are ferritin and some filamentous material (39Pearse B.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ileal villus cells were isolated by a modification of the method of Weiser (40Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as reported previously (41Khurana S. Kreydiyyeh S. Aronzon A. Hoogerwerf W.A. Rhee S.G. Donowitz M. Cohen M.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All procedures for the purification of CCV were done at 4 Â°C. The isolated cells were homogenized in 20 volumes of buffer containing 0.1 m MES, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA and 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.5 (buffer A), with protease inhibitors, using a Dounce homogenizer. For isolation of CCV from liver, the tissue was homogenized in the same buffer using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8000 Ã g for 50 min at 4 Â°C and the supernatant saved. The supernatant was sedimented at 186,000 Ã g for 60 min. The pellet was homogenized with buffer A in a Potter-Elvehjem apparatus and mixed with an equal volume of Ficoll-sucrose solution (both at a final concentration of 12.5% in buffer A, pH 6.5). The redissolved pellet was centrifuged at 40,000 Ã g for 40 min and the supernatant saved. The pellet from this fraction was again resuspended in Ficoll-sucrose as described above, centrifuged, and the supernatant saved. The supernatants were pooled and mixed with 3â4 volumes of buffer A and centrifuged at 186,000 Ã g for 60 min. The pellet represented the CCV preparation. The pellet was resuspended in 1â2 volumes of buffer A layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (from the bottom: 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%) and centrifuged at 50,000 Ã g for 2 h at 4 Â°C. Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie blue staining and by immunoblotting. CCV were enriched in the 10â20% fraction of the gradient. Cytosolic pH was measured in BCECF-loaded cells by either microfluorimetry or by ratio imaging, essentially as described (25D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F. Moore H.-P. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 42Chow C.W. Kapus A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All measurements of pH i were performed at 37 Â°C. Calibration of the fluorescence intensity to pH i was performed in the presence of 5 Î¼mnigericin in high potassium medium (140 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose) as described previously (43Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Each coverslip was calibrated at the end of the experiment using at least three pH values. To facilitate the assessment of NHE3 traffic between the plasmalemmal and intracellular pools, we inserted an HA epitope tag in the predicted first extracellular loop of the protein (between residues 38 and 39). An extracellular epitope was essential to detect NHE3 in intact (nonpermeabilized) cells and thereby quantify its rate and extent of internalization. Using heterologous expression in antiport-deficient AP-1 cells, we have shown that the insertion of the HA tag in this position does not measurably alter the expression or ion exchange properties of NHE3 (26Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When expressed in AP1 cells, the externally tagged exchanger, named NHE3â²38HA3, was found to accumulate in a pericentriolar compartment (Fig. 1 A). This coincides with the distribution of the carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged form of NHE3, which was described earlier to reside in recycling endosomes (25D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F. Moore H.-P. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The similar localization of the two forms of the exchanger implies that the placement of epitope tags has little effect on NHE3 targeting. Binding of anti-HA antibody to the external epitope was used next to monitor the distribution of the exchangers. It was essential to ascertain that the binding of antibody to NHE3 would not by itself alter the behavior of the exchangers. The effect of the antibody on NHE3 distribution was assessed first. NHE3â²38HA3transfectants were incubated with the antibody and the cells were then incubated at 37 Â°C for 45 min to allow internalization to proceed. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with secondary antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, the distribution of NHE3 resembles that observed in untreated cells which were fixed and permeabilized prior to immunostaining (cf. Fig. 1,A and B). Thus, binding of monoclonal antibody to the extracellular epitope did not alter the subcellular distribution of NHE3â²38HA3, implying normal traffic within the cell. We also determined whether the antibody alters Na+/H+ exchange across the plasma membrane. Cells were initially incubated in the cold in the presence or absence of a concentration of antibody determined earlier to saturate all the available extracellular epitope sites. Na+/H+exchange activity was then estimated by microfluorimetric measurement of pH i using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF. Following an acute acid load imposed by a 50 mm NH4Cl prepulse, we measured the pH i recovery induced by superfusion with Na+. Comparison of traces 1 and 2 in Fig. 1 C illustrates that engagement of the external epitope by the antibody had no discernible effect on the rate of ion exchange mediated by NHE3â²38HA3. While binding of antibody to the exchangers exposed at the surface had little effect on their transport activity, it was conceivable that prolonged exposure at physiological temperature might induce cross-linking and redistribution of the exchangers, possibly altering their number at the plasmalemma. To rule out this possibility, AP1/NHE3â²38HA3 cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody for 30 min at 37 Â°C, thereby allowing endocytosis to proceed. The activity of NHE3 was measured subsequently, as described above. This pretreatment had no significant effect on the rate of Na+/H+ exchange (Fig. 1 C,trace 3), suggesting that the overall distribution of NHE3 was unaltered, a conclusion consistent with the morphological determinations reported in Fig. 1, A and B. In summary, our data imply that neither the introduction of the external HA-tag nor binding of monoclonal antibody to the external epitope had any effect on the subcellular distribution or activity of NHE3. To study the route of internalization used by NHE3, it was important to define its normal time course of endocytosis. Initial determinations were made by immunofluorescence methods that involved labeling the surface-exposed exchangers in the cold using anti-HA antibody and then allowing internalization upon rewarming. After varying times, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with labeled secondary antibodies. Typical r"

In an effort to identify new human kallikrein genes, we examined a genomic area of about 300 kilobases on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4, a region that contains most of the currently known kallikreins. By using the positional candidate approach, we were able to identify a new gene named KLK-L2(for kallikrein- like gene 2). Screening of human EST libraries allowed us to delineate the full genomic and cDNA structure of the new gene. KLK-L2 consists of 5 coding exons and 4 introns and has significant similarities to other members of the kallikrein multi-gene family. Homology studies suggest that the protein is likely secreted. KLK-L2 is expressed mainly in breast, brain, and testis and to a lesser extent in many other tissues. KLK-L2is up-regulated by estrogens and progestins in the breast cancer cell line BT-474.

Traditional procedures for new gene identification, such as CpG island mapping and cross-species hybridization will soon be replaced by methods that are based on accumulating knowledge of chromosomal localization of genes and increasing amounts of nucleotide sequence data (1Boehm T. Methods. 1998; 14: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Positional candidate cloning is a new approach for gene discovery that combines the knowledge of map position with the increasingly dense human transcript maps and the available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (2Collins F.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The kallikreins are a group of serine proteases involved in the post-translational processing of polypeptide precursors (3Clements J. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 71-97Crossref Google Scholar). This enzyme family primarily consists of plasma kallikrein and tissue or glandular kallikreins. Plasma kallikrein is encoded by a single gene that is structurally different from the genes encoding tissue kallikreins. The tissue kallikreins comprise a large multigene family of enzymes in rodents, with a highly conserved sequence and tertiary structures. In the mouse genome, at least 24 genes have been identified (4Evans B.A. Drinkwater C.C. Richards R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8027-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar family of 15â20 kallikreins has been found in the rat genome (5Ashley P.L. MacDonald R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4520-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The structural organization of the kallikrein genes includes five coding exons and is highly conserved in all species studied thus far (6Lin F.K. Lin C.H. Chou C.C. Chen K. Lu H.S. Bacheller W. Herrera C. Jones T. Chao J. Chao L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In humans, the kallikrein gene family locus is on chromosome 19q13 (7Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. Suurmeijer L Cleutjens C.B. Trapman J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. Klaassen P. van der Korput J.A. Geurts van Kessel A. Romijn J.C. Trapman J.

Genomics. 1991; 11: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a region that is syntenic to the mouse tissue kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 7 (10Nadeau J.H. Davisson M.T. Doolittle D.P. Grant P. Hillyard A.L. Kosowsky M.R. Roderick T.H. Mamm. Genome. 1992; 3: 480-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, in marked contrast to the large rodent kallikrein gene family, the human kallikrein gene family was, until recently, composed of three genes. From Southern blot analysis, the size of this family has been suggested to vary from just 3â4 genes (11Fukushima D. Kitamura N. Nakanishi S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8037-8043Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Baker A.R. Shine J. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to as many as 19 genes (13Murray S.R. Chao J. Lin F. Chao L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1990; 15 (suppl.): 7-15Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, a few new putative members of the human kallikrein gene family have been discovered such as the zyme (14Little S.P. Dixon E.P. Norris F. Buckley W. Becker G.W. Johnson M. Dobbins J.R. Wyrick T. Miller J.R. MacKellar W. Hepburn D. Corvalan J. McClure D. Liu X. Stephenson D. Clemens J. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar), and neurosin (18Yoshida S. Taniguchi M. Hirata A. Shiosaka S. Gene. 1998; 213: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In our efforts to study the role of the kallikrein gene family in the initiation and/or progression of cancer, we have analyzed a 300-kb1 genomic region on chromosome 19q13.3 -q13.4 and identified a new gene namedKLK-L2 (for kallikrein-like gene 2). In this study, we describe the identification of the new gene, its genomic and mRNA structure, its precise location in relation to other known kallikreins, and its tissue expression pattern. We have obtained sequencing data of approximately 300 kb of nucleotides on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 from the web site of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This sequence was in the form of nine contigs of different lengths. We performed a restriction analysis study of the available sequences using the WebCutter computer program, and with the aid of theEcoRI restriction map of this area (also available from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) we constructed an almost contiguous stretch of genomic sequences. We identified the relative positions of the known kallikrein genes PSA (GenBankâ¢ accession number X14810), KLK2 (GenBankâ¢ accession numberM18157), and zyme (GenBankâ¢ accession number U60801) by using the alignment program BLAST 2 (19Altschul S.F.

We used a number of computer programs to predict the presence of putative new genes in the genomic area of interest. We initially tested these programs using the known genomic sequences of the PSA, protease M, andNES1 genes. The most reliable computer programs GeneBuilder, Grail 2, and GENEID-3 were selected for further use. The predicted exons of the putative new gene were subjected to homology search using the BLASTN algorithm (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. SchaÌffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Open table in a new tab The breast cancer cell line BT-474 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA. Cells were cultured in RPMI media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with glutamine (200 mmol/liter), bovine insulin (10 mg/liter), fetal bovine serum (10%), antibiotics, and antimycotics, in plastic flasks to near confluency. The cells were then aliquoted into 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured to 50% confluency. 24 h before the experiments, the culture media were changed into phenol red-free media containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. For stimulation experiments, various steroid hormones dissolved in 100% ethanol were added into the culture media, at a final concentration of 10â8m. Cells stimulated with 100% ethanol were included as controls. The cells were cultured for 24 h, then harvested for mRNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the breast cancer cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. 2 Î¼g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using the SuperscriptTM preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The final volume was 20 Î¼l. Based on the combined information obtained from the predicted genomic structure of the new gene and the EST sequences, two gene-specific primers were designed (Table II), and PCR was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 1 Î¼l of cDNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 Î¼m dNTPs (deoxynucleoside triphosphates), 150 ng of primers, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler. The cycling conditions were 94 Â°C for 9 min to activate the Taq Gold DNA polymerase followed by 43 cycles of 94 Â°C for 30 s, 63 Â°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 63 Â°C for 10 min. Equal amounts of PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. All primers for RT-PCR spanned at least two exons to avoid contamination by genomic DNA. To verify the identity of the PCR products, they were cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The inserts were sequenced from both directions using vector-specific primers with an automated DNA sequencer. Multiple alignment was performed using the Clustal X software package and the multiple alignment program available from the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Phylogenetic studies were performed using the Phylip software package. Distance matrix analysis was performed using the Neighbor-Joining/UPGMA program, and parsimony analysis was done using the Protpars program. A hydrophobicity study was performed using the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher programs. Signal peptide was predicted using the SignalP server. Protein structure analysis was performed by SAPS (structural analysis of protein sequence) program. Computer analysis of the genomic sequence predicted a putative new gene consisting of four exons. This gene was detected by all programs used, and all exons had high prediction scores. EST sequence homology search of the putative exons against the human EST data base (dbEST) revealed nine EST clones from different tissues with >95% identity to the putative exons of our gene (Table I). Positive clones were obtained, and the inserts were sequenced from both directions. The Blast 2 sequences program was used to compare the EST sequences with the predicted exons, and final selection of the exon-intron splice sites was done according to the EST sequences. The presence of many areas of overlap between the various EST sequences allowed us to further verify the structure of the new gene. The coding and genomic sequence of the gene has been deposited in GenBankâ¢ (accession number AF135028). The 3â² end of the gene was verified by the presence of poly(A) stretches that are not present in the genomic sequence at the end of two of the sequenced ESTs. One of the sequenced ESTs revealed the presence of an additional exon at the 5â² end. The nucleotide sequence of this exon matches exactly with the genomic sequence. To further identify the 5â² end of the gene, 5â²-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed, but no additional sequence could be obtained. However, as is the case with other kallikreins, the presence of further up-stream untranslated exon(s) could not be excluded. Alignment of KLK-L2 gene and the sequences of other known kallikrein genes within the 300-kb area of interest enabled us to precisely localize all genes and to determine the direction of transcription, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 1. The PSA gene was found to be the most centromeric, separated by 12,508 base pairs (bp) from KLK2, and both genes are transcribed in the same direction (centromere to telomere). The prostase/KLK-L1 gene (GenBankâ¢ accession number AF135023) is 26,229 bp more telomeric and transcribes in the opposite direction, followed by KLK-L2. The distance betweenKLK-L1 and KLK-L2 is about 35 kb; however, we could not establish it more precisely due to the presence of a gap in the genomic sequence. The zyme gene is 5,981 bp more telomeric, and the latter 3 genes are all transcribed in the same direction (Fig. 1). The KLK-L2 gene, as presented in Fig. 2, is formed of 5 coding exons and 4 intervening introns, spanning an area of 9,349 bp of genomic sequence on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. The lengths of the exons are 73, 262, 257, 134, and 156 bp. The intron/exon splice sites (mGT â¦ AGm) and their flanking sequences are closely related to the consensus splicing sites (mGTAAGT â¦ CAGm, where m is any nucleotide) (21Iida Y. J. Theor.

The presumptive protein-coding region of the KLK-L2 gene is formed of a 879-bp nucleotide sequence encoding a deduced 293-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa. There are two potential translation initiation codons (ATG) at positions 1 and 25 of the predicted first exon (numbers refer to GenBankâ¢ accession number AF135028). We assume that the first ATG will be the initiation codon, since 1) the flanking sequence of that codon (GCGGCCATGG) matches closely with the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of translation (GCC(A/G)CCATGG) (22Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) and is exactly the same as that of the homologous zyme gene. (15Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol.

The cDNA ends with a 328-bp 3â²-untranslated region containing a conserved polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) which was located 11 bp up-stream of the poly(A) tail (at a position exactly the same as that of the zyme poly(A) tail) (14Little S.P.

By computer analysis, a 29-amino acid signal peptide is predicted with a cleavage site at the carboxyl end of Ala29. For better characterization of the predicted structural motif of the KLK-L2 protein, it was aligned with other members of the kallikrein multi-gene family, (Fig. 3), and the predicted signal peptide cleavage site was found to match with the predicted signal cleavage sites of zyme (14Little S.P.

Also, sequence alignment supports by analogy the presence of a cleavage site at the carboxyl end of Ser66, which is the exact site predicted for cleavage of the activation peptide of all the other kallikreins aligned in Fig. 3. Interestingly, the starting amino acid sequence of the mature protein IING(E/S)DC is conserved in the prostase and enamel matrix serine proteinase 1 (EMSP) genes. Thus, like other kallikreins, KLK-L2 is likely also synthesized as a pre-proenzyme that contains an N-terminal signal peptide (prezymogen) followed by an activation peptide and the enzymatic domain. The presence of aspartate (D) in position 239 suggests that KLK-L2 will possess a trypsin-like cleavage pattern like most of the other kallikreins (e.g. KLK1, KLK2, trypsin-like serine protease (TLSP), neuropsin, zyme, prostase, and EMSP) but different from PSA, which has a serine (S) residue in the corresponding position and is known to have a chymotrypsin-like activity (Fig. 3) (3Clements J. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 71-97Crossref Google Scholar). The dotted region in Fig. 3 indicates an 11-amino acid loop characteristic of the classical kallikreins (PSA, KLK1, andKLK2) but not found in KLK-L2 or other members of the kallikrein-like gene family (14Little S.P. Dixon E.P. Norris F. Buckley W. Becker G.W. Johnson M. Dobbins J.R. Wyrick T. Miller J.R. MacKellar W. Hepburn D. Corvalan J. McClure D. Liu X. Stephenson D. Clemens J. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol.

We aligned the mature 227-amino acid sequence of the predicted protein against the GenBankâ¢ data base and the known kallikreins using the BLASTP and BLAST 2 sequence programs. KLK-L2 is found to have 54% amino acid sequence identity and 68% similarity with the EMSP1 gene, 50% identity with both TLSP and neuropsin genes, and 47, 46, and 42% identity with trypsinogen, zyme, and PSA genes, respectively. Multiple alignment study shows that the typical catalytic triad of serine proteases is conserved in the KLK-L2 gene (His108, Asp153, and Ser245), and as is the case with all other kallikreins, a well conserved peptide motif is found around the amino acid residues of the catalytic triad (i.e. histidine (WLLTAAHC), serine(GDSGGP), and aspartate(DLMLI)) (14Little S.P.

Twelve cysteine residues are present in the putative mature KLK-L2 protein; 10 of them are conserved in all the serine proteases that are aligned in Fig. 3 and would be expected to form disulfide bridges. The other two cysteines (Cys178 and Cys279) are not found in PSA, KLK1, KLK2 or trypsinogen; however, they are found in similar positions in prostase, EMSP1, zyme, neuropsin, andTLSP genes and are expected to form an additional disulfide bond. Twenty-nine âinvariantâ amino acids surrounding the active site of serine proteases have been described (26Dayhoff M.O. Fed. Proc. 1976; 35: 2132-2138PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, 26 are conserved in KLK-L2. One of the nonconserved amino acids (Ser210 instead of Pro) is also found in prostase andEMSP1 genes, the second (Leu103 instead of Val) is also found in TLSP gene, and the third (Val174 instead of Leu) is also not conserved in prostase or EMSP1 genes. According to protein evolution studies, each of these amino acid changes represents a conserved evolutionary substitution to a protein of the same group (26Dayhoff M.O. Fed.

To predict the phylogenetic relatedness of the KLK-L2 gene with other serine proteases, the amino acid sequences of the kallikrein genes were aligned together using the Clustal X multiple alignment program, and a distance matrix tree was predicted using the Neighbor-joining/UPGMA method (Fig. 4). Phylogenetic analysis separated the classical kallikreins (KLK1, KLK2, and PSA) and grouped theKLK-L2 with prostase/KLK-L1, EMSP1, and TLSP, in consistence with previously published studies (25Nelson P.S.

As shown in Table III and Fig. 5, the KLK-L2 gene is primarily expressed in the brain, mammary gland, and testis, but lower levels of expression are found in many other tissues. To verify the RT-PCR specificity, the PCR products were cloned and sequenced.Table IIITissue expression of KLK-L2 by RT-PCR analysisExpression levelHighMediumLowNo expressionBrainSalivary glandUterusStomachMammary glandFetal brainLungAdrenal glandTestisThymusHeartColonProstateFetal liverSkeletal muscleThyroidSpleenTracheaPlacentaCerebellumLiverSpinal cordPancreasSmall intestineKidneyBone marrow Open table in a new tab A steroid hormone receptor positive breast cancer cell line (BT-474) was used as a model to verify whether the KLK-L2 gene is under steroid hormone regulation. PSA was used as a control known to be up-regulated by androgens and progestins, and pS2 was used as an estrogen up-regulated control. Our results indicate that KLK-L2 is up-regulated by estrogens and progestins (Fig. 6). Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases that play important roles in diverse physiological processes (3Clements J. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 71-97Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, some of the kallikrein genes were found to be linked to the development and/or progression of different types of malignancies. Human kallikrein 3 (KLK3/PSA) is the best diagnostic and prognostic marker for prostate cancer to date (29Diamandis E.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 310-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30Oesterling J.E. J. Urol. 1991; 145: 907-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Recombinant KLK2 has been shown to activate PSA in vitro (31Takayama T.K Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21582-21588Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and the combination of KLK2 and free PSA has recently been found to increase the discrimination between prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with moderately elevated total PSA levels (32Stenman U. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 753-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NES1 appears to be a tumor suppressor gene (33Goyal J. Smith K.M. Cowan J.M. Wazer D.E. Lee S.W. Band V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4782-4786PubMed Google Scholar), and zyme (protease M/neurosin) may be important in the establishment of breast and ovarian tumors and may function later in progression as a potential metastatic inhibitor (15Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 624-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least three kallikrein genes (PSA, NES1, and zyme) are down-regulated in breast cancer. In search for new genes that may be involved in malignant diseases, we investigated the possible existence of new kallikreins. Based on mapping of the rodent kallikrein genes and the documented strong conservation between the human chromosome 19q13.1-q13.4 region and the 17 loci in a 20-centimorgan proximal part of mouse chromosome 7 (10Nadeau J.H. Davisson M.T. Doolittle D.P. Grant P. Hillyard A.L. Kosowsky M.R. Roderick T.H. Mamm. Genome. 1992; 3: 480-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,34Saunders A.M. Seldin M.F. Genomics. 1990; 8: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we identified a putative âcritical region.â With the aid of computer programs for gene prediction and the available EST data base, we were able to identify a new gene, named KLK-L2 (for kallikrein-like gene 2). The 3â² end of the gene was verified by the presence of poly(A) stretches in the sequenced ESTs that were not found in the genomic sequence, and the start of translation was identified by the presence of a start codon in a well conserved consensus Kozak sequence. As is the case with other kallikreins, the KLK-L2 gene is composed of 5 coding exons and 4 intervening introns and, except for the second coding exon, the exon lengths are comparable to those of other members of the kallikrein gene family (Fig. 7). The exon-intron splice junctions were identified by comparing the genomic sequence with the EST sequence and were further confirmed by the conservation of the consensus splice sequence (mGT â¦ AGm, where m is any nucleotide) (21Iida Y. J. Theor. Biol. 1990; 145: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the fully conserved intron phases (35Irwin D.M. Robertson K.A. MacGillivary R.T J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 212: 31-45Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 7. Furthermore, the position of the catalytic triad residues in relation to the different exons is also conserved (Fig. 7). As is the case with most other kallikreins, except PSA and HSCCE, KLK-L2 is more functionally related to trypsin than to chymotrypsin (3Clements J. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 71-97Crossref Google Scholar). The wide range of tissue expression of KLK-L2 should not be surprising since by using the more sensitive RT-PCR technique instead of Northern blot analysis (36Clements J.A. Mukhtar A. Verity K. Pullar M. McNeill P. Cummins J. Fuller P.J. Clin. Endocrinol. 1996; 44: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), many kallikrein genes were found to be expressed in a wide variety of tissues including salivary gland, kidney, pancreas, brain, and tissues of the reproductive system (uterus, mammary gland, ovary, and testis) (3Clements J. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 71-97Crossref Google Scholar). KLK-L2 is highly expressed in the brain. Another kallikrein, neuropsin, was also found to be highly expressed in the brain and has been shown to have important roles in neural plasticity in mice (18Yoshida S. Taniguchi M. Hirata A. Shiosaka S. Gene. 1998; 213: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Also, the zyme gene is highly expressed in the brain and appears to have amyloidogenic potential (14Little S.P. Dixon E.P. Norris F. Buckley W. Becker G.W. Johnson M. Dobbins J.R. Wyrick T. Miller J.R. MacKellar W. Hepburn D. Corvalan J. McClure D. Liu X. Stephenson D. Clemens J. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25135-25142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point out to a possible role of KLK-L2 in the central nervous system. It was initially thought that each kallikrein enzyme has one specific physiological substrate. However, the increasing number of substrates, which purified proteins can cleave in vitro, has led to the suggestion that they may perform a variety of functions in different tissues or physiological circumstances. The biological function ofKLK-L2 is not yet known. Serine proteases encode protein cleaving enzymes that are involved in digestion, tissue remodeling, blood clotting, etc., and many of the kallikrein genes are synthesized as precursor proteins that must be activated by cleavage of the pro-peptide. The predicted trypsin-like cleavage specificity ofKLK-L2 makes it a candidate activator of other kallikreins or it may be involved in a âcascadeâ of enzymatic reactions similar to those found in fibrinolysis and blood clotting (31Takayama T.K Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21582-21588Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 3: 10363-10370Crossref Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we characterized a new member of the human kallikrein gene family, KLK-L2. This gene is hormonally regulated, and it is mostly expressed in the brain, mammary gland, and testis. Based on our experience with other kallikreins that are already used as valuable tumor markers (PSA, hk2), we speculate that KLK-L2 may also have utility in similar applications. This possibility, as well as the physiological function of the protein need further investigation. We thank David Irwin and Irvin Bromberg for helpful suggestions and advice on use of some computer programs and Liu-Ying Luo and Margot Black for technical assistance. We have now identified an untranslated exon of the KLK-L2 gene; this is described in our updated GenBankâ¢ submission (AF135028)."

It forms small cation-selective channels in target cell and lipid bilayer membranes and it delivers into cell cytosol the amino-terminal adenylate cyclase (AC) domain, which catalyzes uncontrolled conversion of ATP to cAMP and causes cell intoxication. Here, we demonstrate that membrane translocation of the AC domain into cells is selectively dissociated from ACT membrane insertion and channel formation when a helix-breaking proline residue is substituted for glutamate 509 (Glu-509) within a predicted transmembrane amphipathic Î±-helix. Neutral substitutions of Glu-509 had little effect on toxin activities. In contrast, charge reversal by lysine substitutions of the Glu-509 or of the adjacent Glu-516 residue reduced the capacity of the toxin to translocate the AC domain across membrane and enhanced significantly its specific hemolytic activity and channel forming capacity in lipid bilayer membranes. Combination of the E509K and E516K mutations in a single molecule further exacerbated hemolytic and channel forming activity and ablated translocation of the AC domain into cells. The lysine substitutions strongly decreased the cation selectivity of the channels, indicating that Glu-509 and Glu-516 are located within or close to the membrane channel.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is a 1706-residue-long protein (2Glaser P. Ladant D. Sezer O. Pichot F. Ullmann A. Danchin A. Mol Microbiol. 1988; 2: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) consisting of a cell-invasive amino-terminal adenylate cyclase (AC) domain of approximately 400 residues and a channel forming RTX hemolysin (Hly) moiety of about 1300 residues (3Glaser P.

The Hly comprises the calcium-binding glycine and aspartate-rich nonapeptide repeats (last 700 residues) characteristic of all RTX proteins (5Welch R.A. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other RTX toxins, ACT has a fatty acylation domain (residues 800â1000), where the essential posttranslational activation by amid-linked palmitoylation of lysine 983 is taking place in the presence of the accessory acyltransferase, CyaC (7Barry E.M.

ACT is a unique example of an enzymatically active toxin capable of translocating directly across the cytoplasmic membrane of a variety of target cells without the need for receptor-mediated endocytosis (17Gordon V.M.

AC delivery into some cell types appears to require a negative membrane potential (20Otero A.S. Yi X. Gray M.C. Szabo G. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9695-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but the toxin efficiently invades even cells with low membrane potential, such as sheep erythrocytes (16Bellalou J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3154-3161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Penetration into erythrocytes, which lack membrane traffic, is initiated by a fairly unspecific adsorption of ACT to cell surface, which is followed by direct insertion into and translocation of the 40-kDa AC domain across cell membrane (18Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The path taken by the AC to cross the membrane, however, remains unknown, and the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. Both insertion into and translocation of the ACT across cell membrane, as well as formation of hemolytic ACT channels, absolutely require binding of calcium ions and posttranslational fatty-acylation (palmitoyl) of the Îµ-aminogroup of lysine 983 (8Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Hanski E. Farfel Z. J. Biol.

Formation of membrane channels and delivery of AC into cells can, however, be dissociated and can appear to be two parallel and divergent activities of ACT within target membranes. AC translocation can be selectively blocked by low temperature and/or by loading of ACT with limiting amounts of calcium ions (23Rogel A. Hanski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22599-22605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol.

Their inner diameter, both in artificial lipid bilayers and in erythrocyte membranes, was estimated to be only 0.6â0.8 nm, which appears to be too small for passage of a polypeptide chain (6Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Gordon V.M. Gray L.S. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The membrane insertion and channel forming (hemolytic) activities of ACT are entirely located to the Hly part and do not require the presence of the AC domain (29Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Sebo P. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13598-13602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural integrity of the hemolysin is, however, required for membrane insertion of ACT and delivery of the AC domain into cells (18Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several essential Hly segments were previously identified by deletion mapping (16Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and recently, using random insertional mutagenesis, we identified a new structure in the hydrophobic domain between residues 502 and 549, which is important for both membrane insertion and translocation of the toxin into cells. 2OsicÌka, R., OsicÌkova, A., Basar, T., Guermonperez, P., Rojas, M., Leclerc, C., and Sebo, P. (2000)Infect. Immun. 68, in press. 2OsicÌka, R., OsicÌkova, A., Basar, T., Guermonperez, P., Rojas, M., Leclerc, C., and Sebo, P. (2000)Infect. Immun. 68, in press. Here, we show that an amphipathic and potentially Î±-helical segment within this structure plays a critical role in AC membrane translocation, as well as in formation and ion selectivity of ACT channels. For the first time, we describe a point mutation that selectively blocks AC translocation into cells, without altering membrane insertion and hemolytic activity of ACT. TheEscherichia coli K12 strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used throughout this work for DNA manipulation and for expression of ACT. Bacteria were grown at 37 Â°C in LB medium supplemented with 150 Î¼g/ml of ampicillin. pCACT3 is a construct for co-expression ofcyaC and cyaA (26Betsou F. Sebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it allows production of recombinant CyaC-activated ACT in E. coli(r-Ec-ACT) under control of the isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induciblelacZ p promoter. The substitutions were introduced into the cyaA gene by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using the proof-reading Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using pairs of suitable PCR primers (Table I). In a first step, two complementary mutagenic primers were used to introduce the mutation into two partially overlapping PCR products, which were then purified on agarose gel and used as a template in a second PCR amplification with another pair of primers to assemble the whole mutagenized fragment. Prior to recloning into pCACT3 for expression of mutant proteins, all in vitro amplified (mutagenized) fragments were subcloned in pTZ19R (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and entirely sequenced, in order to confirm the presence of the desired substitutions and the absence of any unrelated additional mutations. Systematically, silent single base substitutions creating new restriction sites were introduced into the PCR primers to allow straightforward screening of the mutants and recloning of the mutations into the parental cyaA gene on pCACT3.Table IList of PCR primers used for mutagenesis and assembly of cyaA allelesPrimer pair (mutation)SequencesaThe mutagenized codon is printed in boldface characters with the substitution base underlined.

Open table in a new tab The wild-type ACT and the different mutant derivatives were produced in the presence of the activating protein CyaC, using the E. colistrain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) transformed with the appropriate plasmid construct, derived from pCACT3. Exponential 500-ml cultures were induced with isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm), the cells were disrupted by ultrasound, and the insoluble cell debris was extracted with 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, as described previously (25Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene. 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proteins were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose as described previously (29Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Sebo P. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13598-13602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the final step, the proteins were eluted with 8 murea, 2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at â20 Â°C. In agreement with our previous observations that mutations outside the AC domain do not affect the enzymatic AC activity of the toxin (18Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Sebo P. Ladant D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), all purified mutant toxin exhibited the same specific AC activity as the intact ACT, which ranged between 300 and 340 units/mg of protein. Adenylate cyclase activities were measured as described previously in the presence of 1 Î¼m calmodulin (31Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2612-2618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of AC activity corresponds to 1 Î¼mol of cAMP formed per min at 30 Â°C, pH 8.0. Cell-invasive AC and hemolytic activities were measured as described previously (16Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by determining the AC protected against externally added trypsin upon internalization into erythrocytes and by photometric (A 541) determination of the amount of hemoglobin released upon prolonged incubation of washed sheep erythrocytes (5 Ã 108/ml) with the toxins. Erythrocyte binding of the toxins was determined as described in detail previously (18Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Black lipid bilayer membranes were formed as described previously (32Benz R. Janko K. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The instrumentation consisted of a Teflon chamber with two aqueous compartments connected by a small circular hole. The hole had a surface area of about 0.5 mm2. Membranes were formed across the hole by painting onto a 1% solution of a mixture of asolectin (lecithin type IIIs from soy beans; Sigma) in n-decane. The aqueous salt solutions (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used unbuffered and had a pH of around 6. The temperature was kept at 20 Â°C throughout. The membrane current was measured with a pair of silver/silver chloride electrodes with salt bridges switched in series with a voltage source and an electrometer (Keithley 617). In the case of the single channel recordings, the electrometer was replaced by a current amplifier. The amplified signal was monitored with a storage oscilloscope and recorded with a tape or a strip chart recorder. Zero-current membrane potential measurements were performed by establishing a salt gradient across membranes containing 100â1000 ACT channels as described earlier (32Benz R. Janko K. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Translocation of AC across target cell membrane appears to depend on negative membrane potential (20Otero A.S. Yi X. Gray M.C. Szabo G. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9695-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that it might bear a net positive charge and might be conducted across the membrane along a negatively charged hydrophilic surface formed by amphipathic transmembrane segments of the hydrophobic domain of ACT. Moreover, the strict cation selectivity of ACT channels also suggested that negatively charged residues are located within the transmembrane ACT channel or close to it. Analysis of the channel forming domain of ACT by the algorithm of Eisenberg et al. (33Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar) revealed that a transmembrane amphipathic Î±-helix, including a pair of negatively charged glutamate residues, Glu-509 and Glu-516, can be predicted to form between residues 502 and 522 (Table II). Furthermore, our previous insertional mutagenesis of ACT indicated that this segment harbors structures important for membrane insertion and translocation of ACT.2 The predicted Î±-helix was, therefore, mutagenized by replacements of the glutamates Glu-509 and Glu-516 with neutral and/or oppositely charged residues.Table IIPredicted membrane associated helices in ACTAverage hydrophobicity (H)aAverage hydrophobicity was calculated on a 21-residue segment by the method of Eisenberg et al.

Open table in a new tab The mutant ACT proteins were expressed in recombinant E. coli and purified by ion exchange chromatography, as documented in Fig. 1, and their toxin activities were compared with intact ACT. As shown in Fig. 2, substitution of Glu-509 by a helix-breaking proline residue selectively abolished the membrane translocation of the AC domain without affecting the hemolytic activity and the cell association capacity of the ACT-E509P mutant. In contrast, substitutions of Glu-509 by the hydrophobic valine or by the neutral glutamine residues, which are not expected to disrupt an Î±-helix, had little effect on toxin activities. These data strongly suggest that the residue Glu-509 is, indeed, part of an Î±-helical structure and is critical for AC translocation across target membrane.FIG. 2Helix-breaking and charge-reversing substitutions of glutamate 509 and 516 dissociate AC translocation from toxin membrane insertion and channel formation. Sheep erythrocytes (5 Ã 108/ml) were incubated at 37 Â°C with 2 units/ml purified ACT proteins in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. After 30 min, aliquots were taken for determinations of the cell-associated AC activity and of the AC activity internalized into erythrocytes and protected against externally added trypsin (18Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The hemolysis was measured photometrically at 541 nm, as hemoglobin released after 270 min of incubation (18Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This graph represents the average of values obtained in three separate experiments performed in duplicates (n = 6). wt, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The E509V and E509Q substitutions allowed nearly wild-type toxin activity, showing that a negative charge at these position is not essential. To test the importance of the total charge of the predicted Î±-helix, the glutamates at positions 509 and 516 were substituted by positively charged lysine residues. As further shown in Fig. 2, the E509K substitution, which shifted the charge of the putative Î±-helix from â2 to 0, caused about 2-fold reduction in both cell association activity and cell-invasive activity of the mutant, as compared with intact ACT. A very similar result was obtained with the E516K substitution. Because cell association is a prerequisite for AC translocation into cells, it can be concluded that the primary defect of these mutants was in reduced cell association and that once the E509K and/or E516K toxin molecules integrated into target membranes, they exhibited an efficiency of AC domain translocation similar to that of the intact ACT. The negatively charged residues at positions 509 and 516, therefore, are not individually essential for AC translocation activity. Interestingly, for both mutants, the total hemolytic activity per unit of toxin added to cells was enhanced about 2-fold, despite their reduced cell association (Fig. 2). Hence, per unit of cell-associated E509K and E516K mutants, their specific hemolytic activity was about 4 times higher than that of intact ACT. Furthermore, when the two substitutions were combined in a single molecule, they exhibited a strong synergic effect. Although the cell association remained similar to that of the single mutants, the cell-invasive activity of the E509K/E516K double mutant was abolished, and the hemolytic activity was further enhanced by another factor of 2 (Fig. 2). When compared on the basis of units of cell-associated toxin, the hemolytic activity of the double mutant was about 8 times higher than that of intact toxin, and the E509K/E516K mutant induced much faster erythrocyte lysis (Fig. 3). It was important to analyze the molecular basis of the exacerbated hemolytic activity of the E509K and E516K mutant toxins. ACT is able to incorporate into lipid bilayer membranes made of the lipid mixtures, such as asolectin, and to form channels that increase the membrane conductance by many orders of magnitude (6Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increase is not a linear function of the ACT concentration in the aqueous phase, probably because of the formation of conductive oligomers from nonconductive monomers and an association-dissociation reaction between both. Therefore, the conductance-concentration relationship of the E509K with enhanced hemolytic activity was compared with that of wild-type ACT. The membrane conductance increase 30 min after the addition of the toxins to both sides of black asolectin lipid bilayer membrane was taken as measure of the membrane activity of the toxins, because at ACT concentrations between 5 and 100 ng/ml, the membrane current was steeply increasing for about 10â20 min after toxin addition, and only a small further increase occurred after that time (data not shown; see also Ref. 6Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the results of these measurements for wild-type ACT and the mutant E509K. An increase of the ACT concentration or of its mutant by a factor of 2 resulted in a 4â8-fold increase of the membrane conductance. This means that the relationship between ACT-induced conductance increase in membranes and toxin concentration was not linear and could be fitted to a straight line with a slope of approximately 2â3 on a double-logarithmic scale, which was approximately similar for ACT and its E509K mutant. The increase of the toxin concentration by a factor of two leads in such a case to a conductance increase by 22â23, i.e.by a factor of 4â8. It is noteworthy that a similar steep conductance-concentration relationship has been observed for RTX-hemolysins from E. coli (34Benz R. Schmid A. Wagner W. Goebel W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 887-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from bacteria of theProteus family (35Benz R. Hardie K.R. Hughes C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This result shows that a meaningful comparison of the membrane activity between ACT and its mutants was only possible for a well defined protein concentration. This comparison was carried out at a concentration of 13 ng/ml. As shown in Table III and in agreement with the observed enhanced specific hemolytic activities, the specific membrane conductance in 1 m KCl generated at a concentration of 13 ng/ml was highest for the double mutant E509K/E516K (1.9 Î¼S/cm2), followed by E516K (0.37 Î¼S/cm2) and by E509K (0.34 Î¼S/cm2), as compared with that of wild-type ACT (0.10 Î¼S/cm2). Hence, the membrane activity in planar lipid bilayers was substantially enhanced by glutamate to lysine substitutions at residues 509 and 516 of ACT. Due to the steep conductance-concentration relationship (see Fig. 4), however, a small error in the protein concentration could lead to a considerable effect on the specific membrane conductance. Therefore, only the difference of membrane activity between wild-type ACT and the mutants and between the single mutants and the double mutant can be considered significant, but the activity difference between the E509K and E516K mutants cannot.Table IIIAverage single-channel conductances of different ACT mutantsACTAverage single channel conductanceaThe membranes were formed of asolectin dissolved inn-decane.

ATP-gated receptor channels amino acid(s) polymerase chain reaction adenosine 5â²-(Î±,Î²-methylene)triphosphate ATP-gated receptor channels (P2XRs)1 are expressed in a number of tissues where they are involved in regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions, including central and peripheral neurotransmission, smooth muscle contraction, platelet activation, and hormone secretion (1Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2North R.A. Neurosciences. 1996; 8: 187-194Google Scholar, 3Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of these functions by the activated P2XRs requires or is susceptible to local and/or global changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) (3Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of extracellular ATP to P2XRs is associated with a rise in [Ca2+] i, which is mediated by Ca2+ influx through these channels as well as by depolarization of cells and activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The pattern of [Ca2+] i signaling by native P2XRs is highly variable, depending on the cell type examined (3Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other Ca2+-conducting channels, however, the relevant structural base of the P2XRs contributing to the control of [Ca2+] i signaling function has not been completely elucidated.

Each subunit is proposed to have two putative transmembrane helices connected with a large extracellular loop, and both the N and C termini are located in the cytoplasm.

Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). During continuous exposure to agonist, current signals generated by recombinant P2XRs are desensitized gradually, an action that should effectively attenuate or terminate direct and indirect Ca2+ influx. Based on the observed differences in their current desensitization kinetics, recombinant P2XRs are generally divided into two groups: the rapidly desensitizing (P2X1R and P2X3R) and the slowly desensitizing (P2X2R, P2X4R, P2X5R, P2X6R, and P2X7R) (3Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with chimera subunits composed of P2X2R and P2X1R or P2X3R subunits suggested that the rapid desensitization requires interactions between two transmembrane domains of receptor subunits (13Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A large C terminus of P2X7R has also been suggested to account for the nondesensitizing pattern of these channels during repetitive stimulation (10Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Recently, a new view of P2XR desensitization has emerged; the C-terminal splice variant of P2X2R, termed P2X2bR or P2X2â2R, was found to lack a stretch of 69 aa and to desensitize faster than the full-length P2X2R, termed P2X2aR (14Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Simon J.

Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Amino acids responsible for such a functional difference between the spliced and full-length channels are localized to the initial six residues (Arg371-Pro376) within the spliced segment (17Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the importance of the C-terminal 6-aa sequences of P2XRs, which correspond to Arg371-Pro376 of P2X2aR (Fig. 1), to the desensitization pattern of these channels. For this purpose, P2XRs and their mutants were expressed in GT1 immortalized neurons, and the impact of receptor desensitization on the pattern of [Ca2+] i signaling was analyzed by monitoring single cell [Ca2+] i . These cells are excitable and express two types of voltage-gated calcium channels, T- and L-type (18Van Goor F. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 587-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neither P2XRs nor Ca2+-mobilizing P2Y receptors are native for these cells (16Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Van Goor F. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the pattern of receptor desensitization is unique for each homo- and heteropolymeric channel and that the structural differences in the C-terminal small region in part account for such variety of responses.

Total RNA was isolated using TrizolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc) and was treated with DNase I at 37 Â°C for 30 min. After heat inactivation of DNase I by incubating it at 70 Â°C for 15 min, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 Î¼g of total RNA by Superscript II reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)12â18 primers in a reaction volume of 20 Î¼l. The resulting single-strand cDNA (1 Î¼l) was then used as a template in 25 Î¼l of PCR containing 2 mm each of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 units of Ex Taq polymerase (PanVera Corp., Madison WI). Primer annealing sites were selected from 3â²- and 5â²-untranslated regions and had the following sequences: X1 sense, 5â²-GGCCGTGTGGGGTGTTCATCTCT-3â²; X1 antisense, 5â²-TCCAAAGTCTTGCCTGTCTTCAT-3â²; X3 sense, 5â²-TAAGTGGCTGTGAGCAGTTTCTC-3â²; X3 antisense, 5â²-GGAAGCATTGCCTATCTGTTGAA-3â²; X4 sense, 5â²-TGGCGAGGGGACCCACAGTGTC-3â²; X4 antisense, 5â²-GAGCCGGGCTCCAACAAGATGT-3â²; X6 sense, 5â²-ACTGGGACCATGGCTTCTGC-3â²; X6 antisense, 5â²-AACCACTCCTGAGACACCTG-3â²; X7 sense, 5â²-CCAGGTCCCGCCGAAACAGAGT-3â²; and X7 antisense, 5â²-GGCCTAACAATCCCTTCAACAC-3â². In the X6 sense primer, a point mutation (underlined) was introduced to obtain optimum translation efficiency (20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, recovered, and subcloned into pBluescript II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at its HincII site pretreated with 2â²-deoxythymidine and Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sequences of subcloned inserts were verified in both strands with vector- and insert-specific primers using T7 sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Confirmed inserts as well as cDNAs for P2X2aR, P2X2bR, and P2X5R (16Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Van Goor F. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were transferred to pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at the XhoI/NotI site for mammalian expression. All C-terminal mutants were made by a PCR-based overlap extension method (21Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) using the wild-type receptor cDNA as a template. Entire PCR fragments carrying mutations were subcloned into pBluescript II, sequenced, and transferred to C termini of the wild-type expression constructs using the following restriction sites:ClaI/HindIII,BspEI/HindIII,PstI/HindIII, and SmaI for P2X2aR, P2X3R, P2X4R, and P2X7R mutants, respectively. All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The full-length P2X3R and its chimera mutant with P2X2aR were transferred from pBluescript to a bicistronic enhanced fluorescent protein vector, pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), at its XhoI/EcoRI site, generating pIRES/P2XR3 and pIRES/P2X3/X2aR, respectively. GT1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Procedures for transient transfection in GT1 cells were performed as described (17Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 0.5â1.0 Ã 105 cell/35-mm dish and allowed to grow for 24 h. On the day of transfection, the total amount of 1.2 Î¼g of expression constructs encoding wild-type or mutant P2XRs was mixed with 8 Î¼l of cationic lipid, LipofectAMINETM, in 1.2 ml of reduced serum medium, Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at ambient temperature. The DNA mixture was then applied to cells for 3â5 h and replaced by normal culture medium. The cells were subjected to experiments 24â48 h after the transfection. For co-transfection experiments, a ratio of 1:2 DNA for P2X2aR and pIRES constructs was used, keeping the total DNA amount same as above. For single cell [Ca2+] i measurements, cells were incubated at 37 Â°C for 60 min with 1 Î¼m fura-2 AM in phenol red- and ATP-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were subsequently washed with assay buffer containing 137 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10 mm glucose and kept for at least 30 min in this medium before measurements. Apyrase (grade I) was purchased from Sigma and used at 20 Î¼g/ml throughout the incubation process indicated. Coverslips with cells were mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Attofluor digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). [Ca2+] i responses were examined under a 40Ã oil immersion objective during exposure to alternating 340- and 380-nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 520 nm was measured. The ratio of light intensities,F 340/F 380, which reflects changes in [Ca2+] i, was simultaneously followed in several single cells. Cells expressing fluorescence protein were optically detected by an emission signal at 520 nm when excited by 488-nm ultraviolet light and were not detectable by 340- or 380-nm excitations. We thus considered the emission signal from fluorescence protein by 340- or 380-nm excitations within our background level. In co-transfection experiments of P2X2aR cDNA and pIRES vectors, about 75% of fluorescent protein-positive cells responded to 100 Î¼m ATP stimulation and were considered to be co-transfected. Lower co-transfection efficiency below this level tended to show small response, and such experiments were excluded from further analysis. Since transfection efficiencies and expression levels of recombinant receptors were variable among the cells, only cells showing the peak [Ca2+] i amplitude of more than 1.0 in the F 340/F 380ratio scale were further used for evaluating the desensitization rates. The time course of [Ca2+] i response to ATP was fitted to one or two exponential functions using SigmaPlot 5.0 (Jandel Scientific software, San Rafael, CA) with the tolerance value set at 10â5. Significant differences were determined by either Student's t test or one-way analysis variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffe's test, if applicable; p < 0.05 was considered as significantly different. Our previous results have shown that GT1 cells are a suitable cell model for analyzing the P2X2aR and P2X2bR desensitization by single cell [Ca2+] i measurements (16Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Van Goor F. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we show that all members of P2XRs, when expressed individually, responded to 100 Î¼m ATP with a significant rise in [Ca2+] i . In cells transfected with P2X1R or P2X3R cDNA, however, preincubation of cultures with apyrase, an ectonucleotidase that degrades ATP, was necessary to detect any appreciable [Ca2+] i change. Preincubation of P2X2aR-expressing cells with this enzyme did not alter the pattern of [Ca2+] i response compared with that observed in controls (not shown). The averaged peak [Ca2+] i amplitudes induced by supramaximal concentrations of ATP apparently differed among P2XRs. When stimulated with 100 Î¼m ATP, the amplitudes of [Ca2+] i were comparable among cells expressing P2X2aR, P2X2bR, and P2X4R, whereas 500 Î¼m ATP was required to reach the comparable [Ca2+] i response in P2X7R-transfected cells. The peak [Ca2+] i responses caused by activated P2X1R and P2X3R with 100 Î¼m ATP were about one-third those observed in cultures expressing P2X2aR. A small fraction (less than 10%) of cells transfected with P2X5R or P2X6R cDNAs also responded to 100â500 Î¼m ATP but with the amplitude of [Ca2+] i responses about one-fifth that seen in the P2X2aR. Because of such low and variable [Ca2+] i responses, P2X5R and P2X6R were not employed in further studies. As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, the receptors also differed in their capacities to sustain [Ca2+] i signaling during continuous stimulation with ATP. The P2X1R- and P2X3R-expressing cells completely terminated [Ca2+] i signaling within 1â2 min of stimulation with 100 Î¼m ATP. The [Ca2+] i responses caused by activation of P2X2bR and P2X4R showed a relatively slow decrease compared with those generated by the P2X1R and P2X3R. In contrast, P2X2aR- and P2X7R-expressing cells induced long-lasting [Ca2+] i signals. The P2X2aR-induced [Ca2+] i signals usually decreased to one-third of maximum response, and this steady-state plateau level was reached within 10 min of stimulation. The P2X7R-expressing cells showed no obvious decline in [Ca2+] i response for more than 10 min. In all cases, except for P2X7R, single exponential functions were sufficient to describe the decline rates of [Ca2+] i responses. The mean values of calculated rate constants are shown in Fig. 2 B. The rank order of desensitization rates derived from these data (P2X1R = P2X3R > P2X2bR > P2X4R > P2X2aR > P2X7R) was highly comparable with that observed in current measurements (22Evans R.J. Surprenant A. North R.A. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 43-61Google Scholar), confirming the validity of single cell [Ca2+] i measurements as a method for comparative evaluation of receptor desensitization. Recently, we found that the Arg371-Pro376 sequence, located in the cytoplasmic region of P2X2aR, is necessary for the slow desensitizing pattern of these receptors (17Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, this 6-aa region is located near the second putative transmembrane domain, and the C-terminal difference in amino acid sequences among the members of P2XRs starts from this region. To study the possible role of structural diversity of this region in the control of receptor desensitization, the Arg371-Pro376 sequence of P2X2aR was introduced to P2X3R and P2X4R instead the native Thr362-Lys367 and Glu376-Gly381 sequences, respectively. Such C-terminal chimeric subunits were termed P2X3/X2aR and P2X4/X2aR (Figs. 1 and 3). Cells expressing the P2X3/X2aR mutant responded to 100 Î¼m ATP with an apparent delay in desensitization of [Ca2+] i signals compared with the wild-type P2X3R (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the averaged spike [Ca2+] i amplitude was significantly higher in cells expressing P2X3/X2aR than in cells expressing P2X3R (F 340/F 380: 1.6 Â± 0.1 (n = 31) versus 2 Â± 0.05 (n = 34), respectively). As seen in wild-type P2X3R, the addition of apyrase to the bath solution was necessary to detect the [Ca2+] i change in P2X3/X2aR-expressing cells, indicating that sensitivity of P2X3R to ATP was not largely affected by introducing Arg371-Pro376 sequence to its C terminus. Cells expressing P2X4/X2aR also showed a slower desensitization rate compared with the cells transfected with the wild-type P2X4R (Fig. 3 B). The calculated time constants for the desensitization rates were 12 Â± 2 msâ1 (n = 12) for P2X4Rversus 4 Â± 0.7 msâ1 (n = 12) for P2X4/X2aR. The averaged peak [Ca2+] i amplitudes induced by 100 Î¼m ATP were elevated in the mutant P2X4/X2aR compared with wild-type P2X4R (F 340/F 380: 2.1 Â± 0.1 (n = 72) and 1.6 Â± 0.1 (n = 55), respectively). On the other hand, the half maximal doses of ATP required to induce maximum peak [Ca2+] i response were comparable for wild-type and chimeric channels (0.8 and 1.6 Î¼m, respectively), indicating that ATP is equipotent for both wild-type P2X4R and mutant P2X4/X2aR. In further studies, the reverse mutation was performed at P2X2aR C terminus by substituting the Arg371-Pro376 sequence for the corresponding 6-aa sequence of P2X3R, P2X4R, and P2X1R, and the mutant P2X2aR subunits were termed P2X2a/X3R, P2X2a/X4R, and P2X2a/X1R, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, traces b, c, andd, all chimeric subunits formed functional channels in GT1 cells with enhanced desensitization rates when compared with the wild-type P2X2aR (trace a). However, none of the P2X2aR mutants was able to mimic the rate of P2X2bR desensitization (trace e). In terms of averaged peak [Ca2+] i amplitudes, no significant difference in [Ca2+] i responses was observed between wild-type and mutant P2X2aR. The relevance of the 6-aa sequence in the control of desensitization in wild-type and chimeric channels are summarized in Fig. 3 Cand Table I. The rate constant for the desensitization of chimeric P2X4/X2aR was indistinguishable from that of P2X2aR (Fig. 3 B). Also, no significant differences were observed between P2X4R and P2X2a/X4R (Table I), indicating that the structural element responsible for the distinct pattern of P2X2aR and P2X4R desensitization is localized to the region of the 6-aa C-terminal sequence. In contrast, the desensitization rates of P2X2a/X1R and P2X2a/X3R were significantly enhanced by mutations but not enough to reproduce responses seen in cells expressing wild-type P2X1R and P2X3R (Table I). Similarly, the desensitization rate of P2X3/X2aR was considerably reduced, but not to the level seen in cells expressing wild-type P2X2aR. Therefore, a part of the subunit molecule other than the C terminus also participates in the control of P2X1R and P2X3R desensitization. This agrees with literature data (13Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) suggesting that the transmembrane domains are critical for the fast desensitization process of P2X1R and P2X3R signaling.Table IDesensitization rate of wild-type and mutant P2XR receptorsReceptorTime constantms â1P2X1R47 Â± 6 (n = 15)P2X2a/X1R7 Â± 0.5 (n = 35)ap < 0.05 vs. wild-type channels.P2X3R48 Â± 4 (n = 35)P2X2a/X3R6 Â± 0.6 (n = 25)ap < 0.05 vs. wild-type channels.P2X4R12 Â± 2 (n = 12)P2X2a/X4R10 Â± 0.8 (n = 20)a p < 0.05 vs. wild-type channels. Open table in a new tab We have also analyzed the relevance of P2X7R C-terminal 6-aa sequence on receptor desensitization. The optimized results of the amino acid sequence alignments for P2XRs revealed that Val392-Pro397 sequence of P2X7R corresponds to the Arg371-Pro376 sequence of P2X2aR. However, a 18-aa stretch from Cys362 to Val379 of P2X7R is not related to any other subunit C termini. Thus, an insertion was needed in the alignment (1Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Substitution of Val392-Pro397 sequence with the corresponding Glu376-Gly381 sequence of P2X4R generated a functional P2X7/X4R mutant receptor, the Ca2+-signaling function of which was indistinguishable from that of wild-type P2X7R. This suggests that the C-terminal 6-aa sequence of P2X7R subunit is not functionally equivalent to those found in other subunits in terms of controlling receptor desensitization. The in-frame splicing of the P2X2aR C terminus starts at Val370 (indicated by an arrowin Fig. 1) and effectively removes three positively charged residues from the Arg371-Pro376 sequence. On the other hand, negatively charged residue(s) were found in the corresponding segment of P2X1R, P2X3R, P2X2bR, and P2X4R (Fig. 1), and all these receptors apparently showed faster desensitization than P2X2aR. Such a structural difference raised the possibility that charged residues in this region may play an important role in P2XR desensitization. This is especially relevant for P2X2a/X4R and P2X4/X2aR mutants, whose desensitization patterns were indistinguishable from the wild type P2X4R and P2X2aR, respectively. To test this, we next evaluated the effects of single amino acid substitution in the P2X4R C terminus on the pattern of ATP-induced [Ca2+] i response. The negatively charged residues in the 6-aa sequence of P2X4R were replaced with neutral ones, or the basic residues of the Arg371-Pro376 sequence were introduced. As shown on Fig. 5, both elimination of negatively charged residues from and introduction of positively charged residue to the position of Glu376 in P2X4R decreased the rate of desensitization. Mutation of Glu379to a basic lysine residue also resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of desensitization. However, the point mutations at Glu376 or Glu379 could not produce the same extent of desensitization as seen in cells expressing wild-type P2X2aR and mutant P2X4/X2aR. In addition, we constructed two mutant P2X4R subunits having 3-aa substitutions, with native acidic moieties of P2X4R changed to neutral (P2X4E376Q/D377Q/E379Q) or three basic amino acids of P2X2aR introduced at the corresponding sites of P2X4R (P2X4RE376R/E379K/Q380H). Both triple mutants desensitized slower than the wild-type P2X4R (Fig. 5). Thus, changing the amino acid composition and the net charge of this particular C-terminal segment altered the duration of Ca2+influx induced by P2X4R. Within the Arg371-Pro376 of P2X2aR, Thr372 represents an optimum phosphorylation site, (R/K)XX(T/S), for the type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (23Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). At the analogous position of Thr372, either glutamate or aspartate was found in P2X1R, P2X3R, P2X2bR, and P2X4R (Fig. 1). We speculated that phosphorylation of the single Thr372 residue or introduction of a negatively charged moiety at this position may change the desensitization rate of P2X2aR. However, substitution of this residue with glutamate or with glutamine did not affect the desensitization rate of mutant channels compared with that of the wild type. The desensitization constants for glutamate- and glutamine-containing mutants were 4 Â± 0.3 msâ1 (n = 35) and 5 Â± 0.3 msâ1 (n = 21), respectively, and 4 Â± 0.2 msâ1 (n = 26) for wild-type channels. Also, no obvious difference was observed in the maximum amplitude of [Ca2+] i response and the EC50 values for ATP between P2X2aR and each C-terminal mutant receptors examined (not shown). The co-expression of P2X2aR and P2X3R has been shown to form a heteropolymeric P2XR channel, which exhibits a distinct pharmacological profile and desensitization pattern from those seen in homopolymeric channels (11Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 12Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this particular subunit combination to analyze the impact of the C-terminal structure on the [Ca2+] i -signaling pattern of heteropolymeric channels. GT1 neurons expressing only P2X3R responded to 20 Î¼m AMP-CPP with a rise in [Ca2+] i, the amplitude and desensitization rate of which"

It is encoded as an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in fungal mRNAs specifying the small subunit of Arg-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. We examined the functions of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae CPA1 and Neurospora crassa arg-2 AAPs using translation extracts from S. cerevisiae, N. crassa, and wheat germ. Synthetic RNA containing AAP and firefly luciferase (LUC) sequences were used to program translation; analyses of LUC activity indicated that the AAPs conferred Arg-specific negative regulation in each system. The AAPs functioned either as uORFs or fused in-frame at the N terminus of LUC. Mutant AAPs lacking function in vivo did not functionin vitro. Therefore, trans-acting factors conferring AAP-mediated regulation are in both fungal and plant systems. Analyses of ribosome stalling in the fungal extracts by primer extension inhibition (toeprint) assays showed that these AAPs acted similarly to stall ribosomes in the region immediately distal to the AAP coding region in response to Arg. The regulatory effect increased as the Arg concentration increased; all of the arginyl-tRNAs examined appeared maximally charged at low Arg concentrations. Therefore, AAP-mediated Arg-specific regulation appeared independent of the charging status of arginyl-tRNA.

Synthetic RNA containing AAP and firefly luciferase (LUC) sequences were used to program translation; analyses of LUC activity indicated that the AAPs conferred Arg-specific negative regulation in each system. The AAPs functioned either as uORFs or fused in-frame at the N terminus of LUC. Mutant AAPs lacking function in vivo did not functionin vitro. Therefore, trans-acting factors conferring AAP-mediated regulation are in both fungal and plant systems. Analyses of ribosome stalling in the fungal extracts by primer extension inhibition (toeprint) assays showed that these AAPs acted similarly to stall ribosomes in the region immediately distal to the AAP coding region in response to Arg. The regulatory effect increased as the Arg concentration increased; all of the arginyl-tRNAs examined appeared maximally charged at low Arg concentrations. Therefore, AAP-mediated Arg-specific regulation appeared independent of the charging status of arginyl-tRNA. upstream open reading frame arginine attenuator peptide luciferase polymerase chain reaction Upstream open reading frames (uORFs)1 in the 5â²-leader regions of eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcripts can serve critical regulatory functions (1Lovett P.S.

The fungal mRNAs specifying the small subunit of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase contain a uORF encoding an evolutionarily conserved peptide (Fig. 1 A). In the cases ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae CPA1 and Neurospora crassa arg-2, the capacity to translate this uORF peptide is essential for establishing Arg-specific negative regulation of gene expressionin vivo (5Werner M. Feller A. Messenguy F. PieÌrard A. Cell. 1987; 49: 805-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 6Delbecq P. Werner M. Feller A. Filipkowski R.K. Messenguy F. PieÌrard A. Mol.

Evolutionarily conserved uORFs are also found in mammalian mRNAs including those specifying HER-2/NEU (see Ref. 10Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24335-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, and references therein), BCL-2 (11Harigai M. Miyashita T. Hanada M. Reed J.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9552-9560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). While these mammalian uORFs affect translation, their regulatory roles remain unknown. Understanding how the CPA1 and arg-2 uORFs exert regulatory effects should provide insight into such uORF-mediated control mechanisms. The evidence for a role of CPA1 uORF translation in regulation is based on mutational studies (see Ref. 14McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein) and a variety of regulatory models are consistent with the existing data concerning the CPA1 uORF (14McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forarg-2, mutational studies have been combined with direct biochemical studies. Addition of Arg to growing cells causes a rapid decrease in the rate of ARG-2 polypeptide synthesis and a decrease in the association of the arg-2 mRNA with ribosomes (7Luo Z. Freitag M. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5235-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Experiments with reporter genes show that translation of the wild-typearg-2 uORF is critical for Arg-specific translational control. mRNAs in which uORF translation is eliminated or in which the evolutionarily conserved peptide sequence is altered no longer show decreased association with ribosomes when Arg is added to cells (8Luo Z. Sachs M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2172-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,9Freitag M. Dighde N. Sachs M.S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further insight into the mechanism of Arg-specific translational attenuation mediated by the arg-2 uORF-encoded peptide was gained using cap-, poly(A)-, and amino acid-dependent translation extracts derived from N. crassa in which regulation is reconstituted (15Wang Z. Sachs M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using reaction mixtures containing low or high Arg concentrations and a primer extension inhibition (toeprint) assay to map the positions of ribosomes on capped and polyadenylated synthetic RNA templates, high Arg concentrations are observed to cause ribosome stalling with the wild-type uORF termination codon at the ribosomal A site (16Wang Z. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4904-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since reinitiation following uORF translation does not appear to be efficient in this case, these data provide the basis for a regulatory model in which the Arg-stalled ribosomes prevent trailing scanning ribosomes from reaching the downstream start codon (16Wang Z. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4904-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Based on its cis-acting ability to repress the translation of downstream RNA sequences, the arg-2 uORF-encoded peptide was named the Arg attenuator peptide (AAP). Dissection of sequences outside of the 24-amino acid coding region established that little else of the original arg-2 mRNA is required for the AAP's regulatory function (18Wang Z. Fang P. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7528-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Neither deletion of the intercistronic sequences nor changing the UAA termination codon to UGA or UAG alters the AAP's regulatory capacity. Furthermore, direct fusion of the AAP at the N terminus of a polypeptide results in Arg-specific stalling of ribosomes involved in elongation in the region immediately downstream of the AAP, indicating that the termination codon is dispensable for stalling. Here we examined the generality of AAP-mediated regulation by studying the function of the CPA1 and arg-2 AAPs in translation extracts derived from S. cerevisiae, N. crassa, and wheat germ. Both CPA1 and arg-2AAPs mediated translational attenuation in each of these systems as determined by LUC assays. Thus, factors that permit AAP-mediated translational attenuation can be found in plant as well as fungal systems. In the S. cerevisiae and N. crassatranslation extracts, primer extension inhibition (toeprint) assays indicated that Arg-specific translational attenuation was associated with the stalling of ribosomes after AAP translation. The level of charged Arg-tRNA did not appear to be responsible for effecting Arg-specific control because the tRNA was fully charged even at low Arg concentrations. In contrast, all other well understood examples of translational regulation of amino acid biosynthetic genes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes that are mediated by uORFs respond to the level of tRNA charging (19Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar, 20Landick R. Turnbough C.L.J. Yanofsky C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Brooks Low K. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C1996: 1263-1286Google Scholar). Thus, AAP-mediated ribosome stalling appears to be an evolutionarily conserved cis-acting control mechanism that regulates the expression of a fungal Arg-biosynthetic gene in response to Arg independent of the level of charged tRNA. Linearized plasmid templates were designed to produce capped and polyadenylated synthetic RNAs encoding firefly LUC. The first type of RNA was designed to contain the entire S. cerevisiae CPA1 uORF and intercistronic region in its 5â²-leader (pAG101; Fig. 1 B, Table I). The second type of RNA was designed to have the CPA1 uORF coding sequence fused directly in-frame with the LUC open reading frame (pAG102; Fig. 1 C, Table I). Also constructed were mutant variants of each type containing either an Asp to Asn codon change at codon 13 of theCPA1 uORF (pAG103 and pAG104) or a Met to Leu codon change (AUG â UUG) at the predicted CPA1 uORF translation initiation codon (pAG105) by using PCR-based procedures (9Freitag M. Dighde N. Sachs M.S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were placed into the pHLUC+NFS4 vector (15Wang Z. Sachs M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Primers for PCR reactions were: AG1 (5â²-TGTTGAAGATCTACCCTTTTTGCAGATTTG-3â²), which includes a 5â²-BglII site, used for pAG101, pAG102, pAG103, and pAG104; AG3 (5â²-ATCTGACCATGGTTGAAATATTTTTAGGAGTGGTT-3â²), which includes a 3â²-NcoI site, used for pAG101, pAG103, and pAG105; AG4 (5â²-ATAGATGGTGACCTGGTGGGAGCTAGTTTTCCA-3â²), which includes a 3â²-BstEII site, used for pAG102, pAG104, and pAG106; AG5 (5â²-CAGATATGTAGTTTTGGCAGG-3â²), which contains the Asp to Asn codon change at codon 13 of the CPA1 uORF, used for pAG103 and pAG104; and AG6 (5â²-TGTTGAAGATCTACCCTTTTTGCAGATTTGAAATAAAAAAAACATTATTTGTTTAGCTTAT-3â²), which contains a 5â²-BglII site and changes the predicted uORF translation initiation codon, used for pAG105 and pAG106. Corresponding templates for the synthesis of RNA containing theN. crassa arg-2 AAP in the 5â²-leader region (Table I) were described previously (15Wang Z. Sachs M.S. J. Biol.

Nuclease-treated yeast extracts were used because nuclease treatment did not significantly affect amino acid-dependence or Arg-specific regulation under our assay conditions, but in initial comparative studies greatly increased the absolute level of reporter RNA translation and yielded superior toeprints (data not shown). The preparation of translation extracts from N. crassa (with no nuclease treatment) was as described (15Wang Z. Sachs M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reaction conditions for in vitro translation usingS. cerevisiae and N. crassa extracts were essentially as described previously (15Wang Z. Sachs M.S. J. Biol.

For translation inS. cerevisiae extracts, the final concentrations of K+ and Mg2+ were 230 and 3.4 mm, respectively. Translation reaction conditions using nuclease-treated wheat germ extracts (Promega) were essentially those specified by the supplier, except that, to achieve maximum activity, K+ and Mg2+ final concentrations were adjusted to 100 and 2.1 mm, respectively. All reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 Â°C; for LUC assays, translation was halted by freezing in liquid nitrogen after 30 min of incubation, and 5-Î¼l aliquots of the ice-thawed mixtures were used for analysis (15Wang Z. Sachs M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Wang Z. Fang P. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7528-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A wide range of conditions were examined to find those that were optimal for toeprinting in S. cerevisiae-derived reactions, including pH, heat pretreatment, reaction temperature, and Mg2+ concentration (23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These were similar to those earlier determined to be optimal for N. crassa-derived reactions (data not shown). Therefore, the toeprint assays of bothS. cerevisiae- and N. crassa-derived reaction mixtures were accomplished after incubation as described in the text using primer ZW4 and the previously established method (16Wang Z. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4904-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All toeprint data shown are representative of multiple experiments. The assays for tRNA aminoacylation were adapted from a previously described procedure (24Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translation reaction mixtures with total volumes of 100 Î¼l (S. cerevisiae and N. crassa) or 60 Î¼l (wheat germ) containing different concentrations of Arg were incubated for 10 min. Then aliquots of 90 Î¼l (S. cerevisiae and N. crassa) or 54 Î¼l (wheat germ) were removed (the remainder of translation reaction mixtures were incubated to the 30-min time point, then used for LUC assays) and immediately added to ice-cold tubes containing a mixture of 300 Î¼l of phenol (pH 4.5) and 200 Î¼l of sodium acetate (pH 4.5). Tubes were vortexed for 60 s and then centrifuged for 20 min. The aqueous layers were transferred to new tubes and mixed with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. Tubes were frozen at â80 Â°C for at least 15 min, and then the total nucleic acids were recovered by centrifugation for 20 min. The nucleic acid pellet was dissolved in 20 Î¼l of 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 4.5). An aliquot (2.0 Î¼l) was used to measureA 260; immediately prior to gel electrophoresis, nucleic acids were adjusted to a final concentration of 2.5 Î¼g/Î¼l (assuming 40 Î¼g of nucleic acid/A 260) by the addition of acid gel loading buffer (24Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of tRNA charging initially present in extracts at time T0 was determined by processing as described above of 50 Î¼l of extract (S. cerevisiae and N. crassa) or 30 Î¼l of extract (wheat germ) with no addition of other reaction mixture components (e.g. additional salt, synthetic mRNA, and amino acids in all three cases, plus an energy- regenerating system for S. cerevisiae and N. crassa). As an additional control, tRNAs in T0extracts were deacylated by alkali treatment. First, aliquots of T0 extracts (50 or 30 Î¼l) were mixed with 250 Î¼l of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and extracted with 300 Î¼l of phenol (pH 8.0). Nucleic acids in the aqueous phase were precipitated with salt and ethanol; the precipitates were dissolved in 100 Î¼l of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 20 min to deacylate the tRNAs. After another ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in 20 Î¼l of 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 4.5) prior to dilution with acid gel loading buffer. The procedures for acid/urea gel electrophoresis, electrophoretic transfer, and Northern blot hybridization to identify charged and uncharged tRNAs were essentially as described (24Varshney U.

We examined Arg-specific regulation mediated by the S. cerevisiae and N. crassa AAPs in translation extracts derived from S. cerevisiae, N. crassa and wheat germ. Capped and polyadenylated synthetic RNAs were synthesized from templates in which the S. cerevisiae CPA1 AAP or the N. crassa arg-2 AAP were placed upstream of firefly LUC, either as uORFs or as in-frame N-terminal extensions (Fig. 1, B andC, Table I). Equal amounts of each RNA were used to program translation extracts. As an internal control, a second capped and polyadenylated synthetic RNA that encoded sea pansy LUC (which lacked fungal regulatory sequences) was also added to the extracts (18Wang Z. Fang P. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7528-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For each of the extracts used, the addition of 10 Î¼m each of the 20 amino acids to reaction mixtures was sufficient for near maximal translation of LUC (data not shown). Additional Arg could be added to translation extracts with relatively slight effects on protein synthesis from RNA templates lackingarg-2 regulatory sequences (e.g. sea pansy LUC, Fig. 5 B). Comparisons of the translation of firefly LUC in reaction mixtures supplemented with low (10 Î¼m) or high (2 mm) Arg showed that the wild-type CPA1 AAP, when present as a uORF (Fig. 1 B), reduced the translation of LUC when the concentration of Arg was high (Table I). Translation of LUC from RNA containing the wild-type N. crassa arg-2 AAP was also subject to Arg-specific negative regulation in each extract (Table I). Introduction of the D13N mutation in the S. cerevisiae AAP coding region (Fig. 1 B) or the corresponding D12N mutation into the N. crassa coding region eliminated this regulatory effect in all cases (Table I). The wild-type CPA1 and arg-2 AAPs, when fused directly to LUC as N-terminal extensions (Fig. 1 C), also functioned to regulate translation in all three extracts (Table I). The LUC polypeptide produced appeared to initiate at the AAP start codon because changing this codon from AUG to UUG resulted in unregulated and substantially reduced (50-fold in N. crassa, 30-fold inS. cerevisiae) LUC synthesis (data not shown). TheCPA1 AAP D13N mutation and the arg-2 AAP D12N mutation eliminated the regulatory effect of Arg in all three systems, showing the strong dependence of Arg regulation on the sequence of the AAP peptide and the lack of necessity of a uORF termination codon for regulation. Toeprint assays, in which reverse transcriptase is used for primer extension in translation extracts, enables the mapping of the positions of N. crassa ribosomes on RNA (16Wang Z. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4904-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Wang Z. Fang P. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7528-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we applied this technique to S. cerevisiae ribosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first use of toeprinting to examine the positions of S. cerevisiae ribosomes on RNA. Primer extension from RNA templates containing the CPA1 uORF in the absence of extract yielded cDNA products predominantly corresponding to full-length extension of the primer as well as other shorter transcription products (Fig. 2,lanes 8 and 15). The shorter products are produced in relatively much lower quantities when the RNA is reverse-transcribed in buffer formulated for reverse transcription (data not shown) rather than the buffer formulated for in vitro translation necessary for these experiments. Extracts that were not programmed with RNA did not yield any of these signals (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 16), as predicted if these represented the products obtained from priming on the synthetic RNA template. When RNA containing the CPA1 uORF in its 5â²-leader was used to program S. cerevisiae extracts containing high Arg (500 or 2000 Î¼m, Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 3) but not low Arg (10 Î¼m, Fig. 2, lane 1), new signals were observed that corresponded to ribosomes stalled with the uORF termination codon in the ribosome A site (confirmed by high resolution mapping on other gels, data not shown). The effect of Arg to stall ribosomes at the termination codon increased when the concentration of Arg was raised from 500 Î¼m to 2000 Î¼m. Arg also caused ribosome stalling at the CPA1 uORF termination codon in N. crassa extracts (Fig. 2, comparelanes 10 and 11 to lane 9). The CPA1 AAP D13N mutation, which eliminates regulation in vivo, (5Werner M. Feller A. Messenguy F. PieÌrard A. Cell. 1987; 49: 805-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), eliminated Arg-specific effects on toeprints in both extracts (Fig. 2, lanes 4â6and 12â14), consistent with the loss of regulation observed by LUC assay (Table I). Puromycin, an inhibitor of translation that releases 80 S ribosomes from RNA, would be expected to release Arg-specific signals if they arose from the stalling of ribosomes. Therefore, extracts were programmed with RNA and incubated for"

Amino acid residues were systematically substituted in three regions of PA c 551 with the corresponding residues from thermophilic Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochromec 552 (HT c 552), which has similar main chain folding to PA c 551, but is more stable to heat. Thermodynamic properties of PAc 551 with one of three single mutations (Phe-7 to Ala, Phe-34 to Tyr, or Val-78 to Ile) showed that these mutants had increased thermostability compared with that of the wild-type. Ala-7 and Ile-78 may contribute to the thermostability by tighter hydrophobic packing, which is indicated by the three dimensional structure comparison of PA c 551 with HTc 552. In the Phe-34 to Tyr mutant, the hydroxyl group of the Tyr residue and the guanidyl base of Arg-47 formed a hydrogen bond, which did not exist between the corresponding residues in HT c 552. We also found that stability of mutant proteins to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride correlated with that against the thermal denaturation. These results and others described here suggest that significant stabilization of PAc 551 can be achieved through a few amino acid substitutions determined by molecular modeling with reference to the structure of HT c 552. The higher stability of HT c 552 may in part be attributed to some of these substitutions.

This protein has proved useful as a model system for studying the relationship between protein structure and stability because (i) primary and three-dimensional structures of cytochromes c from a wide variety of organisms (both mesophiles and thermophiles) are available, and (ii) heterologous expression systems of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic holocytochromesc have been established (11Sambongi Y.

Cytochrome c 552 (HTc 552)1from a thermophilic hydrogen oxidizing bacterium, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus that grows optimally at 70 Â°C, is an 80-amino acid protein with a heme. HT c 552 has 56% sequence identity to an 82-amino acid mono-heme cytochromec 551 (PA c 551) from mesophilic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13Sanbongi Y. Ishii M. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 195-198Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with a view to identifying (by site-directed mutagenesis) amino acid residues that contribute to the higher stability of HT c 552 compared with PAc 551. PA c 551 and HTc 552 are thus very suitable proteins for identifying substitutions of amino acid residues that endow stability. Here we report that holo-PA c 551, which in terms of visible absorption spectra and thermostability is indistinguishable from the native protein, could be expressed in the periplasm ofEscherichia coli. Using this expression system, site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed to show that the stability of PA c 551 could be significantly increased through selected mutations, which had been chosen by molecular modeling with reference to corresponding amino acid residues in HT c 552. We discuss the structural origins of higher stability of HT c 552. TheEcoRI-PstI gene fragment CP1, encoding the 22-amino acid signal sequence and 82-amino acid mature protein of PA c 551 (18Arai H.

The myristoylated N-terminal helix that allows myrARF1 to interact with membrane lipids in a GTP-dependent manner is located some distance from the Sec7 domain-binding region. However, these two regions are connected. Measuring the binding to liposomes of functional or abortive complexes between myrARF1 and the Sec7 domain of ARNO demonstrates that myrARF1, in complex with the Sec7 domain, adopts a high affinity state for membrane lipids, similar to that of the free GTP-bound form. This tight membrane attachment does not depend on the release of GDP induced by the Sec7 domain but is partially inhibited by the uncompetitive inhibitor brefeldin A. These results suggest that the conformational switch of the N-terminal helix of myrARF1 to the membrane-bound form is an early event in the nucleotide exchange pathway and is a prerequisite for a structural rearrangement at the myrARF1-GDP/Sec7 domain interface that allows the glutamic finger to expel GDP from myrARF1.

The molecular mechanism by which ARF1 recruits coatomer to the membrane is poorly understood but is based on the ability of ARF1 to interact directly, simultaneously, and in a GTP-dependent manner both with its protein target and with lipid membranes. This dual interaction can be ascribed to two regions of ARF1. The classical switch I and II regions of the âRas-likeâ core domain of ARF1 are probably the main determinants of its interaction with coatomer (10Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C.

This interaction positions an essential glutamate residue of the Sec7 domain, which lays on one edge of the groove, near the Mg2+ and Î²-phosphate region of the guanine nucleotide-binding site of ARF1 (5Goldberg J.

By its long negatively charged side chain this âglutamic fingerâ probably destabilizes GDP by displacing Mg2+ and the Î²-phosphate, allowing very rapid nucleotide exchange on ARF1 (23BeÌraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J. Antonny B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the recent crystal structure of nucleotide-free [Î17]ARF1 complexed with the Sec7 domain of Gea2p, the carboxylate group of the Glu finger occupies nearly the position of the Î²-phosphate of the expelled GDP and is coordinated to Lys 30 of ARF1, a residue that interacts with the Î²-phosphate of bound nucleotide (5Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Minimalistic studies with [Î17]ARF1 and Sec7 domains have thus given a simple picture of the mechanism by which Sec7 domains induce the dissociation of bound GDP. However, catalysis of GDP/GTP exchange on authentic ARF1 (hereafter abbreviated myrARF1) is more complex than on [Î17]ARF1 because the reaction is correlated with a change in the interaction of the G protein with membrane lipids. The substrate (myrARF1-GDP) is mostly soluble, whereas the product (myrARF1-GTP) is tightly attached to membrane lipids. This increase in membrane affinity is due to a change in the membrane exposure of the N-terminal helix of myrARF1. In the GDP-bound state, the helix is buried in a hydrophobic pocket at the surface of the core domain of ARF1 (3Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D.

Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal helix is fully available for membrane interaction (13Antonny B. BeÌraud-Dufour S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to the membrane insertion of the myristate, this direct protein/lipid interaction allows myrARF-GTP to be strongly attached to the membrane surface (13Antonny B. BeÌraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). At which step of the nucleotide exchange reaction does the switch of the N-terminal helix occur? The reaction proceeds through the formation of a series of ARF-Sec7 domain complexes in which the nucleotide-binding site is initially occupied by GDP, then vacant, and finally occupied by GTP. In these transient complexes, what is the state of the N-terminal helix? Is it held in the hydrophobic pocket on the core domain of ARF1 as in free ARF1-GDP, or does it interact with membrane lipids as in free ARF1-GTP? In this paper, we have studied the binding to lipid vesicles of full-length myristoylated ARF1 (myrARF1) in complex with the Sec7 domain of ARNO, a GEF active in vitro on ARF1 and on other members of the ARF family including ARF6 (18Chardin P.

We show that in the complex between nucleotide-free myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7, the key intermediate of the nucleotide exchange pathway, myrARF1 interacts tightly with membrane lipids like free myrARF1-GTP. Analysis of the membrane interaction of abortive complexes in which GDP remains bound to myrARF1 suggests that the tight membrane interaction of myrARF1 in complex with the Sec7 domain is not a consequence of Sec7-induced GDP dissociation on myrARF1. Rather, our data support the idea that the interaction of the N-terminal helix of ARF1 with membrane lipids is an early event in the Sec7-domain catalyzed nucleotide exchange reaction that is required for all subsequent steps including destabilization of GDP by the glutamic finger of the Sec7 domain. Together with previous kinetics studies (25Paris S. BeÌraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol.

Unlabeled nucleotides were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]GDP and all chromatography columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The expression in Escherichia coli and purification of full-length myristoylated ARF1 (myrARF1), [Î17]ARF1 (residues 18â181 of ARF1), and the Sec7 domain of ARNO (residues 52â242 of ARNO) have been described elsewhere (12Franco M.

Briefly, myrARF1 was purified from bacteria coexpressing bovine ARF1 and yeast N-myristoyltransferase in three steps: (i) precipitation at 35% saturation ammonium sulfate of the supernatant obtained after bacteria lysis; (ii) DEAE-Sepharose chromatography; and (iii) MonoS chromatography. [Î17]ARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 (wild-type or mutated) were purified in two steps: anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose or Q Sepharose, respectively) and gel filtration (Sephacryl HR 200). All proteins were 70â90% pure. Azolectin vesicles were prepared by the reverse phase method, and sucrose-loaded vesicles of defined lipid composition were prepared by the extrusion procedure as described previously (12Franco M.

MyrARF1-GDP (2 Î¼m) was preloaded with [3H]GDP (10 Î¼m, â2000 dpm/pmol) by incubation in buffer A supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 Â°C. After 15 min, 2 mmMgCl2 was added to provide 1 mm free Mg2+. [3H]GDP dissociation was initiated by diluting the sample 2-fold in buffer A supplemented with 2 mm cold GDP and 2 mm MgCl2, and with or without azolectin vesicles and ARNO-Sec7 as indicated. Samples of 25 Î¼l (25 pmol of myrARF1) were removed, diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, and filtered on 25-mm BA 85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & SchuÌll). Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of the same buffer and counted directly (without drying). MyrARF1-GDP and ARNO-Sec7 (wild-type or mutant) were incubated separately or together with lipid vesicles in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2; total volume, 50 Î¼l). Except where otherwise indicated the concentration of each protein was 3 Î¼m. When indicated, alkaline phosphatase (6 Î¼g/ml, 30 units/ml), BFA (0 - 200 Î¼m), EDTA (2 mm), or guanine nucleotides were added. After 15 min of incubation at 25 Â°C, the sample was centrifuged at 400,000 Ãg for 10 min at 25 Â°C in a TLA 100.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). The percentage of myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 in the supernatant and in the lipid pellet (which was resuspended in the same volume of buffer) was determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The membrane-bound complex between nucleotide-free myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 was prepared by incubating 12.5 Î¼m myrARF1-GDP with 12.5 Î¼m ARNO-Sec7, 1 mg/ml azolectin vesicles, and 30 Î¼g/ml alkaline phosphatase (150 units/ml) in buffer B. After 20 min at room temperature, membrane-bound proteins were recovered by centrifugation (400,000 Ã g, 15 min, 4 Â°C) and washed once with buffer A supplemented with 2 mm EDTA to remove residual alkaline phosphatase. The sample was centrifuged again, and the pellet was finally resuspended in buffer A. For fluorescence measurements, the sample was diluted in buffer A at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml azolectin vesicles in a 7-mm-diameter cylindrical quartz cell (13Antonny B. BeÌraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The cuvette was continuously stirred with a small magnetic bar and thermostated at 25 Â°C. Fluorescence was recorded at 340 nm (bandwidth, 20 nm) upon excitation at 297.5 nm (bandwidth, 5 nm) and sampling rate of 1/0.3 s. The signal resulting from vesicles light scattering was subtracted. At the time indicated, GDP or GTP (final concentration, 50 Î¼m) was added from concentrated stock solutions. The mixing time in the cuvette was about 1 s. The formation of complexes between myrARF1 and wild-type ARNO-Sec7 or [E156K]ARNO-Sec7 or [F190Y-A191S-S198d-P208M]ARNO-Sec7 in the absence of lipid vesicles was analyzed by gel filtration on a superose 12 HR 10/30 column as described for the corresponding complexes with [Î17]ARF1 (23BeÌraud-Dufour S.

MyrARF1-GDP (40 Î¼m) in a buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 was first labeled with [3H]GDP by incubation for 15 min at room temperature with tracer [3H]GDP (final concentration, 10 Î¼Ci/ml). Labeled myrARF1-GDP (10 Î¼m) was then incubated in buffer B for 15 min at room temperature with a stoichiometric amount of ARNO-Sec7 (either wild-type or mutated). For the interaction with wild-type ARNO-Sec7, the sample was supplemented with alkaline phosphatase (13 Î¼g/ml, 100 units/ml). For the interaction with [E156K]ARNO-Sec7, the sample was supplemented with 2 mmEDTA (1 Î¼m free Mg2+). For the interaction with [F190Y,A191S,S198D,P208M]ARNO-Sec7, 0 or 50 Î¼m BFA was added. The sample (210 Î¼l) was loaded on the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with buffer B. When indicated, the elution buffer was supplemented with 2 mm EDTA (for the interaction with [E156K]ARNO-Sec7) or with 50 Î¼m BFA (for the interaction with [F190Y,A191S,S198D,P208M]ARNO-Sec7. Fractions (300 Î¼l) were collected and two samples of 60 Î¼l were used for SDS-PAGE analysis and [3H]GDP counting. Monitoring the rate of futile [3H]GDP/GDP exchange on myristoylated ARF1 catalyzed by the Sec7 domain of ARNO (ARNO-Sec7) eliminates two protein/lipid interactions that occur when full-length ARNO catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on myrARF1: the tight binding of myrARF1-GTP to the bilayer and the binding of ARNO to phosphoinositides through its PH domain. Because ARNO-Sec7 is fully soluble and myrARF1-GDP interacts only weakly with membrane lipids, one might expect that ARNO-Sec7 would catalyze [3H]GDP/GDP exchange on myrARF1 in the absence of lipid vesicles. However, Fig. 1 A shows that ARNO-Sec7 is very inefficient in catalyzing [3H]GDP/GDP exchange on myrARF1 in solution. In contrast, a 7-fold stimulation was observed when the same experiment was carried out in the presence of 2 mg/ml azolectin vesicles (Fig. 1 B). Thus, apart from being essential for the stabilization of myrARF1 in the GTP bound state, membrane lipids are also essential for the catalysis of GDP release on myrARF1 by the Sec7 domain of ARNO. This is in agreement with a previous study on an unidentified ARF exchange factor from bovine retinas (27Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1573-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and suggests that productive interaction between myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 can occur only at the surface of lipid membranes. The effect of lipid vesicles on the association of myrARF1 with the Sec7 domain of ARNO was assessed by sedimentation experiments. MyrARF1-GDP or ARNO-Sec7 or a stoichiometric mixture of the two proteins was incubated with azolectin vesicles in an isotonic buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation, the amount of protein in the pellet and in the supernatant was determined by scanning Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels. In the presence of 0.5 mg/ml azolectin vesicles, myrARF1-GDP displayed weak membrane binding (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and2), in agreement with previous studies (12Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Antonny B. BeÌraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, ARNO-Sec7 was totally soluble (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4). When the same experiment was repeated with a stoichiometric mixture of the two proteins, a significant amount (20%) of ARNO-Sec7 was found in the lipid pellet, and the amount of membrane-bound myrARF1 doubled (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5 and 6). If ARNO-Sec7 displayed no preference for membrane-bound myrARF1 versus membrane-free myrARF1, it should not affect the membrane partitioning of myrARF1. Therefore, the synergy between the two proteins for their binding to lipid vesicles suggests that a complex between myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 displays a higher âaffinityâ for lipid membranes than isolated myrARF1-GDP and isolated ARNO-Sec7. To determine whether myrARF1 in the membrane-bound complex with ARNO-Sec7 has lost its nucleotide, as is usually the case for functional complexes between GEFs and G proteins, sedimentation experiments were repeated in the presence of excess GDP or GTP. With 100 Î¼m GDP, no enhancement in the membrane binding of myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 was observed when the two proteins were incubated together (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). With 100 Î¼m GTP, ARNO-Sec7 was found soluble, whereas myrARF1 became totally membrane-bound, as expected because of its conversion to the GTP-bound form (Fig. 2 A, lanes 9 and 10). Thus, the synergy between myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 for their binding to lipid vesicles observed in the absence of added nucleotide probably reflects the formation of a membrane-bound complex between myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7, in which the nucleotide-binding site of myrARF1 is vacant. However, even when carried out in the absence of added nucleotide, these experiments were performed under conditions that do not favor the stabilization of the nucelotide-free complex between myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7. Indeed, the stoichiometric GDP that was initially associated with myrARF1 could antagonize the formation of the nucleotide-free complex with ARNO-Sec7. Therefore, the experiment was repeated in the presence of a catalytic amount of alkaline phosphatase which hydrolyzes GDP as it is released from myrARF1. Strikingly, under these conditions myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 bound almost completely to azolectin vesicles (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 13 and 14 with lanes 5 and6). EDTA, which chelates magnesium and hence weakens the affinity of GDP for the nucleotide-binding site of myrARF1, has a similar effect (data not shown). These results suggest that the complex between nucleotide-free myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 displays a high affinity for membrane lipids. Like myrARF1-GTP, the membrane-bound complex between nucleotide-free myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 interacts with membrane lipids through the N terminus of ARF1. No cotranslocation of ARNO-Sec7 and ARF1 to azolectin vesicles could be detected when myrARF1-GDP was replaced by [Î17]ARF1-GDP (data not shown). This was expected because the complex between nucleotide-free [Î17]ARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 is soluble and can be isolated by gel filtration (23BeÌraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J. Antonny B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Paris S. BeÌraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, both [Î17]ARF1 and myrARF1 are able to form a nucleotide-free complex with ARNO-Sec7, but the complex with [Î17]ARF1 is soluble like isolated [Î17]ARF1-GDP or [Î17]ARF-GTP, whereas the complex with myrARF1 is tightly bound to membrane lipids, like myrARF1-GTP. It should be noted that when myrARF-GDP and ARNO-Sec7 were incubated with alkaline phosphatase in the absence of lipid vesicles and then loaded on a gel filtration column, no complex between the two proteins could be detected (data not shown). Therefore, the complex between nucleotide-free myrARF and ARNO-Sec7 is so lipophilic that it can form only in the presence of lipids. To determine whether specific interactions with membrane lipids are required for the formation of the complex between nucleotide-free myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7, sedimentation experiments were performed with artificial vesicles of defined lipid composition (Fig. 2 B). With neutral vesicles containing 50% phosphatidylcholine and 50% phosphatidylethanolamine, about 70% of ARNO-Sec7 and myrARF1 were found associated with vesicles after incubation in the presence of alkaline phosphatase. With 5% phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, or 20% phosphatidylserine and 5% phosphatidic acid in the vesicles, the amount of myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 bound to the lipid vesicles was slightly enhanced. This suggests that the complex between nucleotide-free myrARF1 and ARNO-Sec7 interacts with membrane lipids mainly through hydrophobic interactions and that the contribution of electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids is weak. By its hydrophobic nature and the essential role of the N terminus of ARF1, the membrane interaction of nucleotide-free myrARF1 in complex with ARNO-Sec7 closely resembles that of myrARF1-GTP (13Antonny B.

The six reported siglecs (CD22, CD33, sialoadhesin, MAG,1 SMP, and siglec 5) share a significant degree of sequence similarity among their V-type domains, which are required for sialic acid binding.

A subset of neurons, those that use acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter, express a unique quantitatively minor family of gangliosides termed âChol-1â gangliosides, initially defined by their reactivity with a polyclonal antiserum raised against cholinergic neurons (21Richardson P.J.

Chol-1 gangliosides carry an Î±2,6-linked sialic acid on the GalNAc of a gangliotetraose core (GT1aÎ± and GQ1bÎ±, see Fig. 1), making them part of the âÎ±-seriesâ ganglioside family (22Ando S.

The observation that GQ1bÎ± is a remarkably high affinity ligand for the neural siglecs, MAG and SMP (17Collins B.E. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tropak M.B. Roder J.C. Crocker P.R. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol.

Synthetic gangliosides were quantified by resorcinol staining as compared with ganglioside standards on TLC.

Plasmids propagated in either MC1061/P3 (MAG and SMP) or DH5Î± (sialoadhesin) E. coli were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation. COS-1 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 Â°C and in a humidified environment of 90% air, 10% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of 9 Ã 105 cells/100-mm diameter dish, were cultured overnight, and then were transiently transfected by exposure to 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, 40 Î¼g/ml DEAE-dextran, 0.1 mm chloroquine, and 3 Î¼g of the plasmid of interest. After 3.5 h of transfection, the medium was removed, and cells were treated with 10% Me2SO (v/v) in PBS for 5 min and then were returned to growth medium. The cells were cultured for 40â50 h to allow ample siglec gene expression prior to detachment for use in adhesion assays. Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (16Collins B.E.

Gangliosides were adsorbed to the bottom of 96-well dishes in an artificial membrane monolayer with phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Aliquots (50 Î¼l/well) of ethanol/water (1:1) containing 0.5 Î¼mphosphatidylcholine, 2.0 Î¼m cholesterol, and the indicated amounts of ganglioside were added to wells of a 96-well flat-bottom microwell plate. The plate was left uncovered for 90 min at ambient temperature to allow partial evaporation and lipid immobilization to occur. After adsorption, the wells were washed three times with water and then were preblocked by the addition of 100 Î¼l/well Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Plates were incubated for 10 min at 37 Â°C prior to the addition of cells. Transfected cells were harvested by exposure to hypertonic Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS containing 1 mmEDTA as described (18Yang L.J.S. Zeller C.B. Shaper N.L. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Shapiro R.E. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in PBS containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 milliunits/ml of V. cholerae neuraminidase (which enhances adhesion (16Collins B.E. Yang L.J.-S. Mukhopadhyay G. Filbin M.T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). The cells were incubated with gentle end-over-end agitation for 2 h at 37 Â°C, washed by centrifugation, and finally resuspended in Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 2.5 Ã 105 cells/ml. An aliquot of the cell suspension (200 Î¼l) was added to each well, and the cells were allowed to settle for 10 min at 4 Â°C prior to incubation for 45 min at 37 Â°C to allow cell adhesion to proceed. Subsequent to the adhesion incubation, nonadherent cells were removed using carefully controlled centrifugal detachment force. To avoid fluid sheer, the plate was carefully immersed upright in a vat of PBS (at ambient temperature), inverted (while immersed), and placed (inverted) in an immersed custom-designed Plexiglas box, which was sealed with a gasket to exclude air (31Yang L.J.S. Zeller C.B. Schnaar R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The inverted plate in its fluid-filled chamber was placed in a centrifuge carrier and centrifuged at 110 Ã g for 10 min to remove nonadherent cells, and the chamber was returned to the vat of PBS. While immersed, the plate was gently removed from the chamber but kept immersed (in the inverted orientation) for 5 min to allow any floating cells to settle away. The plate was then righted (while immersed) and removed from the vat, and excess surface PBS was removed by aspiration. At this point, all wells were full of PBS (320 Î¼l/well), and only adherent cells remained on the well bottoms. Adherent cells were quantified by lysis and measurement of released lactate dehydrogenase. After completion of the adhesion assay, 10 Î¼l of 10% Triton X-100 in PBS were added to each PBS-filled well, adherent cells allowed to lyse for 10 min and then triturated thoroughly with a multichannel micropipettor. An aliquot of lysate (80 Î¼l) from each well was transferred to a fresh plate, and 120 Î¼l of PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml each of NADH and sodium pyruvate were added. The decrease in UV absorbance at 340 nm was measured simultaneously in 96 wells using a kinetic plate reader (Benchmark Microplate Reader, Bio-Rad). Kinetic rates were compared with those from wells containing aliquots of standard cell suspensions to calculate the percentage of cells added that remained adherent at the end of the experiment. To account for modest variations in transfection efficiency between experiments and between the different transfection vectors, values were normalized to the maximum percentage of cells adhering to positively adherent gangliosides for that lectin in that experiment, adjusted for background adhesion. Over the course of the 14 experiments (39 separate siglec transfections) reported here, the average maximum and background adhesion values were as follows (mean Â± S.E.): 75.7 Â± 5.2 (maximum) and 12.2 Â± 2.4 (background) for MAG; 67.2 Â± 4.7 (maximum) and 13.1 Â± 1.7 (background) for SMP; and 72.8 Â± 5.1 (maximum) and 9.2 Â± 0.9 (background) for sialoadhesin. Each value reported in the figures is the average of 3â41 separate determinations and is expressed as mean Â± S.E. Gangliosides used in these studies adsorbed comparably to the wells and remained adsorbed equally during incubation with cells (data not shown). In agreement with our previous report (17Collins B.E. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tropak M.B. Roder J.C. Crocker P.R. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16889-16895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), MAG and sialoadhesin adhered with moderate potency to the two major brain gangliosides bearing terminal âNeuAcÎ±2,3GalÎ²1,3GalNAcâ determinants, GD1a and GT1b (Fig. 2, A and C, and Table I), whereas SMP-mediated adhesion to these gangliosides was less avid (Fig. 2 B; SMP-mediated adhesion to weakly supportive gangliosides added at concentrations above 50 pmol/well was often less than maximum levels, perhaps due to charge repulsion (16Collins B.E. Yang L.J.-S. Mukhopadhyay G. Filbin M.T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). The Chol-1 ganglioside GQ1bÎ± was â¼10-fold more potent in supporting MAG- and SMP-mediated adhesion than was the closely related major brain ganglioside lacking the Î±2,6-NeuAc residue, GT1b (Table I). Gangliosides without the NeuAcÎ±2,3Gal terminus, such as GM1 (Fig. 2) and GM1Î± (III6NeuAc-Gg4OseCer, data not shown) did not support adhesion of any of the siglecs.Table ISiglec-mediated cell adhesion to gangliosides and ganglioside derivativesGangliosideGanglioside concentration supporting half-maximal cell adhesion by:MAGSMPSialoadhesinpmol/wellaFrom data in Figs. 2, 3, 5, and 7.GM1NDbND, no detectable adhesion at >100 pmol/well.NDNDGM1Î±NDNDNDcis-GM18015087GD1a50>10024GT1b50>10047GQ1bÎ±6.08.521GT1aÎ±173022GD1Î±192223cis-GM1 III6-sulfate224622cis-GM1 variant II3,III6-bissulfate1.53.09.5GD1Î± III6-sialic acid derivativesGD1Î±, 7-deoxy-NeuAc283442GD1Î±, 8-deoxy-NeuAc313444GD1Î±, 9-deoxy-NeuAc252427cis-GM1 variantsGal Î²1,6-GalNAc87>300125III-GlcNAc240>30087a From data in Figs. 2, 3, 5, and 7.b ND, no detectable adhesion at >100 pmol/well. Open table in a new tab MAG and SMP displayed enhanced avidity for the other Î±-series gangliosides tested, GD1Î± and GT1aÎ± (Fig. 2, A andB; Table I), compared with GD1a and GT1b. In contrast to the neural siglecs, Î±-series gangliosides and GD1a were equally potent in supporting sialoadhesin-mediated cell adhesion (Fig. 2 C). A comparison of adhesion to GD1Î± and cis-GM1 (Table I; structures in Fig. 1), indicates that the Î±2,6-NeuAc residueper se enhanced binding of siglecs 3â6-fold. The increased potency of Chol-1 gangliosides to support MAG- and SMP-mediated adhesion suggests a potential direct interaction between the Î±2,6-NeuAc residue and the neural siglecs. Previously, we reported that MAG required an intact sialic acid exocyclic glycerol chain on the terminal Î±2,3-NeuAc residue for recognition (16Collins B.E. Yang L.J.-S. Mukhopadhyay G. Filbin M.T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the current study, we tested the role of the exocyclic glycerol chain hydroxyls on the Î±2,6-NeuAc residue of GD1Î± using synthetic derivatives (32Sawada N. Ishida H. Collins B.E. Schnaar R.L. Kiso M. Carbohydr. Res. 1999; 316: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GD1Î±, bearing a 7-, 8-, or 9-deoxysialic acid linked Î±2,6 to GalNAc, supported comparably enhanced siglec-mediated adhesion (Fig. 3and Table I), indicating that the hydroxyls on this exocyclic glycerol chain are not strictly required for enhanced siglec recognition. This led us to test the role of the anionic charge at the III6-position using sulfate analogs of GD1Î± and GT1aÎ±. Replacing the III6NeuAc residue of GD1Î± with a sulfate group (cis-GM1 III6-sulfate, Fig. 1) had no effect on MAG or sialoadhesin binding (Fig. 4, Table I) and only a modest negative effect on SMP binding, indicating that anionic charge at that position is key to enhanced binding affinity. Notably, an analog of GT1aÎ± bearing two sulfate groups (cis-GM1 variant II3, III6-bissulfate, Fig. 1) demonstrated 10-fold increased binding affinity for MAG and SMP and 2-fold for sialoadhesin, making it the most highly potent target for siglec-mediated cell adhesion tested to date (Fig. 4, Table I). To investigate extended recognition by siglecs based on the gangliotetraose core, we employed synthetic derivatives ofcis-GM1 (29Prabhanjan H. Kameyama A. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the minimal gangliotetraose structure bearing the NeuAcÎ±2,3GalÎ²1,3GalNAc terminus preferred by MAG (Fig. 1). MAG bound 3-fold better to cis-GM1 than to a matched structure with a GlcNAc replacing the core GalNAc (Fig. 5). Sialoadhesin, however, recognized both structures equally well. Surprisingly, a novel synthetic structure having the IV-Gal residue in Î²1,6 rather than Î²1,3 linkage (cis-GM1, âGal Î²1,6-GalNAcâ variant) supported siglec adhesion at levels similar to the parent cis-GM1 (Fig. 5). In contrast to cis-GM1, monosialogangliotetraoses GM1 (Fig. 2) and GM1Î± (data not shown) did not support any siglec adhesion. The current study supports the hypothesis that there is extended recognition of multisialylated gangliosides by the closely related neural siglecs, MAG and SMP. For these siglecs, relative placement of the sialic acids (or sulfates) on the neutral sugar core appears to be an important factor in determining binding affinity. This and prior published data (9Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Song T. de Bellard M.E. Schnaar R.L. Mahoney J.A. Hartnell A. Bradfield P. Crocker P.R. Curr.

A. 1996; 93: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) indicate that MAG and SMP require a terminal âNeuAcÎ±2,3Galâ determinant as the primary structural requirement for binding but that additional (secondary) sialic acids on the same core greatly enhance binding. Relative placement of the secondary sialic acids appears to be key, with the NeuAcÎ±2,6GalNAc determinant preferred. Thus, GD1a has higher affinity for MAG and SMP thancis-GM1, GD1Î± has yet higher affinity, and GT1aÎ± is more potent than GT1b (Table I). Two alternative hypothesis fit these data: (i) MAG and SMP have primary and secondary sialic acid binding sites; or (ii) MAG and SMP are very sensitive to the precise tertiary configuration of the primary determinant (NeuAcÎ±2, 3GalÎ²1, 3GalNAc), which is in turn impacted by nearby sialic acids. NMR studies support the latter hypothesis, in that the core GalNAc and II3NeuAc of gangliosides directly interact to restrict the conformation of what would be the primary determinant (33Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Hasegawa A. Ishida H. Kiso M. Bernardi A. Brocca P. Raimondi L. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10014-10018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the III6NeuAc, which is yet more potent as a secondary sialic acid, may not interact in the same manner to restrict ganglioside conformation, and replacement of the III6NeuAc and II3NeuAc with sulfates greatly enhanced MAG and SMP binding. In either case, the extended structure of multisialylated gangliosides impacts the affinity of MAG and SMP binding. Importantly, the physiological significance of gangliosides bearing extended determinants has recently been established (8Sheikh K.A. Sun J. Liu Y. Kawai H. Crawford T.O. Proia R.L. Griffin J.W. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7532-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mice engineered to lack the ganglioside neutral core GalNAc transferase (UDP-GalNAc:GM3/GD3N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) had progressive axon and myelin degeneration similar to the neural deficits found in MAG-deficient mice. Therefore, the extended specificity of MAG for its carbohydrate ligand may have important physiological consequences. The extended specificity reported here conflicts with data reported recently by Strenge et al. (34Strenge K. Schauer R. Bovin N. Hasegawa A. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kelm S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in that the oligosaccharide of GT1aÎ± was reported to be no better than that of GM3 (sialyllactose, NeuAcÎ±2,3GalÎ²1,4Glc) in inhibiting MAGd1â3-Fc binding to human erythrocytes. Other structure-function differences between the Strenge et. al.study and our studies were also noted, including inhibition of MAG binding by soluble saccharides bearing 7-deoxy-NeuAc or 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononic acid (KDN) in place of NeuAc and by certain oligosaccharides bearing only terminal Î±2,6-linked sialic acids. We agree with Strenge et al. that the differences are probably due to the different assays used. The current study measures binding of full-length cell surface MAG to saccharides oriented on an apposing membrane monolayer, whereas the Strenge et al. study measured the site affinity of soluble saccharides for a soluble MAG-Fc chimera engineered to have only the N-terminal three (of five) Ig-like domains. Presentation, valency, and the different forms of MAG may all contribute to the observed differences. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare the half-maximal inhibitory potency of free oligosaccharides for the MAG-Fc chimera (in the submillimolar range) with the half-maximal potencies reported here for supporting MAG adhesion (in the pmol/well range). Notably, genetically engineered mice expressing only truncated gangliosides display neuropathies similar to those in mice lacking MAG, supporting the notion that extended ganglioside specificity is of physiological importance (8Sheikh K.A. Sun J. Liu Y. Kawai H. Crawford T.O. Proia R.L. Griffin J.W. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7532-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The two neural siglecs, MAG and SMP, demonstrate the same relative trends in ganglioside binding specificity, although SMP displays characteristically lower binding avidity. These data reflect the close relationship between these two lectins, which share >70% sequence similarity in the first two N-terminal Ig-like domains (1Kelm S. Schauer R. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Sialoadhesin, which shares â¼40% sequence similarity with the neural siglecs in its first two N-terminal Ig-like domains, does not demonstrate the same extended specificity (GQ1bÎ±, GT1aÎ±, and GD1Î± demonstrated sialoadhesin binding affinities comparable with GD1a). Although extended specificity is suggested by the relatively low affinity of sialoadhesin for cis-GM1 (compared with GD1a or GD1Î±), prior results demonstrated moderately high binding affinity of sialoadhesin for GM3 and even GM4, the simplest âNeuAcÎ±2,3Galâ-bearing ganglioside (17Collins B.E.

Together, these results suggest that sialoadhesin is less responsive to multiple sialic acids on the same neutral sugar core. Sialic acid substructural specificity appears to be relatively stringent for all siglecs, which require an intact exocyclic glycerol side chain and are differentially responsive to the N-acyl moiety (35Kelm S. Brossmer R. Isecke R. Gross H.-J. Strenge K. Schauer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This contrasts with selectins, which bind to target glycosides bearing highly modified sialic acids, or the same saccharides with sulfate or carboxylate moieties in place of sialic acid (36Tyrrell D.

In prior studies, we demonstrated that MAG requires every hydroxyl on its primary sialic acid determinant for binding (17Collins B.E. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tropak M.B. Roder J.C. Crocker P.R. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16889-16895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that the structural requirements at the secondary determinant are not as stringent. Synthetic GD1Î± structures lacking the 7-, 8-, or 9-position hydroxyls were comparable with the parent GD1Î± in supporting MAG and SMP binding and were much more potent than cis-GM1 (Table I). Structures bearing sulfate groups in place of the Î±-ganglioside secondary NeuAc residues displayed either equivalent (cis-GM1 III6-sulfate) or sharply enhanced affinity (cis-GM1 variant II3,III6-bissulfate) compared with their NeuAc-containing analogs (GD1Î± and GT1aÎ±, respectively). Sulfated/sialylated glycoconjugates have been found as naturally occurring targets for l-selectin (41Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and sulfated Lewis blood group oligosaccharide analogs have been touted as potential selectin mimetics (42Bertozzi C.R. Fukuda S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14271-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Galustian C. Lubineau A. le Narvor C. Kiso M. Brown G. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18213-18217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whether sulfated/sialylated glycoconjugates exist in the brain as MAG targets or can be developed as potent MAG antagonists has yet to be determined. In contrast to the marked effect of multiple sialic acids on the same neutral oligosaccharide core on MAG and SMP binding, changes in the neutral core had only modest effects. The replacement of the gangliotetraose core GalNAc with GlcNAc reduced binding about 3-fold, suggesting a modest impact on recognition. Altering the Gal-GalNAc linkage on cis-GM1 from Î²1,3 to Î²1,6 in the gangliotetraose core, which might be expected to have a large conformational effect, did not alter MAG binding. Furthermore, the potent cis-GM1 bissulfate variant has a Î²1, 4 Gal-GalNAc linkage. Although these data indicate that some neutral saccharide backbone variability is tolerated, interpretation of the conformational significance of these data awaits a high resolution structure of the saccharide binding site(s) of MAG. Chol-1 gangliosides are minor species identified by their immunoreactivity with a polyclonal antibody raised in sheep against presynaptic plasma membranes of the cholinergic electromotor nerve terminals of Torpedo marmorata (21Richardson P.J. Walker J.H. Jones R.T. Whittaker V.P. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Chol-1 antibody, which specifically recognizes cholinergic synaptosomes from the mammalian brain, was discovered to target only gangliosides (25Ferretti P. Borroni E. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1888-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GT1aÎ± (0.9 mg/kg of brain) and GQ1bÎ± (0.5 mg/kg) were defined as the two major Chol-1 targets (22Ando S. Hirabayashi Y.

Seyama Y. Hirabayashi Y. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GD1Î± was discovered on hepatoma cells and tumor cell lines (44Taki T. Hirabayashi Y. Ishikawa H. Ando S. Kon K. Tanaka Y. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3075-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it was also found in the brain (0.3 mg/kg (45Hirabayashi Y. Hyogo A. Nakao T. Tsuchiya K. Suzuki Y. Matsumoto M. Kon K. Ando S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). All of the âÎ±-seriesâ gangliosides (bearing an Î±2,6-linked NeuAc residue on a gangliotetraose core) are very minor species compared with GD1a, the major ganglioside of brain (â¼1200 mg/kg (20Tettamanti G. Bonali F. Marchesini S. Zambotti V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 296: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar)). The biological significance of Î±-series ganglioside recognition by MAG must be considered in light of their relatively low expression. However, the highly restricted expression of Î±-series gangliosides may result in selected neurons with enhanced siglec recognition. Alternatively, yet unappreciated lectins may interact with these unusual gangliosides. Evaluation of their biological significance may await disruption of the Î±2,6-sialyltransferase responsible for their synthesis. Nevertheless, the ability of the Î±2,6-NeuAc residue, as well as II3- and III6-sulfates, to enhance MAG and SMP recognition in extended conformation with the primary Î±2,3-NeuAc terminus may provide useful biological and pharmacological tools.

Three isozymes of NOS are known (neuronal, nNOS; endothelial, eNOS; and inducible, iNOS) that share the same domain structure and catalytic mechanism. All three isozymes catalyze NO synthesis at a cytochrome P-450-like thiolate-bound heme, located in the N-terminal oxygenase domain. Reducing equivalents for the reaction are transferred from NADPH to the heme by a C-terminal reductase domain containing one molecule each of bound FAD and FMN. This electron transfer requires the binding of calmodulin to a site between the reductase and the oxygenase. Coupling of NADPH oxidation to NO synthesis requires a further cofactor, the pteridine derivative H4biopterin (4Mayer B. Andrew P. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 358: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has not yet been determined exactly why NOS requires H4biopterin for activity. Although net oxidation to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, as observed in other H4biopterin-dependent enzymes, does not occur (5RiethmuÌller C. Gorren A.C.F. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Habisch H.-J. Heales S.J.R.

These include a shift of the heme coordination equilibrium toward pentacoordinate (high spin) as opposed to hexacoordinate (low spin) forms (8Sono M. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The main differences between the isozymes concern their regulatory properties. The first major distinction is that whereas calmodulin binding and activation of nNOS and eNOS is Ca2+-dependent, iNOS binds calmodulin irreversibly and its activity is effectively Ca2+-independent under physiological conditions. Another difference is that nNOS, when less than fully saturated withl-arginine and H4biopterin, is able to catalyze uncoupled NADPH oxidation, with release of Oâ¨ª2 from the heme site, at much higher rates than the other two isozymes (16Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 17Miller R.T. MartaÌsek P. Roman L.J. Nishimura J.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15277-15284Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This reaction of nNOS is suspected to contribute to brain damage during ischemic episodes (stroke) (18Huang Z. Huang P.L. Panahian N. Dalkara T. Fishman M.C. Moskowitz M.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1883-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), whereas available evidence suggests that under these conditions eNOS fulfills a protective role (19Huang Z. Huang P.L. Ma J. Meng W. Ayata C. Fishman M.C. Moskowitz M.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Thus, precise discrimination between the isoenzymes seems to be a prerequisite for understanding the contribution of NOS to pathological processes, and by extrapolation, for drugs that modulate NOS activity to achieve useful effects (4Mayer B. Andrew P. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 358: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of eNOS, a number of questions related to isozyme-specific properties remain to be solved. First of all, it seemed important to demonstrate whether the suppression of uncoupled NADPH oxidase activity observed previously for the bovine enzyme (15List B.M. KloÌsch B. VoÌlker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) is preserved in the human enzyme. Secondly, although a relatively low specific activity compared with the other isozymes is to some extent an intrinsic property of eNOS (20Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we were curious to see whether human eNOS expressed in eukaryotic cells would exhibit equally low or improved activity. A third question centers on the role of H4biopterin in eNOS dimerization. Previous studies of bovine eNOS found a substantial fraction of the characteristic SDS-resistant dimer even in the absence of added H4biopterin, and addition of H4biopterin did not significantly increase this component (15List B.M. KloÌsch B. VoÌlker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Also, the recent crystal structure of bovine eNOS oxygenase dimer did not reveal significant conformational differences between H4biopterin-bound and H4biopterin-free forms (7Raman C.S. Li H. MartaÌsek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These results might suggest that dimer stabilization by H4biopterin is not a feature of eNOS, which would be a major difference to the other isozymes. A new feature of NOS structure was discovered by Raman et al. (7Raman C.S. Li H. MartaÌsek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) in the course of solving the crystal structure of the bovine eNOS oxygenase dimer. A zinc ion was found at the dimeric interface, bound by two cysteine thiolates from each subunit. The tight, 4S-tetrahedral binding was reminiscent of structural, rather than catalytic zinc sites in other enzymes. Site-directed mutation of one of the zinc-binding cysteines to alanine greatly reduced zinc incorporation but did not completely inactivate the enzyme, supporting a structural rather than catalytic role. Zinc was also found in nNOS (22Miller R.T. MartaÌsek P. Raman C.S. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although not in the crystal structure of iNOS oxygenase domain as reported by Crane et al. (23Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). However, the recent paper of Fischmann et al. (24Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) confirmed the existence of zinc in human eNOS and iNOS expressed in Escherichia coli. Thus, it is not yet certain whether zinc is bound at this site in all NOSs or depends on expression conditions or perhaps on the expression system. Here we report results relevant to these issues obtained with a highly active human eNOS, obtained in high yield by overexpression in Pichia pastoris. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine hydrochloride (57 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. [3H]-Arginine was further purified as described earlier (25Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. BaÌchinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). H4Biopterin and 4-amino-H4biopterin were obtained from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Materials for molecular biology were from New England Biolabs, Life Technologies, Inc., and Qiagen. The EasySelect Pichia Expression Kit was from Invitrogen (Bio-Trade, Vienna, Austria). Myoglobin (product number M1882), carbonic anhydrase (product number C4831), and all other chemicals were from Sigma. The iron content of the myoglobin was determined by ICP-MS to be 0.71 mol/mol protein and the zinc content of carbonic anhydrase was found to be 0.83 mol/mol protein by the same method. Human eNOS cDNA was from John Parkinson (Berlex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). The mutant human eNOS (G2A) was reverted to wild type human eNOS by site-directed (Ala-2 to Gly-2) mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis as described (26Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3 containing the cDNA for human eNOS was subsequently double digested with HindIII and NotI. The recessed 3â²-termini from the HindIII digest were filled by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of the appropriate dNTPs. The expression vector pPICZA (EasySelectPichia Expression Kit, Invitrogen) was subsequently digested with EcoRI, followed by filling the recessed 3â²-termini and with NotI. The 3.6-kilobase insert was ligated to restricted pPICZA. E. coli TOP10Fâ² cells were transformed with the resulting ligation products and plated on LB/zeocin medium containing 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5, and 25 Î¼g/ml zeocin. The resulting transformants were tested by restriction analysis, and the positive clones were amplified to make larger amounts of DNA. The final DNA construct was linearized with PmeI, the DNA was transformed into the yeast P. pastoris KM71 (Mut5), and the cells were plated on YPDS/zeocin medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1 msorbitol, and 100 Î¼g/ml zeocin, following the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were further tested for growth on increasing concentrations (250, 500, and 1000 Î¼g/ml) of zeocin. An overnight culture (30 Â°C) was inoculated from a single colony of the best clone in 10 ml of buffered minimal glycerol medium (containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, 13.4 g/liter of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 400 Î¼g/liter biotin, 40 mg/literl-histidine, and 1% (v/v) glycerol). The next day this culture was used to inoculate 750 ml of buffered minimal glycerol medium (1:200), and the culture was grown overnight at 30 Â°C to anA 600 of 4â6. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 150 ml of buffered minimal methanol medium (containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, 13.4 g/liter of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 400 Î¼g/liter biotin, 40 mg/literl-histidine, and 5% (v/v) methanol) in the presence of 4 mg/liter hemin chloride and incubated for 24 h at 30 Â°C to induce protein expression. Yeast cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 2000 Ã g for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were resuspended at a concentration equivalent to an A 600 of 125 (based on theA 600 of the culture) in 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm CHAPS. An equal volume of glass beads (0.5 mm) was added to the suspension, and the cells were broken by vigorous vortexing at 4 Â°C for a total of 8 min in bursts of 30 s alternating with cooling on ice. The glass beads were separated by centrifugation at 800 Ã g for 5 min. After a further clearing step at 1600 Ã g for 5 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 Ã g for 15 min to yield an extract that was used for protein purification by affinity chromatography as described previously (28Mayer B. Klatt P. List B.M. Harteneck C. Schmidt K. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 420-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final elution was with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 4 mm EGTA. The enzyme was stored at â70 Â°C in the presence of 1 mm CHAPS. Protein was determined with the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column connected to an AÌKTA Purifier 10 chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The temperature was 10 Â°C, the flow rate was 0.3 ml Ã minâ1, and the eluent was 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.5 mm EDTA. Where indicated, H4biopterin (0.1 mm) andl-arginine (1 mm) were added to the eluent and (30 min prior to injection) to the samples containing 35â90 Î¼g of NOS. Elution was monitored at 280 and 398 nm. The elution position of small amounts (â¤ 5%) of heme-free monomeric eNOS was detected by subtraction of the 398-nm signal (heme absorption) from the 280-nm signal. Calculation of Stokes radii was performed as described previously (15List B.M. KloÌsch B. VoÌlker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Enzyme-bound flavins and H4biopterin were determined by reversed-phase HPLC and fluorescence detection using authentic FAD, FMN, and H4biopterin as standards as described (30Klatt P. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 358-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the standards being treated identically to the enzyme samples. Heme was quantified by reversed-phase HPLC and UV-visible detection using myoglobin as standard, as described (30Klatt P. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 358-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification that samples were acidified with 20 mm HCl before mixing 28 Î¼l of aqueous protein sample with 42 Î¼l of acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (600:1, v/v). Calculation of molar cofactor/NOS ratios is based on a subunit molecular mass of 133 kDa. Iron and zinc bound to eNOS were determined by gel filtration with on-line detection by ICP-MS. Before analysis, the ICP-MS was tuned to give â¼22000 cps (background 3 cps) for lithium and 32000 cps (background 2 cps) for yttrium at a doubly charged ratio Ce2+/Ce â¼1.6% and an oxide ratio of CeO/Ce â¼0.2% (at 1 Î¼g/liter lithium, yttrium, cerium). A Superose 6 HR 10/30 column was run at a flow rate of 0.3 ml Ã minâ1 on a Hewlett-Packard HP1100 ChemStation HPLC system incorporating a UV monitor set at 280 nm. The elution buffer was 0.05m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The outlet of the UV detector was connected directly to the Babington-type nebulizer of a Hewlett-Packard HP4500 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The isotopes chosen for monitoring were 57Fe and 66Zn. The background ICP-MS signals were essentially constant over 10 h of continuous operation, showing that the buffer did not adversely affect performance of the mass spectrometer. The autosampler of the HPLC system was set to an injection volume of 10 Î¼l. Known amounts (5â20 Î¼m) of carbonic anhydrase (for zinc) and myoglobin (for iron) were run to calibrate the peak areas of the MS traces. Graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS) was performed on a Hitachi Z-9000 Zeeman-type instrument equipped with a pyrolytic cuvette. For iron, the following temperature program was used: drying, 50 Â°C for 30 s, ramp from 80â120 Â°C over 60 s, hold at 120 Â°C for 15 s; ashing, 800 Â°C for 30 s; atomization, 2700 Â°C for 10 s and cleaning, 3000 Â°C for 3 s. Samples were prepared by gel filtration on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 containing 0.15 m NaCl, and buffer samples were collected from the column between runs for background correction. For calibration, an iron standard solution (Titrisol, product number 9972, Merck) was diluted to final concentrations of 0â1 Î¼m in 50% (w/w) of the buffer in which the samples were prepared and 1% (w/w) HNO3. Samples of eNOS were diluted 2-fold with Nanopure water to final eNOS concentrations of 0.5â0.7 Î¼m. For both standards and NOS samples, 10-Î¼l samples were introduced into the cuvette followed by 10 Î¼l of 10% (w/w) nitric acid as external modifier. Measurements were repeated at least five times for each enzyme sample. NOS activity was determined as formation ofl-[2,3,4,5-3H]citrulline froml-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (31Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Incubations were for 10 min at 37 Â°C in 0.1 ml of 50 mmtriethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1â0.2 Î¼g of eNOS, 0.1 mml-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (approximately 80000 cpm), 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 Î¼g/ml calmodulin, 0.2 mm NADPH, 10 Î¼mH4biopterin, 5 Î¼m FAD, 5 Î¼mFMN, and 0.2 mm CHAPS. NADPH oxidation was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and 37 Â°C as described previously (32Mayer B. John M. Heinzel B. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Schultz G. BoÌhme E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The reaction mix contained 1â3 Î¼g of purified NOS, 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 10 Î¼g/ml calmodulin, 0.1 mm NADPH, 2.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm CHAPS, and, when indicated, 0.1 mml-arginine and 10 Î¼m H4biopterin. The observed rates were corrected by subtraction of blank rates obtained in the absence of calmodulin. Cytochrome c reductase activity was determined photometrically in 0.2 ml of 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 Î¼g/ml calmodulin, and 0.1 mm NADPH in the presence of 0.2 Î¼g of eNOS and 200 Î¼m cytochrome c (33Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. BoÌhme E. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of reduction was calculated using the extinction coefficient of 21 mmâ1 Ã cmâ1 for cytochromec at 550 nm. Purified eNOS was analyzed as described previously by conventional (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) or low temperature SDS-PAGE (13Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. BaÌchinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To test for formation of SDS-resistant dimers, 32-Î¼l samples of eNOS were incubated at 37 Â°C for 10 min in the absence or presence of H4biopterin (0.2 mm) and l-arginine (1 mm). Incubations were terminated by chilling the samples on ice and adding 8 Î¼l of sample buffer containing 0.32 mTris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 m glycine, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol and 0.03% bromphenol blue. Samples containing 1â2 Î¼g of eNOS were subjected to low temperature SDS-PAGE on discontinuous 5% SDS gels, using the Mini Protean II system from Bio-Rad. Gels were stained either for protein with Coomassie Blue R250 or for heme with 3,3â²-dimethoxybenzidine/H2O2 using the method of Thomas et al. (35Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) as adapted by List et al.(15List B.M. KloÌsch B. VoÌlker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in triplicate with 3â4 different eNOS preparations, and results are expressed as mean values Â± S.E. Plots of eNOS activity versusH4biopterin and 4-amino-H4biopterin were fitted to the Hill equation. Values for K m andV max were obtained from direct fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Human eNOS was expressed in P. pastoris using the highly inducible PAOX1 promoter. Analyzing lysates of methanol-induced cells, a band with an apparent molecular mass of 131 kDa became visible on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels, in close agreement with the calculated value of 133 kDa (Fig. 1, lane B versus lane C). This band was recognized on Western blots by an antibody raised against bovine eNOS (data not shown). The recombinant protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential chromatography of crude supernatants over 2â²,5â²-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 1, lanes D and E, respectively). Yeast supernatants typically exhibited specific NOS activities of 4â6 nmol of l-citrulline Ã mgâ1 Ã minâ1. The representative purification shown in Table I led to the isolation of 1.2 mg of eNOS from 110 ml of cell culture. The specific activity of this particular preparation was 190 nmol ofl-citrulline Ã mgâ1 Ã minâ1. Addition of 1 mm CHAPS was essential to prevent precipitation during storage at â70 Â°C.Table IPurification of human eNOS expressed in P. pastorisFractionProteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgnmol Ã min â1nmol Ã mg â1 Ã min â1%Lysate (30,000 Ã gsupernatant)100.85165.11002â²,5â²-ADP-Sepharose2.645217587Calmodulin-Sepharose1.221919043 Open table in a new tab The heme spectrum of eNOS displayed a Soret maximum at 398 nm, and the flavin absorbances at 456 and 480 nm appeared as shoulders (Fig. 2). The enzyme had aK m for l-arginine of 3.9 Â± 0.2 Î¼m and a V max of 192 Â± 18 nmol l-citrulline Ã mgâ1 Ã minâ1 (Table II). Calmodulin-dependent cytochrome c reduction was catalyzed with a specific activity of 2.81 Â± 0.14 Î¼mol Ã mgâ1 Ã minâ1, more than 10-fold higher thanl-citrulline formation. The protein contained 0.56 Â± 0.06 equivalents of FAD and 0.79 Â± 0.08 equivalents of FMN. Possible conversion of FAD to FMN during the HPLC assay was excluded by measuring FAD-only standards. The pterin cofactor H4biopterin was not detectable with the HPLC method (detection limit was 30 nm, corresponding to 0.02 mol of H4biopterin/subunit). The absorbance of the pteridine- and substrate-free enzyme at 398 nm (assuming an extinction coefficient of 72 mmâ1 Ã cmâ1 (36Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) implied a heme content of 0.85 Â± 0.09 mol/subunit, and the HPLC heme assay gave an estimate of 0.71 Â± 0.02 mol heme/subunit (Table II). On-line gel filtration/ICP-MS analysis confirmed that both iron and zinc were bound to the enzyme (Fig. 3). Comparison of the peak areas with those obtained for myoglobin and carbonic anhydrase led to values of 0.80 Â± 0.09 mol of iron/subunit and 0.43 Â± 0.03 mol zinc/subunit. GF-AAS yielded an iron content of 0.84 Â± 0.04 equivalents/NOS subunit (mean Â± S.E. from three preparations), in close agreement with the values from the UV absorbance and the on-line ICP-MS. We were not able to measure zinc in these samples by GF-AAS because the ashing temperatures required were too low to reduce background signals from the buffer components.Table IICharacteristics of human eNOS expressed in P. pastorisK m forl-arginine3.9 Â± 0.2 Î¼mV max192 Â± 18 nmoll-citrulline Ã mgâ1 Ã minâ1Cytochrome c reductase activity2.81 Â± 0.14 Î¼mol Ã mgâ1 Ã minâ1Enzyme-bound cofactorsEquivalents per subunitHeme0.85 Â± 0.09 (A 398)0.71 Â± 0.02 (HPLC)H4biopterinNDFAD0.56 Â± 0.06FMN0.79 Â± 0.08Enzyme-bound metalsEquivalents/subunitIron0.80 Â± 0.09 (ICP-MS)Iron0.84 Â± 0.04 (GF-AAS)Zinc0.43 Â± 0.03 (ICP-MS) Open table in a new tab FIG. 3On-line gel filtration/ICP-MS of eNOS.

The enzyme was previously shown to be abundant in both the liver and pancreas of the rat, to consist of four identical monomers, and to contain tightly bound folate polyglutamates in vivo. We now report that the inhibition of glycine N-methyltransferase by (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 is noncompetitive with regard to both S-adenosylmethionine and glycine. The enzyme exhibits strong positive cooperativity with respect to S-adenosylmethionine. Cooperativity increases with increasing concentrations of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 and is greater at physiological pH than at pH 9.0, the pH optimum. Under the same conditions, cooperativity is much greater for the pancreatic form of the enzyme. The V max for the liver form of the enzyme is approximately twice that of the pancreatic enzyme, whileK m values for each substrate are similar in the liver and pancreatic enzymes. For the liver enzyme, at pH 7.0 half-maximal inhibition is seen at a concentration of about 0.2 Î¼m(6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5, while at pH 9.0 this value is increased to about 1 Î¼m. For the liver form of the enzyme, 50% inhibition with respect toS-adenosylmethionine at pH 7.4 occurs at about 0.27 Î¼m. The dissociation constant, K s, obtained from binding data at pH 7.4 is 0.095. About 1 mol of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5was bound per tetramer at pH 7.0, and 1.6 mol were bound at pH 9.0. The degree of binding and inhibition were closely parallel at each pH. At equal concentrations of (6R,6S)- and (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5, the natural (6S) form was about twice as inhibitory. These studies indicate that glycine N-methyltransferase is a highly allosteric enzyme, which is consistent with its role as a regulator of methyl group metabolism in both the liver and the pancreas. Glycine N-methyltransferase (EC2.1.1.20) catalyzes the methylation of glycine byS-adenosylmethionine to form sarcosine andS-adenosylhomocysteine.

It was first discovered by Blumenstein and Williams (1Blumenstein J. Williams G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1960; 3: 259-263Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in guinea pig liver but was not purified. Kerr (2Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4248-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rediscovered the enzyme in crude extracts of rabbit liver when the high activity of GNMT interfered with the measurement of RNA methyltransferase. It was subsequently purified from rabbit liver (3Heady J.F. Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 69-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found to comprise 0.9â3% of the soluble protein. GNMT is also very abundant in rat liver. It was purified by Ogawa and Fujioka (4Ogawa H. Fujioka M. J. Biol Chem. 1982; 257: 3447-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to consist of four identical subunits ofM r = 32,423. We had earlier purified a folate-binding protein from rat liver cytosol, which contained tightly, but not covalently, bound 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 in vivo(5Suzuki H. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This protein had a similar molecular weight, number of subunits, and amino acid composition as rat liver GNMT. We subsequently showed that this folate-binding protein was identical to GNMT (6Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This was surprising, since the folate does not participate in the enzyme reaction. Further studies showed, however, that when 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was bound, it inhibited GNMT activity (7Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We suggested that inhibition of GNMT by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 is a critical component of a regulatory mechanism that links the availability of preformed methyl groups (from dietary methionine) to the de novo synthesis of methyl groups via the one-carbon folate pool (7Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,8Balaghi M. Wagner C. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another abundant source of GNMT is the pancreas (2Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4248-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 also acts as an inhibitor of the pancreatic enzyme (9Yeo E. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24669-24674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structure of recombinant rat liver GNMT has been resolved (10Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takasugawa F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11985-11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The binding of folates and their inhibition of GNMT were not investigated, however. In this study, we characterize the binding of and inhibition by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 to liver and pancreatic GNMT. Rat liver GNMT was purified from rat liver extract by a modification of the method described previously by Suzuki and Wagner (5Suzuki H. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rat pancreatic GNMT was purified from fresh pancreata as described by Yeo and Wagner (9Yeo E. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24669-24674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic folic acid pentaglutamate (PteGlu5) was provided by B. Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland. Synthetic (6R,6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5was prepared from the corresponding folate polyglutamates as described by Yeo and Wagner (9Yeo E. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24669-24674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was prepared as described below. Bio-Safe II scintillation fluid was from Research Products International Corp. AdoMet was obtained from Sigma, andS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (73.5 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. The labeled and unlabeled AdoMet were repurified by a modification of the procedure by Zappia et al. (11Zappia V. Carteni-Farina M. Calleti P. Ragione F.D. Cacciapnoti G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5was prepared by a modification of the method used for the preparation of radioactive (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu from folic acid (12Horne D.W. Briggs W.T. Wagner C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The procedure consisted of direct reduction of PteGlu5 to H4PteGlu5 by using dihydrofolate reductase. The H4PteGlu5 reacted with formaldehyde to give 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu5, which was reduced to 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 with sodium borohydride. The details are described below. About 0.25 Î¼mol of PteGlu5 (100 Î¼l) was added to the reaction mixture containing 0.5 mg of NADPH (100 Î¼l), 0.5 ml of 0.05m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, 9.9 mg of solid sodium ascorbate, 10 Î¼l of 0.37% (v/v) formaldehyde, and 0.3 ml of distilled water. The solution was bubbled with N2 for 2 min, and then 1 mg of solid dihydrofolate reductase fromLactobacillus casei (0.075 unit/mg, dry weight) was added. It is important to use the enzyme from L. casei, because dihydrofolate reductase from many other sources does not readily react with PteGlu n derivatives but only with 7, 8-H2PteGlu n derivatives. The mixture was incubated under nitrogen in the dark for 1 h, at 37 Â°C. Additional formaldehyde (250 Î¼l of 0.37%) was added and incubated for an additional 10 min. To the reaction mixture, 0.5 ml of cold deaerated 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added. Then 10 mg of sodium borohydride in 100 Î¼l of the Tris buffer was added in four portions over a period of 5 min. The tube was flushed with nitrogen and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h. After the incubation, the tube was cooled in an ice bath, and 10 Î¼l of 14 m2-mercaptoethanol was added to protect folates from oxidation. The pH was reduced to 5.0 with 5 n acetic acid to destroy excess borohydride, and then the pH was adjusted back to 7.2 with 1n NaOH. The product ((6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5) was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography with a Mono Q column, which was equilibrated with 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and was eluted with a gradient of 0â2 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.2, in 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The product was lyophilized and taken up in 5 ml of 0.5 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Its identity was confirmed by treatment with conjugase and high performance liquid chromatography analysis as described by Wilson and Horne (13Wilson S.D. Horne D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies had shown that inhibition of GNMT activity by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was variable and tended to be influenced by the order of addition of substrate or inhibitor. When the enzyme was preincubated with 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5, inhibition was consistently observed. Kinetic measurements were carried out using the charcoal adsorption method for GNMT assay as described before (6Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) at pH 7.4 and at pH 9.0, the pH optimum. To examine the the effects of varying glycine on GNMT activity, the reaction mixture contained about 1.5 Î¼g of GNMT; either 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.4, or 0.2m Tris, pH 9.0; 0.5 mm[3H-CH3]AdoMet (â¼5,000 dpm/nmol); and 5 mm DTT. To examine the effects of varying AdoMet, 8 mm glycine was included. Inhibition of activity was determined by including (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 at varying concentrations. The 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was made up in 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the same amount of 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples without inhibitor. Measurement of inhibition was carried out by preincubating the enzyme, buffer, DTT, and either 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 or 2-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at 25 Â°C. The reaction was started by the addition of substrates. The total volume of the incubation mixture was 0.1 ml. Blank reactions were carried out in the absence of glycine. Incubations were carried out at 25 Â°C for 15 min at pH 9.0 and for 30 min at pH 7.4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 Î¼l of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by 250 Î¼l of a charcoal suspension (38 mg/ml in 0.1 m acetic acid). After 15 min at 0 Â°C, the sample was centrifuged for 4 min in a microcentrifuge. Two hundred Î¼l of the supernatant was added to 5 ml of Bio-Safe II scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity incorporated into sarcosine was counted in a BetaTrac liquid scintillation system (Tm Analytic). All assays were carried out in duplicate. Blank values obtained in the absence of glycine were subtracted to give net counts. Enzyme activity was expressed as nmol of product formed per min per mg of protein. The data were analyzed using the Kaleidograph program (Synergy Software) to fit the data to the Hill equation using nonlinear regression analysis. Binding experiments were carried out using liver GNMT and nonradioactive (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5. The components of the reaction mixture used to study binding were the same as for measurement of enzyme activity, except that glycine and AdoMet were omitted. For studies at pH 7.0, the reaction mixture contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm DTT, 0.35 Î¼m GNMT, and various amounts of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 in a final volume of 300 Î¼l. For studies at pH 9.0, the reaction mixture was the same except that 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, buffer was used. The amount of protein was calculated by the Bradford method (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) after standardization of GNMT by amino acid analysis. Phosphate (0.1m) was included in studies carried out at both pH values, since the stock solution of the folate ligand was dissolved in 0.5m, pH 7.0, phosphate. After incubation at 25 Â°C for 45 min, 200 Î¼l of the reaction mixture was applied to an Amicon micropartition system, MPS-1, containing a YMT ultrafiltration membrane. The filter apparatus was centrifuged at 1000 Ãg for several minutes, and the unbound folate passed into the filtrate. The free folate in the filtrate and the total folate in the reaction mixture were measured by fluorescence. Bound folate was determined by difference. Measurement of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was carried out fluorometrically using the method of Giulidori (15Giulidori P. Galli-Kienle M. Stramentinoli G. Clin. Chem. 1981; 27: 2041-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, model 650-40) was set at 297 and 360 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Samples of 100 Î¼l were adjusted to pH 2.5, since the intensity of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 fluorescence is much greater in acid. A blank was prepared using only enzyme, and fluorescence values were corrected. A standard curve was prepared using 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5. The amount of bound 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5/free 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was plottedversus the concentration of bound 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 in a Scatchard plot, and maximum binding was determined by extrapolation. Companion inhibition studies were carried out by preincubating liver GNMT with various concentrations of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 for 15 min at 25 Â°C in a reaction mixture containing 0.2 mTris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 5 mm DTT in a volume of 60 Î¼l. The reaction mixture also contained 8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 m potassium phosphate, which were added with the folate ligand. The enzyme reaction was started by bringing the volume to 100 Î¼l with the addition of 0.2 Î¼mol of glycine and 0.02 Î¼mol of [3H]AdoMet (4773 dpm/nmol). After a 30-min incubation at 25 Â°C, the reaction was stopped, and the enzyme activity was measured as described above. Activity was compared with control samples preincubated in the absence of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5. Inhibition of liver GNMT by (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 at pH 7.0 was also examined. This was carried out in a 60-Î¼l incubation mixture with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 4.5 Î¼g of enzyme. After a 15-min preincubation at 25 Â°C, the substrates were added, and the volume was brought to 100 Î¼l. The reaction was continued for 1 h. Purified liver GNMT (1 Î¼g) was preincubated with 100 pmol of either (6R,6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5or (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5or without any addition in a solution containing 20 Î¼mol of Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.5 Î¼mol of DTT, 5 Î¼mol of potassium phosphate, and 0.4 Î¼mol of 2-mercaptoethanol in a final volume of 60 Î¼l for 15 min. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of [3H]AdoMet and varying amounts of glycine, so the final concentration of AdoMet was 0.5 mm and varying amounts of glycine in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Incubation was carried out at 25 Â°C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped, and activity was measured as described above. GNMT is a highly allosteric enzyme. Fig. 1 shows extensive cooperativity with respect to AdoMet as substrate for the rat liver enzyme at pH 7.4. Cooperativity appears to be increased with increasing concentrations of the inhibitory ligand, 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5. The pH optimum for GNMT is 9.0 (4Ogawa H. Fujioka M. J. Biol Chem. 1982; 257: 3447-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this pH, GNMT shows minimal cooperativity, but in the presence of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5sigmoid kinetics is easily seen (Fig. 2). In contrast, hyperbolic kinetics is seen with respect to the second substrate, glycine, at both pH 7.4 and pH 9.0 (data not shown). 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 behaves as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet. This is more clearly seen at pH 9.0 (Fig. 3). Here, the data are presented in a Hanes-Woolf plot to avoid the undue weighting of the lowest concentration of substrate inherent in the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot. It can be seen that three of the lines clearly intersect on the x axis, while the fourth line is only slightly below the others, indicating that the inhibition is noncompetitive. The greater sigmoidicity at pH 7.4 results in plots that are nonlinear and are difficult to interpret (data not shown). In contrast, there is no cooperativity with respect to glycine as a substrate, and a double reciprocal plot shows that 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 is clearly a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to glycine (Fig. 4). Pancreatic GNMT is also inhibited by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5. The pancreatic enzyme appears to be even more allosteric than the liver enzyme, although there is no significant cooperativity at pH 9.0 in the absence of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 (Fig. 5). The effects of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 on the cooperativity of the liver and pancreatic forms of GNMT are summarized as apparent Hill coefficients in Table I. Values for V max(app) andK m (app) are shown in Table II. No data were collected for the pancreatic enzyme at pH 7.4. The pancreatic enzyme is about half as active as the liver enzyme under similar conditions.FIG. 2Effect of AdoMet concentration on liver GNMT activity at pH 9.0 in the absence and presence of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5.Conditions were the same as for Fig. 1 except that the pH was 9.0 and incubation was for 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 3Hanes-Woolf plot of the effect of AdoMet concentration on liver GNMT activity at pH 9.0 in the absence and presence of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5.Conditions were the same as for Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 4Double reciprocal plot of the effect of glycine concentration on liver GNMT activity at pH 9.0 in the absence and presence of 0.3 Î¼m(6R,6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5.AdoMet was maintained at 0.5 mm, and glycine was varied from 0.1 to 4.0 mm.

Open table in a new tab Because reciprocal plots of velocities obtained with GNMT under different concentrations of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 at pH 7.4 are not linear, as with all enzymes exhibiting positive cooperativity, it was impossible to determine the K i from a Dixon plot. Therefore, the concentration of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 that results in 50% inhibition was determined at saturating (0.70 and 0.35 mm) concentrations of AdoMet. A value of about 0.27 Î¼m was obtained (Fig. 6). This value is comparable with the dissociation constant,K s, obtained from binding data (see below). The inhibitory effects of (6R,6S)- or (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 on liver GNMT are shown in Fig. 7. When equimolar amounts (1 Î¼m) of either the (R,S) or the (S) form were added, the (S) form was approximately twice as inhibitory, suggesting that the unnatural (R) form is a much less potent inhibitor. When purified liver GNMT was incubated with increasing amounts of (6S)-CH3-H4PteGlu5 for 1 h, complete inhibition was obtained at about 9 Î¼mat pH 7.0 (Fig. 8 A). Half-maximal inhibition occurred at about 0.2 Î¼m. A similar experiment was carried out at pH 9.0 (Fig. 8 B), but in this case the enzymatic reaction was continued for only 30 min. In contrast, at pH 9.0, a maximum of 80% inhibition was obtained, and half-maximal inhibition occurred at about 1.1 Î¼m (Fig. 8 B). The increased reaction time at pH 7.0 was required in order to obtain accurate measurements, because GNMT is less active at this pH. Binding studies were carried out in a similar manner but in the absence of substrates. Following the incubation period, a portion of the incubation mixture was rapidly filtered as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ to separate bound and unbound folate. The amount of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 was measured by fluorescence after acidification as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Scatchard plots of the binding data (Fig. 9) show that binding is concave upward. Analysis of the data is complicated by the nonlinear nature of the binding process, but extrapolation of the curves to thex axis provides an estimate of the maximum concentrations of ligand bound that are about 0.36 Î¼m at pH 7.0 and 0.57 Î¼m at pH 9.0. Since each experiment used 0.35 Î¼m enzyme, this calculates to a stoichiometry of 1 mol of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 per tetramer at pH 7.0. At pH 9.0, the corresponding stoichiometry is 1.6. The binding data were recalculated as percentage of maximum binding (%Bmax) at each concentration of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5, and these values were replotted in Fig. 8, A and B. There is a very close correspondence between the amount of inhibition of GNMT activity and the amount of ligand bound, despite the fact that only 1 mol of bound 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 causes complete inhibition of the tetrameric enzyme at pH 7.0. At pH 9.0, the binding of 1 mol of ligand produced about 80% inhibition. Hill plots of the binding of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5at pH 9.0 and 7.0 gave n values of 0.65 and 1.0, respectively (data not shown). Values of n less than 1.0 and Scatchard plots that are concave upward are characteristic of either a heterogeneity of binding sites or negative cooperativity between binding sites in which the first ligand has a higher apparent affinity than subsequent ligands (16Dahlquist F.H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Calculation of the dissociation constant from the slopes of the extrapolated linear portions of the Scatchard plots in Fig. 9, A and B, gave values of 0.095 Î¼m at pH 7.4 and 1.9 Î¼m at pH 9.0.FIG. 9Scatchard plot of the specific binding of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 to liver GNMT. A, purified enzyme (14 Î¼g) was incubated with various concentrations of (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 for 75 min at 25 Â°C in a total volume of 300 Î¼l at pH 7.0 to provide a final enzyme concentration of 0.35 Î¼m.

J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4248-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is present in large amounts, and the product of methyl transfer in the reaction is sarcosine, which has no known physiologic role in mammals. For this reason it has been suggested (2Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4248-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that GNMT serves as a mechanism for converting excess AdoMet, arising from methionine, to AdoHcy in order to stabilize the ratio of AdoMet/AdoHcy. Since most methylation reactions are product-inhibited by AdoHcy, this ratio is believed to reflect the overall methylating ability of the cell (17Cantoni G.L. Richards H.H. Chiang P.K. Usdin E. Borchardt R.T. Creveling C.R. Transmethylation. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1978: 155-164Google Scholar). The fact that GNMT is also inhibited by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 links the availability of preformed methyl groups, as manifested by the level of AdoMet, to the de novo synthesis of methyl groups via the one-carbon folate pool (7Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The abundance of GNMT in the pancreas as well as the liver of the rabbit and the rat was first noted by Kerr (2Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4248-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ogawa et al. (18Ogawa H. Gomi T. Horii T. Ogawa H. Fujioka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed that mRNA for GNMT is almost as abundant in pancreas as in liver. We have shown that pancreatic GNMT contains tightly bound folate in vivo (9Yeo E. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24669-24674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that the patterns of inhibition of both liver and pancreatic forms of GNMT are very similar. The inhibition by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5has unusual features. It behaves in many respects as a slow, tightly binding inhibitor. Preliminary studies indicated that inhibition was consistent when the enzyme was preincubated with 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 for 15 min before the addition of substrate. Because only a discontinuous assay for GNMT activity is available, it has been impossible to describe the decrease in reaction velocity as a function of time. Ogawa et al.(19Ogawa H. Gomi T. Takata Y. Date T. Fujioka M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have developed a continuous assay for GNMT activity that involves coupling the production of S-adenosylhomocysteine toS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and adenosine deaminase. The adenosine formed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is then converted to inosine with a decrease in absorbance at 265 nm. Unfortunately, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine, and the coupled reaction cannot be carried at concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine greater than 0.1 mm. 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 also binds very tightly to GNMT. GNMT was first purified as a liver cytosolic folate-binding protein. Radioactive folate was injected into rats, and 24 h later the liver cytosol contained a protein of about 130 kDa that had tightly bound 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 (20Zamierowski M.M. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 933-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, purification was dependent upon following the bound radioactivity over several different columns. Only when passed over an anion exchange column did the folate ligand dissociate (5Suzuki H. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Tightly binding inhibitors are effective at concentrations similar to that of the enzyme (21Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In the studies described here, GNMT was present at a concentration of about 0.09 Î¼m (for the tetrameric enzyme), and CH3-H4PteGlu5 was present at concentrations of 0.1â0.3 Î¼m. Under these conditions, a significant amount of enzyme and inhibitor should be present in an essentially irreversible complex, and the assumptions upon which the Michaelis-Menten and the Hill equations are based do not apply (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Wiley Classics Library Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 15-151Google Scholar). It is therefore surprising that the positive cooperativity of GNMT is increased with increasing amounts of inhibitor. One would expect the reaction rate to be decreased when significant amounts of enzyme are tied up in an essentially irreversible complex but not that the cooperativity of the enzyme would increase. Fig. 8 Aindicates that at a concentration of 0.1 Î¼m about 5% of CH3-H4PteGlu5 was bound, and at 0.3 Î¼m about 30% was bound at pH 7.4 (i.e. 95 and 70%, respectively, were unbound). It may be that the decreased amounts of enzyme and inhibitor are not sufficient to significantly alter the fit of the data to the Hill equation. Fig. 8 A also shows that it is possible to completely inhibit the enzyme, but this requires far greater concentrations of CH3-H4PteGlu5 (about 8 Î¼m). Ogawa and Fujioka (4Ogawa H. Fujioka M. J. Biol Chem. 1982; 257: 3447-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted that liver GNMT exhibited positive cooperativity with respect to AdoMet when measured at pH 7.4. It was also stated that positive cooperativity was noted at pH 8.8. Interaction of AdoMet with the liver enzyme also showed positive cooperativity when measured by the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence at pH 7.4 (23Konishi K. Fujioka M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8496-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or by the binding of radioactive AdoMet at pH 7.2 (24Konishi K. Fujioka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13381-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis of rat liver GNMT removed an 8-residue N-terminal peptide, which changed the kinetics from sigmoid to hyperbolic (24Konishi K. Fujioka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13381-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the recombinant rat liver GNMT has recently been published (10Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takasugawa F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11985-11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown at pH 6.5. The tetrameric structure shows the N terminus of each subunit deeply associated with the other three subunits. We have not observed positive cooperativity of the rat liver enzyme at pH 9.0 in the absence of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5. This suggests that the tetrameric enzyme is in a looser configuration at pH 9.0 than it is at pH 7.0 and that the presence of the inhibitor causes a change in conformation or association, which permits interaction among the subunits. We have also obtained evidence that binding of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 results in a change in the intrinsic fluorescence of GNMT. 2E.-J. Yeo, W. T. Briggs, and C. Wagner, unpublished results. Konishi and Fujioka (24Konishi K. Fujioka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13381-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that 4 mol of AdoMet were bound per tetramer, suggesting the existence of four active sites. This has been confirmed by the crystal structure, which revealed that AdoMet remained bound to each monomer of the enzyme upon crystallization. Inhibition of the liver enzyme by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 occurred at both pH 9.0 and 7.0. Binding and inhibition by 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 closely paralleled each other at both pH values (Fig. 8). Complete inhibition of activity was observed at pH 7.0 when only 1 mol of ligand was bound per mol of tetrameric enzyme. At pH 9.0, a maximum of 1.6 mol of ligand were bound per tetramer. Fu et al. have suggested that 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 binds at the AdoMet binding site (10Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takasugawa F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11985-11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); however, this appears to be extremely unlikely. Aside from the limited similarity between the pterin ring and the purine ring, the two compounds are quite different in structure. AdoMet has a net positive charge, and the folate polyglutamate has multiple negative charges. AdoMet binds to four sites per tetramer and shows positive cooperativity; 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 binds to one site per tetramer and shows negative cooperativity. It is therefore possible that 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 binds to a region that is composed of contributions by more than one subunit. The binding of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 may then restrict access of AdoMet to its binding sites. These suggestions should be clarified by locating 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 within the crystal structure of the molecule. The concentration of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 in rat liver has been estimated to be about 9.1 Î¼m (25Horne D.W. BioFactors. 1989; 2: 65-68PubMed Google Scholar). From the same reference, the concentration of AdoMet can be estimated to be about 0.4 mm. The apparent K m for AdoMet is about 0.39 mm (liver enzyme; Table II). Complete inhibition occurs at 10 Î¼m5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 (Fig. 8 A), and 50% inhibition occurs at about 0.27 Î¼m (Fig. 6). Therefore, the concentrations of these compounds in the liver are in the range where changes could modulate the activity of the enzyme. The complete inhibition of a tetrameric enzyme containing four active sites by a single mole of inhibitor is highly unusual. It would be of benefit, however, for the regulation of GNMT under physiologic conditions, because the enzyme activity can be completely turned on or off through a relatively narrow concentration range of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5. If there were four sites for binding and inhibition, then complete inhibition would require 4 times as much 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5, much more than is actually present (25Horne D.W. BioFactors. 1989; 2: 65-68PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 to GNMT is similar in many aspects to the binding of folate polyglutamates to deoxyhemoglobin. Benesch and co-workers (26Benesch R.E. Benesch R. Kwong S. Baugh C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6202-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Benesch R. Baugh C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14653-14658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that folate polyglutamates are bound to deoxyhemoglobin tetramers at a site to which 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is also bound. Only a single molecule of the folate polyglutamate was bound to the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Both 5-CH3-H4PteGlu7 and PteGlu7 as well as the polyglutamate form of methotrexate were bound with dissociation constants ranging from 0.025 to 0.14 mm at a site that involves the central cavity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. In oxyhemoglobin, the central cavity is too small to accommodate the folate polyglutamate (28Arnone A. Rogers P.H. Benesch R.E. Benesch R. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5853-5857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to think that 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 may bind to the GNMT tetramer in a similar manner. The availability of the crystal structure of the enzyme makes such studies now possible. We acknowledge Byron Glenn and W. Decha-Umphai for excellent technical assistance. In addition, we thank Drs. D. W. Horne and R. J. Cook for useful discussion on methodology. We also are grateful to Dr. R. L. Kisliuk for discussion on the interaction of folate polyglutamate with GNMT."

Circulating VN is essentially monomeric, while VN in the extravascular space is essentially multimeric (1Preissner K.T. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VN avidly binds glycosaminoglycans (GAGs;e.g. heparin (2Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305PubMed Google Scholar)); however, the role and mechanisms of GAG binding by VN remains poorly understood. (i) What is the physiological role of GAG binding? A role in VN activation and VN deposition in tissues has been hypothesized (2Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305PubMed Google Scholar); however, currently only little experimental evidence concerning these hypotheses is available. There is evidence that the heparin-binding to VN allosterically effects ligand binding to other domains of VN (3Seiffert D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Note, however, that the heparin-binding domain of VN does not only interact with glycosaminoglycans but also directly interacts with proteins, including other serum and extracellular matrix proteins (e.g.complement components (4Lim B.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26739-26744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and osteonectin (5Rosenblatt S. Bassuk J.A. Alpers C.E. Sage E.H. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) as well as with microbial proteins (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus(6Chhatwal G.S. Preissner G. MuÌller-Berghaus Blobel H. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1878-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Liang O.D. Maccarana M. Flock J.-I. Paulsson M. Preissner K.T. WadstroÌm T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Liang O.D. Flock J.-I. WadstroÌm T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). (ii) Is the heparin-binding site exposed in monomeric VN? Several studies have suggested that only multimeric and not monomeric VN is able to bind heparin (1Preissner K.T. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This was attributed to a heparin-binding sequence, which is cryptic in monomeric but exposed in multimeric heparin (1Preissner K.T. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has challenged this point of view, suggesting that monomeric and multimeric VN exhibit similar affinity for heparin and that the differences in heparin binding properties induced upon denaturation are due to self-association in a multivalent form (12Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). (iii) Which regions of the VN molecule are involved in heparin binding? Several studies have suggested a role of a highly basic VN region (aa 347â361) to be the heparin-binding site (1Preissner K.T. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1998; 72: 903-912Crossref Google Scholar). However, recent studies have identified novel heparin-binding domains of VN (14Liang O.D. Rosenblatt S. Chhatwal G.S. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (iv) what are the kinetics parameters of heparin binding to VN? Since most previous studies on heparin-VN interaction were done with discontinuous binding assays, no analysis of the kinetic parameters of the heparin-VN interaction has been performed so far. In this study, we analyze the kinetics of the interaction between heparin and multimeric VN and characterize VN interaction with soluble and endothelial cell surface glycosaminoglycans. Chemicals were purchased from Merck (Basel, Switzerland) or Sigma (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland). If not stated otherwise, experiments were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc., Basel, Switzerland). RPMI 1640 was from Life Technologies, Inc.). Chondroitinase was from Sigma, and heparitinase was from Seikogaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin (meanM r 10,000) and CMDBS (a synthetic polysulfonated carboxymethyldextran, mean M r 45,000; see also Refs. 15Jozefonvicz J. Jozefowicz M. J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 1990; 1: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 16Jozefonvicz J. Jozefowicz M. Pure Appl. Chem. 1992; 64: 1783-1788Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by J. Jozefonvicz (LRM, University Paris Nord Villetaneuse, France). Cascade BlueÂ® covalently coupled to heparin was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Concentrations of fluorescent heparin were assayed using the carbazole method (17Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fluorescent heparin was hydrolyzed in H2SO4, and after the addition of carbazole reagent, a colored component presenting a maximum absorbency at 530 nm was yielded. A solution of heparin and a solution of gluconolactone were used as standard. Considering the biological activity of our heparin, we used a previously described assay to evaluate the effect of heparin or derivatives on bacterial adherence to fibronectin-coated surface (18Vaudaux P. Avramoglou T. Letourneur D. Lew D.P. Jozefonvicz J. J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 1992; 4: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This assay revealed that both heparins, either the H108 or the Cascade BlueÂ®(CB)-heparin exhibited similar inhibition efficacy on S. aureus adhesion to fibronectin-coated PMMA coverslips (not shown). The anticoagulant property was also checked using the inactivation rate of factor Xa (19Colliec S. Fischer A.M. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Boisson C. Durand P. Jozefonvicz J. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 143-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Heparin H108 showed an activity of 75 IU/mg, whereas the activity of CB-heparin was 83 IU/mg. Both tests confirmed that the coupling procedure does not affect the biological properties of the molecule. Monomeric VN was purified from human plasma as described previously (1Preissner K.T. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Preissner K.T. Wassmuth R. Muller-Berghaus G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at â70 Â°C. Multimeric VN was generated by incubation of the monomeric form for 1 h at 37 Â°C in 8 m urea, followed by extensive dialysis (11Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that this protocol leads to VN multimers containing 3â18 molecules of the protein (11Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1998; 72: 903-912Crossref Google Scholar). All indicated VN concentrations are based on the molecular weight of the monomer (M r 72,000). Since nondenaturing gel electrophoresis demonstrated the spontaneous formation of VN dimers within the monomer preparation, we designed a simple protocol to remove the dimers; 100-Î¼l fractions of plasma VN (1.4 mg/ml) were mixed with 10 Î¼l of a 50% slurry of heparin-Sepharose 6B in PBS. After 2 h of incubation with constant shaking, each sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 Ã g. The purity of the preparation was assessed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see below). VN-derived peptides VN347â361 and VN371â383 were synthesized through standard procedures. A polyclonal Î±-VN antibody was obtained by immunization of rabbit with the synthetic peptide (VN347â361) (13Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1998; 72: 903-912Crossref Google Scholar). The IgG fraction of the antiserum recognized VN multimers but not the native protein (Fig. 3 A). Antibody was then desalted on G-25 gel filtration column equilibrated in PBS. Overnight cultures of S. aureus 6850 and Staphylococcus epidermidis KH11 were grown in chemically defined medium (2 liters) (22Hussain M. Wilcox M.H. White P.J. Faulkner M.K. Spencer R.C. J. Hosp. Infect. 1992; 20: 173-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Heilmann C. Hussain M. Peters G. GoÌtz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and washed in PBS. Cells were then suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 2% SDS. Cells were heated for 5 min at 95 Â°C. After cooling, SDS was removed by exhaustive dialysis against PBS. Protein content was assayed using a commercially available kit (Pierce method; Socochim, Lausanne, Switzerland) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by a silver staining procedure. Extracts showed the characteristic pattern of staphylococcal proteins with a repartition of molecular weight ranging from 20,000 to 140,000. Human endothelial cord cells (ECV304, ATCC:CRL-1998) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 Â°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, in 75-cm2 culture dishes, containing at confluence approximately 107 cells. Adherent cells were detached using EDTA 2.5 mm for 5 min. After rinsing twice in PBS, one half of the suspension was suspended in culture medium, whereas the other half was suspended in PBS plus 0.1% albumin (PBSA) containing 50 mIU/ml and 0.5 IU/ml of heparitinase (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo) and chondroitinase ABC (Sigma). Both suspensions were incubated for 3 h at 37 Â°C with constant and gentle shaking. This treatment has been shown to lead to an almost total degradation of cellular glycosaminoglycans (24de Agostini A.I. Ramus M.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25de Agostini A.I. Watkins S.C. Slayter H.S. Youssoufian H. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 26Ueda H. Fujimori O. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1998; 60: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). After glycosaminoglycan removal, cells were washed with PBSA, resuspended in 100 Î¼l of PBSA, and subjected to VN-binding experiments. Plasma VN (2 Î¼g) or a mixture of plasma VN and heparin H108 (2 or 5 Î¼g) was mixed with 1.5 Ã 106 of enzymatically treated or untreated cells. After an incubation period of 60 min at 4 Â°C, each sample was centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatants were then collected in new tubes. In parallel, 2 Î¼g of plasma VN was incubated in the same condition as above but in PBSA or in PBSA enriched with heparin. Protein samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis (8% acrylamide) under nondenaturing, nonreducing conditions as described (13Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1998; 72: 903-912Crossref Google Scholar). After separation, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a liquid transblot system (Bio-Rad) in a 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, for 2 h under constant voltage (15 V). Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 2.5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. All VN forms were detected using a monoclonal antibody against human VN (1:1000; Life Technologies, Inc., Basel, Switzerland), followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG coupled to peroxidase (1:10,000). Western immunoblots were also performed using the rabbit anti-VN347â361 peptide (1:50), followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG coupled to peroxidase (1:10,000). Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Films showing immunoreactive bands were scanned (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed with an imaging system (Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant Software), and the ratio of dimeric Vn/monomeric Vn was calculated. All fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer LS-3 fluorescence spectrometer, coupled to a computerized data acquisition program (Daqsys, University of Geneva). The sampling rate was 50 ms (standard measurements) or 30 ms (kinetic analysis). Recorded traces were analyzed by the package Origin (MicroCal Software Inc., Northampton, MA) using a PC/AT 486 computer. All fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were monitored in solution with Î»excitation = 280 nm and Î»emission = 426 nm. All environment-dependent fluorescence intensity (EDFI) experiments were monitored in solution with Î»excitation = 380 nm and Î»emission = 426 nm. For displacement curves, data were fitted by a logistic equation (y = y max/(1 + (IC50/x) n) (see also Ref. 27Barlow R. Blake J.F. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 440-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), wherex is the concentration of the tested compound, yis the observed fluorescence signal, y max is the maximal fluorescence signal observed, and n is the Hill coefficient (also referred to as slope factor). For kinetic analysis, data were fitted by single and double exponential decay functions. The quality of the fit was assessed by Ï2 test. It is important to note that a Ï2 test does not allow assessing whether the degree of freedom of the function to be fitted is appropriately chosen. We therefore used an F test (28Schrenzel J. Demaurex N. Foti M. Van Delden C. Jacquet J. Mayr G. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2378-2391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Patel J.K. Kapadia C.H. Owen D.B. Handbook of Statistical Distributions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar) to determine whether a single or a double exponential fit was appropriate for the data. For the statistic in Table I, a relativeF value was calculated by dividing the F value obtained when fitting a curve with a single-exponential decay through the F value obtained when fitting the same curve with a double exponential decay. A relative F value below 0.5 indicates that a double exponential fit is more appropriate than a single exponential fit. If not otherwise indicated, the indicated values are means of three or four different experiments.Table IKinetic properties of heparin interaction with full-length VN and with VN 347â361 peptidePropertiesFull-length VNVN347â361RelativeF test for binding (single/double exponential fit)10 Â± 2.57.5 Â± 2RelativeF test for unbinding (single/double exponential fit)0.2 Â± 0.10.32 Â± 0.1On rate0.4 Â± 0.10.3 Â± 0.1Ï of conversion to stable complex180 Â± 47205 Â± 22Off rate 11.4 Â± 0.22.4 Â± 0.1Off rate 214 Â± 322 Â± 4 Open table in a new tab The fluorescence intensity of CB-heparin (10 nm) was compared with the fluorescence intensity of its parental compound CB-acetylazide (10 nm). The ratio was found to be 1.85 molecules, indicating that the CB-heparin had 1â2 mol of CB bound per mole of heparin. The excitation maximum of CB-heparin was around 380 nm. When elicited with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm, maximal emission was between 420 and 430 nm. The fluorescence intensity of CB-heparin was high in a polar solvent (PBS) and decreased as the hydrophobicity of the solvent increased. These fluorescent properties are similar to those of the parental compound CB-acetylazide (30Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. FrancÌ§ois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.H. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6203-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence intensity as a function of the hydrophobicity of the environment have been observed previously (12Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. FrancÌ§ois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11875-11883Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since the binding of a ligand to a protein leads to a change in the hydrophobicity of the environment (in general, an increase in hydrophobicity), this approach can be used to monitor directly the kinetics of ligand-protein interaction. We will refer to this approach as EDFI. Note that, depending on the fluorescent probe, binding of the ligand to the protein can either lead to a decrease of fluorescence (e.g. CB-coupled ligand in this study) or to an increase in fluorescence (e.g. coumarin-labeled ligand in a previous study) (12Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Due to aromatic amino acids, most proteins display autofluorescence with absorption maximum around 280 nm and an emission maximum around 380 nm. The superimposition of the excitation spectrum of CB-heparin and emission spectrum of VN showed an overlapping, confirming that an interaction between both compounds might yield to FRET. The question of whether heparin binding is restricted to multimeric VN (13Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1998; 72: 903-912Crossref Google Scholar) or also occurs with monomeric VN (12Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Liang O.D. Rosenblatt S. Chhatwal G.S. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) remains controversial. To investigate this question, we compared the heparin binding to both forms of VN. Continuous FRET recordings were performed with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 426 nm. Under these conditions, the addition of multimeric VN (Fig. 1 B) led to a fluorescence increase. The fluorescence increase was due to specific binding, since it could be completely reversed by the addition of an excess of nonfluorescent heparin. When the same amount of nonfluorescent heparin was added to CB-heparin in the absence of VN, no effect on the fluorescence was observed (not shown). As expected from the decreased CB-heparin fluorescence in a hydrophobic environment, EDFI recording of the fluorescence showed a decrease upon the addition of multimeric VN to the probe (Fig. 1 E). The fluorescence decrease was due to specific binding, since it was completely reversed by the addition of an excess of nonfluorescent heparin. When the same experimental protocol was performed with monomeric VN, the signal with FRET was very low to undetectable, while EDFI gave a small signal (â¼10% of the signal seen with multimeric VN), similar to what has been previously observed (12Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The latter observation has been used to challenge the concept that the heparin-binding site is cryptic in monomeric VN and is only exposed in the multimeric form of the protein (12Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We considered an alternative possibility, namely spontaneous formation of a heparin-binding form within the monomeric VN preparation. Indeed, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis clearly showed that in addition to the band of monomeric VN of about M r 72,000, a second band of approximately M r 150,000, presumably corresponding to a VN dimer, was present (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). To investigate whether this dimer could be responsible for the small proportion of heparin binding observed with the monomer preparation, we absorbed the monomer preparation using heparin-Sepharose (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A,lane 3) revealed that this treatment removed theM r 150,000 band. In contrast, the intensity of the M r 72,000 band was not diminished by the heparin-Sepharose absorption. Indeed, densitometric quantification demonstrated that the intensity of the M r 72,000 band was 106 Â± 10% (mean Â± range, n = 2) of control in the heparin-Sepharose-treated preparation. When the remaining monomeric VN was tested in the fluorescent binding assays, strictly no binding was detected (Fig. 1, D andG). Thus, our results demonstrate that specific high affinity binding to VN is restricted to the multimeric form of the protein. These results, however, do not exclude additional low affinity binding sites on the protein (14Liang O.D. Rosenblatt S. Chhatwal G.S. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To study further the properties of heparin binding to multimeric VN, we studied the displacement of CB-heparin (as evidenced by a decrease in FRET) by standard heparin and related compounds. Standard heparin (M r 10,000) displaced CB-heparin with an IC50 of 43 nm (Fig. 2 A). Other heparin-like compounds able to displace CB-heparin were CMDBS (15Jozefonvicz J. Jozefowicz M. J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 1990; 1: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (IC50= 150 nm) and chondroitin sulfate (IC50 = 1.6 Î¼m) (32Hedman K.S. Johansson T. Vartio L. Kjellen A. Vaheri A. HoÌoÌk M. Cell. 1983; 28: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). Dermatan sulfate, de-N-sulfated heparin, or dextran T70 (Fig. 2 A) did not displace CB-heparin. Thus, the rank order of affinity of various heparin-like compounds for the VN-binding site is as follows: heparin > CMDBS > chondroitin sulfate [tmt] dermatan sulfate = de-N-sulfated heparin = dextran T70. It has been previously suggested that the binding sites of VN forS. aureus and for heparin are, at least partially, overlapping (8Liang O.D. Flock J.-I. WadstroÌm T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Binding of VN to S. epidermidis has also been suggested (23Heilmann C. Hussain M. Peters G. GoÌtz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 33Paulsson M. Ljungh A. Wadstrom T. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1992; 30: 2006-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, its relationship to the heparin-binding site is undefined. Using preparations of extracts from the two staphylococcal strains in the FRET assay, S. aureusbut not S. epidermidis proteins displaced CB-heparin from VN (Fig. 2 A). The high affinity heparin-binding site of VN is thought to lie within the C-terminal region of the protein (aa 347â361; VN347â361) (11Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, additional regions of VN might bind heparin as suggested recently (14Liang O.D. Rosenblatt S. Chhatwal G.S. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the identity of the FRET-generating heparin-binding site, we studied the effect of a polyclonal antibody raised against VN347â361. Western blot performed in native conditions revealed that this antibody recognizes dimeric or higher molecular forms of VN but does not recognize monomeric VN, which is the most abundant VN form in the sample (Fig. 3 A). The addition of 4 Î¼g/ml of the antibody decreased the FRET signal by approximately 50%. The subsequent addition of free heparin completely abolished the FRET signal (Fig. 3 B). Repetitive addition of the antibody almost completely abolished the FRET signal, and the final addition of heparin led only to a minor decrease of the fluorescence signal (Fig. 3 C). To further investigate the role of VN347â361 in heparin binding by VN, we directly analyzed heparin binding to the peptide. No significant FRET signal could be obtained with the VN347â361 peptide. This is expected, since there is only one aromatic amino acid contained within this sequence (Phe352), while in the full-length protein there are several flanking aromatic amino acids (Trp320, Trp382, Trp405, and Trp450). This is also illustrated by the absence of detectable autofluorescence of the VN347â361 peptide (not shown). As opposed to FRET, EDFI does not require the presence of aromatic amino acid, and consequently this assay clearly gave a positive signal with the peptide. The addition of the VN347â361 peptide to CB-heparin led to a rapid decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 4 A). The fluorescence decrease was completely reversed by the addition of unlabeled heparin, demonstrating the specificity of the binding. A cont"

ADR1 is itself repressed by glucose, but the significance of this repression for regulating target genes is not known. To test if the reduction in Adr1 levels contributes to glucose repression of ADH2 expression, we generated yeast strains in which the level of Adr1 produced during growth in glucose-containing medium is similar to that present in wild-type cells grown in the absence of glucose. In these Adr1-overproducing strains,ADH2 expression remained tightly repressed, and UAS1, the element in the ADH2 promoter that binds Adr1, was sufficient to maintain glucose repression. Post-translational modification of Adr1 activity is implicated in repression, sinceADH2 derepression occurred in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. The N-terminal 172 amino acids of Adr1, containing the DNA binding and nuclear localization domains, fused to the Herpesvirus VP16-encoded transcription activation domain, conferred regulated expression at UAS1. Nuclear localization of an Adr1-GFP fusion protein was not glucose-regulated, suggesting that the DNA binding domain of Adr1 is sufficient to confer regulated expression on target genes. A Gal4-Adr1 fusion protein was unable to confer glucose repression at GAL4-dependent promoters, suggesting that regulation mediated by ADR1 is specific to UAS1.

TheseADR1-regulated genes are not expressed when yeasts are growing in the presence of glucose, but are turned on when glucose is exhausted.

The best understood of these requires three genes: MIG1, encoding a DNA-binding protein, TUP1, and SSN6. A Tup1-Ssn6 complex is recruited by Mig1 to the promoter of glucose-repressed genes, where it blocks transcription (15Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3132-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 17Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Regulated phosphorylation of Mig1, most likely by Snf1, modulates its nuclear entry and ability to repress transcription (18DeVit M.J. Waddie J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). ADH2 is glucose-repressed by a mechanism that does not involve Mig1, Ssn6, or Tup1 (19Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, glucose repression ofADH2 expression is mediated by modulation of the activity or the amount of the positive transcription factor Adr1 (20Beier D.R. Sledziewski A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation is involved in the activity of Adr1, since repression requires the protein phosphatase Glc7 and its regulatory subunit, Reg1 (59Dowbek K.M. Voronkova V. Raney A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6029-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and derepression requires Snf1 and the regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases (22Cherry J.R. Johnson T.R. Dollard C. Shuster J.R. Denis C.L. Cell. 1989; 56: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Denis C.L. Audino D.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whether Adr1 itself is the subject of regulated phosphorylated has not been demonstrated (19Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Denis C.L. Fontaine S.C. Chase D. Kemp B.E. Bemis L.T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1663-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The other alternative, that regulation mediated by Adr1 is due to changes in its expression, is also a possibility. ADR1expression is repressed 3â20-fold when glucose is present in the medium (25Dombek K.M. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Blumberg H. Hartshorne T.A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since ADH2 derepression requires occupation of both binding sites in UAS1, cooperative binding to UAS1 might be sensitive to small changes in Adr1 concentration. A 5-fold increase in the level of the activator Gal4 accounts for glucose repression ofGAL4-dependent genes (29Griggs D.W. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8597-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Lamphier M.S. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pexton T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3834-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the importance of the increase in ADR1 expression forADH2 derepression, has not been addressed. While overexpression of ADR1 leads to constitutive ADH2expression, further increases in ADH2 expression occur upon derepression, indicating that glucose repression is still active in the presence of high level expression of ADR1 (33Irani M. Taylor W.E. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have investigated the relationship between Adr1 levels andADH2 derepression and identified a glucose-regulated domain in Adr1. Three integrated copies of ADR1 increase the level of Adr1 during glucose repression to a level equivalent to the derepressed level in wild-type cells. In the presence of derepressing levels of Adr1, ADH2 expression remains fully repressed during growth in glucose. Adr1 appears to be rapidly converted to an active form upon derepression because ADH2 expression is activated within minutes after glucose is removed from the medium, and the rate of accumulation of ADH2 mRNA or Î²-galactosidase activity from an ADH2/lacZ gene fusion is very rapid. Moreover, ADH2 derepression in these conditions can occur in the absence of protein synthesis, suggesting that inactive Adr1 is converted post-translationally to an active form and thatde novo synthesis of proteins is not required forADH2 derepression. Utilizing gene fusions, we show that nuclear targeting is not glucose-regulated and that the DNA binding domain of Adr1 is the likely target of glucose repression. The S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I. Strains containing additional copies of ADR1 were derived from HHY10 (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 adh3) by a series of one-step gene disruptions or transformation with integrating plasmids. HHY10 (MATa adh3 trp1 leu2 ura3) was derived from a cross of 521-6 (MATa adh1â1 adh3 trp1 leu2 ura1) and 3482-16-1 (MATÎ± ura3 trp1 leu2). HHY13 (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 adh3 adr1Î1::LEU2) was obtained by transformation (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of HHY10 with a fragment containing ADR1disrupted with LEU2 as described (28Blumberg H. Hartshorne T.A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A Leu+derivative of HHY10, JSY11, was generated by transformation of HHY10 with an EcoRI digest of the LEU2 integrating plasmid pRS305 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

TheADR1-containing fragment was excised from pJS10 usingSalI and NotI and inserted between theSalI and NotI sites in pRS305 to create pJS15. This plasmid was digested with EcoRV and introduced into HHY10. Leu+ colonies were isolated, and protein extracts from several of the transformants were examined by immunoblotting to determine the level of Adr1 under repressed and derepressed growth conditions. Three transformants (JSY12, JSY13, and JSY14) were selected that contained levels of Adr1 in glucose media equivalent to or greater than the level of Adr1 in derepressed JSY11. Southern analysis ofADR1 revealed that these strains contain about 2, 3, and 4 plasmid copies, respectively. 2J. S. Sloan, unpublished data. A TRP1-CEN6 plasmid containing the full-lengthADR1 gene was constructed by excising ADR1 from pJS10 with SalI and NotI and inserting it between the SalI and NotI sites in pRS314 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create pJS20. A truncated ADR1 gene encoding the N-terminal 172 amino acids of Adr1p was constructed by digesting pJS10 withEcoRI and BamHI and a 482-base pairEcoRIâBamHI fragment from the plasmid ADR1(172)lacZ (9Thukral S.K. Tavianini M.A. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The truncated ADR1 gene was excised from this plasmid using KpnI and NotI and inserted between the KpnI and NotI sites of pRS314 to create pJS21. A fusion of the DNA binding domain of Adr1 with the activation domain of the the herpes simplex virus protein VP16 was created by cutting plasmid pJS21 with BamHI and inserting a VP16-encoding BglIIâBamHI fragment from the plasmid pCRF2 (36Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). This plasmid was designated pJS23. A tripartite gene fusion containing the ADR1 promoter, theGAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1â147), andADR1-encoded amino acids 21â1323 was constructed in a series of steps (details will be provided upon request). The gene fusion is present on a CEN-HIS3 plasmid, pJSL93. Yeast strains were grown in YPD or synthetic medium prepared according to standard methods (37Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). For maintaining glucose repression, cultures were started in YP or synthetic medium containing 8% glucose. Cell densities were kept below about 5 Ã 107 during growth in glucose and in minimal media, because we observed ADH2 expression at higher cell densities even in the presence of glucose. For growing yeast under derepressing conditions, cultures were grown in YP or synthetic medium containing 3% ethanol and 0.1% glucose. Alternatively, yeast cultures were derepressed in 0.05% glucose. A 0.9-kb fragment encoding the F64L,S65T-enhanced version of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (38Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar) with an AatII site introduced immediately 5â² to sequences coding for an amino-terminal alanine-glycine flexible linker was created by polymerase chain reaction using plasmid pLI2000, which was generously supplied by E. Muller, as template with primersXhoI-GFP-3â² (5â²-CACTATCTCGAGAATTGGAGCTTCGGTACCAG-3â²) andAatII-GFP-5â²-N (5â²-TCTAGAGACGTCGCAGGCGCTGGAGCCGGTG-3â²). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested withAatII and XhoI, gel-purified, and then ligated to the 10.5-kb AatIIâXhoI vector fragment of pKD64 to create pKD110. This plasmid was digested with AatII, treated with T4 polymerase to blunt the ends, and then digested withXhoI. A 0.9-kb blunt XhoI fragment from the digestion was gel-purified and ligated to a 2.8-kbBglIIâBsaBI fragment of pKD84 (25Dombek K.M. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which contains a portion of the ADR1 open reading frame, and an 8.8-kb BglIIâSalI fragment of pKD84, which contains the 5â²-end of the ADR1 gene and pRS314 vector sequences. The resulting CEN plasmid, pKD113, has theADR1 promoter and open-reading frame fused in frame at codon 1245 to sequences coding for the flexible linker amino-terminal to GFP coding sequences. Cells were stained in culture with 2,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) as described by Shero et al. (39Shero J.H. Koval M. Spencer F. Palmer R.E. Hieter P. Koshland D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 749-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 5-Î¼l aliquot of each DAPI-stained culture was mounted on a coverslip under a 0.1-mm-thick slab of 0.8% agarose containing fresh growth medium and suspended over a concave well on a multiwell slide. Cells were viewed as described by Moseret al. (40Moser M.J. Flory M.R. Davis T.N. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope fitted with the appropriate filters for discriminating between DAPI and GFP fluorescence. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and prepared for publication using Microsoft PowerPoint software. Denatured whole-cell extracts and nitrocellulose protein blots were prepared as described previously (19Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dombek K.M. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against amino acids 335â740 of Adr1 (Î±-Adr1) (19Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Î±-GFP), which were kindly provided by T. Davis. Î²-Galactosidase assays were performed on protein extracts or on permeabilized cells as described by Guarente (41Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). ADH activity assays were performed as described previously (19Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total yeast RNA was prepared by disrupting yeast cells with glass beads in the presence of guanidine isothiocyanate followed by phenol extraction (37Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). RNA samples (16 Î¼g) were incubated in a solution of 50% formamide, 2.2m formaldehyde, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mm EDTA at 65Â° for 10 min and then separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.4. The RNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) and treated according to the Zeta-Probe instruction manual.ADH2 mRNA was specifically detected using the32P-labeled oligonucleotide ZC-398 (5â²-TGGTAGCCTTAACGACTGCGCTA-3â²), which does not hybridize withADH1 mRNA in the conditions used (26Taylor W.E. Young E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4098-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ACT1mRNA was detected using a 560-base pair ClaI fragment of the ACT1 gene as a probe. We first examined the time course of appearance of Adr1 and ADH2mRNA in a strain (JSY11) that contains only the endogenous copy ofADR1. If Adr1 had to accumulate to a critical level to activate ADH2 expression after the removal of glucose, we would expect the increase in Adr1 to significantly precede accumulation of ADH2 mRNA. The level of Adr1 is very low but detectable in repressed cultures, so we can compare the kinetics of appearance of Adr1 with that of ADH2 mRNA (Fig. 1). Adr1 and ADH2 mRNA appear concomitantly between 2 and 3 h after inoculation into derepressing medium, and ADH2 mRNA accumulation increases at a faster rate than that of Adr1, suggesting that a threshold level of Adr1 is not necessary to trigger ADH2transcription. This observation agrees with previous results showing that a low level of ADR1 expression is capable of activatingADH2 under derepressing conditions (25Dombek K.M. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To study the relationship between Adr1 levels andADH2 transcription more directly, isogenic strains expressing different levels of Adr1 were created by integrating multiple copies of ADR1 at the LEU2 locus (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Fig. 2and other data2 show that Adr1 levels in repressed conditions increased with ADR1 copy number and were about 30-fold higher in the multicopy strain JSY14 than in wild-type strain JSY11. The Adr1 levels were also higher than normal in the multicopy strains under derepressing conditions, although by a smaller factor than under repressed conditions. The high ADR1 expression in the transformants under glucose growth conditions suggests that the integrated copies of ADR1 were not subject to glucose repression. This result could be due to effects on the ADR1promoter from the adjacent vector sequences or to position effects at the site of integration. Fig. 3 A shows that ADHII enzyme activity was not detectable in extracts from the threeADR1 multicopy strains grown under repressed conditions, suggesting that ADH2 expression was still repressed despite the high level of Adr1. ADHI levels were comparable in extracts from all five strains after growth on glucose. Under derepressing conditions, the multicopy strains contained greater ADHII activity than the wild-type strain, indicating that the excess Adr1 was active in the multicopy strains. The effect of high Adr1 levels on ADH2 expression was examined directly by Northern blot analysis of ADH2 mRNA (Fig. 3 B). Under glucose growth conditions, ADH2mRNA was virtually undetectable in all of the strains. Under derepressing conditions, ADH2 mRNA accumulated to levels in the Adr1-overproducing strains JSY12, JSY13, and JSY14 that were 2.7-, 5.5-, and 6-fold higher, respectively, than in the wild-type strain.2 A more sensitive and quantitative assay of ADH2 expression was provided by an ADH2/lacZ gene fusion. When the reporter was present on an episomal plasmid, Î²-galactosidase activity was low in all of the strains in repressed conditions (Table II). In particular, Î²-galactosidase activity in the strain with the highest level of Adr1 (JSY14) was only 10% of the derepressed level in the wild-type strain (JSY11). Derepression was about equally effective in the four strains containingADR1, and was about 15â26-fold higher than in theadr1-null strain.Table IIEffect of Adr1 overproduction on expression of an ADH2/lacZ reporter under repressing and derepressing conditionsStrainCopies ofADR1Î²-Galactosidase activityRepressedDerepressedMiller unitsHHY1300.8100JSY1111.81470JSY12292240JSY133762300JSY1441182640 Open table in a new tab Thus, by three independent assays, the level of Adr1 that is present in derepressed cells is not sufficient to activate ADH2expression during growth on glucose. To determine whether the increased Adr1 in glucose-grown cells influences ADH2 derepression, we followed the expression of ADH2 in two strains overproducing Adr1. In these strains, Adr1 levels are already high under glucose conditions, and they remain fairly constant during the first 8 h following the shift to nonfermentable medium.2 In both strains, ADH2 mRNA appeared within the first 30 min (Fig. 4), significantly before its appearance in the wild-type strain, and accumulated rapidly thereafter. A more sensitive assay for ADH2 expression was used to confirm its rapid release from glucose repression in strains with extra copies of ADR1. Isogenic strains containing an integratedADH2/lacZ plasmid were grown in repressing conditions and then transferred to media lacking glucose (Fig. 5). Î²-Galactosidase activity increased about 5000-fold in the strains overproducing Adr1, yet the levels in repressed conditions were nearly identical to those in the wild-type strain, confirming that stringent glucose repression occurred in the presence of derepressed levels of Adr1. ADH2/lacZderepression in the multicopy ADR1 strains was detected at the earliest time point, significantly before derepression occurred in the wild-type strain. In the absence of ADR1,ADH2/lacZ derepression occurred after a lag period and proceeded slowly, reaching a level 100-fold lower than in the presence of ADR1 (note that Fig. 5 shows the activity on a log scale). The ADR1-independent activity is due to UAS2, a second regulated UAS element in the ADH2 promoter (42Yu J. Donoviel M.S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One possibility for maintenance of ADH2repression in the presence of high levels of Adr1 invokes othercis-acting repressing elements in the ADH2promoter. Although no strong repressing element has been found in theADH2 promoter (20Beier D.R. Sledziewski A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we tested this possibility by employing a gene fusion, pHDY10, with UAS1 as the sole upstream activating sequence (42Yu J. Donoviel M.S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) driving expression of a CYC1/lacZ gene fusion (41Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The CYC1 promoter is not subject to glucose repression when a constitutive activating element is inserted upstream of the TATA box (43Karnitz L. Morrison M. Young E.T. Genetics. 1992; 132: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but is repressed in the presence of glucose and derepressed in an ADR1-dependent manner when UAS1 is present (42Yu J. Donoviel M.S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Table III, pHDY10 is inactive in glucose-containing medium and is derepressed in anADR1 copy number-dependent manner. Thus, it is unlikely that sequences other than UAS1 in the ADH2 promoter are responsible for its repression in the presence of high levels of Adr1.Table IIIEffect of Adr1 overproduction on expression of a CYC1/lacZ reporter containing UAS1 aloneStrainCopies of ADR1Î²-Galactosidase activityRepressedDerepressedHHY1300.20.3JSY1110.210JSY1220.4180JSY1440.8660 Open table in a new tab The rapid appearance of ADH2 mRNA and ADHII/Î²-galactosidase activities in strains with high levels of Adr1 suggests that the activator was rapidly converted to an active form. To determine whether this change in its activity requires de novo protein synthesis, derepression was carried out in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis.ADH2 derepression could be detected at 1 h in cycloheximide-treated cells when high levels of Adr1 were present (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and12), but not in wild-type cells or in cells lacking Adr1 (lanes 3 and 6). Thus, de novo protein synthesis is not required for derepression ofADH2 expression. Cycloheximide appeared to allow superderepression of ADH2 expression in the high copy strains (compare lanes 8 and 11 withlanes 9 and 12). Surprisingly, cycloheximide treatment of cells maintained in glucose led to ADR1-independent derepression ofADH2 (Fig. 6 B). The results described above suggest that Adr1 is regulated post-translationally. The domain responsible for this regulation appears to lie in the amino terminus of Adr1, since mini-Adr1, consisting of the first 172 amino acids of Adr1 and transcription activation domain III (amino acids 420â462 of Adr1) is active and confers glucose-regulated expression on ADH2 and other UAS1-containing genes (12Young E.T.

However, transcription activation domain III is not glucose-regulated when fused to GAL4, suggesting that it is not the target of post-translational regulation (11Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C.

To isolate and characterize intermediates that are involved in folding or unfolding of proteins containing disulfide bonds, it is necessary to stop thiol/disulfide exchange reactions that convert one intermediate to another. One traditional approach involves trapping of thiol groups irreversibly by alkylation with iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, or vinylpyridine under alkaline conditions. However, rearrangement of intermediates during the trapping procedure with iodoacetate has been observed for both bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (8Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and ribonuclease A (19Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem.

Another traditional method quenches thiol/disulfide exchange by lowering the pH to â¤2 by acidification. An advantage of acid quenching is its reversibility; intermediates trapped at low pH can be isolated and allowed to undergo further rearrangement or refolding after readjusting the pH in experiments designed to more completely characterize particular pathways (8Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 10Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). While quenching by acidification occurs at a diffusion-controlled rate, it does not completely stop thiol/disulfide exchange (21Pain R.H. Mechanisms of Protein Folding. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 112Google Scholar); further chemical modification is also necessary for the structural characterization of an acid-trapped intermediate. We recently developed a methodology to trap folding intermediates based on the cyanylation of thiol groups by 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium (CDAP)1 tetrafluoroborate under acidic conditions (22Wu J. Yang Y. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This approach has several unique advantages. First, cyanylation of thiol groups in acidic solution quenches the refolding process and minimizes thiol/disulfide exchange. Second, cyanylation of thiol is already part of our procedure for structural elucidation of the intermediates, which involves partial reduction, cyanylation, chemical cleavage, and mass mapping (22Wu J. Yang Y. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Third, this methodology is fast, simple, and even applicable to disulfide structural analysis of proteins containing adjacent cysteines (24Yang Y. Wu J. Watson J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 123: 5834-5835Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (25Rinderknecht E. Humbel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2769-2776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a single-chain polypeptide of 70 residues containing three intramolecular disulfide bonds, two of which involve adjacent cysteines (Fig. 1). IGF-I is postulated to be the mediator of growth hormone action on skeletal tissue as well as of mitogenic activity on several cell types (26Froesch E.R. Burgi H. Ramseier E.B. Bally P. Labhart A. J. Clin. Invest. 1963; 42: 1816-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Rinderknecht E. Humbel R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2365-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The refolding of IGF-I has been studied by several groups (28Hober S. Forsberg G. Palm G. Hartmanis M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W. Arakawa T. Rosenfeld R. Hawkins N Miller J.A. Weiss M. J. Mol.

(28Hober S. Forsberg G. Palm G. Hartmanis M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) proposed a folding pathway for IGF-I, based on the structural analysis of refolding intermediates trapped by pyridylethylation at pH 8.7. Four intermediates were identified, including a native-like one-disulfide intermediate, two two-disulfide intermediates, and a mismatched three-disulfide intermediate. A different refolding pattern was obtained by acidic quenching (29Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W. Arakawa T. Rosenfeld R. Hawkins N Miller J.A. Weiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Miller J.A. Narhi L.O. Hua Q.X Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Rohde S.P. Lauren S. Stoney K.S. Tsai L. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5203-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); in addition to the four intermediates detected by pyridylethylation, a nonnative two-disulfide species and a mixed two-disulfide intermediate with GSH were also detected. Furthermore, a different equilibrium distribution of intermediates was obtained by each of the two trapping procedures. It has been documented that the oxidative refolding of IGF-I follows a pathway governed by thermodynamic rather than kinetic principles, resulting in two folding isomers of similar thermodynamic stability but different disulfide conformations (native and mismatched isomers) (28Hober S. Forsberg G. Palm G. Hartmanis M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W. Arakawa T. Rosenfeld R. Hawkins N Miller J.A.

(33Milner S.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. Magee B.A. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) proposed that a salt bridge between Glu3 and Arg56 in IGF-I might stabilize the mismatched isomer, accounting for the observation of more than one folding outcome of IGF-I. Recombinant human long R3 insulin-like growth factor-I (LR3IGF-I) is a variant of human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in which glutamate 3 is replaced by arginine, and a 13-residue extension appears at the N terminus (Fig. 1). LR3IGF-I is substantially more potent than IGF-I in affecting carbohydrate metabolism and in stimulating the growth of fetal tissue in animals (34Tomas F.M. Knowles S.E. Chandler C.S. Francis G.L. Owens P.C. Ballard F.J. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 137: 413-421Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The refolding behavior of LR3IGF-I has been described as being significantly different from that of IGF-I (33Milner S.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. Magee B.A. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, in that preliminary report, neither the disulfide structure of the intermediates nor the folding pathway of LR3IGF-I was determined. We report here on important aspects of the folding pathway of both LR3IGF-I and IGF-I by structural elucidation of disulfide intermediates involved in the folding and unfolding processes. Our results were obtained using cyanylation chemistry for trapping intermediates and specific cleavage/mass mapping for subsequent structural elucidation of the intermediates (22Wu J. Yang Y. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Yang Y. Wu J. Watson J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 123: 5834-5835Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similarities and differences in the folding patterns of LR3IGF-I and IGF-I are highlighted and rationalized on the basis of their structures. Recombinant human long R3 insulin-like growth factor-I (LR3IGF-I) was purchased from Sigma. IGF-I was obtained from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA). The proteins were purified prior to use by reversed phase HPLC as described below. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was purchased from Pierce. Guanidine hydrochloride was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. GSSG, GSH, citric acid, sodium citrate, hydrochloric acid, and CDAP were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid were of HPLC grade. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine solution in 0.1 m citrate buffer at pH 3.0 was prepared as 0.10 m stock solution and stored under N2 at -20 Â°C for weeks with little deterioration. The 0.10 m CDAP solution in 0.1m citrate buffer at pH 3.0 was prepared prior to use. An overall scheme representing the refolding (and reductive unfolding) protocol is shown in Fig. 2. LR3IGF-I or IGF-I (0.1 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of citrate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 6 m guanidine-HCl and 0.1 mTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine reducing agent. Reduction of the proteins was carried out at 37 Â°C for 2 h; the reduced/denatured LR3IGF-I or IGF-I was purified by HPLC, dried under reduced pressure, and stored at â70 Â°C. The refolding of reduced and denatured protein was initiated by diluting the reduced/unfolded protein sample with 0.10 mTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7), containing 1 mm GSSG, 10 mm GSH, 0.2 m KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, to a final protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The refolding intermediates were trapped at different times by the method described below. Native LR3IGF-I or IGF-I (0.1 mg/ml) was reduced/unfolded in 0.10m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.7, containing 0.25 mmcysteine, 0.20 m KCl, and 1.0 mm EDTA. After incubation for the indicated periods, an aliquot of reductive/unfolding solution (0.1 ml) was removed, and the intermediates were trapped, separated, and analyzed by the method described below. After the reductive unfolding reached the equilibrium, cysteine was added to a final concentration of 100 mm to drive the reductive unfolding reaction to completion. Refolding of the reduced, unfolded LR3IGF-I was quenched at 30 min by adding 1.0 mHCl to pH â¼2. After HPLC separation, the fractions containing a two-disulfide intermediate and a mismatched (three-disulfide) protein isomer were dried; reconstituted in 0.10 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7) containing 1 mm GSSG, 10 mm GSH, 0.2m KCl, and 1.0 mm EDTA to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml; and incubated for up to 30 min at room temperature. At designated time points, aliquots were removed, and refolding intermediates were trapped by the method described below. Refolding or reductive unfolding intermediates were trapped in a time course manner by removing aliquots (0.1 ml) of protein solution and mixing with 1.0 m HCl containing freshly prepared 0.2 m CDAP to give a solution of pH 2â3. Cyanylation of free thiol groups by the CDAP proceeded at room temperature for 10 min. The trapped intermediates were immediately separated by HPLC under the conditions described below. The HPLC fractions were collected manually and analyzed by MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Those with 0-, 52-, 104-, or 156-Da increases over the mass of the intact protein correspond to three-disulfide (native or nonnative), two-disulfide, one-disulfide, and the completely reduced species, respectively. A mass shift of +306 Da is characteristic of the formation of a mixed disulfide bond between a thiol group and glutathione; a mass shift of +612 Da indicates the presence of two mixed disulfide bonds with two glutathiones. The disulfide structure of purified refolding or reductive unfolding intermediates was determined by the partial reduction/cyanylation/chemical cleavage/mass mapping approach, as described previously (22Wu J. Yang Y. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The separation of folding/unfolding intermediates was carried out by reversed phase HPLC with a linear gradient elution using Waters model 6000 pumps controlled by a PC. The UV detection was at 215 nm. The column was a Vydac C18 (catalog no. 218TP54; 10-Î¼m particle size, 300-â« pore, 4.6 Ã 250 mm). Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Solvent B was acetonitrile/water (9:1, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The linear gradient was 30â50% solvent B in 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC fractions were collected manually, and the contents were then dried under reduced pressure for further use. MALDI mass spectra were obtained on a Voyager Elite time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with delayed extraction and a model VSL-337ND nitrogen laser (Laser Science, Newton, MA). The accelerating voltage in the ion source was set to 20 kV. Grid and guide wire voltages were 93.6 and 0.2% of the accelerating voltage, respectively. Data were acquired in the positive linear DE mode of operation. Time-to-mass conversion was achieved by external and/or internal calibration using standards of bradykinin (m/z1061.2), bovine pancreatic insulin (m/z 5734.5), and horse skeletal myoglobin (m/z 16952) obtained from Sigma. All experiments were performed using Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) as the matrix. Saturated matrix solutions were prepared in a 50% (v/v) solution of acetonitrile/aqueous 1% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed in equal volumes with peptide or protein samples, and applied to a stainless steel sample plate. The mixture was allowed to air-dry before being introduced into the mass spectrometer. The distribution of intermediates during the refolding process is represented by HPLC chromatograms of cyanylated species trapped at designated times. Fig. 3, a and b, shows an array of chromatograms of LR3IGF-I and IGF-I intermediates trapped by reaction with CDAP under acidic conditions at various times after initiating refolding in the GSSG/GSH buffer. In addition to native LR3IGF-I (N) and completely reduced LR3IGF-I (R), three well populated species were observed at different time points during the refolding of LR3IGF-I (Fig. 3 a). The oxidative state of the trapped intermediates was determined by MALDI mass spectrometry based on the mass shift between intermediate and the intact protein. Thus, peaks Iâ² and IIâ² in Fig. 3 a correspond to intermediates containing one and two disulfide bonds, respectively, as evidenced by 104- and 52-Da shifts from the mass of the intact protein. Peak IIIâ² represents a mixture of a mismatched three-disulfide intermediate (the same mass as intact protein) and a mixed two-disulfide intermediate in which two SH groups each formed a mixed disulfide bond with a glutathione (as indicated by a shift of +612 Da from the mass of the intact protein). Reduced/unfolded LR3IGF-I was first converted to a one-disulfide intermediate (peak Iâ²) and then a two-disulfide intermediate (peak IIâ²) within 1 min in the presence of 10 mm GSH, 1 mm GSSG. The three-disulfide intermediate and mixed two-disulfide intermediate coeluted as peak IIIâ² by 2 min. Considerable native protein (N) was formed by 30 min, a time by which an equilibrium had been reached, and the ratio of the mismatched and native protein remained constant thereafter. Fig. 3 b shows the HPLC trace of refolding intermediates of IGF-I trapped at 10 s, 1 min, 2.5 min, and 30 min, respectively. During the course of refolding, a total of six well populated intermediates were trapped and identified. Mass analysis by MALDI showed that peak III represents a mismatched protein isomer containing three disulfide bonds; peaks IIA, IIB, and IIC are two-disulfide intermediates; peak IImixrepresents a mixed two-disulfide species with two glutathiones; and peak I is a one-disulfide species. The intermediate distribution at equilibrium (see bottom panel) is very similar to that previously reported from a study using acidic quenching (29Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W. Arakawa T. Rosenfeld R. Hawkins N Miller J.A. Weiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,30Miller J.A. Narhi L.O. Hua Q.X Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Rohde S.P. Lauren S. Stoney K.S. Tsai L. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5203-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In order to prevent the formation of mixed disulfide intermediates as would occur with GSH/GSSG in the refolding process, the reductive unfolding of both proteins was performed in cysteine solution. The time-dependent distribution of the CDAP-trapped intermediates during reductive unfolding of LR3IGF-I is shown in Fig. 4 a. The pattern of intermediates was the same (but inverted) as that observed during the refolding of LR3IGF-I. The mismatched three-disulfide isomer was observed as the earliest intermediate, accounting for â¼10% of the total protein at 3 h. Prolonged incubation of up to 71 h did not alter the ratio of the native and mismatched protein isoforms, suggesting that the native and mismatched species had reached a state of equilibrium. However, the two-disulfide intermediate IIâ² did accumulate during the incubation. After 71 h of incubation, thermodynamic equilibrium among the three species had been reached. When the concentration of cysteine was increased to 100 mmand the mixture was incubated for another 30 min after reaching the 71-h equilibrium point under the initial conditions, the completely reduced/unfolded protein (R) became the predominant species, accompanied by only minor amounts of two- and one-disulfide intermediates. The reductive unfolding of IGF-I under the same conditions (Fig. 4 b) showed a similar pattern to that of LR3IGF-I, but the ratio of the mismatched isomer at equilibrium was significantly higher (35%) than that (10%) observed during the unfolding of LR3IGF-I. Unlike the refolding of IGF-I in which many more intermediates were observed at thermodynamic equilibrium, during reductive unfolding of IGF-I the mismatched three-disulfide species appeared as the only early intermediate to reach an equilibrium with the native protein within 2 h. Further incubation up to 20 h did not significantly change the pattern of unfolding intermediates. Apparently, the trace of cysteine (0.25 mm) in the solution was insufficient to effect further reduction of the disulfide bonds. Increasing the cysteine concentration to 100 mm and incubating for another 1 min shifted the equilibrium distribution of intermediates of IGF-I to the pattern shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4 b; both the one-disulfide intermediate (I) and the two-disulfide intermediate (IIA) (but not IIB and IIC) were formed within 1 min. After 30 min, IIA and I were almost completely converted to reduced/unfolded IGF-I (R) (data not shown). The refolding intermediates of LR3IGF-I (corresponding to peaks IIâ² and IIIâ² in Fig. 3 a, respectively) were trapped during a separate experiment by acid quenching and purified by HPLC. Secondary refolding experiments were initiated with each of these purified acid-trapped intermediates by reconstituting them in 10 mm GSH, 1 mm GSSG buffer, pH 8.7, for up to 30 min at room temperature. Fig. 5, a and b, shows HPLC chromatograms showing the distribution of intermediates after initiating refolding experiments with IIâ² and IIIâ², respectively. Comparison of Figs. 5 a, 5 b, and 3 areveals a surprising similarity in the course of refolding whether it was started with the two-disulfide intermediate (IIâ²), the mismatched isomer (IIIâ²), or the reduced/unfolded protein. In each case, the same equilibrium distribution of IIâ², IIIâ², and native protein was obtained. The one-disulfide intermediate containing the stable Cys18âCys61 structure (Iâ²) was not observed in the refolding experiments starting with purified IIâ² or IIIâ². The refolding experiments initiated from the native two-disulfide intermediate (IIâ²) did not increase the yield of native LR3IGF-I. Analysis by HPLC (Fig. 5 a) showed formation of approximately 90% native LR3IGF-I at 30 min. On the other hand, refolding from the two-disulfide intermediate (IIA) of IGF-I yielded all of the intermediates (I, IIA, IIB, IIC, III, and N) (31Rosenfeld R.D. Miller J.A. Narhi L.O. Hawkins N.

Furthermore, the HPLC trace of the refolding intermediates from IIIâ² (Fig. 5 b) showed a partially resolved peak from IIIâ². Analysis of the corresponding material indicated a molecular weight increase of â¼612 Da, which identified it as a glutathione adduct containing two glutathiones per LR3IGF-I. The methodology developed in our laboratory (22Wu J. Yang Y. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Watson J.T.

The trapping method should stop thiol/disulfide exchange, which may occur on the microsecond time scale in refolding buffer. The cyanylation of thiol groups by CDAP in acidic solution effectively quenches the refolding process by blocking reactive thiol groups. The folding intermediates of IGF-I trapped by CDAP and their distribution pattern are similar to those obtained by acid trapping under the same refolding conditions (29Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W.

By mass mapping the cleavage products resulting from cyanylated intermediates, the disulfide structures of six well populated intermediates were identified, including a native one-disulfide intermediate (I, Cys18âCys61), a native two-disulfide intermediate (IIA, Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys48); two nonnative two-disulfide intermediates (IIB, Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys47; IIC, Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys52); a mismatched intact protein (III, Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys47/Cys48âCys52); and a mixed two-disulfide intermediate with glutathione (IImix) (nonnative disulfide residues underlined). The intermediates IIB and IImix were not observed by vinylpyridine trapping (28Hober S. Forsberg G. Palm G. Hartmanis M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intermediate I was the major form captured by pyridylethylation (28Hober S. Forsberg G. Palm G. Hartmanis M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), while it was the minor form in the distribution of the folding intermediates trapped by the CDAP approach described herein and also by acid trapping as reported elsewhere (29Hua Q.X.

Arakawa T. Rohde S.P. Lauren S. Stoney K.S. Tsai L. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5203-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In order to compare the flow of intermediates in the folding pathway of LR3IGF-I and IGF-I, the refolding of both LR3IGF-I and IGF-I was performed under identical conditions in a GSSG/GSH buffer. Comparison of the HPLC pattern of folding intermediates for LR3IGF-I and IGF-I exhibited some similarities and discrepancies. All the trapped intermediates contain a native Cys18âCys61 structure, which is the first disulfide bond formed in the refolding process (Fig. 3,a and b) and the last disulfide bond reduced in the unfolding process (Fig. 4, a and b). The most abundant two-disulfide intermediates (IIA in IGF-I and IIâ² in LR3IGF-I) and mismatched three-disulfide intermediates (III in IGF-I and IIIâ² in LR3IGF-I) also have a homologous disulfide structure (Table I). Refolding kinetics indicate that formation of the native Cys18âCys61 disulfide bond is very fast in both proteins, as is the subsequent formation of the native Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys48intermediate. However, the formation of the last disulfide bond, Cys47âCys52, is slower, supporting the conclusion that its formation is energetically unfavorable (29Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W. Arakawa T. Rosenfeld R. Hawkins N Miller J.A. Weiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Rosenfeld R.D. Miller J.A. Narhi L.O. Hawkins N. Katta V. Lauren S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The folding result of LR3IGF-I is different from that for IGF-I in that the native three-disulfide isomer (N) is the predominant species at equilibrium, and much less mismatched disulfide bond formation is observed. Oxidation of the native intermediate, Cys18âCys61, results only in the formation of the native Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys48intermediate in the refolding of LR3IGF-I, while as many as four two-disulfide intermediates are observed in the refolding of IGF-I, each containing a Cys18âCys61 bond (Table I). Furthermore, the formation of early intermediates in IGF-I is much faster; at 2.5 min, â¼90% of the reduced IGF-I is oxidized, whereas only â¼50% of the reduced LR3IGF-I is oxidized in the same time period. Nevertheless, an equilibrium distribution of intermediates can be reached for both proteins within 30 min. Rosenfeld et al. (31Rosenfeld R.D. Miller J.A. Narhi L.O. Hawkins N. Katta V. Lauren S. Weiss M.A. Arakawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) observed that the oxidative refolding from the native two-disulfide intermediate of IGF-I (IIA in Fig. 3 b, with Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys48linkage) formed an equilibrium mixture of all of the disulfide intermediates observed from the refolding of reduced/unfolded IGF-I. The refolding experiment starting with the homologous intermediate of LR3IGF-I (IIâ² in Fig. 3 a) resulted in an equilibrium mixture of starting intermediate, native protein, and mismatched protein isomer (coeluting with the glutathione adduct). The one-disulfide intermediate, Iâ², was not observed. The absence of Iâ² in the refolding from IIâ² could be attributable to the greater stability of the Cys6âCys48 pair in LR3IGF-I, as compared with the homologous pair in IGF-I. Nevertheless, comparison of a and b in Fig. 5reveals that the refolding courses from the isolated two-disulfide intermediate and the mismatched isomer, respectively, resulted in an identical distribution of intermediates, suggesting that the refolding of LR3IGF-I is also thermodynamically controlled and all of the trapped intermediates are thus interconvertible. Three distinct features are recognized after comparing the unfolding processes of LR3IGF-I and IGF-I. First, the conversion of native IGF-I to the three-disulfide intermediate III (Fig. 4 b) is faster than the conversion of native LR3IGF-I to the three-disulfide intermediate IIIâ² (Fig. 4 a). Second, no appreciable two-disulfide intermediate (neither IIA, IIB, nor IIC) was detected during the unfolding process of IGF-I in the presence of 0.25 mm cysteine (Fig. 4 b), while the two-disulfide intermediate IIâ² of LR3IGF-I was observed after incubation for up to 24 h under identical conditions (Fig. 4 a). This observation may indicate that the disulfide bond Cys47âCys52 in IGF-I is more stable than its counterpart in LR3IGF-I. Third, the conversion of IIA â I during the âforcedâ unfolding experiment of IGF-I (bottom chromatogram of Fig. 4 b) was faster than the conversion of IIâ² â Iâ² in LR3IGF-I (bottom chromatogram of Fig. 4 a), implying that the disulfide bond Cys6âCys48 in IGF-I is less stable after reduction of the disulfide bond Cys47âCys52. The observed differences in the folding of IGF-I and LR3IGF-I can be rationalized to the variation in the thermodynamic stability of the folding intermediates. The LR3IGF-I variant contains two unrelated structural changes: a substitution of Glu by Arg at position 3 and an N-terminal extension of 13 hydrophobic amino acids. Milner et al. (33Milner S.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. Magee B.A. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) proposed that a salt bridge between Glu3 and Arg56 in IGF-I accounted for the high proportion of mismatched protein isomer during the folding of IGF-I. After the charge substitution by Arg at position 3 in LR3IGF-I, the salt bridge between residues 3 and 56 was replaced by charge repulsion. Thus, the mismatched folding intermediates may be destabilized, leading to predominant formation of the native protein isomer. The N-terminal extension apparently causes steric hindrance, decreases the flexibility of the molecule, and thus limits the number of conformations leading to disulfide bond formation. As a result, the refolding kinetics is much slower for LR3IGF-I, and native folding isomers with minimum conformational energies are preferentially formed. Both structural changes may account for the difference in the folding pathway, and it is not possible to assign which change is dominant in determining the folding process. Based on the disulfide structure and kinetic analysis of folding intermediates, proposed folding pathways for both IGF-I and LR3IGF-I are shown in Fig. 6. Overall, the folding of the two proteins is a thermodynamically controlled process. The two proteins share a similar mechanism, leading to the formation of native and mismatched protein isomers; however, the most productive routes may be slightly different. According to our results, the folding of IGF-I is more flexible in the formation of nonnative two-disulfide intermediates and the mismatched protein isomer via rearrangement of disulfide bonds or thiol/disulfide exchange. The nonnative two-disulfide intermediates (IIB and IIC) can be formed by either direct oxidation of the native one-disulfide intermediate (I) or disulfide rearrangement of IIA. While IIB can lead directly to the mismatched protein isomer (III), both IIB and IIC can revert to productive intermediates (I or IIA). Although only native one- and two-disulfide intermediates were trapped for LR3IGF-I, the presence of the mismatched isomer at equilibrium implicates the involvement of nonnative disulfide intermediates, because neither IIâ² nor native protein can spontaneously convert to the mismatched isomer without breaking/reforming disulfide bonds. Although these intermediates were so short lived as not to be detected, they represent productive intermediates for the formation of mismatched species (35Chang J.Y. Schindler P. Ramseier U. Lai P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9207-9216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We speculate that these intermediates may have a more native-like structure but are thermodynamically less stable (than the native two-disulfide intermediate IIâ²). Therefore, they can rapidly convert to the mismatched isomer. The glutathione intermediates detected during the refolding experiment from IIâ² strongly support the participation of glutathione in the disulfide rearrangement, largely accounting for the formation of Cys18âCys61/Cys6âCys47and/or Cys18âCys61/Cys48âCys52. The involvement of glutathione in the rearrangement of the two-disulfide species was further supported by the energetics of late folding intermediates. The refolding of an IGF-I mutant protein showed that the formation of Cys47âCys52 is energetically unfavorable (32Hober S. Uhlen M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conversion of the native two-disulfide intermediate (IIâ² in LR3IGF-I and IIA in IGF-I) to other intermediates, such as glutathione adducts, was as favorable as the conversion to native protein. Another route leading to the formation of precursor intermediates of the mismatched isomer is the direct oxidation of the Cys18âCys61 intermediate, which is obviously a route of choice for the refolding of IGF-I, as observed in Fig. 3 b. However, the absence of Iâ² during the refolding from IIâ² and IIIâ² at least suggests that the direct oxidation of Iâ² is not essential for the formation of the nonnative two-disulfide intermediates, although we cannot exclude the possibility. It seems that a disulfide rearrangement between the two-disulfide intermediates is a more favorable route for the formation of the precursor intermediates of the mismatched three-disulfide species. The availability of chemical and mass spectrometric evidence for the disulfide structure of trapped intermediates provides a great advantage in studies of the folding process. Furthermore, investigations of both the folding and unfolding processes by the same methodology for a given protein and its mutant provide the basis for integrating time-dependent âsnapshotâ observations for insight into the dynamic phenomenon. Despite the great experimental challenges associated with providing concrete solutions to problems in protein folding, the data presented here should help provide an integrated view of the folding patterns for the family of insulin-like proteins."

Human rabaptin-5 is cleaved at two sites (HSLD379 and DESD438) in apoptotic HeLa extracts. Cleavage is effected by caspase-3, since it is prevented when caspase-3 activity is either inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO or removed by immunodepletion. Moreover, an identical pattern of cleavage is observed using recombinant caspase-3. The action of caspase-3 is highly selective; neither caspase-2 nor caspase-7 are able to cleave recombinant or cytosolic rabaptin-5. Caspase-dependent cleavage of rabaptin-5 generates two physically separated coiled coil-forming domains, the C-terminal of which retains the ability to bind the Rab5 exchange factor rabex-5.

Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Barres B.A. Burne J.F. Coles H.S.R. Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1994; 345: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primary feature of apoptosis is rapid engulfment and degradation of dying cells by their neighbors, so that an inflammatory response can be avoided. Since in many cases the engulfing cells are not specialized for phagocytic uptake (3Savill J. Nature. 1998; 392: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), signals that expedite engulfment and degradation are likely to arise from the apoptotic cell. A critical event during apoptosis is therefore the expression of surface receptors that permit the specific recognition of a dying cell. One such receptor is probably phosphatidylserine, which is translocated from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis (4Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence, however, that other surface moieties, including carbohydrate, form part of the recognition signal (5Savill J. Dransfield I. Hogg N. Haslett C. Nature. 1990; 343: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In addition to changes at the surface, the changes in cellular function that occur in an apoptotic cell are characterized by a variety of striking morphological and biochemical alterations. These include fragmentation of the nucleus and activation of endonuclease(s) (6Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 111: 2839-2850Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Earnshaw W.C. Curr.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). A further distinguishing feature of apoptotic cells is a loss of organized endomembrane structure; the nuclear envelope is frequently lost, and other recognizable membrane structures such as the Golgi complex are replaced by a disorganized array of vacuoles and vesicles (9Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12874) Google Scholar, 10Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). The so-called execution phase of apoptosis is evolutionarily conserved (11Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar), underlining its importance. It is now widely believed that many (although not all) apoptotic changes are linked to activation of a number of conserved cysteine proteases (caspases), which cleave specific substrates involved in key cellular processes (for review see Ref. 12Kidd V.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 533-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Caspases themselves are present as proenzymes that are readily cleaved, either autocatalytically (13Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 14Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol.

Caspases can be divided into groups based on their sequence-selective protease activity toward peptide substrates. Thus, caspases-2, -3, and -7 (group II caspases) all cleave preferentially after the sequence DEXD, whereas caspases-6, -8, and -9 (group III) prefer the sequence (V/L)E(H/T)D (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.O. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). A major question is whether such overlapping substrate specificity within each group indicates that these enzymes represent tissue-specific isoforms or redundant isoforms within the same cell, or whether caspases exhibit far greater specificity toward polypeptide substrates in vivo. Given the profound morphological changes occurring to membranes within apoptotic cells, and evidence for alterations in the expression of surface receptors, we anticipated that apoptosis would be associated with changes in the dynamics of the endocytic/recycling pathways. On this basis, we examined whether endosomal membrane fusion, an event that is essential for endosomal organization and for transport of receptors through the endocytic recycling pathway, is affected in apoptotic extracts. Endosomal fusion was indeed substantially reduced during apoptosis in Xenopus extracts, and this reduction was associated with specific cleavage of the Rab5 effector rabaptin-5 (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cleavage of rabaptin-5 was also apparent in cellular models of apoptosis, and was accompanied by reduced endocytic capacity. Hence, rabaptin-5 cleavage appears to be an important determinant in the abrogation of normal cellular function during apoptosis. In this study, we have examined in detail the activity that cleaves rabaptin-5. We have also mapped the site of rabaptin-5 cleavage, in order to understand how it might interfere with rabaptin-5 function and thus contribute to impairment of normal endocytic transport. Our previous data suggested that rabaptin-5 is cleaved by a caspase-related activity (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We now show that caspase-3 cleaves human rabaptin-5 at two closely positioned and conserved sites to generate physically separated N- and C-terminal domains. The activity of caspase-3 toward rabaptin-5 is surprisingly selective, since neither caspase-2 nor caspase-7 effect cleavage.

A cytosol fraction was produced by centrifuging the homogenate at 300,000 Ãg av for 45 min. The cytosol was snap-frozen and stored at â80 Â°C. To generate apoptotic extracts, cytosol (20 mg of protein/ml) was incubated for the indicated times at 30 Â°C with an ATP regenerating mixture (1 mm ATP, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 10 Î¼g/ml creatine kinase final) and 10 Î¼m cytochrome c. HL-60 cells (grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum) were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with 50 Î¼metoposide (20Beere H.M. Chresta C.M. Hickman J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 842-851PubMed Google Scholar) or with 1 Î¼g/ml anisomycin (21Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7013-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To generate apoptotic HL60 extracts, 1â2-liter cultures of cells were treated with etoposide, then harvested by centrifugation, washed in KEHM buffer, and homogenized as for HeLa cells. For immunodepletion of caspase-3, cytosol (4 mg of protein) was incubated overnight with gentle rotation in a tube containing 40 Î¼l of protein A-Sepharose beads to which had been pre-bound 8 Î¼g of anti-caspase-3 antibody. As a control, cytosol was incubated with beads pre-treated with a non-relevant antibody. Xenopus egg extracts were prepared exactly as described (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recombinant active caspases (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.O. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Samples were diluted to 2.5 ml in water and the generation of fluorescent product determined (22Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cleavage of polypeptide substrates by recombinant caspases was carried out in the appropriate buffer for 2 h at 30 Â°C, in a final volume of 10 Î¼l. Bacterially expressed His6-rabaptin-5 was purified as described by Stenmarket al. (23Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For some experiments, His6-rabaptin-5 containing a C-terminal protein C peptide tag was expressed and purified as above. This reagent was generated by inserting the protein C coding sequence (GAA GAT CAG GTA GAT CCA CGG TTA ATC GAT GGT AAG TAA) immediately downstream from the rabaptin-5 coding sequence. The protein C coding sequence was followed by an in-frame stop codon (underlined) and was inserted using polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (ExSite; Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-2 cDNAs were present in pcDNA3 vectors (24Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated by incubating 1 Î¼g of cDNA with a combined transcription/translation kit (Promega) supplemented with T7 RNA polymerase and 60 Î¼Ci of [35S]methionine. Rabaptin-5 cleavage site mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To examine cleavage of in vitro translated His6-rabaptin-5 in extracts, translation product was diluted 10-fold into Xenopus or HeLa extracts and incubated at 25 Â°C or 30 Â°C respectively. Samples were denatured by boiling for 5 min in 1% SDS, then diluted to 200 Î¼l with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and precipitated with 0.5 Î¼l of appropriate antibody with protein G- or protein A-agarose. Gel filtration chromatography to separate rabaptin-5 from procaspases 2 and 3 was performed using a 24-ml Sepharose-6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a Beckman BioSys 510 HPLC system. Analytical fractionation of apoptotic cytosol was achieved using a Superose 6 column on a Smart System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation experiments, polyclonal anti-rabaptin-5 serum (50 Î¼l) or monoclonal anti-rabaptin-5 (50 Î¼l of ascites) were preincubated with 100 Î¼l of protein A- or protein G-agarose, respectively, and the antibody was covalently attached to the beads using dimethylpimelimidate according to published methods (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Approach. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). These beads were then used to immunoprecipitate rabaptin-5 or its fragments from 2 mg of cytosol. For determination of N-terminal sequences, protein C-tagged rabaptin-5 was incubated with 10 nm caspase-3 for 4 h at 37 Â°C, then precipitated in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 onto protein G-agarose beads to which anti-protein C antibody (HPC4; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Lewes, UK) had been covalently attached. Residual full-length rabaptin-5 and C-terminal fragments were eluted with 5 mm EDTA. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Endosome fusion was assayed as described previously (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), using for each sample 5 Î¼l of donor membranes, 7 Î¼l of acceptor membranes, 10 Î¼l of cytosol in a total volume of 40 Î¼l. Our previous work had demonstrated that Xenopus rabaptin-5 is cleaved in egg extracts to yield a C-terminal fragment of 45â50 kDa (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar extracts have been shown to undergo several apoptotic events, including activation of caspases and endonucleases (26Cosulich S.C. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 997-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To establish whether cleavage by apoptotic proteases is a conserved feature of rabaptin-5, human His6-rabaptin-5 was translated in vitroand then combined with a Xenopus egg extract. After appropriate incubation, rabaptin-5 cleavage products of approximately 62 (Fig. 1 A) and 47 kDa (Fig. 1 B) were produced, which could be immunoprecipitated by anti-His antibody (Fig. 1 A) or an antibody recognizing the C-terminal portion of rabaptin-5 (Fig. 1 B), respectively. The time course of cleavage was similar to that previously reported for cleavage of endogenous Xenopus rabaptin-5 (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (data not shown), and was prevented by inclusion of the specific caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 1). Hence, human His6-rabaptin-5 behaves in apoptotic Xenopusextracts in the same way as Xenopus rabaptin-5, confirming that cleavage is a conserved function. Recent work from Wang and colleagues (16Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar) has shown that cytosolic extracts from mammalian cells can be triggered to enter apoptosis by addition of cytochrome c. This process can be sensitized by, although it is not strictly dependent upon, inclusion of dATP (24Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). We examined whether this system would be convenient for studying the apoptotic cleavage of rabaptin-5. Previous work has shown that activation of caspase-3 in HeLa extracts occurs via cytochromec-dependent activation of caspase-9 (16Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar), and is maximal within 30 min of addition of cytochrome c (24Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Substrates for caspase-3 and/or downstream caspases are cleaved more slowly. For example, caspase-2, whose cleavage requires caspase-3 activity (24Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Li H. Bergeron L. Cryns V. Pasternack M.S. Zhu H. Shi L. Greenberg A. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21010-21017Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), is cleaved in these extracts between 1 and 3 h after addition of cytochrome c to yield an immunoreactive 12/13-kDa fragment (24Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rabaptin-5 is also cleaved, although somewhat more slowly than caspase-2, to yield a C-terminal fragment similar in size to that generated within apoptotic Xenopus extracts. Using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within the N-terminal portion of rabaptin-5, the 62-kDa N-terminal fragment was also identified (Fig. 2 B). An additional minor product of approximately 53 kDa (N-53) was also seen with this antibody, indicating the presence of a further cleavage site. This was confirmed by inclusion of in vitro translated rabaptin-5 (see Fig. 3). Prolonged incubation of apoptotic extracts resulted in the disappearance of the N-62 fragment, while the N-53 fragment remained resistant to further proteolysis (Fig. 2 C, left panel), consistent with it being the result of a second, slower, cleavage event. Importantly, appearance of a 53-kDa polypeptide reactive against this antibody was observed in apoptotic cells and correlated with the disappearance of full-length rabaptin-5 (Fig. 2 C,right panel). These results suggest that N-53 is a final cleavage product in apoptotic cells. Moreover, they demonstrate that the cleaving activity that is present in apoptotic cells is likely to be similar, if not identical, to that present in cytochromec-activated extracts.FIG. 3Rabaptin-5 is cleaved after aspartate-438.

Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and the size of the C-terminal cleavage product in Xenopus extracts (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) had suggested to us that caspase-dependent cleavage was most likely to occur after aspartate 438 or aspartate 446. Indeed, inclusion of a 22-mer peptide that included both aspartate residues retarded cleavage in Xenopus extracts by 1â2 h (data not shown). To identify the exact cleavage site, rabaptin-5 mutants were prepared with either Asp438 or Asp446 replaced by alanine, and were incubated in apoptotic HeLa extracts. Compared with wild-type rabaptin-5 (Fig. 3 A), Asp438 rabaptin-5 did not produce N-62 or C-47 fragments (Fig. 3 B) while Asp446 rabaptin-5 behaved identically to the wild-type (Fig. 3 C). Hence, human rabaptin-5 is cleaved at the sequence DESD438F. Asp438 rabaptin-5 still gave rise to the N-53 fragment, confirming that it is the product of a second cleavage event that is not dependent on prior cleavage at Asp438. Systematic studies of caspase cleavage sites using synthetic modified tetrapeptides have identified the amino acid preferences at the P2âP4 positions for each caspase (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.O. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, caspases have been divided into several groups. The group II âeffectorâ caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, both cleave effectively after the sequence DEVD. Although this is similar to the primary cleavage site within rabaptin-5 (DESD), the activity of both caspases toward peptides is reduced when serine is placed at P2. In contrast, DESD is a preferred cleavage site, second only to DEHD, for the group II âactivatorâ caspase, caspase-2 (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.O. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, and our previous observation that concentrations of recombinant caspase-3 just sufficient to accelerate apoptotic changes in Xenopus egg extracts were unable to cleave rabaptin-5 directly (18Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that a caspase-2-like activity would be responsible for cleaving rabaptin-5. However, we undertook a detailed examination to establish the true identity of the cleaving activity. First, we examined whether cleavage of cytosolic rabaptin-5 in HeLa extracts is dependent on caspase-3 activity. We have already used this approach to establish that cleavage of caspase-2 occurs via caspase-3 (24Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We first examined the sensitivity of cleavage to the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, and found that cleavage of rabaptin-5 was prevented by inclusion of 50 nm Ac-DEVD-CHO (data not shown), similar to those concentrations that prevent cleavage of the caspase-3 substrates PARP and caspase-2 (24Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To further establish a dependence on caspase-3 activity, extracts were depleted of caspase-3 prior to addition of cytochrome c. Cytosols pre-treated with an antibody to caspase-3 were depleted of caspase-3 precursor by at least 90% compared with mock-depleted cytosols (data not shown). When incubated with cytochrome c, these extracts were unable to cleave rabaptin-5 (Fig. 4 A,left panel). In contrast, rabaptin-5 was cleaved almost to completion within 4 h when mock-depleted extracts were incubated with cytochrome c (Fig. 4 A,right panel). Although cleavage of cytosolic rabaptin-5 is dependent on caspase-3, it is possible that it is cleaved directly by a downstream effector of caspase-3, such as caspase-2. To address this question, HeLa extracts were preincubated for a period sufficient to activate caspase-3, as well as potential downstream caspases. They were then depleted of activated caspase-3. Western blotting of extracts confirmed that greater than 90% of activated caspase-3 had been removed (data not shown). When excess bacterially expressed rabaptin-5 was added to depleted extract, no cleavage product was detected before 3 h, and significant cleavage did not occur until after 5 h incubation (Fig. 4 B, top left). In contrast, cleavage of rabaptin-5 was observed within 1 h of its addition to mock-depleted extract, and the majority of recombinant rabaptin-5 was cleaved after 4â5 h (Fig. 4 B, top right). The rate at which caspase-3-depleted extract could cleave rabaptin-5 was increased significantly by inclusion of recombinant caspase-3 (Fig. 4 B, bottom left) or the beads isolated from the immunodepletion step (Fig. 4 B, bottom right), confirming that the major cleaving activity was caspase-3. To demonstrate that the caspase activated within apoptotic cells most likely to cleave rabaptin-5 is caspase-3, cytosol was prepared from apoptotic HL60 cells. These cytosols had substantial rabaptin-5 cleaving activity, since significant cleavage of recombinant rabaptin-5 was observed within 1â2 h (Fig. 4 C, left panel). Again, prior depletion of active caspase-3 from these extracts significantly reduced the rate at which rabaptin-5 was cleaved (Fig. 4 C, right panel). These results indicated that the major rabaptin-5 cleaving activity within apoptotic extracts is caspase-3. To confirm this, and to further demonstrate the selectivity of rabaptin-5 as a caspase-3 substrate, recombinant rabaptin-5 was incubated with purified caspases. As shown in Fig. 5 A (left panel), rabaptin-5 was cleaved in a Ac-DEVD-CHO-sensitive manner when incubated with immunoprecipitated activated caspase-3. Furthermore, recombinant caspase-3 cleaved rabaptin-5 to generate the same cleavage products as did apoptotic cytosol (Fig. 5 A,right panel). Cleavage of rabaptin-5 was first observed at caspase-3 concentrations of 0.5 nm or above (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, PARP cleavage was observed above 0.1 nm caspase-3 (Fig. 5 C) and caspase-2 cleavage was observed above 0.25 nm caspase-3 (Fig. 5 D). This somewhat lower activity of caspase-3 toward rabaptin-5 compared with caspase-2 correlates well with the slower rate of rabaptin-5 cleavage in apoptotic extracts. By analyzing caspase-3 cleavage of purified in vitro translated rabaptin-5 at 37 Â°C (data not shown) we obtained aK cat/K m of 1 Ã 105mâ1 sâ1(versus PARP; 20 Ã 105mâ1 sâ1). Caspase-2 has a preference for the cleavage site DESD over DEVD, so it was expected that rabaptin-5 would be a good substrate for caspase-2 (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.O. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2108707790,"Abstract Visual transduction in the compound eye of flies is a well established model system for the study of G protein-coupled transduction pathways. To characterize key components of the phototransduction cascade we performed substractive hybridization screening. We cloned the cDNA coding for the visual GÎ³ (GÎ³e) subunit from Drosophila which had so far eluded identification at the molecular level. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a major, 1.4-kilobase(kb) GÎ³e transcript and two minor transcripts of 1.8 and 6 kb in size. The major 1.4-kb mRNA is expressed preferentially in the eye. The spatial expression pattern determined for GÎ³e as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that GÎ³e dimerizes with GÎ²e to form the heterodimeric GÎ²Î³ subunit which functions in visual transduction in the Drosophila compound eye. GÎ³e shares common characteristics with the visual GÎ³ subunits of human rod and cone photoreceptors although different classes of GÎ± subunits are employed in vertebrate and invertebrate phototransduction. By the molecular cloning and characterization of the visual Î³ subunit ofDrosophila one of the few missing links in the well studiedDrosophila phototransduction cascade has been characterized to complete our knowledge about the Drosophila visual transduction pathway."

TL-P preferentially agglutinated human A-type erythrocytes, and the activity was inhibited by N-acetyl group-containing monosaccharides. The amino acid sequence analysis indicated that TL-P is almost structurally the same as a hemocyte-derived lectin with no hemagglutinating activity, tachylectin-1 (TL-1), and that 218 out of 221 amino acid residues in total were conserved between the two lectins. Despite the high sequence similarity, biological and biochemical characteristics of TL-P differed from those of TL-1: (i) unlike TL-1, TL-P agglutinates several animal-derived erythrocytes; (ii) unlike TL-1, TL-P has no significant affinity for bacterial lipopolysaccharides or antibacterial activity; (iii) Based on apparent molecular masses determined by gel filtration, TL-P forms a dimer in solution, while TL-1 is present as a monomer; (iv) and TL-P interacts with endogenous proteins of 13 and 14 kDa present in the perivitelline fluid; however, neither has any affinity for TL-1.

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Escherichia coli O111:B4, Salmonella minnesota (Smooth), andS. minnesota R595 (Re mutant) were from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, protein A-Sepharose, and reference proteins for molecular weight estimation were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Lysyl endopeptidase and endoproteinase Asp-N were, respectively, from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Tokyo) and from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Sugars and glycoproteins were from Sigma and Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo. Horse and sheep erythrocytes were from Nippon Bio-Laboratories (Tokyo). A hemocyte-derived TL-1 was prepared, as described (4Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Adults of T. tridentatus were collected in Kitsuki, Japan and maintained at the Shimoda Marine Research Center of the University of Tsukuba. The eggs of T. tridentatus were inseminated artificially (1Sekiguchi K. Sekiguchi K. Biology of Horseshoe Crabs. Science House Co., Ltd., Tokyo1988: 139-181Google Scholar). The developmental stage of the embryo was determined according to the normal plate of T. tridentatus, described by Sekiguchi (9Sekiguchi K. Sci. Rep. Tokyo Kyoiku Daigaku Sec. B. 1973; 15: 153-162Google Scholar). Perivitelline fluid was collected from the eggs after the third or fourth molt of the embryo by making a tear in the inner egg membrane, and then the fluid was stored at â20 Â°C until use. BSM (20 mg) was coupled with 2 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose, according to the instruction manual. SDS-PAGE was performed in 12 or 15% slab gels, according to Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver staining. For immunoblotting, electrophoresed proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, and the membrane was treated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TL-1 and visualized as described (11Miura Y. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 542-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemagglutinating activity (12Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 78: 51-61PubMed Google Scholar) and antimicrobial activity (12Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 78: 51-61PubMed Google Scholar, 13Larrick J.W. Hirata M. Shimomura Y. Yoshida M. Zheng H. Zhong J. Wright S.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2534-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were determined as described. TL-P and TL-1 were reduced, S-alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with lysyl endopeptidase (E/S = 1:100 (w/w)) in 0.1m NH4HCO3, containing 2m urea at 37 Â°C for 12 h (14Stone K.L.

Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 31-47Google Scholar). TheS-alkylated TL-P was also digested with endoproteinase Asp-N (E/S = 1:40 (w/w)) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m urea for 12 h at 37 Â°C. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC, using Cosmosil 5C18-MS (2.0 Ã 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto) with a linear gradient of 0â80% acetonitrile in 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm. Amino acid analysis was performed on a PICO-TAG system (Waters, Millipore Corp., Milford, MA), and sequence analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems 473A or 477A sequencer. The degenerate nucleotide sequences of primers used for PCR were based on peptide sequences of TL-P, QWHQIP (residues 2â7), and KQCDAT (residues 199â204). Sense and antisense nucleotides were synthesized with anEcoRI site at the 5â² end. Total RNA was extracted fromT. tridentatus embryo according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczymski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Oligotex dt30 (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto). First-strand cDNA synthesis from poly(A)+ RNA was performed using First SuperScript II RNase Hâ Reverse Transcriptase and random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA template (corresponding to about 0.1 Î¼g of poly(A)+ RNA) and 100 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer were subjected to PCR (30 cycles) with denaturation at 94 Â°C for 0.5 min, annealing at 50 Â°C for 1 min, and extension at 70 Â°C for 1 min. The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid Bluescript II SK (Stratagene) for sequence analysis. Gel filtration was done, using an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a Bio-silect SEC 250-5 column (300 Ã 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl and 15% acetonitrile at the flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and monitored atA 280. The reference proteins were IgG (146,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (45,000), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), and myoglobin (17,500). A polyclonal antibody against TL-1 prepared previously (11Miura Y. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 542-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was biotinylated with EZ-Link NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), according to a protocol provided by the manufacturer. Microtiter plates were coated with the nonbiotinylated antibody by incubating overnight at 4 Â°C. After washing with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, the plates were blocked with 2.5% casein, and 2-fold serial dilutions of samples were added. The bound antigen was assayed, using the biotinylated antibody and streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described (6Inamori K. Saito T. Iwaki D. Nagira T. Iwanaga S. Arisaka F. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An aliquot of samples, 400 Î¼l, was mixed with 5 Î¼g of TL-P or TL-1 and incubated for 10 h at 4 Â°C. The anti-TL-1 antibody (5 Î¼g) was added and incubated further for 10 h. Protein A-Sepharose was then mixed and incubated for 3 h at 4 Â°C. After washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, the pellet was suspended in the Laemmli sampling buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sugar contents were analyzed by the method of Takemoto et al. (17Takemoto H. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The principle was based on HPLC analysis of sugar derivatives released after pyridylamination of the acid hydrolysates of protein samples. The pooled perivitelline fluid just after the fourth molt of the embryo was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1 h to remove a flocculent substance. The resulting supernatant was applied to a BSM-Sepharose 4B column (1 Ã 5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After extensive washing with the buffer, hemagglutinating activity was eluted with 0.4 m GlcNAc present in the same buffer. A typical elution profile is shown in Fig. 1 A. The pooled fraction indicated by a bar gave a single band ofM r = 27,000 on SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B). About 0.4 mg of the hemagglutinin was purified from 50 ml of the perivitelline fluid, corresponding to about 700 eggs. We named this newly isolated lectin TL-P. TL-P agglutinated human A-type erythrocytes at the minimum concentration of 0.85 Î¼g/ml. The activity is equivalent to activities of tachylectins earlier identified from hemocytes, TL-2 (5Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and TL-3 (6Inamori K. Saito T. Iwaki D. Nagira T. Iwanaga S. Arisaka F. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TL-P also agglutinated human B-type and animal-derived erythrocytes including horse and sheep, but a 30-fold higher concentration than that of human A-type erythrocytes was required for agglutination (25 Î¼g/ml). Ca2+ was not required for the hemagglutinating activity of TL-P, but the activity was enhanced 2-fold by the addition of Ca2+ at 10 mm. Therefore, human A-type erythrocytes were used in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ for subsequent hemagglutination assays. The activity was completely inhibited by 0.1m EDTA, and the inactivation could not be recovered after dialysis against the assay buffer containing 10 mmCa2+, which suggested the presence of metal ion(s) in TL-P. Effects of various carbohydrates and several glycoproteins on the hemagglutinating activity of TL-P are summarized in Table I. For mono- and oligosaccharides,d-GalNAc and d-ManNAc inhibited the activity at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.5 mm.d-GlcNAc and NeuNAc were also inhibited at MIC ranging from 25 to 50 mm, but monosaccharides without theN-acetyl group had no effect. On the other hand, anN-acetyl derivative of amino acid,N-acetyl-glycine, was without effect at concentrations up to 200 mm. These results suggest that the N-acetyl group is important but not sufficient for recognition. BSM or orosomucoid was a potent inhibitor with MIC of 6.25 Î¼g/ml, or 15.6 nm assuming M r = 4.0 Ã 105 for BSM (18Tettamanti G. Pigman W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 124: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, bacterial LPS from E. coli O111 and S. minnesota R595 had no inhibitory effect.Table IInhibition of hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-PCarbohydratesMICd-GlcNIaNot inhibited at 250 mm.d-GalNIaNot inhibited at 250 mm.d-ManNIaNot inhibited at 250 mm.l-FucNIaNot inhibited at 250 mm.d-Glucuronic acidNIaNot inhibited at 250 mm.l-RhamnoseNIaNot inhibited at 250 mm.NeuAc50.0 mmd-GlcNAc25.0 mmd-ManNAc12.5 mmd-GalNAc12.5 mmLactose (GalÎ²1â4Glc)NIaNot inhibited at 250 mm.N-Acetyllactosamine (GalÎ²1â4GlcNAc)50.0 mmBovine submaxillary grand mucin6.25 Î¼g/mlOrosomucoid6.25 Î¼g/mlChondroitin sulfate ANIbNot inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml.Chondroitin sulfate BNIbNot inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml.Chondroitin sulfate CNIbNot inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml.HeparinNIbNot inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml.Hyaluronic acidNIbNot inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml.LPS: E. coliO111NIbNot inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml.LPS: S. minnesotaR595NIbNot inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml.a Not inhibited at 250 mm.b Not inhibited at 100 Î¼g/ml. Open table in a new tab The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of TL-P facilitated the identification of 20 amino acid residues, and this sequence was identical to that of a hemocyte-derived tachylectin, TL-1 (4Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a polyclonal antibody against TL-1 recognized TL-P, as determined by immunoblotting (see Fig. 5 B). TL-1 consisting of 221 amino acid residues is also a 27-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE but exhibits no hemagglutinating activity against human erythrocytes (4Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results indicate that while the two lectins are homologous they are not identical. TL-P and TL-1 were digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and their peptide maps were compared by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2, A and B). A definitive difference was observed between the two maps. A peak with a retention time of 53 min in TL-1 disappeared in TL-P, and two peaks named K8 and K9 emerged. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that peptides K8 and K9 derived from TL-P correspond to positions 162â185 and 186â197 in TL-1, with amino acid substitutions Leu168and Arg197 of TL-1 to Ile and Lys in TL-P, respectively. The peptides derived from TL-P were all sequenced, and peptide K4, corresponding to positions 70â84 of TL-1, was found to contain another amino acid substitution with Ser77 in TL-1 to Thr. Each substituted residue was confirmed by amino acid composition analysis of the peptides (data not shown). Furthermore, the sequence analysis of peptides derived from endoproteinase Asp-N digest overlapped the K-peptides. Details of the sequence analysis for individual peptides are summarized in Fig. 3. Essentially all amino acid residues were sequenced except for three residues corresponding to positions 36, 198, and 199.FIG. 2Peptide mapping of the proteolytic digest of TL-P (A) and TL-1 (B).

The outlined lettersrepresent different amino acid residues different from those of TL-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To complete the sequence of TL-P, reverse transcription-PCR and DNA sequence analysis were done, as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The deduced amino acid sequence confirmed the three amino acid substitutions of TL-P determined at the protein level; the unidentified residues were Cys36, Leu198, and Lys199, all of which are identical to those of TL-1 (Fig. 4 A). Consequently, TL-P consists of 221 amino acid residues, the same number as those of TL-1. Only the three amino acid residues differ between the two lectins, which are located in the sequence repeats, III, V, and VI (Fig. 4 B). Although TL-1 exhibits no hemagglutinating activity, it does show antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli B (4Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TL-P, however, had no significant antibacterial activity againstE. coli B, even at a concentration of 80 Î¼g/ml (Table II). In contrast, TL-1 inhibited the growth of E. coli B by 95% under the same conditions.Table IIAntibacterial activity of tachylectin-P and tachylectin-1 against E. coli BConcentrationViable cells/mlÎ¼g/mlTachylectin-P017,920 Â± 400 (100%)4016,370 Â± 880 (91%)8013,800 Â± 280 (77%)Tachylectin-1017,920 Â± 400 (100%)407530 Â± 970 (42%)80860 Â± 60 (5%) Open table in a new tab The apparent molecular masses of TL-P and TL-1 in solution were determined by gel filtration (Fig. 5 A). TL-P and TL-1 bound weakly to this silica-based resin; therefore, 1m NaCl and 15% acetonitrile were added to the elution buffer to prevent nonspecific binding. TL-P showed two major peaks of 54 and 27 kDa, corresponding, respectively, to a dimer and a monomer. On the other hand, TL-1 had a single peak of 27 kDa, corresponding to a monomer. The presence of TL-P or TL-1 in each peak was confirmed by immunoblotting, using the anti-TL-1 antibody (Fig. 5 B). Hemagglutinating activity was detected only in peak 1, not in peaks 2 and 3, suggesting that the dimeric formation of TL-P is an essential condition for hemagglutination. TL-P present in the monomer fraction (peak 2) may be denatured irreversibly and not form the dimer under the conditions used. Hemagglutinating activities in perivitelline fluid prepared just after the third and the fourth molt of the embryo were compared. The perivitelline fluid prepared after the fourth molt had 8 times higher hemagglutinating activity than that after the third molt. The content of TL-P in each perivitelline fluid was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ: 2.9 Â± 0.26 Î¼g/ml in the perivitelline fluid after the third molt and 22.4 Â± 2.5 Î¼g/ml in that after the fourth molt. Consequently, TL-P increased 7.7-fold during the two stages at the antigen level, which is consistent with the increase in hemagglutinating activity. The protein concentration in the perivitelline fluid after the fourth molt was quantitated to be 112 Î¼g/ml, using the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). Hence, TL-P accounts for 20% of the total proteins present in the perivitelline fluid at this stage. The flocculated material, which emerged in the perivitelline fluid during dialysis, was collected as precipitates by centrifugation. Shishikura and Sekiguchi (19Shishikura F. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) partially purified several glycoproteins from the flocculated material in perivitelline fluid of T. gigas; these glycoproteins inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the perivitelline fluid. To determine if the perivitelline fluid of T. tridentatuscontains such glycoproteins, the precipitates were washed with 0.5m GlcNAc and recentrifuged. When the supernatant was subjected to immunoblotting using the anti-TL-1 antibody, a 27-kDa immunoreactive band was observed (data not shown), a finding that suggests that part of TL-P in the perivitelline fluid is incorporated into the flocculated material during dialysis. After washing with 0.5m GlcNAc, the precipitates were solubilized in 5m urea and separated by gel filtration, as shown in Fig. 6 A. The first fraction gave two protein bands of 13 and 14 kDa on SDS-PAGE, and the second fraction contained TL-P, in addition to these proteins (Fig. 6 B). The 13- and 14-kDa proteins in the first fraction co-precipitated with the anti-TL-1 antibody only in the presence of TL-P, not in the presence of TL-1 (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, the co-precipitation of the 13- and 14-kDa proteins was inhibited in the presence of GlcNAc, suggesting that TL-P specifically interacts with these two proteins through the carbohydrates (Fig. 7). A component sugar analysis of the fraction containing the 13- and 14-kDa proteins showed that it contains Gal, Man, Fuc, Xyl, GlcNAc, and GalNAc at a molar ratio of 1.0:5.3:3.4:12.1:13.2:11.0.FIG. 7Inhibition of the co-precipitation of the 13- and 14-kDa proteins by GlcNAc. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE were performed, as described in the legend to Fig. 6, in the absence (lane 1) or presence of GlcNAc (50 mm(lane 2) or 100 mm (lane 3)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Hemagglutinating activity in the perivitelline fluid of the Japanese horseshoe crab T. tridentatus dramatically increased between the third and the fourth molt of the embryo, as was found to be the case for the Indo-Pacific horseshoe crab T. gigas (3Shishikura F. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We identified an embryonic 27-kDa lectin, TL-P, in the perivitelline fluid of T. tridentatus. The increase of the hemagglutinating activity in the perivitelline fluid correlated with the increase of TL-P at the antigen level. These results indicate that the major hemagglutinin present in perivitelline fluid during this period is TL-P. We previously identified four kinds of hemocyte-derived tachylectins, all of which seem to be involved in innate immunity of the horseshoe crab. TL-1 exhibits no hemagglutinating activity but does bind to LPS and polysaccharides such as agarose and dextran with broad specificity (4Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TL-2 specifically agglutinates human A-type erythrocytes and recognizes several LPS and staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids, probably through a high ligand density on pathogens (5Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, TL-3 (6Inamori K. Saito T. Iwaki D. Nagira T. Iwanaga S. Arisaka F. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and TL-4 (7Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) specifically bind to S-type LPS from several Gram-negative bacteria through a certain sugar moiety on O-antigens. Sequence analysis of TL-P indicated that TL-P is almost the same as TL-1, except for substitutions of three amino acid residues. This slight difference between primary sequences of the two tachylectins makes for a great difference in biological and biochemical characteristics: (i) unlike TL-1, TL-P agglutinates preferentially human A-type erythrocytes; (ii) unlike TL-1, TL-P has no significant affinity for bacterial lipopolysaccharides and does not exhibit antibacterial activity; (iii) based on apparent molecular masses determined by gel filtration, TL-P forms a dimer in solution, while TL-1 is present as a monomer; (iv) TL-P interacts with endogenous proteins of 13 and 14 kDa present in the perivitelline fluid, yet neither protein has any affinity for TL-1. TL-1 contains a zinc ion in the molecule, and removal of this zinc by EDTA leads to a loss of its sugar binding affinity (4Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hemagglutinating activity of TL-P was not Ca2+-dependent, but the activity was completely inhibited by EDTA, thereby indicating that TL-P also contains metal ion(s) with an important role for the sugar binding. Tectonins from the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum have been reported to have sequence similarity to TL-1 (33% identity), but the physiological role of tectonins remains unknown (20Huh C-G. Aldrich J. Mottahedeh J. Kwon H. Johnson C. Marsh R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6565-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A sequence homology search showed no significant similarity between TL-P and other lectins derived from embryos or vitelline membranes, including chicken galectins (21Hirabayashi J. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Sakakura Y. Hirabayashi J. Oda Y. Ohyama Y. Kasai K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19190-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). d-GlcNAc, d-GalNAc, and d-ManNAc, each of which is a stereoisomer at C-2 or C-4, inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of TL-P at similar concentrations.N-Acetyllactosamine (GalÎ²1,4GlcNAc) also inhibited the hemagglutination of TL-P. These results suggest that the configuration of C-2 and C-4 and a free 4-OH group of the ligand are not essential for TL-P for sugar recognition, and this is not the case for TL-2 with GlcNAc specificity. The importance of the configuration at C-2 and C-4 and a free 4-OH is evident from the crystal structure of TL-2 containing the ligand (26Beisel H.-G. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). TL-P probably recognizes the ligand mainly through the N-acetyl group. The inner egg membrane of horseshoe crab has an ion-permeable nature for Na+, Clâ, and Ca2+, but it does not allow for permeation of substances of higher molecular weights, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids (27Sugita H. Sekiguchi K. Biology of Horseshoe Crabs. Science House Co., Ltd., Tokyo1988: 195-224Google Scholar). These data suggest that TL-P functions in the perivitelline fluid without secretion through the membrane. Shishikura and Sekiguchi (19Shishikura F. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) partially purified several glycoproteins from the perivitelline fluid of T. gigas, which inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of the perivitelline fluid. Here we identified candidates of endogenous ligands for TL-P from the perivitelline fluid of T. tridentatus. These substances of 13 and 14 kDa were solubilized from aggregates formed in the perivitelline fluid during dialysis. TL-P could be eluted from precipitates with 0.5 md-GlcNAc, suggesting that the endogenous ligands are glycoproteins containing N-acetylhexosamines. The potential ligands could be immunoprecipitated with TL-P but not with TL-1, using the anti-TL-1 antibody. The dimeric form of TL-P may lead to an increase in binding affinity for multivalent ligands. The perivitelline fluid rapidly increases about 5-fold in volume between the third and the fourth molt of the embryo; therefore, the maintenance of osmotic pressure of the perivitelline fluid is an important factor to complete embryonic development (1Sekiguchi K. Sekiguchi K. Biology of Horseshoe Crabs. Science House Co., Ltd., Tokyo1988: 139-181Google Scholar, 27Sugita H. Sekiguchi K. Biology of Horseshoe Crabs.

Several carbohydrates and glycoproteins have been reported to be major factors to maintain osmotic pressure in perivitelline fluid (27Sugita H. Sekiguchi K. Biology of Horseshoe Crabs. Science House Co., Ltd., Tokyo1988: 195-224Google Scholar). TL-P occupies the majority of proteins in the perivitelline fluid after the fourth molting, accounting for 20% of the total proteins. TL-P probably has an important role in regulating the carbohydrate concentrations in the perivitelline fluid by interacting with endogenous glycoproteins orN-acetyl hexosamines. Structural differences between TL-P and TL-1 probably originated during molecular evolution by gene duplication and the accumulation of point mutations from the common ancestral gene. This is considered to be a good example of isolectins that have obtained different biological properties by mutating only a few amino acids of the ancestral lectin. We thank W. Kamada and H.

https://openalex.org/W1986478996,"We previously demonstrated that the induction of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) played an important role in oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL)-induced macrophage growth as a growth priming factor. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of the GM-CSF gene using Raw 264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line. Transient transfection into Raw 264.7 cells of several 5â²-flanking regions of GM-CSF gene-luciferase fusion plasmids revealed the presence of two positive regulatory sites in regions spanning from â97 to â59 and from â59 to â37 and one negative regulatory site from â120 to â97 in unstimulated cells. When cells were stimulated by Ox-LDL, there was one positive responsive site from â225 to â120 and one negative responsive site from â97 to â59, which contained the NF-ÎºB binding site. Computer analysis revealed the presence of a putative AP-2 binding site from â169 to â160. Mutagenesis of a putative AP-2 binding site and tandem repeat of this site in plasmid resulted in a complete loss and increased responsiveness to Ox-LDL, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that Ox-LDL increased the binding of certain nuclear protein(s) to a putative AP-2 binding site but decreased their binding to NF-ÎºB binding site.

In the early stages of atherosclerotic lesions, monocytes/macrophages are the major source of foam cells, which play an essential role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions via production of various active molecules (1Ross R.

Thus, to elucidate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, it seems reasonable to investigate the mechanisms of macrophage activation, proliferation, and survival processes that are regulated by the colony-stimulating factor (CSF)1 family, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (2Stanley E.R.

This finding strongly suggests that Ox-LDL acts as a growth inducer to macrophages by inducing certain intracellular signaling pathways. Subsequent studies from our laboratory identified the exact intracellular signaling pathways in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth. These included a rise in intracellular calcium ion and uptake of lysophosphatidylcholine through the scavenger receptors, which resulted in activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (17Matsumura T. Sakai M. Kobori S. Biwa T. Takemura T. Matsuda H. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Shichiri M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of GM-CSF at the mRNA level was located downstream the signaling pathway from PKC activation to macrophage growth (12Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T.

It was first identified as a stimulator of progenitor hemopoietic cells to proliferate or differentiate into mature granulocytes or macrophages (25Burgess A.W. Metcalf D.

The presence of a signaling pathway linking PKC activation to GM-CSF induction has been described in T lymphocytes. Sugimoto et al. (27Sugimoto K. Tsuboi A. Miyake S. Arai K. Arai N. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Tsuboi et al. (28Tsuboi A. Sugimoto K. Yodoi J. Miyatake S. Arai K. Arai N. Int. Immunol. 1991; 8: 807-817Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that two cis-acting DNA elements on the GM-CSF promoter region, CLE2/GC, were required for the induction of GM-CSF by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore. Moreover, Tsuboiet al. (29Tsuboi A. Muramatsu M. Tsutsumi A. Arai K. Arai N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cooperation among AP-1-, NF-ÎºB-, and NF-AT-binding sequences was required for the induction of GM-CSF, which was located downstream of PKC- and Ca2+-signaling pathways in T lymphocytes. Furthermore, Areset al. (30Ares M.P.S. Kallin B. Eriksson P. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1584-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that Ox-LDL could induce the activation of AP-1 in smooth muscle cells. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that induction of GM-CSF by Ox-LDL is also regulated by the activation of certain cis-acting DNA element(s) and nuclear transcription factor(s) after PKC activation in macrophages. However, the mechanism of GM-CSF production by Ox-LDL in macrophages remains unknown at present. In this study, we examined the promoter activity of GM-CSF in Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production by macrophages. Calphostin C was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentrations of Me2SO were <0.1% in the culture medium, which did not affect cell viability and cell growth. [Î³-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Antibodies for NF-ÎºB p50 and p65, AP-2Î±, AP-2Î², and AP-2Î³ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Other chemicals were of the best grade available from commercial sources. Human LDL (d = 1.019â1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from the plasma of consented normolipidemic subjects obtained after overnight fasting (31Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LDL was dialyzed against 0.15 mol/liter NaCl and 1 mmol/liter EDTA, pH 7.4. Acetyl-LDL was prepared by chemical modification of LDL with acetate anhydride (32Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Hakamata H. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ox-LDL was prepared by incubation of LDL with 5 Î¼mol/liter CuSO4 for 20 h at 37 Â°C followed by the addition of 1 mmol/liter EDTA and cooling (33Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Sakamoto Y. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Ohta T. Takata K. Horiuchi S. Morino Y. Matsuda I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (35Miyazaki A. Rahim A.T.M.A. Araki S. Morino Y. Horiuchi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Endotoxin levels associated with these lipoproteins were <1 pg/mg protein measured by a commercially available kit (Toxicolor system; Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Moreover, growth and viability of Raw 264.7 cells were not affected by endotoxin at a concentration of <1 ng/ml in our experimental system. The oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay contained the following sequences (only one strand is shown): the element of the region from position â173 to â147 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter region 5â²-AAA CCC CCA AGC CTG ACA ACC TGG GG-3â² (fragment A) and the region from position â95 to â70 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter region 5â²-CTC AGG TAG TTC CCC CGC CCC CCT GG-3â² (fragment B). Competitors corresponding to a putative AP-2 and NF-ÎºB binding sites were designed from their consensus sequences (competitor A, 5â²-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3â²; competitor C, 5â²-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3â²). Mutated competitors corresponding to a putative AP-2 and NF-ÎºB binding sites were designed from their consensus sequences (competitor B, 5â²-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC TTG CGG CCC GT-3â²; competitor D, 5â²-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3â²). Raw 264.7 cells were maintained in suspension at a density of 2 Ã 105 to 1 Ã 106cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) (medium A). For experiments, the cells were incubated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (5 Ã 106 cells/dish) or plated at a density of 1 Ã 106 cells/well in culture dishes (35-mm diameter; Falcon). All cell experiments were performed in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2 in air at 37 Â°C. When Raw 264.7 cells reached approximately 80% confluence in 100-mm plates in medium A, cells were washed twice with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, 37 Â°C) and then incubated for 3 or 24 h with 20 Î¼g/ml of Ox-LDL. Nuclear extract was purified as described previously by Dignamet al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as radiolabeled probes or unlabeled competitors. Probes were end-labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSA employing [Î³-32P]ATP-labeled probes, competitors, and nuclear extract was performed as described previously (37Matsuda K. Araki E. Yoshimura R. Tsuruzoe T. Furukawa N. Kaneko K. Motoshima H. Yoshizato K. Kishikawa H. Shichiri M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Five Î¼g/Î¼l firefly luciferase reporter plasmids (pGL3 Basic; Promega, Madison, WI) containing the 5â²-upstream regions of the GM-CSF gene was transiently transfected into Raw 264.7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method using a commercially available kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with 5 Î¼g/Î¼l Renilla luciferase control plasmid (pRL-SV40; Promega). After a 24-h incubation with medium A alone, cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 20 Î¼g/ml Ox-LDL. A plasmid lacking the 5â²-upstream region of the GM-CSF gene was used as a negative control (pGL3 Basic, Promega). After incubation, cells were washed twice by phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 1Ã passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. The luciferase activity in the resulting protein lysates was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). The results were expressed as normalized firefly luciferase activity divided by Renilla luciferase activity, to adjust any differences in transfection efficiency. Raw 264.7 cells (5 Ã 106 cells/plate, 100 mm in diameter; Falcon) were cultured in 15 ml of medium A with or without 20 Î¼g/ml Ox-LDL. During incubation for 24 h, 300 Î¼l of the medium were collected at various time intervals and immediately centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 1 min to remove any particulate material. The supernatant was stored at â80 Â°C immediately. After completion of all culture experiments, the frozen culture supernatants were quickly thawed to determine GM-CSF levels in the medium. The concentration of GM-CSF protein was determined according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the GM-CSF-specific ELISA system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using recombinant murine GM-CSF as a standard (12Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Standard molecular biology techniques were used (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After incubation of Raw 264.7 cells (2 Ã 106 cells/well in a six-well plate, 35 mm in diameter; Nunc) with or without Ox-LDL (20 Î¼g/ml) for different time intervals (0â5 h), total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand cDNA synthesis containing 1 Î¼g of total RNA was primed with oligo(dT). Primers used for PCR amplification of GM-CSF and Î²-actin were designed on the basis of murine GM-CSF cDNA (39Miyake S. Otsuka T. Yokota T. Lee T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1988; 4: 2561-2568Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and murine Î²-actin cDNA (40Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) sequences as follows: for GM-CSF, forward primer was TGT GGT CTA CAG CCT CTC AGC AC (nucleotides 64â86 of murine GM-CSF coding sequence), and reverse primer was CAA AGG GGA TAT CAG TCA GAA AGG T (nucleotides 407â431 of murine GM-CSF coding sequence) (39Miyake S. Otsuka T. Yokota T. Lee T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1988; 4: 2561-2568Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar); for Î²-actin, forward primer was GTG GGC CGC TCT AGG CAC CAA (nucleotides 25â45 of murine Î²-actin coding sequence), and reverse primer was CTC TTT GAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC (nucleotides 541â564 of murine Î²-actin coding sequence) (40Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The sizes of RT-PCR products of GM-CSF and Î²-actin were expected to be 368 and 540 base pairs, respectively. The cycling conditions in the GeneAmp 9600 System consisted of a first step of 94 Â°C denaturation for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of annealing at 54 Â°C for 60 s, extension at 75 Â°C for 90 s, and denaturation at 94 Â°C for 30 s, with a final elongation step at 75 Â°C for 10 min. Amplification products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. To verify that the amplification products were consistent with the reported sequences of murine GM-CSF and Î²-actin, they were ligated into pGEM-T (Promega), transfected intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue, and sequenced by using 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (12Biwa T.

All data were expressed as mean Â± S.D. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. We previously demonstrated that mouse peritoneal macrophages could produce GM-CSF in response to Ox-LDL (12Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1726-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To confirm whether Raw 264.7 cells also respond to Ox-LDL, we investigated the Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production in Raw 264.7 cells at protein and mRNA levels by using ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Fig. 1 A shows that LDL or acetyl-LDL did not induce GM-CSF release into the medium. However, the addition of 20 Î¼g/ml Ox-LDL to Raw 264.7 cells significantly induced GM-CSF release into the medium, with the peak release occurring at 4 h after the addition of Ox-LDL (Fig. 1 A). RT-PCR analysis showed that GM-CSF mRNA was increased by Ox-LDL with the peak level occurring at 3 h (Fig. 1 B), whereas both LDL and acetyl-LDL had no effect on GM-CSF mRNA expression in these cells (data not shown). These results demonstrated that Ox-LDL also induced GM-CSF expression in Raw 264.7 cells. Previous studies demonstrated that several nuclear factor binding sites existed in GM-CSF gene 5â²-flanking region from sequence â133 to â30, which positively regulated GM-CSF expression in response to PKC activation in T lymphocytes (27Sugimoto K. Tsuboi A. Miyake S. Arai K. Arai N. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Tsuboi A. Sugimoto K. Yodoi J. Miyatake S. Arai K. Arai N. Int. Immunol. 1991; 8: 807-817Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Tsuboi A. Muramatsu M. Tsutsumi A. Arai K. Arai N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the GM-CSF gene 5â²-flanking region from â225 to +26 was cloned and inserted into the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-basic) (Fig. 2 A) and transiently transfected into Raw 264.7 cells. Incubation with Ox-LDL significantly increased luciferase activity (Fig. 2 B), and luciferase activity reached a plateau level at 24 h (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, both LDL and acetyl-LDL had no effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 2 B). These results suggested that Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF mRNA expression might be regulated, at least in part, by the transcriptional activation of GM-CSF promoter from â225 to +26. To identify the regulatory elements in the mouse GM-CSF promoter, we constructed a series of plasmids containing 5â²-deletions of GM-CSF promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 B, in the unstimulated state, luciferase activity in pGL3GM120-transfected cells was almost equal to that in pGL3GM225-transfected cells. However, deletion extending to position â97, which removed the CLE1 region, resulted in increased luciferase activity. In contrast, deletion extending to â59 and to â37 resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity (Fig. 3 B). These results suggested that a negative regulatory site existed in the region extending from â120 to â97 and that two positive regulatory sites existed in the regions extending from â97 to â59 and from â59 to â37 in the unstimulated state. To confirm this notion, we constructed two plasmids containing mutations in a region from â120 to â97 and a region from â97 to â59 (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3 B also showed that luciferase activities in pGL3GM120mt- or pGL3GM97mt-transfected cells were significantly higher or lower than those in wild type plasmid-transfected cells, respectively, demonstrating that a region from â120 to â97 was a negative regulatory site and that a region from â97 to â59 was a positive regulatory site for GM-CSF expression under unstimulated states. On the other hand, when cells transfected with pGL3GM225 were incubated with Ox-LDL, luciferase activity increased, whereas luciferase activity in pGL3GM120-transfected cells was not changed by Ox-LDL-stimulation (Fig. 3 B). These results suggested that the region from â225 to â120 contained a positive responsive site for Ox-LDL stimulation. In contrast, luciferase activity was significantly decreased by Ox-LDL in pGL3GM97-transfected cells, which contained a positive regulatory site under unstimulated state, suggesting that a negative responsive site for Ox-LDL existed in the 5â²-flanking region from â97 to â59. We performed a computer analysis of the region extending from â225 to â120, which showed the presence of a putative AP-2 binding site from sequence â169 to â160 in the mouse GM-CSF promoter region (Fig. 4). Moreover, the NF-ÎºB binding site was reported to exist from â91 to â82 (41Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next performed a functional analysis using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing mutations in a putative AP-2 binding site from â169 to â160 (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, mutation in the putative AP-2 binding site reduced basal promoter activity by 20% and completely diminished Ox-LDL-induced promoter activity. To confirm that the putative AP-2 binding site is a positive responsive site for Ox-LDL stimulation, we constructed pGL3GM177 plasmid, which contained the sequence spanning position â177 of GM-CSF promoter region, and pGL3GM177 tandem plasmid, which had two more copies of the putative AP-2 binding site (Fig. 6 A). Cells transfected with pGL3GM177 plasmid induced 2.5-fold expression of luciferase in response to Ox-LDL, relative to unstimulated cells (Fig. 6 B). Transfection of the pGL3GM177 tandem plasmid increased basal level luciferase activity at 1.5-fold and Ox-LDL-induced luciferase activity at 4.4-fold, relative to unstimulated cells (Fig. 6 B). These results demonstrated that Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF expression was required for a putative AP-2 binding site.FIG. 5Mutation in a putative AP-2 binding site reduces transcriptional activation by Ox-LDL.

As shown in Fig. 7 B using a putative AP-2 binding site as a probe, the nuclear proteins from unstimulated cells produced two faint bands, which became prominent bands by Ox-LDL. These bands were completely diminished by cold excess unlabeled fragment A but not completely competed by cold excess unlabeled AP-2 consensus oligonucleotides. Moreover, supershift analysis using anti-AP-2Î±, AP-2Î², and AP-2Î³ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) did not affect the position and density of the bands (data not shown). These results suggested that the binding of nuclear factor(s) to a putative AP-2 binding site was different from AP-2Î±, AP-2Î², or AP-2Î³ but might be a nuclear protein highly homologous to the AP-2 family. As shown in Fig. 8 B, when the NF-ÎºB binding element was used as a probe, a strong band was detected in unstimulated cells. Interestingly, this band was decreased by incubation with Ox-LDL for 24 h (Fig. 8 B). Cold excess NF-ÎºB consensus oligonucleotides diminished this band. However, cold excess mutated NF-ÎºB consensus oligonucleotides completely failed to compete for nuclear protein binding to fragment B. Moreover, the density of this band was reduced by both anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies but not by nonimmune IgG (Fig. 8 C), suggesting that this band contained, at least, NF-ÎºB p50 and p65.FIG. 8Binding of NF-ÎºB to a NF-ÎºB bind"

At the cellular level, the treatment results in a tremendous transient increase in resistance to a subsequent heat stress, a process termed thermotolerance (7Gerner E.W. Schneider M.J. Nature. 1975; 256: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The role of the transcriptional activation of the HSP genes in the acquisition of thermotolerance has been suggested by the demonstration that HSP accumulation after mild triggering heat shock closely parallels development of thermotolerance, both responses culminating 5â10 h after the priming treatment (8Landry J.

There is evidence for a role of each of the MAP kinase cascades in the cell response to stress and apoptosis signaling. SAPK1/JNK and SAPK2/P38 activities were in most cases associated with promotion of apoptosis, whereas ERK activity is in general associated with protection (26Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). In some circumstances, however, SAPK1/JNK and SAPK2/p38 can have a protective function (27Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Activation of SAPK2/p38 appears particularly significant in the case of heat shock because one of the heat shock proteins, HSP27, is phosphorylated by MAPKAP kinase-2, a physiological substrate of SAPK2/p38 (6Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 30Huot J. Lambert H.

SAPK2/p38-mediated phosphorylation has been shown to be essential for some activities of HSP27. Upon phosphorylation, high molecular weight HSP27 multimers dissociate into monomers and dimers providing a pool of active monomeric HSP27 which can modify the dynamics of actin filaments (31Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 32Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity results in the stabilization of the microfilaments in response to oxidative stress (33Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Landry J. Huot J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). However, strong activation of SAPK2/p38 and phosphorylation of HSP27 coupled with a high level of expression of HSP27 can also in some circumstances result in bleb formation and increased toxicity, illustrating the necessity of a tight control over SAPK2/p38 activation (36Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). HSP27 becomes phosphorylated within 20 min upon exposure of cells to elevated temperature (10Landry J. ChreÌtien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is maximal immediately or soon after the triggering heat shock and returns to the control level after 5 h when cells are fully thermotolerant. Intriguingly, HSP27 is not phosphorylated when a second heat shock is applied during thermotolerance. Desensitization starts at 2 h after the priming treatment, peaks at 5 h, at which time no reinduction of HSP27 phosphorylation is observed, and vanishes by 15 h. In fact, a perfect temporal correlation has been found between the capacity of the cells to resist HSP27 phosphorylation and the thermotolerant state. This has led to the suggestion that some factors induced by the priming heat shock and generated along with the development of thermotolerance block the signaling pathway leading to HSP27 phosphorylation (10Landry J. ChreÌtien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for inhibiting HSP27 phosphorylation in heat-induced thermotolerant cells. The results showed that the desensitization process occurs at a proximal step in the signaling pathway upstream of SAPK2/p38 phosphorylation and activation. Desensitization was strictly homologous affecting exclusively heat shock induction of the SAPK2/p38 pathway. We infer that there is a sensing mechanism highly specific to heat shock in the activation pathway of SAPK2/p38, and we showed that it involves a short lived protein whose activity depends on a tight regulation between synthesis and degradation.

The kinase activity was assayed for 30 min at 30 Â°C and was stopped by the addition of 10 Î¼l of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Immunoprecipitated SAPK2/p38 was assayed analogously using ATF2-GST as substrate (34Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase assay buffer for SAPK2/p38 contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 50 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 Î¼g ATF2-GST, and 4 Î¼Ci of [Î³32-P]ATP. Kinase activities were evaluated by measuring incorporation of the radioactivity into the specific substrates after resolution by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantification using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To ensure equal loading of the kinases on different lanes, immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Proteins were separated through 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose as described previously (33Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). After reacting the membranes with the specific antibodies, proteins were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by iodinated secondary antibodies and quantified using PhosphorImager analysis. Cells that had become thermotolerant after a mild heat shock are refractory to heat-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 (10Landry J. ChreÌtien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We investigated whether desensitization could be correlated with the loss of responsiveness of MAPKAP kinase-2 and SAPK2/p38, the two upstream activators of HSP27 phosphorylation. In CCL39 cells, MAPKAP kinase-2 and SAPK2/p38 are activated maximally right after a 20-min heat shock (Fig. 1, A andB ). The activities of both kinases rapidly returned to basal level within the next 3â5 h. This is in perfect agreement with the previously published kinetics of HSP27 phosphorylation, which is maximal within 20 min and is back to normal basal levels within 3â5 h after the priming treatment (10Landry J. ChreÌtien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We examined the reactivation of these two kinases by heat shock at various times after a priming heat shock treatment. Neither kinase was reactivated when the cells were restimulated at any time between 5 and 10 h postpriming although both were present at normal levels as determined by immunoblot using anti MAPKAP kinase-2 and SAPK2/p38 antibodies (Fig. 1 C). At later times (24 h), both kinases were activated normally as shown previously for HSP27 phosphorylation (10Landry J. ChreÌtien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar kinetics of desensitization was observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). In the case of SAPK2/p38, the results were confirmed using a phospho-specific antibody, which indicated that the failure to activate SAPK2/p38 correlated with lack of phosphorylation by the upstream kinases (data not shown). The desensitization appeared to be total and not just a mere displacement in the dose-response curve for heat shock. Whereas a 20-min heat shock induced a maximal MAPKAP kinase-2 activation in naive cells, treatment for up to 1 h did not induce MAPKAP kinase-2 activity in fully desensitized cells (Fig. 1 D). The Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 1 C indicated that heat-induced desensitization of MAPKAP kinase-2 and SAPK2/p38 activation were not caused by a down-regulated expression of MAPKAP kinase-2 or SAPK2/p38 in thermotolerant cells. To determine whether these enzymes were physically available and functional, we evaluated if the desensitization process also affected MAPKAP kinase-2 activation by other known activators of the pathway. Cells were first exposed to heat shock and then restimulated with various growth factors, cytokines, or stress agents. In control cells, thrombin and TNF-Î± elicited a strong activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 (Fig. 2,A and B). The ability of thrombin and TNF-Î± to activate MAPKAP kinase-2 was unaffected in heat-desensitized cells. Similarly, heat-desensitized cells remained fully responsive to restimulation with all other agonists tested at 5 h after heat shock, namely EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, readdition of serum to serum-deprived cells, sphingomyelinase, and phorbol ester (data not shown). The ability of physical or chemical stresses to activate the SAPK2/p38 pathway in heat-desensitized cells was also tested by looking either directly at the activity of SAPK2/p38 or at the activity of MAPKAP kinase-2. Both H2O2 and sodium arsenite induced a normal activation of the pathway at all times after the desensitizing heat shock (Fig. 2, C and D). Similarly, sorbitol induction of the pathway was about 75% of the control response at 5 h after the priming heat shock (data not shown). Hence heat shock-induced desensitization of the SAPK2/p38 pathway was not caused by a general toxic response and affected specifically the heat shock-sensitive pathway. Thus, the failure to induce phosphorylation of HSP27 in heat-induced thermotolerant cells was the result of a total inhibition of some proximal elements of the heat shock signaling pathway preventing phosphorylation and activation of SAPK2/p38 and activation of the HSP27 kinase MAPKAP kinase-2. Having shown clear homologous desensitization of the SAPK2/p38 pathway activation by heat shock, we next tested if other agonists were also capable of eliciting a desensitization to heat shock. Cells pretreated with EGF showed virtually total desensitization of MAPKAP kinase-2 activation to restimulation with EGF (Fig. 3 A). MAPKAP kinase-2 activation was not induced above the residual level remaining after the first stimulation. In contrast, heat shock induction was unaffected in EGF-desensitized cells. Similarly, thrombin treatment induced homologous desensitization of MAPKAP kinase-2 activation but did not desensitize to heat shock (Fig. 3 B). One conclusion of these results is that activation of SAPK2/p38 is not a sufficient condition for heat desensitization. The possibility that it could be required during heat-induced homologous desensitization was tested by determining the effect on heat-induced desensitization of SB203580, a pyridinil imidazol derivative that efficiently inhibits SAPK2/p38 activity (43Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). As reported previously, SB203580 did not prevent SAPK2/p38 activation but led to a total inhibition of MAPKAP kinase-2 activation (Fig. 4) and HSP27 phosphorylation. Inhibition of SAPK2/p38 activity during the priming heat shock treatment had no effect on induction of desensitization, indicating that events occurring downstream of SAPK2/p38 were not required for inducing homologous heat desensitization.FIG. 4Heat desensitization does not require SAPK2/p38 activity. Panel A, exponentially growing CCL39 cells were pretreated (+SB) or not (âSB) for 1 h with the SAPK2/p38 inhibitor SB203580 (5 Î¼m) and then exposed (HS) or not (Ctl) to a 20-min heat shock at 44 Â°C before being extracted. Panel B, cells were pretreated (+SB) or not (âSB) for 1 h with SB203580 (5 Î¼m), exposed to a 20-min heat shock at 44 Â°C, and returned at 37 Â°C. 5 h later, the cells were exposed (HS) or not (Ctl) to a second identical heat shock before being extracted. Extracts were assayed for MAPKAP kinase-2 (black bars) or SAPK2/p38 (white bars) activities using recombinant HSP27 or ATF2-GST as substrates, respectively. Results are expressed as the ratio of the kinase activities of stimulated cells over the activity of unstimulated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Another possibility for explaining the heat-induced desensitization is that one of the heat shock proteins that accumulate after the first heat shock acts as a repressor of one of the elements in the heat-specific sensing pathway that triggers SAPK2/p38 activation. This appeared unlikely because the kinetics of accumulation of the HSP after heat shock does not match the kinetics of desensitization. For example, HSP27 and HSP70 concentrations peak at 10 and 14 h after heat shock, whereas desensitization is maximal at 5 h (10Landry J. ChreÌtien P. Laszlo A. Lambert H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we tested directly the effect of overexpressing HSP70, HSP90, or HSP27 on heat activation of SAPK2/p38. HSP70, HSP90, or HSP27 was cotransfected with HA-tagged SAPK2/p38 in CCL39 cells. Under the conditions of transfection used, we calculated, after correcting for the transfection efficiency (about 20%), that individual transfected cells expressed amounts of HSP equivalent (HSP70 and HSP90) or 2-fold higher (HSP27) than what control cells express 5 h after heat shock. Epitope-tagged SAPK2/p38 was immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells at various times after shifting the temperature to 44 Â°C, and p38 activity was determined using ATF2-GST as substrate. As shown in Fig. 5 A overexpression of HSP90, HSP70, or HSP27 had no effect on heat activation of SAPK2/p38 compared with cells transfected with an empty vector. Furthermore, these cells were desensitized to heat shock to the same extent as control cells (Fig. 5 B). These results strongly suggested that HSP70, HSP90, or HSP27 generated during development of thermotolerance was not implicated in heat-induced homologous desensitization of SAPK2/p38 activation. This was supported further by the finding that the addition of cycloheximide during and after heat shock to inhibit HSP and total protein synthesis did not block desensitization of the SAPK2/p38 pathway (see below). Cycloheximide desensitized MAPKAP kinase-2 to activation by heat shock (Fig. 6 A). The capacity to activate MAPKAP kinase-2 with heat shock decreased progressively upon exposure to cycloheximide and was totally inhibited after 5 h, suggesting the existence of an essential element with a half-life in the order of 2â3 h in the SAPK2/p38 activation pathway. To determine whether this element was specific to heat shock, cells were exposed to cycloheximide for 5 h and then treated with H2O2, sodium arsenite, or sorbitol. In contrast to heat shock, activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 by these agents was not or only slightly affected by the cycloheximide pretreatment(Fig. 6 B ). Similar results were obtained using two other structurally and mechanistically unre"
https://openalex.org/W1528803042,"Sensory neural reorganization occurs as a result of visual experience in the adult as well as early in life. Here we report and quantify a misperception of visual orientation: when alphanumeric characters that are commonly tilted clockwise were presented with a clockwise tilt, they were perceived as less tilted than the same stimulus horizontally inverted. In contrast, subjective perception of tilt magnitude for horizontally inverted non-alphanumeric stimuli was similar to that for non-inverted stimuli. Therefore, misassessment of tilt of alphanumeric characters probably reflects a persistent sensory recalibration of orientation perception as a result of previous long-term visual experience."
