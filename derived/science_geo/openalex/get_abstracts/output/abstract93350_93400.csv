https://openalex.org/W1981581994,"Metastasis is the principal cause of failures to cure human cancers. Prostacyclin is a powerful antimetastatic agent against B16 amelanotic melanoma cells. This effect, which may result from the platelet antiaggregatory action of prostacyclin, is potentiated by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Inhibitors of prostacyclin synthesis increase metastasis. Prostacyclin and agents that may increase endogenous prostacyclin production or prolong its activity are suggested as new antimetastatic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2074731733,"Three human thymic cell-surface antigens T6, T9 and T10, previously defined by monoclonal antibodies, were analyzed using immunoprecipitation techniques. The antigen T6 was found to be a 49,000 dalton glycoprotein, which is associated with β2-microglobulin, the small subunit (12,000 daltons) of the HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens. The target antigen for the monoclonal reagent anti-T9 was found to be a glycoprotein of 94,000 daltons, which appears as a disulfide-linked dimer of 190,000 daltons on the cell surface. The antigen precipitated by the anti-T10 antibody is a 45,000 dalton glycoprotein. We present preliminary evidence that all three cell-surface proteins may be integral membrane proteins. These findings, in addition to the distribution patterns, suggest that the T6 antigen is the human homolog of the murine thymus leukemia (TL) antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2078311241,"Termination of transcription is emerging as an important and powerful mechanism for controlling gene expression as the result of converging evidence from studies in four very different areas. First, genetic approaches to understanding regulatory mechanisms have led to the discovery of and characterization of specific protein factors that effect termination and antitermination. Second, studies suggest that the phenomenon of translational polarity is due to premature termination of transcription. Third, the identification and analysis of attenuator sites preceding gene clusters has demonstrated that the extent of gene expression can be modulated by termination, independent of promoter/operator regulation. Finally, recent results concerning termination at the end of genes or operons indicate that the structure and function of termination regions may be more complex than previously envisioned. The tryptophan (trp) gene cluster in E. coli is one of the best characterized biosynthetic operons in bacteria, consisting of five contiguous structural genes (encoding enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway from chorismate to tryptophan) and associated control elements, transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA about 6720 nucleotides long (Figure 1). The final level of expression is subject to control by integrative feedback mechanisms at many different levels; hence the system is extremely well suited for detailed studies of mechanisms regulating operon expression in procaryotes. Since my previous review (Platt, 19781, an enormous amount of new data has been accumulated that relates to trp operon regulation, and much of this is discussed in detail by Crawford and Stauffer (1980). General analyses of termination as a mechanism for genetic control are available in reviews by Adhya and Gottesman (1978), Pribnow (1979) and Rosenberg and Court (1979). Detailed insights into the particular intricacies of attenuation as a regulatory phenomenon are given in the comprehensive summary by Yanofsky (1981). To complement these discussions, I will focus on recent developments bearing on termination of transcription in E. coli, in the context of regulation of tryptophan operon mRNA synthesis. These developments begin to answer several important questions about termination, including: What features control termination in the simplest systems in vitro? What is the role of rho factor (Roberts, 1969) and how do rhoindependent termination sites differ from rho-dependent ones? In what ways can the cell modulate the extent of termination to regulate gene expression? From a discussion of these questions some general ideas also emerge, which help clarify our understanding of the mechanisms involved in termination and raise important questions for future work."

The method depends primarily on a single chromatographic step which is highly specific for recA protein: elution by ATP from single-stranded DNA cellulose. With this procedure, gram quantities of recA protein, greater than 99% pure, can be reproducibility prepared for biochemical and biophysical analysis."

Cultures initiated from diluted samples containing an estimated 1.0 or 0.5 parasite showed microscopically visible parasites after 21 days. Most of these cultures were characterized by only single enzyme forms.

https://openalex.org/W1975761737,Incubation of cortical synaptic membranes with low concentrations of calcium resulted in a decrease in the amount of a high-molecular-weight doublet protein and an increase in the sodium-independent binding of glutamate. Both effects were blocked by the thiol protease inhibitor leupeptin. These results suggest that calcium-induced proteolysis of membrane components regulates the number of glutamate receptors in neuronal membranes.

https://openalex.org/W1980543400,"Using a cloned fragment containing the lexA gene of E. coli, the entire nucleotide sequence of the lexA gene has been determined. The probable coding region of the lexA gene contains 606 nucleotide residues and encodes a single protein of 202 amino acids. The initiation site of in vitro transcription of the lexA messenger RNA has been determined by analysis of the 5' nucleotide sequence. Comparison of the DNA sequence of the promoter region of the lexA gene with that of the recA gene reveals the presence of sequences that are common to both. There is some similarity between the amino acid sequences of the lexA and the lambda repressor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1967872365,"Methionine enkephalin release was evoked by depolarization of slices from rat striatum with potassium. In the presence of 0.1 μM thiorphan [(N(R,S)-3-mercapto-2-benzylpropionyl)glycine], a potent inhibitor of enkephalin dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (enkephalinase), the recovery of the pentapeptide in the incubation medium was increased by about 100 percent. A similar effect was observed with the dipeptide phenylalanylalanine, a selective although less potent enkephalinase inhibitor. Inhibition of other known enkephalin-hydrolyzing enzymes—aminopeptidase by 0.1 mM puromycin or angiotensin-converting enzyme by 1 μM captopril—did not significantly enhance the recovery of released methionine enkephalin. These data indicate that enkephalinase is critically involved in the inactivation of the endogenous opioid peptide released from striatal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1499137085,"A binding protein from liver which binds reversibly to yeast mannan depending on the presence or absence of calcium has been purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The binding of the isolated protein to 125I-mannan is proportional to protein concentration and is apparently an unsaturable process. The Scatchard plot of the binding is a curvilinear, indicating the presence of a high affinity binding site with a dissociation constant of 1.62 X 10(-8) M. Evidence is presented to show that the protein recognizes and binds mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues almost indiscriminately at the same binding site. Physical and chemical studies suggest the intact binding protein with an approximate molecular weight of 194,000 to be composed of six identical subunits. The protein is characterized as a glycine-rich protein. The apparent ubiquitous distribution of mannan-binding protein in mammalian liver is consistent with the proposal that the binding protein is the cellular receptor mediating the hepatic uptake of glycoproteins terminated with mannose and/or N-acetylglucosamine residues."

A serum-free, biochemically defined medium, supplemented with the relevant hormones, permitted proliferation and propagation of normal diploid mammalian arterial smooth muscle cells. Serum-free, hormone-supplemented cultures spontaneously formed atherosclerotic plaque-like nodules. Thus atherosclerosis may be mediated by a complex endocrine system."
https://openalex.org/W1942044719,"The complete primary structure of the Escherichia coli B/r galactose-binding protein was determined by the automated sequencing of fragments produced by cleavage with cyanogen bromide, o-iodosobenzoic acid, limited trypsin digestion, mild acid hydrolysis, and Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 protease. The protein, which has 309 amino acids, is notable in the extent to which it differs from the L-arabinose-binding protein. Comparison of these two proteins indicates only about 18% homology despite the close structural resemblence of the molecules which they bind. The galactose-binding protein is the chemoreceptor initiating chemotaxis toward galactose, and it thus becomes the first protein component required for chemotaxis for which the primary structure is known.

https://openalex.org/W1580158514,"Glucosidase activities capable of removing the three glucose residues from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide were detected in a cell-free preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae X-2180. The glucosidase which cleaves the glucose residue at the nonreducing terminus (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide glucosidase) was equally distributed between the particulate and the supernatant fractions obtained after centrifugation of the yeast homogenate at 27,000 X g for 30 min. The membrane-bound activity was stimulated by Triton X-100, whereas the supernatant activity was not affected. The soluble Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide glucosidase was partially purified from the supernatant by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. It was clearly separated from alpha-glucosidase, which acts onp-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, but still contained beta-glucosidase and alpha-mannosidase acting on p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and alpha-D-mannopyranoside, respectively. The Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide glucosidase had a pH optimum of 6.8, and showed no requirement for divalent cations. The enzyme was very active with glucose-labeled Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, was slightly active with Glc2Man9GlcNAc2, and showed no activity with Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. These properties suggest that this enzyme is involved in the first step of processing of oligosaccharides after transfer from dolichyl pyrophosphate to proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1483822327,"Protein synthesis, accumulation, and breakdown were examined in growing cultures of contractile embryonic chick heart cells, and the fractional synthetic rates of several individual proteins were compared. Fractional rates of protein synthesis were evaluated with a procedure that combined equilibrium and pulse labeling for determination of specific radioactivities of the precursor in the medium and in proteins isolated by electrophoresis. Kinetic analysis during equilibration of the precursor specific radioactivity with that in labeled proteins indicated that the specific radioactivity of leucine in the culture medium closely approximated that of the immediate reaction precursor for protein synthesis. Protein accumulation and breakdown were evaluated by standard growth and decay kinetics. Fractional protein synthesis rates determined during either short pulse labeling or during continuous labeling to equilibrium were found to be in agreement with independent measurements of protein accumulation and breakdown. We also determined fractional synthetic rates of proteins isolated from cultured heart cells on single and two-dimensional electrophoresis and found the following order of fractional synthesis rates: fibronectin greater than or equal to alpha-actinin greater than myosin heavy chain = tropomyosin = myosin light chains greater than 55,000-dalton proteins (desmin and tubulin) greater than or equal to actin. The half-lives of these proteins ranged from T 1/2 = 1.1 days for fibronectin and 2.0 days for myosin heavy chain to 4.7 days for actin."
https://openalex.org/W1541356504,"19-Hydroxy[1 alpha-3H]androstenedione was synthesized and its specific activity was accurately determined. Upon aromatization of the above material by placental microsomal aromatase preparation, a process involving 1 beta hydrogen elimination, only 7.4% of the isotope was lost establishing the alpha orientation of the 3H at C-1 in the substrate. The 19-hydroxy[1 alpha]3H]androstenedione was used as the starting material in the synthesis of 2 beta-hydroxy-19-oxo[1 alpha-3H]androstenedione which therefore had the same specific activity and isotope orientation as its precursor. The nonenzymatic collapse of 2 beta-hydroxy-19-oxo[1 alpha-3H]androstenedione in pH 7.1 buffer to estrone was associated with the elimination of only 2.6% of the isotope indicating that this process proceeds also with stereospecific 1 beta hydrogen elimination. The stereochemistry of hydrogen loss in the nonenzymatic aromatization of the 2 beta-hydroxy-19-oxo derivative is therefore beta and identical with that of estrogen biosynthesis. This provides further evidence in support of the hypothesis that the final enzymatic hydroxylation of the aromatization sequence takes place at position 2 beta of the androgen substrate and that its product, the 2 beta-hydroxy-19-aldehyde, is the proximate precursor of estrogen with the final conversion occurring nonenzymatically."
https://openalex.org/W1505009450,"Abstract Intracellular protein degradation was measured in primary monolayer cultures of adult rat hepatocytes by the loss of radioactivity from proteins pulse-labeled in culture with L-[U-14C]valine. The fractional rate of protein degradation of total protein measured over 18 h was similar to the rate in vivo. The fraction rate of protein breakdown was altered significantly by varying the composition of the chase medium from a balanced salts medium (high rate of protein degradation) to a more complete medium (lower rate of protein degradation). Whereas the vitamin component of the complete medium had some effect, the major portion of the inhibition of protein degradation was due to the essential amino acids in the medium. This inhibition was found to depend on the presence of methonine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, the latter two of which appear to be primarily responsible. The observed rate of protein breakdown was a function of the level of amino acids in the medium when they were varied in the physiological range for rat plasma. Our results suggest that the regulation of protein degradation by essential amino acids may be physiologically important in maintaining intracellular amino acid pools when the exogenous supply of amino acids is diminished."

https://openalex.org/W1486520506,"During catalysis by homogeneous procaryotic DNA polymerases, nucleoside monophosphates are generated by a 3' leads to 5'-exonucleolytic activity. Using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and poly[d(A-T)] as a template, the contribution of this activity to the fidelity of DNA synthesis has been evaluated by three different criteria. 1) The ratio between the rates of monophosphate generation and incorporation of the noncomplementary nucleotide with Mg2+ as an activating cation was 0.6 +/- 0.6, which is insufficient to account for the high fidelity of polymerization. 2) Inhibition of polymerization by pyrophosphate fails to diminish fidelity, although some kinetic models suggest that optimal error correction via monophosphate release requires the polymerization reaction to be strongly driven by pyrophosphate release. 3) The addition of deoxynucleoside monophosphates in concentrations as great as 10 mM to the reaction mixture does not alter the fidelity of DNA synthesis. These observations argue against the kinetic proofreading mode to account for the fidelity of E. coli DNA polymerase I when copying poly[d(A-T)] in a Mg2+-activated reaction. Furthermore, they suggest that the polymerase may enhance specificity at the base-selection step. However, the 3' leads to 5' exonuclease plays a larger role when the polymerase is activated with Mn2+ and may also be important in copying natural DNA where lower error rates are observed in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2041420212,"The replication terminus of the drug resistance factor R6K has been cloned into the plasmid vectors pBR313 and pBR322. When the exogenously added DNA is replicated in vitro using cell extracts prepared from Escherichia coli, the plasmid replication terminus temporarily arrests the progression of the unidirectionally moving replication fork at or near the cloned terminator sequence. When the relative location of the terminator sequence is changed with respect to the replication origin, the point of arrest of the replication fork shifts correspondingly to the new location of the terminator. Termination of replication takes place in vitro regardless of whether the cell extracts used in the in vitro reaction are prepared from E. coli with a resident terminus sequence containing plasmid. From these observations we conclude that the termination of replication in vitro is identical or very similar to that observed in vivo, membrane association is not necessary for the activity of the replication terminus and the terminus sequence does not code for a transacting factor necessary for termination of replication. Therefore, any transacting factor which may be needed for the termination of replication must be coded by the host chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W70062644,"Incubation of Escherichia coli initiation factor 3 (IF3) with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) followed by reduction with sodium borohydride resulted in the selective modification and inactivation of this protein. The ribosomal-binding site (RNA-binding site) of IF3 is the target of PLP modification, since (a) the phosphate residue of PLP is required for inactivation; (b) RNA as well as synthetic polynucleotides (especially guanine-containing one) protect IF3 from inactivation; and (c) 30 S, but not 50 S ribosomal subunits, protect IF3 from PLP modification and from inactivation. The incorporation of PLP into IF3 occurred exclusively at lysine residues by reduction of the Schiff bases yielding epsilon-(5'-phosphopyridoxyl)lysine. The PLP-modified lysines were identified by amino acid analysis and sequencing of the PLP-modified peptides. Out of the 20 lysines of the factor, only Lys 2, Lys 5, Lys 99, Lys 112, Lys 166, and an unidentified Lys of the central cluster of the molecule (Lys 86, 87, 90, 91, 96) were found to be modified to varying degrees. The incorporation of 3 to 4 mol of PLP/mol of IF3 is accompanied by a substantial (greater than or equal to 80%) inactivation of this protein; the loss of activity follows apparent first order kinetics, and the inactivation results from the modification of just 1 Lys residue. This essential Lys residue was identified by various criteria to be Lys 112. The identification of an active region in the IF3 molecule is emerging from this as well as from other chemical modification studies."
https://openalex.org/W1653788241,"The in vitro biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside taxiphyllin has recently been demonstrated in Triglochin maritima (Hosel, W., and Nahrstedt, A. (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 203, 753-757). We have now studied in more detail the multistep conversion of tyrosine into p-hydroxymandelonitrile, the immediate precursor of taxiphyllin, catalyzed by microsomes isolated from dark-grown seedlings. The biosynthetic pathway involves N-hydroxytyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime, and p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile. In marked contrast to an analogous pathway in Sorghum bicolor, p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile is the best substrate for cyanide production (Vmax = 224 nmol/h/g, fresh wt) and the physiological substrate tyrosine is the poorest (Vmax = 18.8 nmol/h/g, fresh wt). The substrates exhibit alkaline pH optima between 7.5 and 9, and all except tyrosine show pronounced substrate inhibition. We have found that p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile generated in situ from tyrosine is free to equilibrate by diffusion with exogenous material. On the other hand, neither N-hydroxytyrosine nor p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime will readily exchange with exogenous intermediates. We consider both N-hydroxytyrosine and p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime to be channeled in T. maritima, whereas in S. bicolor N-hydroxytyrosine and p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile are channeled and the aldoxime is freely exchangeable."

https://openalex.org/W1608556748,"In the cyclorrhaphid flies, exoskeletal proteins from the last larval instar cross-link by arylation and glycosylation to form the sclerotized puparial case. Cuticular proteins from maggots killed just prior to tanning were resolved into 21 soluble components by isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Isoelectric points ranged from pH 4.5 to 6.0, molecular weights were distributed between Mr = 16,000 and 24,000. Aspartic and glutamic acids, glycine, serine, valine, and lysine were abundant in all the proteins while sulfur-containing residues were uniformly absent. Heterogeneity was manifest among NH2 termini of the soluble fractions, while the insoluble chitin-linked protein showed only aspartic acid in this position. The sclerotized matrix was assembled by a concerted bridging of protomers without accumulation of di-, tri-, or higher n-mers in the urea-soluble fraction. This mechanism was also favored by uniform distribution of the bridge precursor, [7-14C]dopamine, among the individual larval protomers including the polypeptide bound to chitin. Following administration of isotopic catecholamine 2 to 10 h prior to sclerotization, unbridged larval cuticle retained 3% of the radioactivity, puparial and adult in integument 7% and 18%, respectively. Proteolytic digestion afforded labeled peptides with molecular weights in register with the degree of cross-linking. Nonradioactive larval proteins did not incorporate labeled dopamine and exchange incubation of labeled proteins with nonisotopic precursor failed to diminish recoveries of 14C. Since protein synthesis was low as assessed by minimal incorporation of [3H]leucine, metabolites derived from dopamine may have been added after translation in the course of presclerotal activation of the polypeptides destined for cross-linking."

https://openalex.org/W1543696054,"Repressor protein modified with N-ethylmaleimide has been used to determine the exclusive effects of tyrosine nitration by tetranitromethane. Since modification of proteins with tetranitromethane generally results in both cysteine oxidation and tyrosine nitration, N-ethylmaleimide has been used to protect the cysteines in the repressor against oxidation in subsequent tetranitromethane reactions. Nitration of tyrosine residues in repressor previously reacted with N-ethylmaleimide results in loss of both specific and nonspecific DNA-binding activities. Na2S2O4 reduction of tetranitromethane-modified protein restores partial operator DNA-binding and complete nonspecific DNA-binding capability. Residues primarily affected are tyrosines 7 and 17, which are both in the NH2 terminus. Inter- and intramolecular cross-links which are observed in the modified protein can be minimized by altering reaction conditions; the cross-links present occur between sites located in the NH2 termini. Modification of the core protein also results in loss of the operator DNA-binding capacity, and subsequent reduction restores partial operator-binding activity. Both operator and nonspecific DNA-binding capabilities of the repressor protein are protected by the presence of nonspecific DNA during the tetranitromethane modification, and simultaneously the extent of nitration is decreased."

https://openalex.org/W1522356554,"In an approach to the study of phospholipid-protein interactions in biological membranes, the photoactivable fatty acids, omega-(m-azidophenoxy)-undecanoic acid (I) and omega-(m-diazirinophenoxy)-hexadecanoic acid (II), were incorporated biosynthetically into the phospholipids of the Escherichia coli fatty acid auxotroph, strain K1060-B5. The extent of incorporation of the two fatty acids was 43% and 21%, respectively, of the total fatty acid content of the phospholipids. Membrane vesicles prepared from cells grown on the fatty acid supplements and [32P]H3PO4 were irradiated at suitable wavelengths to generate the reactive nitrene or carbene intermediates. Subsequent analysis of solubilized membrane proteins by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated cross-linking between radioactive phospholipids and an number of proteins. A corresponding experiment with cells grown on oleic acid showed only trace amounts of covalently cross-linked phospholipid-protein adducts. While the extent of cross-linking in vesicles from cells grown on I was only 3 times the background level observed for oleic acid-grown cells, cells grown on II showed 30 times this amount. The present results, together with the previously observed nonreactivity of the nitrene generated from I to undergo C-H insertion, show that the use of carbene precursors such as II is promising for chemical analysis of specific phospholipid-protein interactions in bacterial membranes under biologically meaningful conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1623488384,"Chemical modification of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase using the group-specific reagent, ethoxyformic anhydride, has demonstrated that 3 histidyl residues/subunit are modified with a concomitant loss of enzyme activity. Reaction with [14C]ethoxyformic anhydride indicates that only three ethoxyformyl groups are incorporated per subunit, confirming that no other amino acid residues are modified under these conditions. Zinc ions protect alkaline phosphatase from inactivation as well as from histidine modification, thus implicating all 3 histidyl residues in Zn2+ binding. The ethoxyformylation reaction was also used to characterize Zn2+ binding sites in immobilized dimeric and monomeric alkaline phosphatase derivatives. The immobilized dimeric alkaline phosphatase was inactivated with ethoxyformic anhydride at a rate similar to that of the soluble enzyme, demonstrating that immobilization did not significantly alter the chemical environment of the Zn2+ binding site. The catalytically inactive, immobilized monomer of alkaline phosphatase was modified more rapidly with ethoxyformic anhydride, demonstrated by the loss of its ability to form functionally active enzyme upon titration with nascent soluble subunits. Moreover, Zn2+ protects the immobilized subunit alkaline phosphatase against this modification, indicating that the isolated subunits of alkaline phosphatase bind Zn2+. These results are consistent with a model for renaturation of the dimeric enzyme in which individual subunits refold and bind Zn2+ before which individual subunits refold and bind Zn2+ before establishing subunit interactions to regain catalytic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1662437659,"A 9-fold increase in the rate of conversion of [14C]-acetate to nonsaponifiable lipids was seen on culturing explants of pregnant rabbit mammary gland in the presence of insulin, prolactin, and cortisol. Stimulation of [3H]mevalonate into nonsaponifiable lipid was 3-fold under the same conditions. With both substrates activities were maximal after 24 h in culture. Incorporation of acetate into saponifiable lipid was stimulated 20-fold after 24 h and almost 50-fold after 48 h in the presence of hormones. Radioactivity from [3H]mevalonate was incorporated into saponifiable lipid after 48 h in culture with hormones suggesting an active trans-methyl-glutaconyl shunt at this time. Changes in the rate of acetate conversion to nonsaponifiable lipid correlated well with the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) in the glands of mid-pregnant and mid-lactating rabbits. Enzyme activity rose from 3.3 pmol/min/mg of 100,000 X g pellet protein in the mid-pregnant gland to an apparent value of 15.6 pmol/min/mg of 100,000 X g pellet protein in the lactating gland. When corrected for the very high content of milk protein in this 100,000 X g pellet, the HMG-CoA reductase activity was 36-fold greater in lactating compared to pregnant mammary gland. Hepatic reductase in both pregnant and lactating animals was approximately 25 pmol/min/mg of microsomal protein. This increase in capacity for sterol synthesis in mammary gland during the transition from pregnancy to lactation suggests that this tissue could synthesize a major proportion of milk sterol."
