https://openalex.org/W2931575838,"The domestication of wild emmer wheat led to the selection of modern durum wheat, grown mainly for pasta production. We describe the 10.45 gigabase (Gb) assembly of the genome of durum wheat cultivar Svevo. The assembly enabled genome-wide genetic diversity analyses revealing the changes imposed by thousands of years of empirical selection and breeding. Regions exhibiting strong signatures of genetic divergence associated with domestication and breeding were widespread in the genome with several major diversity losses in the pericentromeric regions. A locus on chromosome 5B carries a gene encoding a metal transporter (TdHMA3-B1) with a non-functional variant causing high accumulation of cadmium in grain. The high-cadmium allele, widespread among durum cultivars but undetected in wild emmer accessions, increased in frequency from domesticated emmer to modern durum wheat. The rapid cloning of TdHMA3-B1 rescues a wild beneficial allele and demonstrates the practical use of the Svevo genome for wheat improvement. Genome assembly of durum wheat cultivar Svevo enables genome-wide genetic diversity analyses highlighting modifications imposed by thousands of years of empirical selection and breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2927777239,"Understanding normal brain aging and developing methods to maintain or improve cognition in older adults are major goals of fundamental and translational neuroscience. Here we show a core feature of cognitive decline-working-memory deficits-emerges from disconnected local and long-range circuits instantiated by theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in temporal cortex and theta phase synchronization across frontotemporal cortex. We developed a noninvasive stimulation procedure for modulating long-range theta interactions in adults aged 60-76 years. After 25 min of stimulation, frequency-tuned to individual brain network dynamics, we observed a preferential increase in neural synchronization patterns and the return of sender-receiver relationships of information flow within and between frontotemporal regions. The end result was rapid improvement in working-memory performance that outlasted a 50 min post-stimulation period. The results provide insight into the physiological foundations of age-related cognitive impairment and contribute to groundwork for future non-pharmacological interventions targeting aspects of cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2930154557,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in the immune response to cancer, but the mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment controls TAMs and T cell immunity are not completely understood. Here we report that kynurenine produced by glioblastoma cells activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in TAMs to modulate their function and T cell immunity. AHR promotes CCR2 expression, driving TAM recruitment in response to CCL2. AHR also drives the expression of KLF4 and suppresses NF-κB activation in TAMs. Finally, AHR drives the expression of the ectonucleotidase CD39 in TAMs, which promotes CD8+ T cell dysfunction by producing adenosine in cooperation with CD73. In humans, the expression of AHR and CD39 was highest in grade 4 glioma, and high AHR expression was associated with poor prognosis. In summary, AHR and CD39 expressed in TAMs participate in the regulation of the immune response in glioblastoma and constitute potential targets for immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2950554370,"The value of an anticipated rewarding event is a crucial component of the decision to engage in its pursuit. But little is known of the networks responsible for encoding and retrieving this value. By using biosensors and pharmacological manipulations, we found that basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic activity tracks and mediates encoding and retrieval of the state-dependent incentive value of a palatable food reward. Projection-specific, bidirectional chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations revealed that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) supports the BLA in these processes. Critically, the function of ventrolateral and medial OFC→BLA projections is doubly dissociable. Whereas lateral OFC→BLA projections are necessary and sufficient for encoding of the positive value of a reward, medial OFC→BLA projections are necessary and sufficient for retrieving this value from memory. These data reveal a new circuit for adaptive reward valuation and pursuit and provide insight into the dysfunction in these processes that characterizes myriad psychiatric diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2928561368,"Silencing of the somatic cell type-specific genes is a critical yet poorly understood step in reprogramming. To uncover pathways that maintain cell identity, we performed a reprogramming screen using inhibitors of chromatin factors. Here, we identify acetyl-lysine competitive inhibitors targeting the bromodomains of coactivators CREB (cyclic-AMP response element binding protein) binding protein (CBP) and E1A binding protein of 300 kDa (EP300) as potent enhancers of reprogramming. These inhibitors accelerate reprogramming, are critical during its early stages and, when combined with DOT1L inhibition, enable efficient derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with OCT4 and SOX2. In contrast, catalytic inhibition of CBP/EP300 prevents iPSC formation, suggesting distinct functions for different coactivator domains in reprogramming. CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition decreases somatic-specific gene expression, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and chromatin accessibility at target promoters and enhancers. The master mesenchymal transcription factor PRRX1 is one such functionally important target of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition. Collectively, these results show that CBP/EP300 bromodomains sustain cell-type-specific gene expression and maintain cell identity."
https://openalex.org/W2938417878,"Most deciduous fruit trees cultivated in the temperate zone require a genotype-dependent amounts of chilling exposure for dormancy release and bud break. In Japanese apricot (Prunus mume), DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box 6 (PmDAM6) may influence chilling-mediated dormancy release and bud break. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the biological functions of PmDAM6 related to dormancy regulation by analyzing PmDAM6-overexpressing transgenic apple (Malus spp.). We generated 35S:PmDAM6 lines and chemically inducible overexpression lines, 35S:PmDAM6-GR. In both overexpression lines, shoot growth was inhibited and early bud set was observed. In addition, PmDAM6 expression repressed bud break competency during dormancy and delayed bud break. Moreover, PmDAM6 expression increased abscisic acid levels and decreased cytokinins contents during the late dormancy and bud break stages in both 35S:PmDAM6 and 35S:PmDAM6-GR. Our analysis also suggested that abscisic acid levels increased during dormancy but subsequently decreased during dormancy release whereas cytokinins contents increased during the bud break stage in dormant Japanese apricot buds. We previously revealed that PmDAM6 expression is continuously down-regulated during dormancy release toward bud break in Japanese apricot. The PmDAM6 expression pattern was concurrent with a decrease and increase in the abscisic acid and cytokinins contents, respectively, in dormant Japanese apricot buds. Therefore, we hypothesize that PmDAM6 represses the bud break competency during dormancy and bud break stages in Japanese apricot by modulating abscisic acid and cytokinins accumulation in dormant buds."
https://openalex.org/W2938637279,"Negative symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with significant burden and possess little to no robust treatments in clinical practice today. One key obstacle impeding the development of better treatment methods is the lack of an objective measure. Since negative symptoms almost always adversely affect speech production in patients, speech dysfunction have been considered as a viable objective measure. However, researchers have mostly focused on the verbal aspects of speech, with scant attention to the non-verbal cues in speech. In this paper, we have explored non-verbal speech cues as objective measures of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. We collected an interview corpus of 54 subjects with schizophrenia and 26 healthy controls. In order to validate the non-verbal speech cues, we computed the correlation between these cues and the NSA-16 ratings assigned by expert clinicians. Significant correlations were obtained between these non-verbal speech cues and certain NSA indicators. For instance, the correlation between Turn Duration and Restricted Speech is -0.5, Response time and NSA Communication is 0.4, therefore indicating that poor communication is reflected in the objective measures, thus validating our claims. Moreover, certain NSA indices can be classified into observable and non-observable classes from the non-verbal speech cues by means of supervised classification methods. In particular the accuracy for Restricted speech quantity and Prolonged response time are 80% and 70% respectively. We were also able to classify healthy and patients using non-verbal speech features with 81.3% accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2936452997,"Information on genetic diversity and population structure are very important in any breeding programme for the improvement of traits of interest and the development of outstanding products for commercialization. In the present study, we assessed the genetic diversity of 94 early-maturing white and yellow tropical maize inbred lines using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The larger number of SNP markers used in this study allowed a clearer inference of the population structure of the 94 inbred lines. Cluster analysis resolved the inbred lines into different clusters based on their pedigree, selection history and endosperm colour. However, three heterotic groups were revealed by population structure analysis, but additional field evaluation could be more informative to confirm the heterotic groups identified. Nevertheless, wide genetic variability existed among the inbred lines making them unique with the potential to contribute new beneficial alleles to maize breeding programmes in the tropics, especially in the West and Central Africa (WCA) sub-region."
https://openalex.org/W2936464900,"Maternal mortality is among the most important public health concerns in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is limited data on hospital-based maternal mortality in Tanzania. The objective of this study was to determine the causes and maternal mortality trends in public hospitals of Tanzania from 2006-2015.This retrospective study was conducted between July and December 2016 and involved 34 public hospitals in Tanzania. Information on causes of deaths due to pregnancy and delivery complications among women of child-bearing age (15-49 years old) recorded for the period of 2006-2015 was extracted. Data sources included inpatient and death registers and International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 report forms. Maternal deaths were classified based on case definition by ICD 10 and categorized as direct and indirect causes. A total of 40,052 deaths of women of child-bearing age were recorded. There were 1,987 maternal deaths representing 5·0% of deaths of all women aged 15-49 years. The median age-at-death was 27 years (interquartile range: 22, 33). The average age-at-death increased from 25 years in 2006 to 29 years in 2015. Two thirds (67.1%) of the deaths affected women aged 20-34 years old. The number of deaths associated with teenage pregnancy (15-19 years) declined significantly (p-value<0·001) from 17.8% in 2006-2010 to 11.1% in 2011-2015. The proportion of deaths among 30-34 and 35-39 years old (all together) increased from 13% in 2006-2010 to 15·3% in 2011-2015 (p-value = 0.081). Hospital-based maternal mortality ratio increased from 40.24 (2006) to 57.94/100000 births in 2015. Of the 1,987 deaths, 83.8% were due to direct causes and 16.2% were due to indirect causes. Major direct causes were eclampsia (34.0%), obstetric haemorrhage (24.6%) and maternal sepsis (16.7%). Anaemia (14.9%) and cardiovascular disorders (14.0%) were the main indirect causes. Causes of maternal deaths were highly related; being attributed to up to three direct causes (0.12%). Cardiovascular disorders and anaemia had strong linkage with haemorrhage. While there was a decline in the number of deaths due to eclampsia and abortion, those due to haemorrhage and cardiovascular disoders increased during the period.During the ten year period (2006-2015) there was an increase in the number of hospital maternal deaths in public hospitals in Tanzania. Maternal deaths accounted for 5% of all women of child-bearing age in-hospital mortalities. Most maternal deaths were due to direct causes including eclampsia, haemorrhage and sepsis. The findings of this study provide evidence for better planning and policy formulation for reproductive health programmes to reduce maternal deaths in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W2938849049,"Chlorothalonil is a thiol-reactive antifoulant that disperses widely and has been found in the marine environment. However, there is limited information on the deleterious effects of chlorothalonil in marine mollusks. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chlorothalonil on the gill tissues of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis after exposure to different concentrations of chlorothalonil (0.1, 1, and 10 μg L−1) for 96 h. Following exposure to 1 and/or 10 μg L−1 of chlorothalonil, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly increased in the gill tissues of C. gigas and M. edulis compared to that in the control group at 96 h. Similarly, glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly affected in both bivalves after chlorothalonil exposure. The chlorothalonil treatment caused a significant time- and concentration-dependent increase in the activity of enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR), in the antioxidant defense system. Furthermore, 10 μg L−1 of chlorothalonil resulted in significant inhibitions in the enzymatic activity of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). These results suggest that chlorothalonil induces potential oxidative stress and changes in osmoregulation and the cholinergic system in bivalve gill tissues. This information will be a useful reference for the potential toxicity of chlorothalonil in marine bivalves."
https://openalex.org/W2939241625,"Epidemiological and clinical studies compellingly documented the ability of Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) to reduce breast and colon cancers incidence, cardiovascular diseases, and aging cognitive functions decline. (-)-Oleocanthal (OC) and other EVOO phenolics gain progressive research attention due to their documented biological effects against cancer, inflammations, and Alzheimer's disease. There is no simple, reliable, and cost-effective isolation protocol for EVOO phenolics, which hinder their therapeutic applications. This study develops novel methods to isolate OC and other EVOO phenolics. This includes the use of ultra-freezing to eliminate most EVOO fats and the successful water capacity to efficiently extract OC and EVOO phenolics as self-emulsified nano-emulsion. Subsequent resin entrapment and size exclusion chromatography afforded individual EVOO phenolics in high purity. OC in vitro and in vivo oral anti-breast cancer (BC) activities validated its lead candidacy. Effective isolation of EVOO phenolics provided in this study will facilitate future preclinical and clinical investigations and stimulate the therapeutic development of these important bioactive natural products."
https://openalex.org/W2931332774,"Protein phosphorylation regulates key processes in all organisms. In Gram-positive bacteria, protein arginine phosphorylation plays a central role in protein quality control by regulating transcription factors and marking aberrant proteins for degradation. Here, we report structural, biochemical, and in vivo data of the responsible kinase, McsB, the founding member of an arginine-specific class of protein kinases. McsB differs in structure and mechanism from protein kinases that act on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and instead has a catalytic domain related to that of phosphagen kinases (PhKs), metabolic enzymes that phosphorylate small guanidino compounds. In McsB, the PhK-like phosphotransferase domain is structurally adapted to target protein substrates and is accompanied by a novel phosphoarginine (pArg)-binding domain that allosterically controls protein kinase activity. The identification of distinct pArg reader domains in this study points to a remarkably complex signaling system, thus challenging simplistic views of bacterial protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2937301722,"Aims Increased visceral adipose tissue and dysbiosis in the overweight and obese promote chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the gut-adipose tissue cross-talk in obese Zucker rats. Methods Obese male Zucker rats (n = 36) were divided in three groups: MICT (12m.min-1 for 51min), HIIT (6 sets at 18 m.min-1 for 4min followed by 3min at 10m.min-1) and controls (CONT; no exercise). The animals ran on a treadmill 5 days/week for 10 weeks. Body composition, glycaemic control, lipid profile, inflammation, lipolysis signalling in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, intestinal permeability (tight junctions and plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein; LBP), and gut microbiota composition were assessed in the three groups. Results After 10 weeks of exercise, total and epididymal fat mass decreased only in the HIIT group. The α/β adrenergic receptor RNA ratio in subcutaneous adipose tissue increased only in the HIIT group. The expression level of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase was not modified by training. Both HIIT and MICT decreased inflammation (plasma myeloperoxidase and keratinocyte-derived chemokine secretion in adipose tissue) and improved glucose metabolism. Zonula occludens-1 and occludin were upregulated in the HIIT group. Plasma LBP was similarly reduced in both training groups. HIIT and MICT did not affect gut microbiota composition. Conclusion In obese Zucker rats, HIIT and MICT improved inflammation and glucose metabolism. In contrast, only HIIT decreased total and visceral fat mass. These adaptations were not associated with modifications in gut microbiota composition."
https://openalex.org/W2937482717,"Traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a condition leading to the collapse of the femoral head, and the primary treatment is a total hip replacement, which has a poor prognosis. The current study was conducted with the aim of investigating the role of exosomes from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) carrying microRNA-224-3p (miR-224-3p) in traumatic ONFH. Initially, a microarray analysis was performed to screen the differentially expressed genes and miRs associated with traumatic ONFH. Patients with traumatic and nontraumatic ONFH were enrolled, and HUVECs were obtained. The BM-MSCs-derived exosomes were purified and characterized, after which HUVECs were cocultured with exosomes. The functional role of miR-224-3p in traumatic ONFH was determined using ectopic expression, depletion, and reporter assay experiments. Endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion abilities, and angiogenesis were evaluated. Based on microarray analysis, miR-224-3p was found to be down-regulated, whereas focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) was up-regulated in ONFH. Traumatic ONFH exosomes resulted in the up-regulation of FIP200 and down-regulation of miR-224-3p. FIP200 was confirmed to be a target gene of miR-224-3p. Exosomes were internalized by vascular endothelial cells. The down-regulation of exosomal miR-224-3p was observed to promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion abilities, angiogenesis, and FIP200 expression. In addition, FIP200 overexpression promoted angiogenesis. In summary, the results highly indicated that lower miR-224-3p levels in exosomes derived from BM-MSCs promote angiogenesis of traumatic ONFH by up-regulating FIP200. The present study provides a potential strategy for the treatment of traumatic ONFH.—Xu, H.-J., Liao, W., Liu, X.-Z., Hu, J., Zou, W.-Z., Ning, Y., Yang, Y., Li, Z.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2939572941,"The battle against malaria has been substantially impeded by the recurrence of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest human malaria parasite. To counter the problem, novel antimalarial drugs are urgently needed, especially those that target unique pathways of the parasite, since they are less likely to have side effects. The mitochondrial type II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2) of P. falciparum, PfNDH2 (PF3D7_0915000), has been considered a good prospective antimalarial drug target for over a decade, since malaria parasites lack the conventional multi-subunit NADH dehydrogenase, or Complex I, present in the mammalian mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC). Instead, Plasmodium parasites contain a single subunit NDH2, which lacks proton pumping activity and is absent in humans. A significant amount of effort has been expended to develop PfNDH2 specific inhibitors, yet the essentiality of PfNDH2 has not been convincingly verified. Herein, we knocked out PfNDH2 in P. falciparum via a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated approach. Deletion of PfNDH2 does not alter the parasite’s susceptibility to multiple mtETC inhibitors, including atovaquone and ELQ-300. We also show that the antimalarial activity of the fungal NDH2 inhibitor HDQ and its new derivative CK-2-68 is due to inhibition of the parasite cytochrome bc1 complex rather than PfNDH2. These compounds directly inhibit the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of the malarial bc1 complex. Our results suggest that PfNDH2 is not likely a good antimalarial drug target."
https://openalex.org/W2896032654,"In a Quantum Walk (QW) the “walker” follows all possible paths at once through the principle of quantum superposition, differentiating itself from classical random walks where one random path is taken at a time. This facilitates the searching of problem solution spaces faster than with classical random walks, and holds promise for advances in dynamical quantum simulation, biological process modelling and quantum computation. Here we employ a versatile and scalable resonator configuration to realise quantum walks with bright classical light. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing a variety of QWs, all with the same experimental platform, while the use of a resonator allows for an arbitrary number of steps without scaling the number of optics. This paves the way for future QW implementations with spatial modes of light in free-space that are both versatile and scalable."
https://openalex.org/W2935915438,"Both obesity and the metabolic syndrome have been independently associated with increased asthma morbidity. However, it is unclear whether metabolic syndrome limits the beneficial effects of weight loss on asthma.To evaluate whether bariatric weight loss is associated with improved asthma control, and whether this association varies by metabolic syndrome status.We determined the changes in asthma control, defined by the Asthma Control Test (ACT), before and after bariatric surgery among participants with asthma in the multi-center Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study, stratifying our analysis by the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome.Among 2,458 LABS participants, 555 participants had an asthma diagnosis and were included in our analysis. Of these, 78% (n = 433) met criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) at baseline. In patients without MetSyn, mean ACT increased from 20.4 at baseline to 22.1 by 12-24 months, ending at 21.3 at 60 months. In contrast, among those with MetSyn there was no significant improvement in ACT scores. The proportion of patients without MetSyn with adequate asthma control (ACT >19) increased from 58% at baseline to 78% and 82% at 12 and 60 months, respectively, whereas among those with MetSyn, it was 73.8% at baseline, 77.1% at 12 months, dropping to 47.1% at 60 months (p = 0.004 for interaction between metabolic syndrome and time). Having MetSyn also increased the likelihood of losing asthma control during follow-up (HR = 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-2.97, p = 0.003).Metabolic syndrome may negatively modify the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on asthma control."
https://openalex.org/W2936179968,"Women remain highly vulnerable to HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, with female sex workers (FSWs) facing some of the highest rates of HIV. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to reduce new infections among populations at highest risk and end-user perspectives of actual use in ‘real-world’ settings are critical to informing PrEP implementation. This paper presents findings from serial in-depth interviews (IDIs) conducted with FSW participants during the course of the Treatment And Prevention for Sex workers (TAPS) Demonstration Project in South Africa, exploring the lived experiences and perceptions of taking up and using PrEP. This research provides insight into risks and responsibilities facing FSWs perceived as prominent drivers in taking up and using PrEP, how PrEP was adopted to mitigate risk or ameliorate realities, and the characteristics of PrEP most valued, all of which are critical to consider in scale-up. Overall, distrust in the existence and/or efficacy of PrEP affected the motivation of women to come to the clinic and to maintain use. As one of the first reports of PrEP use among FSWs outside of a clinical trial setting, this research shows that it will be important to ensure accurate, relevant, and widespread messaging in communities to generate demand and support for PrEP."
https://openalex.org/W2938270682,"Dioecy has evolved recently and independently from cosexual populations in many angiosperm lineages, providing opportunities to understand the evolutionary process underlying this transition. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a dioecious plant with homomorphic sex chromosomes (XY). Although most of the spinach Y chromosome recombines with the X chromosome, a region around the male-determining locus on Y does not recombine with its X counterpart, suggesting that this region might be related to the evolution of dioecy in the species. To identify genes located in the non-recombining region (MSY, male-specific region of Y), RNA-seq analysis of male and female progeny plants (eight each) from a sib-cross of a dioecious line was performed. We discovered only 354 sex-chromosomal SNPs in 219 transcript sequences (genes). We randomly selected 39 sex-chromosomal genes to examine the reproducibility of the RNA-seq results and observed tight linkage to the male-determining locus in a spinach segregating population (140 individuals). Further analysis using a large-scale population (>1400) and over 100 spinach germplasm accessions and cultivars showed that SNPs in at least 12 genes are fully linked to the male-determining locus, suggesting that the genes reside in the spinach MSY. Synonymous substitution rates of the MSY genes and X homologues predict a recent divergence (0.40 ± 0.08 Mya). Furthermore, synonymous divergence between spinach and its wild relative (S. tetrandra), whose sex chromosomes (XY) originated from a common ancestral chromosome, predicted that the species diverged around 5.7 Mya. Assuming that dioecy in Spinacia evolved before speciation within the genus and has a monophyletic origin, our data suggest that recombination around the spinach sex-determining locus might have stopped significantly later than the evolution of dioecy in Spinacia."
https://openalex.org/W2938930273,"Tight junctions are dynamic structures that are crucial in establishing the diffusion and electrical barrier of epithelial monolayers. Dysfunctions in the tight junctions can impede this barrier function and lead to many pathological conditions. Unfortunately, detailed understanding of the non-specific permeation pathway through the tight junctions, the so-called leak pathway, is lacking. We created computational models of the leak pathway to describe the two main barrier measures, molecular permeability and transepithelial electric resistance while using common structural dynamics. Our results showed that the proposed alternatives for the leak pathway, the bicellular strand opening dynamics and the tricellular pores, contribute together with distinct degrees, depending on the epithelium. The models can also capture changes in the tight junction barrier caused by changes in tight junction protein composition. In addition, we observed that the molecular permeability was markedly more sensitive to changes in the tight junction structure and strand dynamics compared with transepithelial electric resistance. The results highlight that our model creates a good methodological framework to integrate knowledge on the tight junction structure as well as to provide insights and tools to advance tight junction research."
https://openalex.org/W2937754038,"Resistance to antimicrobials is one of the biggest challenges worldwide for public health. A key strategy for tackling this is ensuring judicious use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine. Whilst there are many studies in human medicine investigating prescribing behaviour of doctors, there is limited work to understand what factors influence veterinarian prescribing behaviour. Veterinarians often prescribe antimicrobials to sheep and beef farmers in contexts other than at a clinical consultation, and decision-making behind this has not been explored. The aim of this study was to measure, for the first time, the influence of factors from social theories on veterinarians’ decision to prescribe antimicrobials to sheep and beef farmers without a clinical consultation, using a factorial survey approach. Respondents were presented with eight vignette scenarios, where a farmer asks for antimicrobials at the veterinary practice. Seven factors, identified from constructs of social theories, were included in the vignettes. Random intercept and random slope models were built to estimate the effects of the vignette factors and vet characteristics on the respondents’ willingness to prescribe ratings. A total of 306 surveys were completed. The vignette factors: case type, farmer relationship, other veterinarians in practice, time pressure, habit, willingness to pay, and confidence in the farmer, were significant in the decision to prescribe. Confidence in the farmer was the most influential vignette variable, and was included as a random slope effect. Respondent variables with significant influence on the decision to prescribe were agreeableness personality score, region of veterinary practice, and presence of a small animal department. These influential factors could be considered to target interventions in beef and sheep farm animal veterinary practice for improved antimicrobial stewardship."
https://openalex.org/W2951702794,"This study examined factors contributing to temporal variability (2009-2017) in total mercury (THg) concentrations in aquatic bird eggs collected in the Peace-Athabasca Delta and Lake Athabasca in northern Alberta. Factors examined included year of egg collection, site of collection, bird species, bird diets, annual surface-mineable oil sands production, forest fires, and flow of the Athabasca River. Surface mining activities associated with Alberta's Athabasca oil sands are situated north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, adjacent to the northward-flowing Athabasca River. Previous studies have found that oil sands industrial operations release mercury into the local (within ~50 km) environment. An information-theoretic approach revealed that the best model for explaining egg THg levels included Athabasca River flow, bird food source, and bird species. Variability in egg THg levels was partly a reflection of differences in food sources, e.g. proportions of aquatic versus terrestrial food in bird diets. Annual fluctuations in maximal flow of the Athabasca River were also important with eggs collected following years of high maximal flow exhibiting higher THg concentrations. Furthermore, eggs collected in years of high versus low flow differed in their stable Hg isotope composition with less mass-independent fraction of 199Hg and 201Hg in years of high flow. Riverine processes associated with suspended sediment were likely critical in regulating Hg availability to nesting birds. This study highlights the importance of the Athabasca River as a conduit for Hg transport to ecologically-sensitive downstream ecosystems such as the Peace-Athabasca Delta and Wood Buffalo National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Human activities that increase atmospheric Hg deposition to the Athabasca River watershed, or that enhance Hg releases to the river through erosion of Hg-bearing soils, will likely increase the availability of Hg to organisms inhabiting downstream areas."
https://openalex.org/W2938237931,"Trace elements and potential toxic elements were analyzed in bovine livers submitted for autopsy in the Netherlands during the years 2007 to 2018. The age of each animal was recorded. In total, 1544 livers were analyzed for cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, molybdenum, nickel, lead, selenium and zinc. Less than 2% of the liver samples were from veal calves. Young animals had significantly higher concentrations of iron and zinc in their livers compared to animals older than one year, while older animals had significantly higher levels of cadmium and molybdenum in their livers. Animals aged 1 to 2 years had the lowest copper and selenium levels. There was a tendency for lower chromium and nickel levels during the last years of the testing period, while copper showed an increase. Lead intoxication was only seen in the youngest group of cattle, while copper intoxication, defined as a liver copper of more than 1000 mg/kg dry matter, occurred in older animals, mainly in animals of 3 to 4 years old. This trend analysis of trace elements in bovine livers of cattle over time in recent years, and the relation of liver element concentrations with age of the animal, provides insight in the uptake and storage of these elements by cattle in The Netherlands. Possible reasons for observed trends and age-related patterns are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2950987652,"Recurrent neural networks are complex non-linear systems, capable of ongoing activity in the absence of driving inputs. The dynamical properties of these systems, in particular their long-time attractor states, are determined on the microscopic level by the connection strengths wij between the individual neurons. However, little is known to which extent network dynamics is tunable on a more coarse-grained level by the statistical features of the weight matrix. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of recurrent networks of Boltzmann neurons. In particular we study the impact of three statistical parameters: density (the fraction of non-zero connections), balance (the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory connections), and symmetry (the fraction of neuron pairs with wij = wji). By computing a ‘phase diagram’ of network dynamics, we find that balance is the essential control parameter: Its gradual increase from negative to positive values drives the system from oscillatory behavior into a chaotic regime, and eventually into stationary fixed points. Only directly at the border of the chaotic regime do the neural networks display rich but regular dynamics, thus enabling actual information processing. These results suggest that the brain, too, is fine-tuned to the ‘edge of chaos’ by assuring a proper balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural connections."

However, the effects of lncRNAs on the meat quality of chicken hasn’t been elucidated clearly yet. Gushi chickens are popular in China because of their superior meat quality, particularly the tender flesh, and unique flavor. Gushi chickens are popular in China because of their superior meat quality, delicate flesh, and unique flavor. We performed RNA-Seq analysis of breast muscle from Gushi chicken at two physiological stages, including juvenile (G20W) and laying (G55W). In total, 186 lncRNAs and 881 mRNAs were differentially expressed between G20W and G55W (fold change ≥ 2.0, P < 0.05). Among them, 131 lncRNAs presented upregulated and 55 were downregulated. We identified the cis and trans target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs, and constructed lncRNA-mRNA interaction networks. The results showed that differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs were mainly involved in ECM-receptor interaction, glycerophospholipid metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and the biosynthesis of amino acids. In summary, our study utilized RNA-seq analysis to predict the functions of lncRNA on chicken meat quality. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis identified lncRNAs and their target genes, which may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying in poultry meat quality and provide a theoretical basis for further research."
https://openalex.org/W2935830030,"The present work was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary propolis supplementation to laying Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) on egg production, egg quality, physiological and immunological aspects under heat stress conditions. A total of 200, 21-day-old, Japanese quail females were distributed equally into standard wired cages in two identical environmentally-controlled rooms (10 cages per room, 10 birds per cage). From 29-70 d of age, the quail birds in the first room remained at a normal temperature of 24°C (C group), whereas the quail birds in the second room were kept under heat stress at 35°C (HS group). Each group was further assigned to 2 propolis subgroups (5 cages per subgroup); one of them received a basal diet without propolis supplementation (-PR subgroup), while, the other received 1 g propolis/ kg basal diet (+PR subgroup). In the present study, performance and egg production of laying quail were significantly (P<0.001) impaired by HS treatment and improved by the PR treatment. Similarly, the negative and positive effects of HS and PR, respectively, were appeared on the egg shell thickness and yolk index. Stress indicators in laying quail were significantly (P<0.001) increased by HS, while, PR significantly (P<0.05) moderated these levels in the HS+PR group when compared to the HS-PR quail group. In addition to the positive impact of PR on the plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus, and albumin, it also normalized the plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and cholesterol in the heat-stressed quail birds. Moreover, the quail birds in the HS groups expressed lower immunological aspects than those in the C group, while, the addition of propolis to the diets enhanced the immune status of laying quail birds under HS conditions. These results strongly suggest that dietary propolis supplementation could be a successful attempt to maintain the performance and egg production of laying Japanese quail at convenient levels under heat stress conditions."

Fluxapyroxad was diluted 2,000-fold and penthiopyrad was diluted 4,000-fold. Each solution was sprayed 3 times onto crops at 7-d intervals before harvest. Leaf samples were collected at 3 h (0 d), 1, 3, 5 and 7 d after the third and final treatment. The recovery ranges of fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad and their metabolites were 74.2%-104.1%. Pesticide residue analyses indicated that fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad residues in perilla leaves dissipated over time. The persistence of fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad residues 7 d after the final spray were 50.0% ± 4.9% and 44.2% ± 2.8% of those measured 3 h (0 d) after the final spray, respectively. The percent acceptable daily intake (%ADI)-which was assessed according to the daily food intake by Koreans according to age-was < 7.3%. Therefore, it was determined that the health risk was low. The perception that residual pesticides are present in large amounts in perilla leaf has led to consumer concern. However, in this study, the amounts of pesticide in perilla leaf decreased over time. Although it has been hypothesized that the risk of pesticide intake would be higher in younger children, the results actually suggest the opposite. Therefore, the pesticides in question are considered to be safe for use on perilla leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2935738470,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress plays an important role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and atherosclerosis. We aimed to assess the ability of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a small chemical chaperone administered via drinking water, to reduce atherosclerotic lesion size in chow-fed apolipoprotein (Apo) e-/- mice and to identify mechanisms that contribute to its antiatherogenic effect. Chow-fed 17-wk-old female Apoe-/- mice treated with 4-PBA-supplemented drinking water for 5 wk exhibited smaller lesions as well as increased plasma levels of heat shock protein (HSP) 25, the mouse homolog of human HSP27, compared with controls. In addition, 4-PBA inhibited cell death and increased HSP27 expression as measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, as well as induced nuclear localization of its transcription factor, heat shock factor 1, in human monocyte/macrophage (THP-1) cells. Furthermore, HSP27 small interfering RNA diminished the protective effect of 4-PBA on THP-1 macrophage attachment and differentiation. In summary, drinking water containing 4-PBA attenuated early lesion growth in Apoe-/- mice fed a chow diet and increased expression of HSP25 and HSP27 in macrophages and HSP25 in the circulation of Apoe-/- mice. Given that increased expression of HSP27 is inversely correlated with CVD risk, our findings suggest that 4-PBA protects against the early stages of atherogenesis in part by enhancing HSP27 levels, leading to inhibition of both macrophage cell death and monocyte-macrophage differentiation.-Lynn, E.

https://openalex.org/W2939872255,"Rationale As part of the End TB Strategy, the World Health Organization calls for low-tuberculosis (TB) incidence settings to achieve pre-elimination (<10 cases per million) and elimination (<1 case per million) by 2035 and 2050, respectively. These targets require testing and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Objectives To estimate the ability and costs of testing and treatment for LTBI to reach pre-elimination and elimination targets in California. Methods We created an individual-based epidemic model of TB, calibrated to historical cases. We evaluated the effects of increased testing (QuantiFERON-TB Gold) and treatment (three months of isoniazid and rifapentine). We analyzed four test and treat targeting strategies: (1) individuals with medical risk factors (MRF), (2) non-USB, (3) both non-USB and MRF, and (4) all Californians. For each strategy, we estimated the effects of increasing test and treat by a factor of 2, 4, or 10 from the base case. We estimated the number of TB cases occurring and prevented, and net and incremental costs from 2017 to 2065 in 2015 U.S. dollars. Efficacy, costs, adverse events, and treatment dropout were estimated from published data. We estimated the cost per case averted and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Measurements and main results In the base case, 106,000 TB cases are predicted to 2065. Pre-elimination was achieved by 2065 in three scenarios: a 10-fold increase in the non-USB and persons with MRF (by 2052), and 4- or 10-fold increase in all Californians (by 2058 and 2035, respectively). TB elimination was not achieved by any intervention scenario. The most aggressive strategy, 10-fold in all Californians, achieved a case rate of 8 (95% UI 4–16) per million by 2050. Of scenarios that reached pre-elimination, the incremental net cost was $20 billion (non-USB and MRF) to $48 billion. These had an incremental cost per QALY of $657,000 to $3.1 million. A more efficient but somewhat less effective single-lifetime test strategy reached as low as $80,000 per QALY. Conclusions Substantial gains can be made in TB control in coming years by scaling-up current testing and treatment in non-USB and those with medical risks."
https://openalex.org/W2940071312,"High dimensional biomedical data contain tens of thousands of features, accurate and effective identification of the core features in these data can be used to assist diagnose related diseases. However, there are often a large number of irrelevant or redundant features in biomedical data, which seriously affect subsequent classification accuracy and machine learning efficiency. To solve this problem, a novel filter feature selection algorithm based on redundant removal (FSBRR) is proposed to classify high dimensional biomedical data in this paper. First of all, two redundant criteria are determined by vertical relevance (the relationship between feature and class attribute) and horizontal relevance (the relationship between feature and feature). Secondly, to quantify redundant criteria, an approximate redundancy feature framework based on mutual information (MI) is defined to remove redundant and irrelevant features. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, controlled trials based on typical feature selection algorithm are conducted using three different classifiers, and the experimental results indicate that the FSBRR algorithm can effectively reduce the feature dimension and improve the classification accuracy. In addition, an experiment of small sample dataset is designed and conducted in the section of discussion and analysis to clarify the specific implementation process of FSBRR algorithm more clearly."
https://openalex.org/W2937035957,"Background Emergency department (ED) crowding is associated with negative health outcomes, patient dissatisfaction, and longer length of stay (LOS). The addition of advanced diagnostic imaging (ADI), namely CT, ultrasound (U/S), and MRI to ED encounter work up is a predictor of longer length of stay. Earlier and improved prediction of patients’ need for advanced imaging may improve overall ED efficiency. The aim of the study was to detect the association between ADI utilization and the structured and unstructured information immediately available during ED triage, and to develop and validate models to predict utilization of ADI during an ED encounter. Methods We used the United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data from 2009 to 2014 to examine which sociodemographic and clinical factors immediately available at ED triage were associated with the utilization of CT, U/S, MRI, and multiple ADI during a patient’s ED stay. We used natural language processing (NLP) topic modeling to incorporate free-text reason for visit data available at time of ED triage in addition to other structured patient data to predict the use of ADI using multivariable logistic regression models. Results Among the 139,150 adult ED visits from a national probability sample of hospitals across the U.S, 21.9% resulted in ADI use, including 16.8% who had a CT, 3.6% who had an ultrasound, 0.4% who had an MRI, and 1.2% of the population who had multiple types of ADI. The c-statistic of the predictive models was greater than or equal to 0.78 for all imaging outcomes, and the addition of text-based reason for visit information improved the accuracy of all predictive models. Conclusions Patient information immediately available during ED triage can accurately predict the eventual use of advanced diagnostic imaging during an ED visit. Such models have the potential to be incorporated into the ED triage workflow in order to more rapidly identify patients who may require advanced imaging during their ED stay and assist with medical decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2950060748,"Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for malaria are restricted to a few biomarkers and antibody-mediated detection. However, the expression of commonly used biomarkers varies geographically and the sensibility of immunodetection can be affected by batch-to-batch differences or limited thermal stability. In this study we aimed to overcome these limitations by identifying a potential biomarker and by developing molecular sensors based on aptamer technology. Using gene expression databases, ribosome profiling analysis, and structural modeling, we find that the High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) of Plasmodium falciparum is highly expressed, structurally stable, and present along all blood-stages of P. falciparum infection. To develop biosensors, we used in vitro evolution techniques to produce DNA aptamers for the recombinantly expressed HMG-box, the conserved domain of HMGB1. An evolutionary approach for evaluating the dynamics of aptamer populations suggested three predominant aptamer motifs. Representatives of the aptamer families were tested for binding parameters to the HMG-box domain using microscale thermophoresis and rapid kinetics. Dissociation constants of the aptamers varied over two orders of magnitude between nano- and micromolar ranges while the aptamer-HMG-box interaction occurred in a few seconds. The specificity of aptamer binding to the HMG-box of P. falciparum compared to its human homolog depended on pH conditions. Altogether, our study proposes HMGB1 as a candidate biomarker and a set of sensing aptamers that can be further developed into rapid diagnostic tests for P. falciparum detection."

This study examined RV mitochondrial function and ADP transfer in PH animals advancing to right heart failure, and investigated a potential therapy with the specific β1-adrenergic-blocker metoprolol. Adult Wistar rats (317 ± 4 g) were injected either with monocrotaline (MCT, 60 mg kg-1) to induce PH, or with an equivalent volume of saline for controls (CON). At three weeks post-injection the MCT rats began oral metoprolol (10 mg kg-1 day-1-) or placebo treatment until heart failure was observed in the MCT group. Mitochondrial function was then measured using high-resolution respirometry from permeabilised RV fibres. Relative to controls, MCT animals had impaired mitochondrial function but maintained coupling between myofibrillar ATPases and mitochondria, despite an increase in ADP diffusion distances. Cardiomyocytes from the RV of MCT rats were enlarged, primarily due to an increase in myofibrillar protein. The ratio of mitochondria per myofilament area was decreased in both MCT groups (p ≤ 0.05) in comparison to control (CON: 1.03 ± 0.04; MCT: 0.74 ± 0.04; MCT + BB: 0.74 ± 0.03). This not only implicates impaired energy production in PH, but also increases the diffusion distance for metabolites within the MCT cardiomyocytes, adding an additional hindrance to energy supply. Together, these changes may limit energy supply in MCT rat hearts, particularly at high cardiac workloads. Metoprolol treatment did not delay the onset of heart failure symptoms, improve mitochondrial function, or regress RV hypertrophy."

However, few studies have assessed seasonality of TB in the equatorial region, and none in children.To assess for seasonality of childhood TB cases in Kampala, Uganda, and determine the role of temperature, rainfall patterns, and influenza cases on TB diagnoses.We retrospectively analyzed demographic and clinical data of children (under 15 years) diagnosed with TB at a pediatric TB clinic in Kampala, Uganda from 2010 to 2015. We performed decomposition analysis of the monthly case time series to assess seasonality. We compared monthly mean plots and performed Poisson regression to assess any association between TB diagnoses and temperature, rainfall, and influenza.Of the 713 childhood TB cases diagnosed at the clinic, 609 (85%) were clinically diagnosed and 492 (69%) were pulmonary cases. There were minimal monthly variations in TB cases, with a trough in December and peaks in July and October, but there was no significant seasonality. Temperature variations did not show a clear pattern with TB diagnoses. Rainfall alternated with TB diagnoses in the first half of the year, but then overlapped in the second half and was significantly associated with TB diagnoses. Influenza cases were significantly related to TB diagnoses with (β = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09, p = 0.01) or without (β = 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.1, p = 0.01) rainfall, and had particular overlap with pulmonary TB cases.Seasonal variations in childhood TB diagnoses were non-significant. Temperature did not have a clear pattern with TB diagnoses, but rainfall and influenza cases correlated with the primarily clinically diagnosed childhood TB cases."
https://openalex.org/W2935826033,"Triple-Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) are the most difficult to treat subtype of breast cancer and are often associated with high nuclear expression of Snail and Cathepsin L (Cat L) protease. We have previously shown that Snail can increase Cat L expression/activity in prostate and breast cancer cells. This study investigated the role of CUX1 (a downstream substrate of Cat L) in TNBC. We showed that Cat L and CUX1 were highly expressed in TNBC patient tissue/cell lines, as compared to ER-positive samples, using cBioportal data and western blot/zymography analyses. Additionally, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that CUX1 directly bound to estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) promoter in MDA-MB-468, a representative TNBC cell line, and that CUX1 siRNA could restore ER-α transcription and protein expression. Furthermore, Snail and CUX1 expression in various TNBC cell lines was inhibited by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE, a natural grape product rich in anthocyanins) or Cat L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO) leading to decreased cell invasion and migration. MSKE decreased cell viability and increased expression of apoptotic markers in MDA-MB-468 cells, with no effect on non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. MSKE also decreased CUX1 binding to ER-α promoter and restored ER-α expression in TNBC cells, while both MSKE and CUX1 siRNA restored sensitivity to estradiol and 4-hydoxytamoxifen as shown by increased cell viability. Therefore, CUX1 activated by Snail-Cat L signaling may contribute to TNBC via ER-α repression, and may be a viable target for TNBC using natural products such as MSKE that targets cancer and not normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2936614552,"Objective This study aimed to show the epidemiological characteristics and the difference in the risk factors and types of collision between older and younger drivers in Korea. Methods We collected data from the Emergency Department-based Injury In-depth Surveillance retrieved by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2011 to 2015. We included injured drivers aged ≥ 18 years who were registered in the database, who were limited to drivers of four-wheeled vehicles. The enrolled patients were divided according to age into older (≥ 65 years) and younger (< 65 years) drivers. The total number of enrolled drivers was 37,511; 2,361 (6.3%) of them were older drivers. The epidemiological characteristics (e.g., age, sex, fatality rate) of traffic collision victims for 5 years were determined, and the risk factors (e.g., seat belt use) and types of collision (single- vs. multi-vehicle) between the two groups were compared. Results The median age and interquartile range (IQR; 25th and 75th percentiles) of all drivers were 41.0 (IQR, 32.0–52.0), and 24,544 (65.4%) of them were men. The median age increased from 40.0 (IQR, 31.0–50.0) to 43.0 (IQR, 33.0–54.0) between 2010 and 2015 (P < 0.001). The proportion of older drivers increased from 5.0% to 8.4% annually during the study period (P < 0.001). Between 2010 and 2015, the fatality rate decreased from 3.1% to 1.2% (P = 0.287) for older drivers and from 0.9% to 0.5% (P = 0.009) for younger drivers. The proportion of single-vehicle collision (25.9% vs. 20.3%) was higher in older than in younger drivers (P < 0.001). Older drivers had a lower rate of seat-belt use than younger drivers (79.0% vs. 83.0%, P < 0.001). Conclusions The proportion of older drivers increased annually during the study period, and older drivers experienced more single-vehicle collision and used seat belt less frequently than younger drivers. A national policy support to reduce traffic collision in older drivers and public relation activities to enhance their seat belt use should be strengthened in the future."

In this study, we evaluated the effects of GSK3-β inhibition on lung lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition and silencing of GSK3-β resulted in increased lymphangiogenesis of lung lymphatic endothelial cells. To investigate mechanisms of GSK3-β-mediated lymphangiogenesis, we interrogated the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway and found that inhibition of GSK3-β resulted in PTEN activation and subsequent decreased activation of AKT, leading to decreased p-P70S6kinase levels, indicating inhibition of the mTOR pathway. In addition, consistent with a negative role of GSK3-β in β-catenin stability through protein phosphorylation, we found that GSK3-β inhibition resulted in an increase in β-catenin levels. Simultaneous silencing of β-catenin and inhibition of GSK3-β demonstrated that β-catenin is required for GSK3-β-induced lymphangiogenesis."

However, this canonical response can weaken, leading to a spontaneous bypass of the checkpoint, a process referred to as checkpoint adaptation. Here, we have investigated the contribution of microcephalin 1 (MCPH1), mutated in primary microcephaly, to the decatenation checkpoint, a less-understood G2 pathway that delays entry into mitosis until chromosomes are properly disentangled. Our results demonstrate that, although MCPH1 function is dispensable for activation and maintenance of the decatenation checkpoint, it is required for the adaptive response that bypasses the topoisomerase II inhibition----mediated G2 arrest. MCPH1, however, does not confer adaptation to the G2 arrest triggered by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated- and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related-based DNA damage checkpoint. In addition to revealing a new role for MCPH1 in cell cycle control, our study provides new insights into the genetic requirements that allow cellular adaptation to G2 checkpoints, a process that remains poorly understood.-Arroyo, M., Kuriyama, R., Guerrero, I., Keifenheim, D., Cañuelo, A., Calahorra, J., Sánchez, A., Clarke, D.

However, increased threats to it necessitate its conservation, and one common approach is the practice of agroforestry. A number of studies have shown that Shea tree has influence on crop production, and yet, some of these studies were done using single season experiments or bioassays using mature Shea tree components. In this study, the seasonal influence of young and mature Shea trees on Maize and Soybean yields was investigated using field experiments in Otuke district of northern Uganda, where, Shea tree parklands are dominant and Maize and Soybean are used for food security and income. Our results show that there are differential responses of maize and soybean yield to rainy seasons and physiological variations of Vitellaria paradoxa with age. We find yield reduction for maize more pronounced than yield reduction for soybeans under different Shea age (Mature and Young) for two rainy seasons. We attribute the variance to the differential maize and soybean responses to Vitellaria paradoxa shading and its differential allelopathic inhibition of these crops. We recommend that Soybeans should be preferred to maize when planting under Shea canopy."
https://openalex.org/W2937891426,"In this paper we set the previously reported pressure-dependent, ordinary differential equation outflow model by Smith and Gardiner for the human eye, into a new three-dimensional (3D) porous media outflow model of the eye, and calibrate model parameters using data reported in the literature. Assuming normal outflow through anterior pathways, we test the ability of 3D flow model to predict the pressure elevation with a silicone oil tamponade. Then assuming outflow across the retinal pigment epithelium is normal, we test the ability of the 3D model to predict the pressure elevation in Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome. For the first time we find the flow model can successfully model both conditions, which helps to build confidence in the validity and accuracy of the 3D pressure-dependent outflow model proposed here. We employ this flow model to estimate the translaminar pressure gradient within the optic nerve head of a normal eye in both the upright and supine postures, and during the day and at night. Based on a ratio of estimated and measured pressure gradients, we define a factor of safety against acute interruption of axonal transport at the laminar cribrosa. Using a completely independent method, based on the behaviour of dynein molecular motors, we compute the factor of safety against stalling the dynein molecule motors, and so compromising retrograde axonal transport. We show these two independent methods for estimating factors of safety agree reasonably well and appear to be consistent. Taken together, the new 3D pressure-dependent outflow model proves itself to capable of providing a useful modeling platform for analyzing eye behaviour in a variety of physiological and clinically useful contexts, including IOP elevation in Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome and with silicone oil tamponade, and potentially for risk assessment for optic glaucomatous neuropathy."

Our perspective here is to focus on understanding the underlying societal processes behind these recent political shifts. We use novel methods to study social dynamics behind the 2016 Presidential election. This is done by using network science methods to identify key groups associated with the US right-wing during the election. We investigate how the groups grew on Twitter, and how their associated accounts changed their following behaviour over time. We find a new external faction of Trump supporters took a strong influence over the traditional Republican Party (GOP) base during the election campaign. The new group dominated the GOP group in terms of new members and endorsement via Twitter follows. Growth of new accounts for the GOP party all but collapsed during the campaign. While the Alt-right group was growing exponentially, it has remained relatively isolated. Counter to the mainstream view, we detected an unexpectedly low number of automated 'bot' accounts and accounts associated with foreign intervention in the Trump-supporting group. Our work demonstrates a powerful method for tracking the evolution of societal groups and reveals complex social processes behind political changes."

We estimated the HIV incidence and prevalence and assessed the trend using data from three cross-sectional surveys of men who have sex with men (MSM) in two cities in Georgia.Using respondent-driven sampling strategy, a total of 796 eligible MSM (18 years or older men with self-reported oral or anal sex with another man in past 12 months) were recruited in Tbilisi in 2010, 2012 and 2015 and 115 in Batumi 2015 into behavioral surveys and HIV testing. To estimate the HIV incidence, we divided the number MSM tested positive for HIV to the time at risk. We calculated the time at risk as years since age at first anal intercourse to the age at last HIV-negative test or the age at first HIV-positive test, accounted for the interval censorship. We calculated the respondent-driven sampling adjusted estimates for HIV prevalence and assessed the trend in Tbilisi by Chi2 test for trend. For HIV incidence rate, we used Kaplan Meier method to estimate the rates and assessed the subgroup differences by log-rank test.The HIV prevalence was 14.9% in Batumi in 2015; it significantly increased in Tbilisi from 6.2% in 2010 to 14.1% in 2012, and to 19.6% in 2015 (p-value for trend < 0.001). Likewise, the HIV incidence rate in Tbilisi significantly increased form 0.45 per 100 person-years (PY) in 2010 to 0.98 per 100 PY in 2012 (p-value 0.01), and to 1.63 per 100 PY in 2015 (p-value < 0.001).

VSPs catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) that regulate diverse aspects of cell membrane physiology including cell division, growth and migration. VSPs are highly conserved among chordates, and their RNA transcripts have been detected in the adult and embryonic stages of frogs, fish, chickens, mice and humans. However, the subcellular localization and biological function of VSP remains unknown. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), we show that both Xenopus laevis VSPs (Xl-VSP1 and Xl-VSP2) mRNAs are expressed in early embryos, suggesting that both Xl-VSPs are involved in early tadpole development. To understand which embryonic tissues express Xl-VSP mRNA, we used in situ hybridization (ISH) and found Xl-VSP mRNA in both the brain and kidney of NF stage 32-36 embryos. By Western blot analysis with a VSP antibody, we show increasing levels of Xl-VSP protein in the developing embryo, and by immunohistochemistry (IHC), we demonstrate that Xl-VSP protein is specifically localized to the apical membrane of both embryonic and adult kidney tubules. We further characterized the catalytic activity of both Xl-VSP homologs and found that while Xl-VSP1 catalyzes 3- and 5-phosphate removal, Xl-VSP2 is a less efficient 3-phosphatase with different substrate specificity. Our results suggest that Xl-VSP1 and Xl-VSP2 serve different functional roles and that VSPs are an integral component of voltage-dependent PIP signaling pathways during vertebrate kidney tubule development and function."
https://openalex.org/W2935930767,"The central carbon/lactate utilization pathway in the model sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, is encoded by the highly conserved operon DVU3025-3033. Our earlier in vitro genome-wide study had suggested a network of four two-component system regulators that target this large operon; however, how these four regulators control this operon was not known. Here, we probe the regulation of the lactate utilization operon with mutant strains and DNA-protein binding assays. We show that the LurR response regulator is required for optimal growth and complete lactate utilization, and that it activates the DVU3025-3033 lactate oxidation operon as well as DVU2451, a lactate permease gene, in the presence of lactate. We show by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that LurR binds to three sites in the upstream region of DVU3025, the first gene of the operon. NrfR, a response regulator that is activated under nitrite stress, and LurR share similar binding site motifs and bind the same sites upstream of DVU3025. The DVU3025 promoter also has a binding site motif (Pho box) that is bound by PhoB, a two-component response regulator activated under phosphate limitation. The lactate utilization operon, the regulator LurR, and LurR binding sites are conserved across the order Desulfovibrionales whereas possible modulation of the lactate utilization genes by additional regulators such as NrfR and PhoB appears to be limited to D. vulgaris."
https://openalex.org/W2936296995,"In the search for new pharmaceutical leads, especially with DNA-binding molecules or genome editing methods, the issue of side and off-target effects have always been thorny in nature. A particular case is the investigation into the off-target effects of N-methylpyrrole-N-methylimidazole polyamides, a naturally inspired class of DNA binders with strong affinity to the minor-groove and sequence specificity, but at < 20 bases, their relatively short motifs also insinuate the possibility of non-unique genomic binding. Binding at non-intended loci potentially lead to the rise of off-target effects, issues that very few approaches are able to address to-date. We here report an analytical method to infer off-target binding, via expression profiling, based on probing the relative impact to various biochemical pathways; we also proposed an accompanying side effect prediction engine for the systematic screening of candidate polyamides. This method marks the first attempt in PI polyamide research to identify elements in biochemical pathways that are sensitive to the treatment of a candidate polyamide as an approach to infer possible off-target effects. Expression changes were then considered to assess possible outward phenotypic changes, manifested as side effects, should the same PI polyamide candidate be administered clinically. We validated some of these effects with a series of animal experiments, and found agreeable corroboration in certain side effects, such as changes in aspartate transaminase levels in ICR and nude mice post-administration."
https://openalex.org/W2937958346,"Background Unintentional weight loss in older people has been linked to increased risk of mortality. We aimed to investigate common medical conditions and lifestyle factors, including body fat distribution, as potential determinants of recent and prospective unintentional weight loss in early old age. Methods From the Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), we included a total of 2234 study members aged 60–64 with information on unintentional weight loss in 2006–2010. Of these, 2136 also had information on unintentional weight loss recorded in 2015. Logistic regression was conducted to examine the associations between medical conditions, lifestyle, and body fat distribution at age 60–64 and unintentional weight loss at age 60–64 and 69. Results A total of 109 of 2234 study members had unintentional weight loss at ages 60–64, and 166 of 2136 at age 69. Never smoking was associated with lower risk of unintentional weight loss at age 60–64 (OR = 0.29, 95%CI = 0.12–0.68 compared to current smokers), and this association remained when adjusted for other determinants. Greater waist-hip ratio (OR = 0.95, 95%CI = 0.91–0.99) and body fat-lean mass ratio (OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.94–0.99) were associated with less likelihood of unintentional weight loss at age 60–64. Never smoking and greater hip circumference at age 60–64 were associated with lower odds of unintentional weight loss at age 69. Conclusions Smoking status and body fat distribution may help identify those at risk of unintentional weight loss in early old age. Their benefit in interventions to prevent age-associated weight loss needs to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2939789820,"Mycobacterium cosmeticum is a nontuberculous Mycobacterium recovered from different water sources including household potable water and water collected at nail salon. Individual cases of this bacterium have been reported to be associated with gastrointestinal tract infections. Here we present the first whole-genome study and comparative analysis of two new clinically-derived Mycobacterium sp. UM_RHS (referred as UM_RHS after this) and Mycobacterium sp. UM_NYF (referred as UM_NYF after this) isolated from patients in Indonesia and Malaysia respectively to have a better understanding of the biological characteristic of these isolates. Both strains are likely Mycobacterium cosmeticum as supported by the evidence from molecular phylogenetic, comparative genomic and Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) analyses. We found the presence of a considerably large number of putative virulence genes in the genomes of UM_RHS and UM_NYF. Interestingly, we also found a horizontally transferred genomic island carrying a putative dsz operon proposing that they may have potential to perform biodesulfization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) that may be effective in cost reduction and air pollution during fuel combustion. This comparative study may provide new insights into M. cosmeticum and serve as an important reference for future functional studies of this bacterial species."
