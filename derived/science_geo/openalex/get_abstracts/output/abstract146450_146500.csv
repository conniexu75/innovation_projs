Despite the diversity of these mechanisms, many of the features of soliton interactions and collisions are universal. Spatial solitons exhibit a richness of phenomena not found with temporal solitons in fibers, including effects such as fusion, fission, annihilation, and stable orbiting in three dimensions. Here the current state of knowledge on spatial soliton interactions is reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2098772291,"The complete genome sequence of the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans R1 is composed of two chromosomes (2,648,638 and 412,348 base pairs), a megaplasmid (177,466 base pairs), and a small plasmid (45,704 base pairs), yielding a total genome of 3,284,156 base pairs. Multiple components distributed on the chromosomes and megaplasmid that contribute to the ability of D. radiodurans to survive under conditions of starvation, oxidative stress, and high amounts of DNA damage were identified. Deinococcus radiodurans represents an organism in which all systems for DNA repair, DNA damage export, desiccation and starvation recovery, and genetic redundancy are present in one cell."
https://openalex.org/W2036368878,"Theory predicts that systems that are more diverse should be more resistant to exotic species, but experimental tests are needed to verify this. In experimental communities of sessile marine invertebrates, increased species richness significantly decreased invasion success, apparently because species-rich communities more completely and efficiently used available space, the limiting resource in this system. Declining biodiversity thus facilitates invasion in this system, potentially accelerating the loss of biodiversity and the homogenization of the world's biota."
https://openalex.org/W2000744528,"Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) and mu-opioid receptor (muOR) agonists affected respiratory rhythm when injected directly into the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), the hypothesized site for respiratory rhythmogenesis in mammals. These effects were mediated by actions on preBötC rhythmogenic neurons. The distribution of NK1R+ neurons anatomically defined the preBötC. Type 1 neurons in the preBötC, which have rhythmogenic properties, expressed both NK1Rs and muORs, whereas type 2 neurons expressed only NK1Rs. These findings suggest that the preBötC is a definable anatomic structure with unique physiological function and that a subpopulation of neurons expressing both NK1Rs and muORs generate respiratory rhythm and modulate respiratory frequency."

The field has been transformed by the advent of semiconductor nonlinear devices capable of operation at 100 gigabits per second and higher, well beyond the current speed limits of commercial electronics. These devices are expected to become important in future high-capacity communications networks by allowing digital regeneration and other processing functions to be performed on data signals “on the fly” in the optical domain."
https://openalex.org/W2085220858,"Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle are regulated by myosin light-chain kinase and myosin phosphatase through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of myosin light chains. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase Ialpha (cGKIalpha) mediates physiologic relaxation of vascular smooth muscle in response to nitric oxide and cGMP. It is shown here that cGKIalpha is targeted to the smooth muscle cell contractile apparatus by a leucine zipper interaction with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase. Uncoupling of the cGKIalpha-MBS interaction prevents cGMP-dependent dephosphorylation of myosin light chain, demonstrating that this interaction is essential to the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell tone."
https://openalex.org/W2045368311,"The role of naturally varying vegetation in influencing the climate variability in the West African Sahel is explored in a coupled atmosphere–land-vegetation model. The Sahel rainfall variability is influenced by sea-surface temperature variations in the oceans. Land-surface feedback is found to increase this variability both on interannual and interdecadal time scales. Interactive vegetation enhances the interdecadal variation substantially but can reduce year-to-year variability because of a phase lag introduced by the relatively slow vegetation adjustment time. Variations in vegetation accompany the changes in rainfall, in particular the multidecadal drying trend from the 1950s to the 1980s."

We developed mAbs against Triton X-100-insoluble components of HL-60 cells pretreated with all-trans retinoic acid. In particular, one mAb recognized a 22-kDa protein that exhibited intriguing behavior by forming an aggregate and appearing as a speck during apoptosis induced by retinoic acid and other anti-tumor drugs. Cloning and sequencing of its cDNA revealed that this protein comprises 195 amino acids and that its C-terminal half has a caspaserecruitment domain (CARD) motif, characteristic of numerous proteins involved in apoptotic signaling. We referred to this protein as ASC (apoptosis-associatedspeck-like protein containing a CARD). TheASC gene was mapped on chromosome 16p11.2–12. The antisense oligonucleotides of ASC were found to reduce the expression of ASC, and consequently, etoposide-mediated apoptosis of HL-60 cells was suppressed.

ICH-1, Ced-3, ICE, and Mch6, all proteins containing the CARD, have been reported to act in apoptotic signaling (9Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The CARD has been proposed to play a regulatory role in apoptosis by allowing proteins such as Apaf-1 to associate with caspase-9 (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 11Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The viral apoptosis inhibitor IAP of the two cellular homologs c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 is part of the TNFR2-TRAF complex through the CARD (13Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V.

Dev. 1996; 6: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The CARDs of these proteins associate with electrostatic forces, and this binding specificity between CARDs is determined by the charge distribution on the domain surfaces (16Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a novel protein, ASC. This soluble protein was located in the cytosol of healthy HL-60 cells; however, in apoptotic cells, it was visualized as a speck. Closer examination of this speck revealed that the protein formed an aggregate with a hollow center. Although the C-terminal of ASC was found to contain a CARD, the N-terminal was found to be homologous to that of pyrin, the causative gene product for familial Mediterranean fever (17The International FMF ConsortiumCell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). The CARD domain of ASC may be involved in apoptotic signaling, thereby initiating pro-apoptotic effects. The methods described previously for preparation of the cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix (18He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) were used with slight modifications. Triton X-100-insoluble materials of HL-60 were used for immunization of mice and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HL-60 cells were treated with etoposide (10 μg/ml) for 12 h and collected. Cells were fixed with 3% hydrogen peroxide in 70% ethanol and refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were immunostained and refixed with 1% glutaraldehyde. All subsequent steps were performed as described previously (19Masumoto J. Sagara J. Hayama M. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Taniguchi S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were harvested and lysed in hypotonic solution. 60% sucrose solution was added to the cell lysate to result in a final concentration of 10%. The whole cell lysate was successively fractionated by centrifuging. Twelve h after medium exchange, HL-60 cells in exponential growing phase were suspended with fresh control medium or media-containing anti-tumor agents: agents that interact with topoisomerase, i.e. 10 μg/ml etoposide (VP-16) (LastetTM, Nippon-Kayaku) or 1 μg/ml camptothecin (CPT; TopoGEN); an antimetabolite; 10 μg/ml cytarabine (ara-C) (1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; CylocideTM, Nippon-Shinyaku); a metallic agent; 1 μg/ml cisplatin (CDDP) (RandaTM, Nippon-Kayaku); an antimicrotubule agent; 1 μg/ml vincristine (VCR) (OncovinTM, Shionogi); a differentiation agent; 10 μm all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) (Sigma) or a miscellaneous chemotherapeutic agent; 2 milliunits/ml bleomycin (BLM) (BleoTM, Nippon-Kayaku). After treatment with these agents, cells were fixed and analyzed as described above. Total RNA from HL-60 cells was isolated by acid guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction using Isogen (Wako). To purify mRNA, pre-packed spin oligo-dT-cellulose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. A λgt11 cDNA library was constructed using a TimeSaverTM cDNA synthesis kit with poly(A) primers and random primers, a cDNA rapid cloning module, and λ-DNA in vitro packaging module (all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA library described above was screened with the anti-ASC mAb, and positive clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ noncoding region was cloned by 5′-RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sequence homology searches were carried out using the BLAST computer program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The entire open reading frame of ASC was inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The DNA construct was transfected into COS-7 cells by lipofection using TransomeTM (Wako) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A human PAC DNA pool (20Ioannou P.A. Amemiya C.T. Garnes J. Kroisel P.M. Shizuya H. Chen C. Batzer M.A. de Jong P.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) was screened using primers for the 3′-untranslated region of ASC under the following polymerase chain reaction conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min (GeneAmp 9600 system, Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Primers were 5′-TGGAGGACCTGGAGCGGAGC-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTGGCTTTTCGTATATTGT-3′. DNA of positive clones was prepared using a Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Aliquots of 1 μg of PAC DNA labeled with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by nick end translation were hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes together with 10 μg of human Cot 1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) to suppress repetitive sequences, as described previously (21Kishino T. Ariga T. Soejima H. Tamura T. Ohta T. Jinno Y. Yonemura S. Sato N. Tsukita Sa Tsukita Sh Sakiyama Y. Niikawa N. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 167-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FISH signals were detected with FITC-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories), and chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide. Signals were viewed under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope equipped with a Zeiss 100× Apochromat objective, and images were acquired with a PXL cooled CCD camera (Photometrics). The HL-60 cells were transfected by antisense oligonucleotides-(76–95) 5′-GCGCCCCATGGCTCCAGGAT-3′ or, as the control, sense oligonucleotides-(76–95), 5′-ATCCTGGAGCCATGGGGCGC-3′, or sense oligonucleotides-(71–90), 5′-CGGGGATCCTGGAGCCATGG-3′. HL-60 cells (2 ×106) were transfected with each of the oligonucleotides (5 μm)using the LipofectAMINE-PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Apoptotic cells were assessed by the TUNEL method. Fragmented DNA strands were labeled with FITC-conjugated deoxyuridine using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara). Changes in cellular architecture during apoptosis and/or differentiation of leukemic cells were determined by developing mAbs against the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of RA-treated or -untreated HL-60 cells. One mAb recognized an antigen with a molecular mass of 22-kDa. Western blotting analysis revealed that, unlike control cells, a portion of this protein in RA-treated cells was resistant to extraction with Triton X-100/cytoskeleton buffer (Fig.1 A). DNA condensation in apoptotic cells was detected by immunofluorescence after extracting DNA fragments with 70% ethanol at −20 °C for 30 min (22Telford W.G. King L.E. Fraker P.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A bright speck-like signal was observed in RA-treated (4 days) HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1, Ba and Bb, arrowheads) and this protein was thus termed ASC. Over 50% of the RA-treated HL-60 cells were found to be apoptotic. In most HL-60 cells bearing an ASC speck, chromatin condensation was visualized by Hoechst 33258, thus implying that in HL-60 cells, ASC is concentrated into a speck and is associated with the apoptotic process. By using pre-embedding electron microscopy, it was possible to obtain a more precise location for the ASC speck in apoptotic HL-60 cells. The cells were pretreated with etoposide (10 μg/ml) for 12 h, and the histochemical staining of apoptotic HL- 60 with the ASC mAb was examined. Our findings revealed that the speck was detected in the periphery of the apoptotic HL-60 cells and appeared to be an aggregate with a hollow center (Fig. 1 C). The location of ASC in HL-60 cells was also determined by cell fractionation. ASC was found predominantly in the supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, but a small portion was also found in the pellet after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min (Fig. 1 D). It was deduced, therefore, that ASC is essentially a soluble protein in the cytosol. This phenomenon was also seen in HL-60 cells pretreated with various anti-tumor agents for the induction of apoptosis (TableI). A significant correlation was observed between the number of apoptotic cells and the number of cells with a speck-like fluorescence signals of ASC (Fig.2, A and B).Table IThe speck-like aggregate of ASC in HL-60 cells during apoptosis induced by anti-tumor agentsControlDrugEtoposideCamptothecinCytarabineCisplatinVincristineBleomycinAll-transretinoic acidConcentrationNone10 μg/ml1 μg/ml10 μg/ml1 μg/ml1 μg/ml2 mU/ml1 μmIncubation time (h)2424242424242472Apoptotic cells (%)10.3 ± 3.154.3 ± 7.11-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).44.7 ± 10.31-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).50.6 ± 6.01-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).40.0 ± 8.51-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).42.7 ± 6.31-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).37.4 ± 4.91-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).33.7 ± 4.81-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).Cells with speck-like signal (%)6.4 ± 2.237.9 ± 6.51-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).31.9 ± 7.01-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).38.4 ± 6.91-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).26.9 ± 3.41-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).33.4 ± 6.81-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).29.1 ± 3.31-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).24.5 ± 4.31-aSignificantly different from control values using Student's t test (p < 0.05).Cells with speck-like signal (%)/ apoptotic cells (%)0.62 ± 0.090.70 ± 0.110.72 ± 0.070.76 ± 0.070.69 ± 0.130.78 ± 0.080.79 ± 0.100.73 ± 0.06HL-60 cells were treated with anti-tumor drugs at concentrations and times indicated.

Open table in a new tab HL-60 cells were treated with anti-tumor drugs at concentrations and times indicated. Values are means (n = 5) ± S.D. mU, milliunits. The entire cDNA of ASC was cloned by immunoscreening and RACE. Immunoscreening the λgt11 cDNA expression library of HL-60 cells with the mAb for ASC resulted in two clones with 425- and 725-bp inserts found in the 3′-end of ASC. The remaining sequence consisting of 59-bp at the 5′-noncoding end was obtained by 5′-RACE. The 785-bp cDNA of ASC was obtained and sequenced (Fig.3). A good Kozak consensus (23Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) at the initial methionine (GCCATGG) was found, and the sequence contained an open reading frame of 585 bp; the putative initiation codon was preceded by an in-frame stop codon (−33 bp). Northern blotting showed the mRNA to be about 0.8 kilobase in length (see below), whereas Western blotting using extracts from COS-7 cells transiently expressing cDNA detected the immunoreactive 22-kDa protein (data not shown). Hence the sequence contained the complete coding region of ASC. The cDNA of ASC encodes a predicted peptide of 195 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 6.4 and a mass of 21.7-kDa. The schematic structure of human ASC (Fig. 3 A), nucleotide, and deduced protein sequences are shown (Fig. 3 B). A PSI-BLAST search of the NIH data base revealed that the 87 amino acid residues in the C terminus of ASC had significant homology (expect-value < 0.001) to the CARD of both mammalian cIAP1 and cIAP2 and, to a lesser extent, to the CARD of the human death protease caspase-2 (Fig. 3 C). During apoptosis, caspases are recruited by receptor-associated adaptors through CARD-CARD binding (11Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 12Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 16Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recently, several proteins containing the CARD motif have been cloned; ARC inhibits apoptosis induced by caspase-8 and Ced-3 interacting with caspase-2, -8, and Ced-3 (24Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Núñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). RICK/RIP2 interacts with CLARP and regulates apoptosis induced by the CD95/Fas receptor pathway (25Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). RICK/RIP2 is also a component of the TNFR1, cIAP1, and TRAF family signaling complexes (26McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Similarly, ASC may be involved in apoptotic signaling through the CARD. The N terminus of ASC displayed a high degree of homology to N-terminal pyrin (Fig. 3 D), the causative gene product of familial Mediterranean fever (17The International FMF ConsortiumCell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). The characteristics of ASC were ascertained by a transient expression experiment. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting enabled the detection of ASC after transient expression in COS-7 cells. The mAb against ASC was used to detect the subcellular localization of ASC in COS-7 cells. Additionally, this mAb probed whole cell lysate from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3 (empty vector) and pcDNA3-ASC. A ring-like fluorescent signal was detected in some COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-ASC, but not in those transfected with pcDNA3 (data not shown). Western blots revealed a 22-kDa band in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-ASC. This was the same size as that of ASC in HL-60 cells (data not shown). The chromosomal location of the ASC gene was determined by FISH, wherein we screened the human PAC library to isolate two independent PAC clones containing the ASC gene. The clones were shown to overlap with each other by restriction analysis and were mapped to 16p11.2-p12 by FISH (data not shown). For further refined mapping, we used the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid mapping panel (Research Genetics). Two-point maximum likelihood analysis indicated a linkage to markers SHGC-64124 and SHGC-35326 with log of odds (lod) scores of 9.54 and 8.93, respectively, as calculated by the Stanford Human Genome Center radiation hybrid web server. The marker SHGC-35326 was located between D16S3093 and D16S409 at 16p11.2. Based on these findings, theASC gene was located at 16p11.2–12. We examined the expression of ASC in several tumor cell lines using Northern and Western blotting (Fig. 4, Aand C). It was found to be restricted to two leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and U937, and a melanoma cell line, WM35. In addition, traces of ASC mRNA expression were detected in the chronic myelogeneous leukemic cell line, K562. Interestingly, ASC expression was not detected in other leukemic cell lines such as, Jurkat T-cell lymphoma and Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma. Furthermore, although ASC was expressed in the early stage melanoma cell line, WM35, its presence was not detected in another melanoma cell line, WM793. Multiple-tissue Northern blot showed an 0.8-kilobase transcript in various human normal tissues (Fig. 4 B). With the exception of K562, the expression of ASC in various tumor cell lines was confirmed by Western blotting using our anti-ASC mAb. Our data showed that ASC expression occurred in HL-60, U937, and WM35 (Fig. 4 C). These observations suggested that the level of ASC expression may vary according to the cell lineage, maturation stage, or cell transformation. Fig.5 A shows that in etoposide-induced apoptosis of HL-60 transfectant by antisense oligonucleotides, a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptosis was observed in comparison with control cells. Western blotting and NIH Image software showed that the HL-60 transfectant by antisense oligonucleotides-(76–95) expressed 57% less ASC than the controls by sense oligonucleotides-(76–95) or sense oligonucleotides-(71–90) (Fig. 5 B). Similar findings were also observed in vincristine-induced apoptosis (data not shown). These results showed that ASC may have pro-apoptotic activity by increasing the susceptibility of HL-60 cells to apoptotic stimuli by anti-cancer drugs such as etoposide or vincristine. It is possible that just as Apaf-1 has sensitizing effects for etoposide-induced apoptosis (27Perkins C. Kim C.N. Fang G. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4561-4566PubMed Google Scholar) so ASC has pro-apoptotic effects on some apoptotic pathways. Although at present it is not clear in which apoptotic pathway the CARD of ASC is involved, this study showed that low expression levels of a new CARD-containing molecule, ASC, decreases etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a variety of penta- and hexa-acylated lipid A structures under different environmental conditions. CF patient PA synthesized LPS with specific lipid A structures indicating unique recognition of the CF airway environment. CF-specific lipid A forms containing palmitate and aminoarabinose were associated with resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and increased inflammatory responses, indicating that they are likely to be involved in airway disease."
https://openalex.org/W2096842237,Substance P receptor (SPR)–expressing spinal neurons were ablated with the selective cytotoxin substance P–saporin. Loss of these neurons resulted in a reduction of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia associated with persistent neuropathic and inflammatory pain states. This loss appeared to be permanent. Responses to mildly painful stimuli and morphine analgesia were unaffected by this treatment. These results identify a target for treating persistent pain and suggest that the small population of SPR-expressing neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.

The crystal structure of the adenovirus fiber knob domain in complex with domain I of its human cellular receptor, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), is presented here. Surface-exposed loops on knob contact one face of CAR, forming a high-affinity complex. Topology mismatches between interacting surfaces create interfacial solvent-filled cavities and channels that may be targets for antiviral drug therapy. The structure identifies key determinants of binding specificity, which may suggest ways to modify the tropism of adenovirus-based gene therapy vectors."

Cellular attachment of Ad5 is mediated by binding of the carboxyl-terminal knob of its fiber coat protein to the Coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) protein. However, Ad5 binding to CAR hampers the development of adenovirus vectors capable of specifically targeting (diseased) tissues or organs. Through sequence analysis and mutagenesis, a conserved receptor-binding region was identified on the side of three divergent CAR-binding knobs. The feasibility of simultaneous CAR ablation and redirection of an adenovirus to a new receptor is demonstrated."

The degradation pathway of α-synuclein has not been identified nor has the kinetics of this process been described. We investigated the degradation kinetics of both wild-type and A53T mutant 6XHis-tagged α-synuclein in transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells. Degradation of both isoforms followed first-order kinetics over 24 h as monitored by the pulse-chase method. However, the t 12 of mutant α-synuclein was 50% longer than that of the wild-type protein (p < 0.01). The degradation of both recombinant proteins and endogenous α-synuclein in these cells was blocked by the selective proteasome inhibitor β-lactone (40 μm), indicating that both wild-type and A53T mutant α-synuclein are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Taken together, these immunohistochemical features indicate that α-synuclein catabolism may be impaired in PD, causing its accumulation in the cytoplasm and promoting its aggregation into Lewy bodies. The mechanism of the concomitant neurodegeneration is presently unknown.The kinetics of α-synuclein turnover have not been determined, nor has its degradation pathway been identified. In the present investigation, we studied the rate of catabolism for both recombinant wild-type and A53T mutant forms of α-synuclein in transiently transfected cells of the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (13Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested the hypothesis that α-synuclein is catabolized by proteasome using the selective proteasome inhibitor β-lactone.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWild-type and A53T mutant isoforms of 6XHis-tagged human α-synuclein fusion proteins were expressed in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y by transient transfections. Following labeling with [35S]methionine, these recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the 6XHis-tag and detected by SDS-PAGE as a single band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 21 kDa (Fig.1). The migration of these fusion proteins, which include 20 additional amino acids forming the tag, is consistent with previous reports that unconjugated α-synuclein monomer migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa (15Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar).The degradation rates of both isoforms of [35S]Met-labeled His-tagged α-synuclein were studied in pulse-chase experiments using chase intervals of 0–24 h (Fig.2 and TableI). The decay of both isoforms of α-synuclein correlated highly with one-phase exponential equations fit to each data set, with R 2 = 0.9362 for wild-type α-synuclein and R 2 = 0.9286 for the mutant protein, implying a single rate-limiting step for the degradation of approximately 70% of each protein. However, almost 30% of the original α-synuclein label consistently remained at the 24-hour time point, long after the initial decay had reached its apparent plateau (the variable “B” of the decay equation). Fraction B could be the result of an initially insoluble form of α-synuclein that aggregated because of overexpression and was then redissolved by the denaturation process (16Wood S.J. Wypych J.

Alternatively, another pool of α-synuclein undergoing a slower turnover cannot be excluded. The goodness-of-fit of the 24-hour degradation data to a one-phase exponential model demonstrates that the early and major process of α-synuclein catabolism obeys first order kinetics.Figure 2Degradation kinetics of α-synuclein.

Thetwo curves represent each data set fit to a first order decay equation. The two horizontal broken lines correspond to the B-constants, which represent the residual protein at the asymptote in the decay equations obtained for each isoform. The initial value of the α-synuclein label, normalized to 100%, represents the sum of the decay span A and B.

Although the t 12 for wild-type was 1.84 ± 0.16 h, that of the mutant form was 2.76 ± 0.24 h (p < 0.01), representing a 50% prolongation. The overexpressed recombinant proteins in this experimental paradigm cannot be assumed to have the same half-lives as their endogenous counterparts because synthesis rate can affect degradation rate (17Franklin J.L.

Nevertheless, the finding that mutant α-synuclein degrades more slowly than the wild-type under the same experimental conditions suggests a potential mechanism whereby the mutated protein accumulates in the cytoplasm at higher concentrations. This observation in a cellular system, along with the higher propensity of A53T mutant α-synuclein to aggregate into filamentous structuresin vitro (19Crowther R.A. Jakes R.

The amount of both of the labeled α-synuclein isoforms in cells incubated in the control chase medium significantly declined by 4 h. By contrast, no significant decrease of either α-synuclein isoform was found in cells incubated with β-lactone. Similarly, steady state levels of α-synuclein in non-transfected SH-SY5Y cells were increased after β-lactone treatment compared with vehicle (Fig.4), indicating that the endogenous protein is also catabolized by proteasome. The lack of detection of polyubiquitin laddering in our experiments is likely due to concurrent de-ubiquitination by isopeptidases, which often cause an increase in non-ubiquitinated substrate, rather than an accumulation of ubiquitinated species, to be the more conspicuous effect of proteasome inhibition (22Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Substrate polyubiquitination is required prior to the degradation of most proteins known to be processed by the eucaryotic proteasome (23Ciechanover A. Laszlo A. Bercovich B.S.I. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Orian A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 55: 491-501Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, the findings that β-lactone blocks degradation of endogenous α-synuclein and both recombinant isoforms provide strong evidence that this protein is degraded in vivo by the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.Figure 3Inhibition of α-synuclein degradation by β-lactone.

Endogenous α-synuclein in SH-SY5Y cells detected by immunoblotting followed by chemiluminescence was increased by 79, 61, and 52% after incubation with 40 μmβ-lactone for 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively, compared with that found in cells incubated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 4 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the few kindreds in which the A53T α-synuclein mutation has been found, all individuals identified as carriers of this mutation have developed PD, with symptom onset approximately a decade earlier than average for the sporadic disease. The present finding of a significantly longer half-life of the A53T mutant relative to wild-type α-synuclein suggests that the mutant is degraded less efficiently by proteasome. Even a minor impediment to α-synuclein catabolism could shift the cellular equilibrium toward an increase in cytosolic concentration, thus increasing the opportunity for aggregation. The biochemistry of proteasome catabolism is complex and involves many protein-targeting reactions in addition to proteasome proteolysis. The kinetics of catabolism can be altered at multiple steps in the proteasome pathway. Subtle alterations in the kinetics of these reactions could produce small changes in the cellular biochemistry that could have a cumulative effect over decades and may underlie slowly progressing neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Converging lines of evidence link the neuronal protein α-synuclein to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).1 Two different point mutations in α-synuclein, A53T (1Polymeropoulos M.H.

Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Substrate polyubiquitination is required prior to the degradation of most proteins known to be processed by the eucaryotic proteasome (23Ciechanover A. Laszlo A. Bercovich B.S.I. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Orian A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 55: 491-501Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, the findings that β-lactone blocks degradation of endogenous α-synuclein and both recombinant isoforms provide strong evidence that this protein is degraded in vivo by the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.Figure 3Inhibition of α-synuclein degradation by β-lactone. A, representative autoradiographs of 35S-labeled wild-type and A53T mutant His-tagged α-synuclein transiently expressed in SH-SY5Y cells after a 4-h incubation in unlabeled medium in the presence of 40 μm β-lactone or 0.1% DMSO.

Endogenous α-synuclein in SH-SY5Y cells detected by immunoblotting followed by chemiluminescence was increased by 79, 61, and 52% after incubation with 40 μmβ-lactone for 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively, compared with that found in cells incubated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 4 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the few kindreds in which the A53T α-synuclein mutation has been found, all individuals identified as carriers of this mutation have developed PD, with symptom onset approximately a decade earlier than average for the sporadic disease. The present finding of a significantly longer half-life of the A53T mutant relative to wild-type α-synuclein suggests that the mutant is degraded less efficiently by proteasome. Even a minor impediment to α-synuclein catabolism could shift the cellular equilibrium toward an increase in cytosolic concentration, thus increasing the opportunity for aggregation. The biochemistry of proteasome catabolism is complex and involves many protein-targeting reactions in addition to proteasome proteolysis. The kinetics of catabolism can be altered at multiple steps in the proteasome pathway. Subtle alterations in the kinetics of these reactions could produce small changes in the cellular biochemistry that could have a cumulative effect over decades and may underlie slowly progressing neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Wild-type and A53T mutant isoforms of 6XHis-tagged human α-synuclein fusion proteins were expressed in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y by transient transfections. Following labeling with [35S]methionine, these recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the 6XHis-tag and detected by SDS-PAGE as a single band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 21 kDa (Fig.1). The migration of these fusion proteins, which include 20 additional amino acids forming the tag, is consistent with previous reports that unconjugated α-synuclein monomer migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa (15Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The degradation rates of both isoforms of [35S]Met-labeled His-tagged α-synuclein were studied in pulse-chase experiments using chase intervals of 0–24 h (Fig.2 and TableI). The decay of both isoforms of α-synuclein correlated highly with one-phase exponential equations fit to each data set, with R 2 = 0.9362 for wild-type α-synuclein and R 2 = 0.9286 for the mutant protein, implying a single rate-limiting step for the degradation of approximately 70% of each protein. However, almost 30% of the original α-synuclein label consistently remained at the 24-hour time point, long after the initial decay had reached its apparent plateau (the variable “B” of the decay equation). Fraction B could be the result of an initially insoluble form of α-synuclein that aggregated because of overexpression and was then redissolved by the denaturation process (16Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Alternatively, another pool of α-synuclein undergoing a slower turnover cannot be excluded. The goodness-of-fit of the 24-hour degradation data to a one-phase exponential model demonstrates that the early and major process of α-synuclein catabolism obeys first order kinetics. Wild-type and mutant recombinant α-synuclein degradation data were fit to a first-order decay function: f(t) = A · e−kt + B , where A is the Span or total range of protein decay over the measured interval, B is the Plateau or residual protein label at the decay asymptote, kis the decay rate constant, and t is the duration of the chase incubation. t 12 (expressed in hours) is calculated as 0.693/k. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. The half-lives of wild-type and mutant proteins are significantly different, while other decay constants are not. The square of the correlation coefficient R 2 is a measure of goodness-of-fit. The estimated half-lives calculated for wild-type and mutant isoforms of His-tagged α-synuclein were consistently and significantly different. Although the t 12 for wild-type was 1.84 ± 0.16 h, that of the mutant form was 2.76 ± 0.24 h (p < 0.01), representing a 50% prolongation. The overexpressed recombinant proteins in this experimental paradigm cannot be assumed to have the same half-lives as their endogenous counterparts because synthesis rate can affect degradation rate (17Franklin J.L. Johnson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 142: 1313-1324Google Scholar, 18Martegani E. Alberghina L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7047-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the finding that mutant α-synuclein degrades more slowly than the wild-type under the same experimental conditions suggests a potential mechanism whereby the mutated protein accumulates in the cytoplasm at higher concentrations. This observation in a cellular system, along with the higher propensity of A53T mutant α-synuclein to aggregate into filamentous structuresin vitro (19Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 308-312Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 20Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), reveals a possible physicochemical basis for the pathogenesis of some forms of PD. The specific and irreversible proteasome inhibitor β-lactone significantly inhibited the degradation of both wild-type and mutant His-tagged α-synuclein (Fig. 3). The amount of both of the labeled α-synuclein isoforms in cells incubated in the control chase medium significantly declined by 4 h. By contrast, no significant decrease of either α-synuclein isoform was found in cells incubated with β-lactone. Similarly, steady state levels of α-synuclein in non-transfected SH-SY5Y cells were increased after β-lactone treatment compared with vehicle (Fig.4), indicating that the endogenous protein is also catabolized by proteasome. The lack of detection of polyubiquitin laddering in our experiments is likely due to concurrent de-ubiquitination by isopeptidases, which often cause an increase in non-ubiquitinated substrate, rather than an accumulation of ubiquitinated species, to be the more conspicuous effect of proteasome inhibition (22Weissman A.M.

The first event after sensory stimulation was an increase in oxygen consumption, followed by an increase in blood flow. Because oxygen consumption and neuronal activity are colocalized but the delayed blood flow is not, functional magnetic resonance imaging focused on this initial phase will yield much higher spatial resolution, ultimately enabling the noninvasive visualization of fundamental processing modules in the human brain."

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of all mammalian selenoproteins contain a stem-loop structure, designated as the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element (18Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y.Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar).

The presence of a Sec residue in regions that are essential to function of selenoproteins explains many, if not all, of the biological effects of selenium when this micronutrient is present at suboptimal levels in the diet. Selenium deficiency results in decreased levels of selenium-containing proteins (24Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Annu. Rev.

Supplementation of the human diet with selenium offers a potentially effective means of preventing or diminishing human maladies. For example, dietary supplementation with selenium resulted in 48–63% reduction in the incidence of human prostate, lung, and colon cancers in a human clinical trial (26Clark L.C. Combs Jr., G.F. Turnbull B.W. Slate E.H. Chalker D.K. Chow J. Davis L.S. Glover R.A. Graham G.F. Gross E.G. Krongrad A. Lesher Jr., J.L. Park H.K. Sanders Jr., B.B. Smith C.L. Taylor J.R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 276: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The essential role of selenium for mammalian development is illustrated by the findings that disruption of the mouse Sec-tRNA gene results in early embryonic lethality (28Bosl M.R. Takaku K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5531-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is not known which selenoprotein(s) is (are) responsible for this effect. Identification and characterization of new Sec-containing proteins is an important area of research that may take advantage of the available genome sequencing data and help to elucidate many biological effects of selenium. No algorithms are currently available that would correctly predict selenoprotein gene sequence in nucleotide data bases because selenoproteins have diverse functions (8Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and lack a common amino acid consensus sequence. In this report, we describe a computer program, SECISearch, that recognizes SECIS elements in nucleotide sequences. Using this program and additional criteria for recognition of mammalian selenoprotein genes, 2V. N. Gladyshev and G. V. Kryukov, submitted for publication. we found the genes for two new Sec-containing proteins, SelT and SelR, which do not have homology to previously characterized proteins. In addition, we provide experimental evidence for the expression of SelT and SelR in mammalian cells. It should also be noted that SelR is the first selenoprotein that has a direct homolog in a “minimal gene set for cellular life” (30Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10268-10273Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). A program for SECIS element recognition in nucleotide sequences, SECISearch, is based on the algorithm that involves three steps of a search strategy: 1) primary sequence identification; 2) secondary structure prediction; and 3) minimum free energy estimation (Fig. 2 A). The program is composed of two modules. The first module is responsible for recognition of the SECIS element primary sequence and secondary structure consensuses and is written on the basis of the PatScan program. Nucleotide sequences that satisfy both primary and secondary structure constraints are further analyzed in the second module that estimates the free energy of the stem-loop structure. This module is based on the Vienna RNA package RNAfold program for secondary structure prediction and free energy evaluation. It separately estimates the free energies for Helix I plus internal loop and Helix II plus apical loop regions of the putative SECIS element (Fig. 2 B). The free energy cutoff parameters are based on free energy minimization calculations of SECIS elements in previously characterized human selenoprotein mRNAs and were set as −7 kcal/mol for Helix I and internal loop and −5 kcal/mol for Helix II and apical loop. In the absence of a reliable algorithm that correctly predicts the three-dimensional structure of mRNA, these numerical values are relative but reflect the relationship between the values of the free energy of folding predicted for SECIS elements in previously characterized selenoproteins and stem-loop structures selected by SECISearch. The minimum free energy algorithm derived from the Vienna RNA package and employed by SECISearch is also present in the popular mfold program (31Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). The two modules of SECISearch were written in C and compiled by the GNU C compiler for Win32 platform. Perl scripts were used for module interaction and for presentation of the SECISearch data for further analyses. Human expressed sequence tag data base (dbEST) (March 1999 release) was searched with SECISearch (Fig.2 A) with parameters indicated in Table I. SECIS elements in the SelP gene were obvious outrangers in terms of Helix II plus apical loop energy (Fig. 2 B). The use of energy cut-off parameters that excluded these SECIS elements allowed us to reduce the number of sequences selected by SECISearch over 6-fold and increase the proportion of sequences that corresponded to known selenoprotein genes from ∼10 to ∼70%. Nucleotide sequences that were selected by the program were manually analyzed against NCBI non-redundant (NR) and EST data bases and against the TIGR tentative human consensus data base. Sequences corresponding to the known selenoprotein genes were excluded, remaining sequences were further extended by computer search analyses of dbEST, and consensus sequences were obtained on the basis of multiple matches in all three data bases. Extended sequences were analyzed for the presence of open reading frames (ORFs) allowing in-frame TGA codons to be interpreted as either Sec residues or stop signals. ORFs containing in-frame TGA codons were identified and analyzed by computer search analyses for the presence of features characteristic of mammalian selenoprotein genes. Specifically, conservation of a TGA codon in nucleotide sequences, putative Sec-flanking areas in amino acid sequences and SECIS elements in 3′-UTR were tested in mammalian sequences. ORFs were further searched for homologies to NR and EST sequences using BLAST programs, and sequences homologous to putative selenoprotein sequences and containing a cysteine codon in place of a Sec-encoding TGA codon in a putative selenoprotein were identified.Table IAn example of SECISearch analysis of human dbESTHuman ESTs in dbEST1,253,123Satisfied primary sequence consensus179,614 ATGAN/11–12 nt/AA/18–27 nt/GASatisfied secondary structure consensus32,652 Helix I, 7 nt, 1 mismatch and 1 bulge on each side are allowed; internal loop, 3–7 nt, 5′ branch ends with A; Quartet, TGAN…NGAN; Helix II, 11–12 nt, 3 mismatches and 1 bulge on each side are allowed; apical loop, 7–17 nt, starts with AASatisfied free energy threshold974 ΔG for Helix I1-aTen additional nucleotides upstream of the 5′ branch and 10 nucleotides downstream of the 3′ branch of predicted Helix I were considered in free energy estimation for Helix I plus the internal loop.

Plasmids were isolated using a Nucleobond AX100 Kit (CLONTECH). The nucleotide sequences were determined using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing method. GFP-SelT and GFP-SelR constructs were made on the basis of pEGFP-C3 expression vector (CLONTECH). In each of these constructs,GFP was located upstream of a selenoprotein gene. Human SelT cDNA was amplified with primers W5U119, 5′- GTGCCAGCAAGAGATTAAAG-3′, and W5L791, 5′- GCCAGCACTGAAACACTATC-3′, and cloned into the SmaI site of pEGFP-C3. The SelR cDNA was directly cloned into the XhoI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C3. Both plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain NovaBlue (Novagen), and the plasmids were isolated using Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). A monkey CV-1 cell line was grown on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to ∼80% confluence and transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for attached cells. 3 μg of DNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE were used for each 60-mm plate. Cells were labeled between 6 and 36 h after transfection with 100 μCi of freshly neutralized [75Se]selenious acid (1000 Ci/mmol, Research Reactor Facility, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) as described (17Gladyshev V.N.

Cells were washed four times from the remaining 75Se with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and the samples analyzed on 10% SDS-NuPAGE gels (Novex). 75Se-Labeled proteins were visualized on SDS-PAGE gels with a Storm PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to residues 148–163 of the human SelT protein.

RNA. 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) are composed of Helices I and II, internal and apical loops, and a non-Watson-Crick base paired SECIS core, Quartet (Fig.1, A-D). Conserved nucleotides in the SECIS element sequence are an A directly preceding the Quartet, TGA in the 5′ segment and GA in the 3′ segment of the Quartet, and an unpaired AA in the apical loop. Another characteristic feature of a mammalian SECIS element is the length of Helix II, which separates the non-Watson-Crick Quartet and AA in the apical loop by 11–12 nucleotides. Two distinct but related models were recently proposed for the SECIS element consensus sequence and structure. Krol and collaborators (20Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a single consensus for all mammalian SECIS elements (Fig.1 A), while Berry and collaborators (22Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) divided SECIS elements into two distinct subfamilies, type I and type II (Fig. 1,B and C). These subfamilies were different in the area of the apical loop; that is, type II SECIS elements had an additional mini-stem that placed AA in the bulge. These two types of SECIS elements were interconvertible by mutations that remove/create the mini-stem suggesting a similar structure and function of both SECIS element types (22Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Even though the consensus sequences shown in Fig. 1, A-C, indeed represent SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNA, we analyzed known SECIS elements from a different perspective and propose a consensus that utilizes the free energy of a stem-loop structure in addition to primary and secondary consensus structures (Fig.1 D). When free energies predicted from a computer analysis of SECIS element folding were analyzed for known SECIS elements, all Sec-inserting stem-loop structures exhibited similar free energy parameters. The free energy values for Helix I plus internal loop and for Helix II plus apical loop were determined separately and plotted against each other (Fig. 2 B). No differences were observed in the free energy values for type I and type II SECIS elements shown in Fig. 1, B and C, suggesting that the mini-stem serves to stabilize the stem-loop structure. The mini-stem is formed when an apical loop is large enough to destabilize the structure, but it may not be required for the SECIS elements with smaller apical loops. These considerations are similar to the suggestion that the mini-stem may serve to maintain thermodynamic stability or to nucleate SECIS element folding (22Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The commonality in the energetic criteria for SECIS elements allowed us to maintain a single model, depicted in Fig. 1 D, for designing an algorithm that searches for novel SECIS elements. Additional features that distinguish the SECIS element shown in Fig. 1 D, from previously proposed models, Fig. 1, A-C, are: (a) assigning a distance of 11–12 nucleotides between the Quartet and AA in the apical loop instead of a 9–11-base pair stem (20Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); (b) identifying a distance between the unpaired AA and the 3′ segment of the Quartet; and (c) the use of the unpaired AA instead of AA(A/G) in the apical loop. A computer program, SECISearch, was developed for identification of SECIS elements in nucleic acid sequences. The algorithm includes three major steps: 1) primary consensus sequence search; 2) analysis of mRNA secondary structure; and 3) estimation of the free energy for the predicted secondary structure. The descriptor was developed on the basis of the SECIS element consensus (Fig. 1 D) and adjusted to recognize SECIS elements in known selenoproteins. The free energy values were estimated for known SECIS elements and the lowest negative free energy cutoff parameters were determined (Fig. 2 B). The on-line version of SECISearch was also developed and designed to provide researchers with a tool to test nucleotide sequences for the presence of potential SECIS elements. It should be noted, however, that recognition of a SECIS element in a nucleotide sequence by SECISearch does not identify the sequence as a portion of a selenoprotein gene containing a functional SECIS element. Instead, this analysis is a first step in testing nucleotide sequences for the presence of a SECIS element, and further experimental and/or computer analyses are required (see below). SECISearch was applied to search dbEST and NR for nucleotide sequences containing SECIS elements. The search strategy involving this program and further analysis of ESTs selected by SECISearch is summarized in Fig. 2 A. SECISearch was highly selective for authentic SECIS elements. Depending on the parameters applied for a particular search (free energy of Helix I/internal loop, free energy of Helix II/apical loop, length of Helixes I and II, etc.), ∼10–70% of the sequences selected by the program in dbEST corresponded to SECIS elements in previously characterized selenoproteins genes. The example of SECISearch analysis of human dbEST is shown in Table I. The primary sequence consensus step reduced the number of tested ESTs to 14.3%, and only 2.6% (32,652 ESTs) of the initial 1,253,123 sequences satisfied the secondary structure consensus. The criteria used in primary sequence and secondary structure searches were sufficient to detect all known selenoproteins in NR. Calculations of the free energy for the predicted stem-loop structures with thermodynamic parameters that satisfy 12 out of 13 selenoproteins with known SECIS elements reduced the number of ESTs to 0.078% (974 individual ESTs). Eleven known selenoproteins were represented in this subset of human ESTs by 678 sequences. The remaining 296 ESTs were further grouped by multiple sequence alignments and each group was manually analyzed with the help of BLAST programs resulting in detection of two new selenoproteins (Fig. 1, Eand F) that were represented by 35 ESTs. However, not all of the SECISearch-selected sequences were derived from selenoprotein genes. This is likely due to a low degree of sequence and structure conservation in mammalian SECIS elements and perhaps due to a limited knowledge of actual SECIS element structure and of additional cis-acting elements involved in Sec insertion into mammalian proteins. Thus, in addition to functional SECIS elements, non-functional, “pseudo” SECIS elements were found by the current version of SECISearch during analyses of nucleotide data bases. A number of such SECIS-like non-functional structures were immediately recognized due to their presence in 5′-UTRs and coding regions (as well as in 3′-UTRs if translation was terminated at TAA or TAG) of known proteins. However, pseudo SECIS elements may also be present in the 3′-UTR of proteins in which TGA signals terminate translation, but certain properties of mRNA, such as the distance between TGA and the SECIS element, or mRNA tertiary structure, prevent SECIS element from signaling Sec incorporation. It has been established, for instance, that the TGA-SECIS element distance of <51 nucleotides was insufficient in decoding of TGA as Sec (23Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), while the distance of >204 nucleotides was sufficient (32Wen W. Weiss S.L. Sunde R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28533-28541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analyses of SECISearch-selected ESTs were also occasionally complicated by the uncertainty of the correspondence of an entry to a coding or complementary strand. However, we found that, even if the majority of SECISearch-selected ESTs were classified as SECIS elements in known selenoproteins or as pseudo-SECIS structures, the number of remaining nucleotide sequences was typically too large to test in a cell line system. Indeed, experimental screening of the subset of nucleotide sequences that are selected by SECISearch but cannot be judged for authenticity (functionality) would require enormous experimental effort. This suggests that the current version of SECISearch is not efficient in finding new selenoprotein mRNAs exclusively and that identification of additional cis-acting elements may be necessary for selenoprotein gene sequence recognition. Analysis of putative Sec-flanking areas in cDNAs selected by SECISearch provides such additional criteria for selection of selenoprotein genes. We recently proposed a set of criteria, designated as mammalian selenoprotein gene signature (MSGS),2 that are helpful for identifying selenoprotein mRNA sequences. According to MSGS, a typical new selenoprotein will not only contain a SECIS element in the 3′-UTR of its mRNA, but this SECIS element will also be conserved among mammalian mRNAs for this protein. In addition, Sec and Sec-flanking regions for this protein should be conserved in mammalian"

However, it has been difficult to elucidate how the phosphorylation of each of these subunits might contribute to functional regulation of the channels in intact cells and to assign specific roles of the multiple sites of phosphorylation to specific functional changes in channel properties. Studies in intact cardiac myocytes are extremely difficult due to the low abundance of channel proteins, thus studies in heterologous expression systems have the potential to define the roles of subunit phosphorylation in the regulation of the channels. However, a problem with this approach is that it has been difficult to reconstitute in heterologous expression systems the robust regulation of L-type channels that is observed in cardiac cells (8Zong X.

While both the α1C and β2 subunits were phosphorylated when coexpressed with AKAP79, only phosphorylation of serine (Ser) 1928 in the pore-forming α1C subunit appeared to be functionally linked to channel regulation (6Gao T.

However, compared with the robust PKA-mediated stimulation of native L-type currents (3–6-fold in many species), the effects of PKA in the heterologous expression systems in the presence of either AKAP were rather small (50% increase in peak currents) (6Gao T.

In addition, Ser-1928 is present in a portion of the C terminus of the α1C subunit that appears to be subject to proteolytic processing in native systems (10Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

This suggests that other events, such as phosphorylation of the β subunit, may play a functional role in channel regulation. This goal of this study was to test whether or not PKA mediated phosphorylation of the β2 subunit has functional consequences. The β2 subunit has been shown to undergo cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites in vitro and in cardiac myocytes and intact hearts (12Haase H. Karczewski P. Beckert R. Krause E.G.

While the rat β2a subunit has two consensus sequences at Thr-164 and Ser-591 that might serve as PKA sites, these sites are not phosphorylated by PKA (14Gerhardstein B.L. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rather, the actual sites of PKA-mediated phosphorylation on the β2a subunit are Ser-459, Ser-478, and Ser-479 (14Gerhardstein B.L. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An additional goal of this study was to determine which, if any, of these sites might mediate functional changes in channel activity. In order to prevent contributions from the previously identified PKA phosphorylation site on the α1C subunit and to mimic conditions that may exist in native systems, we utilized a truncation mutant of the α1C subunit, α1CΔ1905, that lacked the C-terminal 265 amino acids, including the only identified PKA site at Ser-1928.RESULTSCan PKA regulate channels lacking a phosphorylatable α1C subunit? The first question we addressed was whether or not PKA can regulate cardiac L-type calcium channels comprised of a wild-type β2 subunit and a truncated α1Csubunit that lacks Ser-1928, the site that was previously shown to be phosphorylated both in vitro (4De Jongh K.S.

The truncated α1C subunit used in these studies contained a deletion that resulted in the loss of its C terminus downstream of residue 1905 (α1CΔ1905). This mutant α1CΔ1905 subunit had a similar molecular mass when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as the truncated α1C subunit isolated from cardiac tissue (Fig.1). Importantly, α1CΔ1905 was not a substrate for PKA (Fig. 1), confirming that Ser-1928 is the sole site phosphorylated by PKA in the α1C subunit (4De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W.

This resulted in an approximately two-fold increase (from −47.5 ± 11.4 pA/pF to −116.2 ± 26.2 pA/pF at 0 mV test potential, n = 10–11) in current amplitude of the Ba2+ current generated by the channels formed by the α1CΔ1905 and the WT β2a subunits (Fig. 2, A and B). These results demonstrated that PKA could indeed cause increases in currents generated from channels lacking a phosphorylatable α1C subunit. In addition, the 2-fold increase in peak current amplitude resembled that seen in native cardiac myocytes. On the other hand, no apparent hyperpolarizing shift in the current-voltage (I-V) curve of the Ba2+ current was observed. This latter effect is routinely observed in native cardiac myocytes.In order to test whether or not the PKA-mediated increase in Ba2+ currents was due to phosphorylation of the β2a subunit, we expressed the α1CΔ1905 subunit with mutant β2a subunits that lacked the identified PKA phosphorylation sites (14Gerhardstein B.L. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These mutants contained point mutations of serines to alanines either at position 459 or 478/479 (14Gerhardstein B.L. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent Ba2+ currents in cells expressing α1CΔ1905 and β2aS459A were indistinguishable from currents obtained in cells expressing the WT β2 subunit (Fig. 3), indicating that this mutation did not alter the basic functional properties of the regulatory β2a subunit. The addition of the catalytic subunit of PKA to the patch pipette caused a significant increase in Ba2+ currents compared with the controls (−138.1 ± 37.7 pA/pF versus −28.2 ± 7.0 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 6–7) in cells expressing α1CΔ1905 and the mutant β2a S459A (Fig.3, A and B). This effect was comparable with that observed with the WT β2a subunit (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 3). In addition and in contrast to the results obtained with the WT β2a subunit, a significant (p < 0.05) shift of the voltage that caused half-maximal activation of calcium channels from −7.8 ± 2.4 mV to −14.4 ± 0.6 mV (n = 6–7) was observed in response to PKA by analysis of steady state activation curves (Boltzmann fit).Figure 3PKA-mediated stimulation of Ba2+currents through channels lacking phosphorylation site Ser-459 on the β2a subunit.

However, in marked contrast to what was observed with the WT and S459A mutant β subunits, the addition of PKA to the pipette did not augment currents obtained with α1CΔ1905 and the S478A/S479A β2a subunit (−59.1 ± 12.1 pA/pF versus −63.5 ± 12.4 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9). We have previously demonstrated that Ser-478 and Ser-479 are key residues for phosphorylation by PKA and that mutation of these two serines to alanines causes a 75% reduction in the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2 subunit. Taken together with the fact that the α1CΔ1905 subunit was not a substrate for PKA, the functional effects of the PKA-mediated regulation seen in the studies reported here are likely to occur through phosphorylation of the β2a subunit. These results demonstrated the importance of phosphorylation of the β2asubunit to the regulation of the cardiac calcium channel and identified the functionally important residues in the β2 subunit that are important for channel regulation.Figure 4Lack of PKA-mediated stimulation of L-type calcium channels in cells expressing S478A/S479A β2a subunits.Experiments were performed as described for Fig. 1 using the S478A/S479A β2a subunits instead of β2a WT subunits.

Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar); however the underlying phosphorylation reactions have not been resolved completely. In particular, the substrates for PKA that are responsible for the stimulation of the calcium current in intact cardiac myocytes are unknown. The results shown here, together with those in recent companion studies (6Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 7Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Zhao X.L. Ladner M.B. Hosey M.M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), give new insights into this process and demonstrate that the regulation of the channel may occur through more than one process. While early studies encountered difficulties in obtaining PKA-mediated stimulation of the cardiac L-type channel in various heterologous expression systems (8Zong X. Schreieck J. Mehrke G. Welling A. Schuster A. Bosse E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we now have learned of two scenarios that will allow for expression of the PKA effects. In studies with full-length α1C and β2a subunits, cAMP-dependent effects can be observed only if the channels are co-expressed with an AKAP (6Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the cAMP-dependent effects were attributed to phosphorylation of Ser-1928 in the C terminus of the α1C subunit, as mutation of this site alone led to a loss of the PKA effect (6Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition, the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-1928 in the α1C subunit was AKAP-dependent, while phosphorylation of the β2a subunit was not (6Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Thus, even though the β2a was phosphorylated at multiple sites when it was coexpressed with the full-length α1C subunit in the presence or absence of an AKAP, there did not appear to be a functional consequence of the phosphorylation of the β2asubunit (6Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this scenario, the increases in peak current were small, but a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the current-voltage relationship was observed (6Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the second scenario reported here, in studies with a C-terminally truncated, nonphosphorylatable α1C subunit, we have demonstrated the functional importance of the phosphorylation of two adjacent sites at Ser-478 and Ser-479 in the β2 subunit for regulation of the channel in response to PKA. In this second scenario, the increase in peak current was more substantial than observed in the first scenario, but a small hyperpolarizing shift in the current-voltage relationship was only observed in the context of the β2aS459A mutant. These effects did not require the expression of an AKAP, in agreement with the previous observation that the β2asubunit could undergo PKA-dependent phosphorylation whether or not it was co-expressed with an AKAP. These results contribute new aspects to mechanisms of regulation of the cardiac L-type channel, in particular that the β subunit may be directly involved in the regulatory process. Further studies are necessary to define whether one or both, or even other, events contribute to the PKA-mediated regulation of the channels in intact myocytes. Since neither scenario alone exhibits both the large increases in peak current amplitude and the hyperpolarizing shift in the current-voltage relationship that are observed in native cardiac myocytes, it is possible that both scenarios contribute to current regulation in the heart.Key to understanding exactly what modes of regulation exist in cardiac myocytes is to elucidate the status and role of the α1C C terminus. It is possible that the truncation of the α1Csubunit is necessary to allow for expression of the functional consequences of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2subunit and that regulation proceeds through a different mechanism when the full-length α1C subunit is the major form present. Yet another mechanism of regulation of the channel may be possible if the α1C subunit is cleaved in intact cells and the C-terminal fragment remains functionally associated with the “body” of the channel. This latter possibility is suggested by the observations that ∼85–90% of the α1C subunit appears to be truncated at the C terminus when biochemically isolated from native tissues, yet immunofluorescent studies suggest that the C terminus is present in cardiac myocytes in stoichiometric amounts and co-localized with the α1C and β2 subunits (11Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19401-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Potentially the truncation of the C terminus may allow new conformations of the channel to exist and alter the functional consequences of the phosphorylation of both the α1C and β2 subunits. Future studies will address these potentially complex mechanisms of channel regulation and further probe the types of regulation that occur in native systems. It has been known for more than a decade that the cardiac L-type calcium channel is an important effector for positive modulation of cardiac contractility through signaling cascades initiated by activation of the β-adrenergic receptors (1McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). It is well accepted that activation of protein kinase A (PKA)1 through the βAR pathway is crucial for the positive regulation of cardiacl-type Ca2+ currents (1McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels are composed of α1C,β2, and α2δ subunits (2De Waard M. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Narahashi T. Ion Channels. 4. Plenum Press, New York1996: 41-87Google Scholar, 3Hosey M.M. Chien A.J. Puri T.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and both the α1C and β2 subunits have been demonstrated to be direct targets of PKA-mediated phosphorylation (4De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10392-103402Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 5Mitterdorfer J. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Moebius F.F.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9605-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to elucidate how the phosphorylation of each of these subunits might contribute to functional regulation of the channels in intact cells and to assign specific roles of the multiple sites of phosphorylation to specific functional changes in channel properties. Studies in intact cardiac myocytes are extremely difficult due to the low abundance of channel proteins, thus studies in heterologous expression systems have the potential to define the roles of subunit phosphorylation in the regulation of the channels. However, a problem with this approach is that it has been difficult to reconstitute in heterologous expression systems the robust regulation of L-type channels that is observed in cardiac cells (8Zong X. Schreieck J. Mehrke G. Welling A. Schuster A. Bosse E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation and functional regulation of the channels was facilitated in human embryonic kidney cells when the channels were coexpressed with the protein kinase A-anchoring proteins AKAP79 and AKAP15/18 (6Gao T.

While both the α1C and β2 subunits were phosphorylated when coexpressed with AKAP79, only phosphorylation of serine (Ser) 1928 in the pore-forming α1C subunit appeared to be functionally linked to channel regulation (6Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, compared with the robust PKA-mediated stimulation of native L-type currents (3–6-fold in many species), the effects of PKA in the heterologous expression systems in the presence of either AKAP were rather small (50% increase in peak currents) (6Gao T.

In addition, Ser-1928 is present in a portion of the C terminus of the α1C subunit that appears to be subject to proteolytic processing in native systems (10Chang F.C. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19401-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that this site may not be available to mediate PKA-mediated regulation in cardiac myocytes. This suggests that other events, such as phosphorylation of the β subunit, may play a functional role in channel regulation. This goal of this study was to test whether or not PKA mediated phosphorylation of the β2 subunit has functional consequences. The β2 subunit has been shown to undergo cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites in vitro and in cardiac myocytes and intact hearts (12Haase H. Karczewski P. Beckert R. Krause E.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Haase H. Bartel S. Karczewski P. Morano I. Krause E.G. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). While the rat β2a subunit has two consensus sequences at Thr-164 and Ser-591 that might serve as PKA sites, these sites are not phosphorylated by PKA (14Gerhardstein B.L. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rather, the actual sites of PKA-mediated phosphorylation on the β2a subunit are Ser-459, Ser-478, and Ser-479 (14Gerhardstein B.L. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10361-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An additional goal of this study was to determine which, if any, of these sites might mediate functional changes in channel activity. In order to prevent contributions from the previously identified PKA phosphorylation site on the α1C subunit and to mimic conditions that may exist in native systems, we utilized a truncation mutant of the α1C subunit, α1CΔ1905, that lacked the C-terminal 265 amino acids, including the only identified PKA site at Ser-1928.

Screening of a prokaryotic expression library from human fibroblasts with a GST1 fusion protein comprising the EH domains of Eps15 led to the isolation of several clones interacting with these domains.

Multiple screens of the λgt11 human brain library led to several overlapping clones, none of which contained a full-length open reading frame.

Three pairs of primers ((5′-GCAAGGACCAGGGCATCAATG-3′, 5′-TGAAGTCCGAAGGTTGTCAAATTC-3′) and (5′-CCCCCGGCCTTGCCATACT-3′, 5′-CAGCCACTCGGAGCAGGAGTAT-3′), and (5′-ATGACAACTTCGTCTATCAGACGG-3′, 5′-CTAGAGAAGGAAAGGGTTGGTTGTG-3′)) were added to a single PCR at a final concentration of 2 mm. The longest PCR product was gel-extracted and subcloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced, confirming the generation of a full-length rat epsin 2 clone. A portion of the coding region of human epsin 2 containing the three NPF motifs (amino acids 524–642 human epsin 2a), the DPW domains of epsin 2 (amino acids 318–456 of human epsin 2a), and the ENTH/DPW domain of epsin 2 (amino acids 1–456 of human epsin 2a) and epsin 1 (amino acids 1–401) were amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase. The PCR fragment encoding the NPF motifs was subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), cleaved with EcoRI, and ligated to pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain a GST-NPF fusion protein. The PCR product of the DPW domain of epsin 2 was digested withEcoRI/XhoI and subcloned into the same vector to obtain a GST-DPW fusion protein. The ENTH/DPW domain fragments were digested with EcoRI/XhoI (epsin 1) andHindIII/XhoI (epsin 2) and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). GST fusions of the ENTH/DPW of epsin 1 and 2 were prepared by subcloningEcoRI/XhoI inserts into pGEX6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DH5a or BL21(DE3) host strains were transformed, and both constructs were verified by sequencing (Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). Rat epsin 1 constructs and GST fusion proteins of amphiphysin 1 (amino acids 262–405 and 262–375) were previously described (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified on a glutathione 4B-Sepharose affinity matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Affinity chromatography of a rat brain extract on the GST-NPF domain of epsin 2 was performed as described previously (9Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For the study of AP-2 and clathrin binding to GST fusion proteins, a rat brain homogenate was extracted with 1m Tris, pH 8.9, 2% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture and spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was desalted in a buffer containing 125 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins specifically retained by the affinity matrix were eluted into SDS/PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS/PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting (9Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). cDNA clones encoding luciferase (Promega Co.), amphiphysin I (10Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), rat epsin 1 (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), human epsin 2, and fragments of rat epsin 1 and human epsin 2 comprising both the ENTH and DPW domains (amino acids 1–401 and 1–456, respectively) were in vitro transcribed and translated using [35S]methionine with a T7-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega Co.) according to manufacturer's instructions. The radiolabeled products were separated by SDS/PAGE and quantitated so that equivalent amounts of radioactivity could be added in each binding reaction. The products were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose with a prebound GST or GST fusion protein of the NH2-terminal 579 amino acids of the clathrin heavy chain (kindly provided by James Keen, Kimmel Cancer Institute). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and thoroughly washed in the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS/PAGE followed by audioradiography. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain to obtain a fraction enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles was performed as described (11Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A full-length GFP-tagged human epsin 2a clone was constructed by PCR modification of the 5′-end of the epsin 2a sequence to incorporate additional restriction sites. This clone was subcloned into an enhanced green fluorescent protein vector with XhoI/BamHI. Full-length Xpress-tagged rat epsin 1 was prepared as described (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The cDNA-containing vectors were purified with a Maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to immunofluorescent staining as described (12Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A construct derived from the EHB21 clone was used as the initial probe to isolate via sequential library screens several overlapping human DNA sequences that encode an open reading frame, epsin 2, closely related to epsin 1. A corresponding full-length clone (epsin 2a) was assembled from two overlapping clones encoding the 5′ (clone 17B) and 3′ ends (clone 4) of the open reading frame. The putative start codon is surrounded by a sequence that conforms to the initiation consensus sequence as defined by Kozak (13Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar) and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon. Furthermore, it aligns with the start ATG of epsin 1. Other clones encoded identical sequences, with the exception of a deletion of amino acids 200–257, present in the majority of clones. This finding suggests the occurrence of a shorter epsin isoform (epsin 2b) resulting from alternative splicing. The presence of the two epsin 2 variants was confirmed by PCR amplification from a human brain library of the portion of the epsin 2 gene comprising this region (data not shown). A PCR-based strategy was then used to obtain from a rat brain library the nucleotide sequence of rat epsin 2. The sequence obtained does not include the 58-amino acid insert (see above). The deduced amino acid sequences of human and rat epsin 2 (accession numbers: AF062085 (human 2a), AF062084 (human 2b), and AF096296 (rat 2)) are shown in Fig.1 A, where they are aligned with each other and with rat epsin 1. Epsin 2 comprises the same main domains as epsin 1, with the NH2-terminal portion of the protein, which contains the epsin homology domain (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (epsin NH2-terminalhomology: ENTH) being the most conserved between rat epsin 1 and 2 (∼85% identity) and between human and rat epsin 2 (∼98% identity) (Fig. 1 B). This domain is present in a variety of partial and complete open reading frames from several species in the data base (Fig. 2 A), including open reading frames otherwise substantially dissimilar from epsin. It appears, therefore, to be a protein module with a conserved function from yeast to man (Fig. 2). As shown by the alignment of Fig.2 A, a few amino acids of the ENTH domain are 100% conserved in all of the sequences. The carboxyl-terminal region (NPF domain) is less conserved between epsins 1 and 2 (33% identity) but contains three NPF motifs in both proteins. This is consistent with the isolation of EHB21 as an interactor for the EH domain of Eps15 (6Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The DPW motifs of the central region (DPW domain) are only partially conserved between epsin 1 and epsin 2. This central region is the least conserved between rat epsin 1 and 2 (∼26% identity) and also between rat and human epsin 2 (∼79% identity) (Fig. 1 B). The DPW domain of epsin 2 contains the sequence LLDL, which precisely fits the core of the putative consensus for binding to clathrin (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 15Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Krupnick J.G.

TheXenopus mitotic phosphoprotein MP90 (17Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) is more similar to epsin 1 (∼51%) than to epsin 2 (∼40%), and the putative phosphorylation site for Cdc2 kinase in MP90 (17Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) is also present in the DPW domain of epsin 1 (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) but not in that of epsin 2. In Western blots, antibodies generated against a GST-EHB21 fusion protein (corresponding roughly to the NPF-containing region of epsin 2) reacted primarily with a doublet of 74- and 65-kDa bands in a human brain homogenate and a 74-kDa protein band in a rat brain homogenate (Fig. 3 A). The same antibodies recognized a 74-kDa band in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged human epsin 2 (Fig. 3 B). The 65-kDa band visible in human brain homogenate may therefore represent either an isoform or a proteolytic fragment of the 74-kDa band. A 74-kDa apparent molecular mass is only slightly higher than the predicted size of epsin 2 band based on its amino acid composition (68 kDa for human epsin 2a). In contrast, epsin 1, whose predicted size is only slightly greater than that of epsin 2, migrates with an apparent molecular mass of about 94 kDa in SDS/PAGE (Fig. 3 A). Based on the analysis of the SDS/PAGE mobility of epsin fragments, this difference is primarily due to the different mobilities of the DPW domains of epsin 1 and 2 (not shown). It is most likely due to the higher content of acidic amino acids in the DPW domain of epsin 1 (predicted pI 3.3) than in the DPW domain of epsin 2 (predicted pI 9.08). As shown in Fig. 3 B, antibodies directed against epsin 2 do not recognize epsin 1 in either brain or transfected cells. Western blot analysis of a variety of rat and human tissues demonstrated a widespread tissue distribution of the protein (Fig.4). Similar results were obtained by Northern blotting (not shown). The highest concentration of the protein was observed in brain. We next investigated the binding properties of epsin 2. Extracts of rat brain were affinity-purified on GST fusion proteins of epsin 2 fragments, and the bound proteins were revealed by Western blotting. The NPF domain bound specifically to Eps15 (Fig. 5) but not to glutamic acid decarboxylase, another abundant brain cytosolic protein (18Solimena M. De Camilli P. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 452-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) used as a control, in agreement with the isolation of the EHB21 clone as an interactor for its EH domains (6Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The DPW domain of epsin 2 bound AP-2, as revealed by the enrichment in the bound material of the AP-2 subunits, α- and β-adaptins (3Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Blotting of the material affinity-purified by this construct for a variety of endocytic proteins demonstrated that the DPW domain of epsin 2 also bound clathrin (Fig.6 B), in agreement with the presence of the clathrin binding motif LLDL in this domain (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 15Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). GST, used as a negative control, did not bind either protein, whereas amphiphysin 1, used as a positive control, bound both AP-2 and clathrin as expected (Fig. 6, Aand B). A GST fusion protein of the DPW domain of epsin 1 bound clathrin only slightly above background (not shown). We noted, however, that the sequence LMDLAD is present at the very NH2-terminal end of this construct of epsin 1, and unfavorable folding of this fusion protein may interfere with binding to clathrin. We considered the possibility that epsin 1 as well may bind clathrin and that flanking regions may be required for optimal binding of clathrin to epsin. We compared, therefore, binding of GST fusion proteins of longer epsin 1 and epsin 2 constructs (amino acids 1–401 of epsin 1 and amino acids 1–456 of epsin 2). As shown by Fig.6 C, both constructs, but not GST alone, bound similar levels of AP-2 and similar levels of clathrin. Clathrin binding was also observed when the brain extract used for the affinity purification was depleted of AP-2 by preincubation with a GST fusion protein comprising selectively the AP-2 binding domain of amphiphysin 1 (10Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (not shown). This finding strongly suggests that not only the interaction between epsin and AP-2 (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but also the interaction between epsin and clathrin, is direct. To further demonstrate a direct interaction between clathrin and epsin 1 or 2, in vitro translation experiments were performed. Epsin 1 and epsin 2 fragments corresponding to those used for Fig.6 C, amphiphysin 1 (positive control) and luciferase (negative control), were transcribed and translated in vitroand then incubated with immobilized GST or a GST fusion of the NH2-terminal domain of clathrin. This clathrin domain was previously shown to be the region of clathrin that binds the consensus sequence L(L/I)(D/E/N)(L/F)(D/E) (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As shown by Fig.7, epsin 1 and epsin 2, their ENTH-DPW domain fragments and amphiphysin 1 bound clathrin, whereas luciferase did not. None of the proteins bound GST alone (not shown). Binding of epsin 1 and 2 to clathrin was similar to that of amphiphysin 1 in this assay. Rat brain homogenate was fractionated to generate a highly enriched clathrin-coated vesicle fraction. Epsin 2 was partially recovered in the purified coated vesicles, although it did not co-enrich with clathrin and AP-2, i.e. the intrinsic components of the clathrin coat. Instead, its recovery in the clathrin-coated vesicle fraction was similar to that of Eps15 (Fig.8), epsin 1, and of other accessory proteins of the clathrin coat (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). Synapsin 2, a protein previously found to be absent from clathrin-coated vesicles (8Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) was not present in the same fraction. The subcellular localization of epsin 2 was further analyzed in cultured fibroblastic cells. Since endogenous epsin 2 was not detectable by available antibodies, epsin 2 was expressed in these cells as a GFP-tagged fusion protein. In cells expressing it at low to moderate levels, GFP-epsin 2 appeared as fine puncta sparse throughout the cell and particularly concentrated in the central region where the Golgi complex is localized. This distribution was very similar to the distribution of clathrin immunoreactivity (Fig.9, a and b). In highly expressing cells (Fig. 9, c–j), GFP-epsin 2 produced an intense and continuous labeling of the cell surface as well as one or more bright, compact masses in the central region of the cell. In these cells a major redistribution of components of the clathrin coat was observed, as shown by the collapse of clathrin, Eps15, and to a lesser extent, AP-2, into the same central mass(es) positive for GFP-epsin 2 (Fig. 9, c–h). Furthermore, in these cells, an inhibition of the internalization of Texas red-labeled transferrin was observed (Fig. 9, i and j). Similar results were obtained by using epitope-tagged epsin 2 instead of GFP-epsin 2 (data not shown). We report here the characterization of a new protein that shares significant primary sequence similarity with epsin (epsin 1) and that we have therefore defined as epsin 2. Epsin 1 and 2 have the same tripartite domain structure, similar protein binding partners, and similar subcellular localization. Furthermore, both proteins are enriched in brain. Despite these similarities, a number of differences have also emerged. The region of highest similarity between the two proteins is the NH2-terminal domain, most strikingly, the first 150 amino acids. Based on data base searches, this domain defines a new protein module conserved from yeast to man (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (epsinNH2-terminal homology domain or ENTH domain). Alignment of these sequences reveals several sites with 100% conservation and numerous other sites with conservative amino acid substitutions. It is of interest that about half of these proteins and perhaps more, due to the incomplete sequence of some of these genes, contain one or multiple NPF motifs, even if some of them do not appear to represent true orthologues of either epsin 1 or 2. Since the NPF sequence was found to represent an EH domain binding consensus, this observation suggests that a physiologically important link between ENTH domains and EH domain-mediated interactions. This protein module, first identified in epsin 1 (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), has been recently and independently discussed by Kayet al. (20Kay B.K. Yamabhai M. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The second most conserved portion in epsin 1 and 2 is the COOH-terminal region, which contains the three NPF motifs. The interaction of this region with Eps15, predicted by the expression screen that led to the isolation of the EHB21 clone, was now confirmed by affinity chromatography of Eps15. The least conserved region is the central DPW domain, which contains only 3 fully conserved DPW repeats in epsin 2, in contrast to 8 repeats in the corresponding domain of epsin 1. Most important, although this domain is very acidic in epsin 1, it has a basic isoelectric point in epsin 2. This difference correlates with the presence of a phosphorylation site for Cdc2 kinase in epsin 1 (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but not in epsin 2, and with corresponding observation that epsin 1, but not epsin 2, undergoes a phosphorylationdependent shift in electrophoretic mobility in mitotic cells (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3257-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, both DPW domains have similar AP-2 binding properties. Thus, the peculiar and distinct organization of the DPW motifs in the two proteins must have additional functions beside AP-2 binding. However, a contribution of at least some DPW repeats to AP-2 binding is plausible. It was shown previously that the unique arrangements of the multiple DPF motifs in the COOH-terminal region of Eps15 is not essential for AP-2 binding, although some of the numerous DPF motifs were found to participate in such an interaction (1Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,22Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Both epsins bind the NH2-terminal domain of clathrin. Epsin 1 and 2 contain the sequences LMDLAD and LLDLMD, respectively, at the NH2-terminal side of their DPW domains. Based on the similarity of these sequences to a previously defined consensus for clathrin binding (L(L/I)(D/E/N)(L/F)(D/E)) (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 15Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that such sequences may represent the core of the clathrin binding domain. All these findings support the hypothesis that epsin 2, like epsin 1, is implicated as an accessory factor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the partial co-localization of GFP-epsin 2 with clathrin in transfected cells and by its property, when greatly overexpressed, to mislocalize clathrin coat components and to block the clathrin-mediated internalization of transferrin. In highly overexpressing cells, a pool of GFP-epsin 2 was concentrated under the plasmamembrane despite the coalescence of clathrin coat components and of the majority of GFP-epsin 2 to the central region of the cell. It was shown previously that epsin 1 as well, when overexpressed by transfection, can reach a concentration at the cell surface that far exceeds the concentration of clathrin, AP-2, and Eps15 (5Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). One must infer that epsin 1 and 2 have binding sites in the cortical cytomatrix besides components of the clathrin coat. The partial sequences of two proteins, Ibp1 and Ibp2, intersectin-binding proteins 1 and 2, which are likely to represent mouse epsin 1 and 2, respectively, were reported while this study was in progress (22Yamabhai M.

Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), proteins of the DAP160/intersectin family may link the function of these proteins to the function of Eps15 and epsin. A picture is emerging in which formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is assisted by a variety of accessory factors that interact with each other to form large macromolecular complexes. At least one component of these complexes is a lipid-metabolizing enzyme, the inositol phosphatase synaptojanin (27McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X.M. Grabs D. Sossin W.S.

Other proteins of the complex have been linked to actin function from genetic studies in yeast and biochemical studies in mammalian tissues (28Munn A.L. Riezman H. J.

It is therefore likely that this network of protein-protein interactions may coordinate formation of a coated bud and then of a free vesicle, with changes in the actin cytoskeleton and in the lipid components of the vesicle membrane.

With respect to liver fibrosis, we have investigated differences in antioxidant enzymes expression in stellate cells (SCs) and parenchymal cells from normal and CCl4-treated rat livers. We observed an increase in the expression of catalase in activated SCs. Treatment with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) increased the production of H2O2. Treatment with catalase decreased TGF-β expression. Addition of H2O2resulted in increased TGF-β production. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole abolished the capacity of SCs to remove H2O2. A paradoxical increase in capacity was observed when the cells were pretreated with diethyl maleate. Treatment with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole increased TGF-β production. A paradoxical decrease of TGF-β production was observed with diethyl maleate. Treatment of the cells with N-acetylcysteine resulted in increased TGF-β production. TGF-β decreased the capacity of the SCs to remove H2O2. An increase in the capacity to remove H2O2 was observed when TGF-β was removed by neutralizing antibodies. In conclusion, our results suggest: 1) a link between cellular GSH levels and TGF-β production and 2) that cellular GSH levels discriminate whether H2O2 is the result of oxidative stress or acts as second messenger in the TGF-β signal transduction pathway.

In high doses, ROS are noxious to the cell leading to impaired metabolic functions, growth inhibition, and ultimately cell death (7Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells therefore employ several antioxidant enzyme systems to maintain low levels of ROS. With respect to liver fibrosis, the stellate cell is considered to be the main effector cell of liver fibrogenesis. In normal conditions, stellate cells produce controlled amounts of collagens type III and IV (8Geerts A. De Bleser P. Hautekeete M.L. Niki T. Wisse E. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 819-838Google Scholar). In fibrogenesis, stellate cells proliferate and undergo transition into myofibroblast-like cells, secreting large amounts of extracellular matrix components. This process is driven to a large extent by the autocrine and paracrine secretion of TGF-β (9Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchior R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). TGF-β has been shown to induce the production of H2O2 in several cell types such as lung fibroblasts (10Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), hepatocytes (11Kayanoki Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1993; 265: L622-L626PubMed Google Scholar). Recently ROS and, in particular H2O2, have been proposed to act as signaling mediators for a variety of growth factors such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 (14Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and TGF-β (12Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Both nuclear factor (NF)-κB and activator protein-1 were shown to be regulated by the intracellular redox state (15Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T.

Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2461-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated 1) the links between antioxidant enzymes expression and the capacity to remove extracellular H2O2 and 2) the roles of glutathione (GSH), TGF-β, and H2O2 in the control of the autocrine TGF-β loop in activated stellate cells. Our results suggest a model in which cellular GSH levels discriminate whether H2O2 is considered as oxidative stress or as second messenger in the TGF-β signal transduction pathway. Male adult Wistar rats (350–400 g) were used in all experiments. The rats were treated according to the guidelines of the Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences for the care and use of laboratory animals in research. All procedures were performed with the animals under ether anesthesia. For the isolation of cells from CCl4-treated rat livers, rats received 6 injections of CCl4 intraperitoneally. CCl4 was dissolved in an equal volume of paraffin oil. The first injection consisted of 150 μl of CCl4/100 g of body weight. Subsequent injections consisted of 100 μl of CCl4/100 g of body weight, intraperitoneally (2 injections weekly at equal intervals). Rats were sacrificed 72 h after the last injection. Parenchymal cells were isolated and purified by collagenase digestion, 1 ×g sedimentation, and low speed centrifugation according to Rogiers et al. (18Rogiers V. Paeme G. Vercruysse A. Bouwens L. Van Bezooyen C. Pharmacological, Morphological and Physiological Aspects of Liver Ageing. Eurage, Rijswijk, The Netherlands1984: 121-126Google Scholar). Stellate cells were isolated by collagenase/pronase digestion. Stellate cells were purified by centrifugation through 13% and 11% (w/v) Nycodenz (19De Bleser P. Geerts A. Van Eyken P. Vrijsen R. Lazou J.-M. Desmet V. Wisse E. Wisse E. Knook D. McCuskey R. Cells of the Hepatic Sinusoid. Kupffer Cell Foundation, Rijswijk, The Netherlands1991: 218-221Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted as described by Chomszynski and Sacchi (20Chomszynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Purity and concentration were determined by measuring light absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. For Northern hybridization analysis, 20 μg of RNA obtained from the isolated cells was electrophoresed in 1% agarose/3% paraformaldehyde gels. The gels were then stained with acridine orange (15 mg/liter in 0.01 mol/liter sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.5) for 3 min. After destaining, gels were viewed and photographed on a UV transilluminator. RNA was transferred to Hybond N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) by capillary blotting. RNA was cross-linked to the filter by UV illumination (1200 microwatts/cm2) using a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Filters were prehybridized for 2 h and subsequently hybridized overnight with cDNA probes at 42 °C. After hybridization, filters were washed at 65 °C to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Filters were exposed at −70 °C to pre-flashed Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using intensifying screens. Antisense RNA probes complementary to rat copper/zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and catalase mRNA sequences were synthesized by in vitrotranscription from linearized plasmid templates using [32P]uridine triphosphate ([α-32P]UTP, 800 Ci/mmol, ICN, Asse, Belgium) and the RNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 18S ribosomal cDNA was labeled with32P-deoxycytidine triphosphate ([32P]dCTP, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a megaprime extension kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As a control for equal loading, correct transfer, and integrity of the samples, the blots were later probed for the presence of 18 S ribosomal RNA. The cDNAs containing rat catalase, GSHPx, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD sequences were kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Tilly (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (21Tilly J.L. Tilly K.I. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 242-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5.6-kb 18 S ribosomal cDNA probe was a kind gift from Dr. R. V. Guntaka (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO). In these experiments hydrogen peroxide levels were measured by the method of Jiang et al. (22Jiang Z.Y. Woollard A.C. Wolff S.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Xylenol orange (100 μm), ammonium ferrous sulfate (250 μm), and sorbitol (100 mm) were dissolved in sulfuric acid (25 mm). Fifty μl of sample was combined with 50 μl of substrate in a 96-well microplate and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Absorbance was read at 570 nm. A standard curve was generated by including in the assay a 2-fold serial dilution of a known amount of hydrogen peroxide. For the measurement of removal rate, 300 μl of GBSS, containing 100 μm of H2O2, was added to each well of a 24-well plate, containing the cultured stellate cells. At 5-min time intervals, 50-μl portions of the medium were withdrawn and subjected to H2O2determination, as described above. Hepatic stellate cell glutathione was measured using the GSH-400 colorimetric assay for glutathione (Oxis International, Portland, ME). The method of White et al. (23White S.R. Kulp G.V. Spaethe S.M. Van Alstyne E. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 144: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was modified. The latter was based on the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.o-Phenylenediamine (16 mm) and horseradish peroxidase (1 units/ml) were dissolved in 100 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, immediately prior to use. For the assay, 50 μl of sample was combined with 75 μl of substrate in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently the reaction was quenched with sulfuric acid (3 n), and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm, using 690 nm as reference wavelength. Hydrogen peroxide levels in freshly conditioned media were measured 90 min after the addition of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/ml TGF-β. Controls consisted of media, conditioned in the presence of excess catalase. Results were presented relative to untreated cultures, taken as 100%. Intracellular peroxide levels were assessed using 2′,-7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells treated with 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/ml TGF-β for 60 min at 37 °C were incubated with 5 μm DCFDA. Micrographs were taken with the same exposure time (8 s) for all conditions. The TGF-β bioassay was essentially the one described by Tada et al. (24Tada H. Shiho O. Kuroshima K. Koyama M. Tsukamoto K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 93: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In short, CCL 64 cells (106 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates in the presence of conditioned medium for 48 h. Inhibition of cell proliferation was measured using the colorimetric bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Brussels, Belgium). Fibronectin concentrations in conditioned media of stellate cell cultures were measured using a direct ELISA. Ninety six-well ELISA plates (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with samples diluted in coating buffer (1.59 mg/ml Na2CO3, 2.93 mg/ml NaHCO3, 0.2 mg/ml NaN3, pH 9.6). Unbound antigens were washed away with washing buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Plates were blocked with Blotto-PBS (PBS, 5% skim milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing, rabbit anti-rat fibronectin (dilution, 1:8000) (Calbiochem) was added and plates were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The plates were washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled, affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (dilution, 1:8000) (Sigma). After washing, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in 10% diethanolamine buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml MgCl2·6H2O, pH 9.8) was added and the plates were incubated at room temperature up to 60 min. The optical densities were read at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, 3550-UV). At the indicated time points, the medium was removed from stellate cells cultured on coverslips. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min with acetone at −20 °C. Subsequently, the coverslips were preincubated with PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma) for 15 min and washed three times for 5 min each with PBS. Each coverslip was incubated with the primary antibody (diluted in PBS, containing 0.3% Triton X-100). A 1:1000 diluted mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4 (Sigma) raised against α-smooth muscle actin synthetic peptide was used. Incubation with the primary antibody for 18 h at 4 °C in a humid atmosphere was followed by washing three times for 5 min each with PBS and subsequent application of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dilution 1:100, for 90 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times in PBS, peroxidase was visualized by diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and H2O2. Twenty mg of DAB was dissolved in 50 ml of Tris-HCl (10 mmol/liter), pH 7.4). The solution was filtered, kept in the dark, and shortly before use, 1 ml of 1% CoCl2·6H2O and 0.8 ml of 1% Ni(NH4)2(SO4)2 were added under constant stirring. Finally, 15 μl of a 30% H2O2 solution was added. Addition of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions strongly enhanced the reaction product. Sections were incubated in the substrate solution for 10–12 min. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Controls consisted of substitution of the primary antibody by normal mouse IgG and omission of the primary antibody. They were invariably negative. Data were expressed as mean values ± S.D. Statistical analysis of the observed differences was performed using one-way blocked analysis of variance, and values were considered significant at p < 0.05. First, we examined by Northern hybridization analysis the mRNA steady state levels of catalase, GSHPx, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD in freshly isolated stellate and parenchymal cells from both normal and CCl4-treated rat livers and in stellate cells kept in culture for 3, 6, and 12 days. The results were shown in Figs. 1 and2.Figure 2Northern hybridization analysis for catalase, GSHPx , Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD mRNA, and 18 S rRNA on 20 μg of total RNA extracted from stellate cells and parenchymal cells of normal and CCl4-treated livers.While no catalase RNA expression was found in stellate cells of normal livers, strong expression was found in stellate cells derived from fibrotic animals. Little variation was observed in the levels of expression of catalase mRNA between normal and CCl4-treated parenchymal cells and in the levels of expression of GSHPx, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD mRNA between stellate cells and parenchymal cells from both normal and fibrotic livers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Whereas strong signals for catalase mRNA were found in freshly isolated stellate cells from fibrotic animals and in culture-activated stellate cells, freshly isolated stellate cells of normal livers did not express catalase mRNA. Using ribosomal RNAs as size standards, the catalase cRNA recognized a mRNA species of approximately 2.7 kb. No differences in steady state catalase mRNA levels were found when total RNA of parenchymal cells derived from normal livers was compared with that of fibrotic rat livers (Fig. 2). The GSHPx cRNA recognized a mRNA of approximately 1.2 kb. In stellate cells, isolated from fibrotic animals, the levels of GSHPx expression tended to be slightly increased as compared with the levels observed in stellate cells from normal animals. In parenchymal cells derived from fibrotic animals, the level of GSHPx expression was decreased as compared with normal parenchymal cells. With time in culture, the levels of GSHPx mRNA expression tended to decrease. The cRNA for Cu/Zn-SOD detected a transcript with the size of approximately 0.9 kb. We found no differences in the levels of transcription in the stellate cells derived from fibrotic animals as compared with freshly isolated stellate cells from normal livers. The level of expression in parenchymal cells from fibrotic animals was lower than in normal parenchymal cells. Again, there was a slight tendency for decrease in the level of transcription with the time the stellate cells were cultured. The cRNA for Mn-SOD detected multiple bands in our blots. The minor bands corresponded to transcript sizes of approximately 4.1, 3.5, and 2.2 kb, the predominant band to a transcript size of approximately 1.2 kb. No expression could be detected in RNA extracted from freshly isolated stellate cells and parenchymal cells from both normal and fibrotic rat livers. Mn-SOD mRNA was transiently expressed in cultured stellate cells. No expression was observed in freshly isolated stellate cells. Strongest expression was observed at day 3 in culture and decreased at days 6 and 12. Considering the results obtained with the freshly isolated cells, the major observation was the induction of expression of catalase in stellate cells from fibrotic animals. This was also reflected in culture-activated stellate cells. From the third day in culture onwards, we observed strong signals for catalase mRNA. This observation suggested that activated stellate cells were better equipped than quiescent stellate cells to remove efficiently H2O2. Using a xylenol orange assay, the kinetics of H2O2 removal was determined in cultures of stellate cells, kept in culture for 3 days, and in cultures of activated stellate cells, kept in culture for 9 days. The latter cells showed clear morphological signs of activation. Cells were challenged to 100 μm H2O2, and every 5 min the remaining H2O2 concentration was measured. The results were shown in Fig. 3. Whereas the rate of H2O2 removal by activated stellate cells was first order with an half-life of approximately 7 min, the same number of 3-day-old stellate cells was not able to remove efficiently added H2O2. As most cells had two antioxidant enzymes able to remove H2O2, catalase and GSHPx, we tried to identify which of the two enzymes was responsible for H2O2 breakdown using specific inhibitors. These were, respectively, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AMT) and diethyl maleate (DEM) (Fig. 4). When the cells were challenged with 100 μm H2O2 (Fig.4 A), pre-treatment with 8 mm AMT abolished almost completely the capacity of activated stellate cells to remove H2O2. A paradoxical, opposite effect was obtained when the cells were pre-treated with 1 mm DEM. This indicated that the capacity to remove the added H2O2 was due to catalase rather than GSHPx. As GSHPx is more effective at low H2O2concentrations, the cells were also challenged with 10 μmH2O2 (Fig. 4 B). At this concentration, DEM-treated cells removed H2O2less efficiently than controls. Fibrogenesis is driven by the autocrine expression of TGF-β by activated stellate cells. TGF-β has been shown to induce the production of H2O2 in several cell types such as lung fibroblasts (10Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), hepatocytes (11Kayanoki Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), osteoblastic cells (12Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and aortic endothelial cells (13Thannickal V.J. Hassoun P.M. White A.C. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L622-L626PubMed Google Scholar). If the autocrine TGF-β loop in stellate cells were mediated by H2O2, then increased expression of catalase could be a physiological adaptation to the high levels of H2O2 generated in the cells following exposure to TGF-β. In the following experiments, we investigated this hypothesis. Both in quiescent (Fig.5 A) and activated (Fig.5 B) stellate cells, the levels of hydrogen peroxide increased in a dose-dependent way with the amount of TGF-β added. At a concentration of 20 ng/ml TGF-β, a 300% increase of hydrogen peroxide concentration was observed. To confirm these results, the intracellular oxidized states were determined using the highly sensitive fluorescent assay with DCFDA. Quiescent stellate cells were treated with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 60 min at 37 °C. DCFDA (5 μm) was added, and micrographs were taken with an epifluorescence photo-microscope, using the same exposure time for all samples. Increasing concentrations of TGF-β resulted in increased fluorescence (Fig. 5 C). Conditioned media were prepared from 8-day old, activated stellate cell cultures treated with 0, 10, 20, and 40 μm H2O2 for 16 h. Next, the media were assayed for TGF-β activity using a bioassay. The results were shown in Fig. 6 A. Untreated stellate cells produced 75 pg/ml TGF-β. With increasing concentrations of H2O2, TGF-β synthesis reached a concentration of 261 pg/ml at 40 μmH2O2, corresponding to an approximately 3-fold increase as compared with the untreated cells. As the added H2O2 is rapidly removed by the cells (Fig. 3), this is rather a model for acute oxidative stress. To investigate what happens under conditions of chronic oxidative stress, we studied the effect of treating the cells with 0, 12.5, 25, and 50 μmmenadione. While untreated cells produced 324 pg/ml TGF-β, addition of menadione resulted in a dramatic decrease of TGF-β production (Fig. 6 B). We investigated the effect of extracellular catalase (Fig.7 A), AMT (Fig. 7 B), and DEM (Fig. 7 C) on the production of TGF-β by 8-day-old, activated stellate cells in culture. At this time point, the autocrine TGF-β loop in stellate cells was well established (25Gressner A.M. Bachem M.G. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 30-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Untreated stellate cells synthesized 189 pg/ml active TGF-β per 24 h. Stellate cells conditioned in the presence of 100 units/ml catalase synthesized 37 pg/ml active TGF-β per 24 h, corresponding to a 5-fold decrease in the level of active TGF-β (Fig. 6 A). Stellate cells conditioned in the presence of 4 mm AMT per 24 h synthesized 318 pg/ml active TGF-β (70% increase). At a concentration of 8 mm AMT, stellate cells produced 524 pg/ml active TGF-β (277% increase) per 24 h (Fig.7 B). Treatment of stellate cells with DEM resulted paradoxically in a decrease of TGF-β production. While control cells synthesized 970 pg/ml active TGF-β, treatment with 0.25 mm DEM resulted in a production of 60 pg/ml TGF-β, corresponding to a 16-fold decrease in active TGF-β production (Fig.7 C). TGF-β has been shown to stimulate both fibronectin synthesis and transdifferentiation of stellate cells into myofibroblast-like cells (9Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchior R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). If H2O2 acts as a mediator in the TGF-β signal transduction pathway, than removal of H2O2 by exogenous catalase should attenuate both the effect of TGF-β on fibronectin synthesis and stellate cell activation. These hypotheses were tested in the next experiments. Conditioned media were prepared from stellate cell cultures treated with different concentrations of catalase. These media were assayed for fibronectin using a specific ELISA. The results were shown in Fig. 8. Untreated stellate cell cultures synthesized 51 ng/ml fibronectin. With increasing concentrations of catalase, the synthesis of fibronectin decreased in a dose-dependent way, reaching a concentration of 5 ng/ml at 1000 units/ml catalase. Freshly isolated stellate cells were cultured on coverslips for 3, 6, and 9 days. One group was left untreated (control), while the other half was treated with catalase (500 units/ml) from the second day onwards. At the indicated time points, the cells were fixed and stained for α-smooth muscle actin, a marker for stellate cell activation. The results were shown in Fig. 9. In the untreated group (Fig. 9, left panels), staining for α-smooth muscle actin became strong from day 6 onward and was localized in cytoplasmic filaments. When the stellate cells were treated with catalase (Fig. 9, right panels), the cells remained smaller, and α-smooth muscle actin staining was much less pronounced and was localized mainly around the nuclei. These observations suggested that activation was retarded by addition of catalase. Two paradoxical events emerged from the DEM treatment of stellate cells; first, these cells removed H2O2 more efficiently than control cells and, second, the production of TGF-β in these cells was dramatically decreased. This latter observation suggested a link between cellular GSH levels and the autocrine TGF-β loop. As the increased breakdown of H2O2 by DEM-treated cells could be due to the removal of TGF-β from the system, we also investigated the effects of 1) adding excess TGF-β to the cells and 2) removal of TGF-β from the system by using neutralizing antibodies. The results were shown in Fig. 10. Treatment of the cells with neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies (50 μg/ml) resulted in a strong increase in the capacity of the cells to remove H2O2, reminiscent of the effect observed with DEM (Fig. 10 A). The opposite effect was observed when the cells were treated with excess TGF-β (5 ng/ml). This resulted in a decrease in the capacity of the cells to remove H2O2, mimicking the effect of AMT (Fig.10 B). As the above data suggested the existence of a link between cellular GSH levels and TGF-β production, we also investigated the effects of treating the cells with various concentrations of NAC on TGF-β production (Fig. 11). NAC was used to provide extra cysteine for de novo glutathione synthesis (26Shan Z. Tan D. Satriano J. Silbiger S. Schlondorff D. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 388-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). While untreated cells produced 21 pg/ml TGF-β, treatment with 2.5, 5, or 10 mm NAC increased TGF-β production with 33–40%. Treatment with 20 mm NAC increased TGF-β production approximately 3-fold. Under these conditions, the cells produced 59 pg/ml TGF-β. TGF-β is generally considered to be the main mediator of fibrogenesis. TGF-β induces its own expression in stellate cells thereby creating a self-perpetuating circle of events (9Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchior R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recently ROS and, in particular, H2O2 have been proposed to act as signaling mediators for tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 (14Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and TGF-β (12Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based on the observations that these growth factors were able to induce the production of H2O2 in several cell types (10Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 11Kayanoki Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1993; 265: L622-L626PubMed Google Scholar) and that both NF-κB and activator protein-1 were regulated by the intracellular redox state (15Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 16Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). A direct consequence of this model is that cells must be able to discriminate between H2O2 produced by oxidative stress and H2O2 acting as second messenger in signal transduction pathways. In the present paper, we propose a model that discriminates between these possibilities. First, we investigated the differences in anti-oxidant enzyme expression in parenchymal and stellate cells from both normal and fibrotic rat livers and culture-activated stellate cells. We found that the expression of catalase mRNA was strongly induced in activated stellate cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, activated, but not quiescent, stellate cells were able to remove efficiently exogenously added H2O2. As catalase removes specifically H2O2 this suggested a special role for H2O2 in the activation of stellate cells. Our current hypothesis concerning the relationship between TGF-β and oxidative stress is that the autocrine TGF-β loop in stellate cells is mediated by endogenously produced H2O2. In support of this hypothesis, we showed that TGF-β1 increased the levels of H2O2 in the medium of cultured hepatic stellate cells. This increase was abolished by adding catalase, indicating that H2O2 was the major cause of the increased oxidized state. TGF-β1 also increased the intracellular peroxide levels of the stellate cell, as was demonstrated by DCFDA and fluorescence microscopy. The role of H2O2 as a mediator in the TGF-β signal transduction pathway was studied by investigating the effect of modulating the cellular H2O2 levels on both the production of TGF-β and the synthesis of fibronectin. Treatment of culture-activated stellate cells with catalase resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of both TGF-β production and fibronectin synthesis. In parallel, the spontaneous differentiation into the myofibroblast-like phenotype was retarded, as evidenced by staining for α-smooth muscle actin, a stellate cell activation marker. This result was in support of the finding by Lee et al. (17Lee K.S. Buck M. Houglum K. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2461-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), in which the antioxidant,d-α-tocopherol, blocked the activation of stellate cells cultured on plastic, as assessed by α-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry. When, conversely, the stellate cells were treated with a pulse of H2O2, an increase in the production of TGF-β was observed. This observation is in support of the data by Garcı́a-Trevijano et al. (27Garcia-Trevijano E.R. Iraburu M.J. Fontana L. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Auster A. Covarrubias-Pinedo A. Rojkind M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 960-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), who found that H2O2 treatment of stellate cells resulted in the up-regulation of α1(I) procollagen mRNA. This gene is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level by TGF-β (28Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Decreased TGF-β production by DEM-treated stellate cells suggested a link between cellular GSH content and the extent of the autocrine TGF-β loop. This hypothesis was verified by treating stellate cells with increasing concentrations of NAC, a precursor of GSH (26Shan Z. Tan D. Satriano J. Silbiger S. Schlondorff D. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 388-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which resulted in increased production of TGF-β. A similar observation was reported by Shan et al. (26Shan Z. Tan D. Satriano J. Silbiger S. Schlondorff D. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 388-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), who found that treatment of mesangial cells with NAC resulted in a 40% increase of TGF-β mRNA expression. Kidney mesangial cells and hepatic stellate cells are both of mesenchymal origin and share many characteristics including extracellular matrix production and vitamin A storage (29Bauer P. Wake K. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1996; 59: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Considering that 1) the cellular GSH content is linked to the extent of the autocrine TGF-β loop, 2) DEM-treated cells remove H2O2 more efficiently than control cells, 3) removal of TGF-β from the system with neutralizing antibodies results in a strong increase in the efficiency of H2O2break-down, and (4Pietrangelo A. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) addition of excess TGF-β to the system results in the opposite effect, we postulate that cellular GSH may play a role in discriminating between exogenous oxidative stress and H2O2 generated in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This model is summarized in Fig.12. Exogenous oxidative stress (Fig. 12, left panel) is essentially a diffusion process, i.e. the initial H2O2 concentrations that enter the cell will be low. As it is generally accepted that GSHPx is more effective at low H2O2 concentration (30Makino N. Mochizuki Y. Bannai S. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1020-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this will result in the consumption of GSH necessary for its detoxification. Since our experiments demonstrated that the cellular GSH content was linked to the autocrine TGF-β loop, this will result in abrogation of TGF-β production. All H2O2 will be considered as oxidative stress and will be efficiently removed. The same happens when TGF-β is removed from the system with neutralizing antibodies (Fig.10 A). When, however, H2O2 is generated intracellularly in the TGF-β signaling pathway (Fig. 12,right panel), its concentration may locally reach high concentrations, making GSHPx less efficient for its detoxification. In addition, it was shown by Thannickal et al. (13Thannickal V.J. Hassoun P.M. White A.C. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L622-L626PubMed Google Scholar) that TGF-β-induced H2O2production in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells occurs at a site inaccessible to detoxification by GSH. In this case, the cellular GSH concentrations will remain high and the autocrine TGF-β loop will not be interrupted. In this event, H2O2 will be considered as mediator in the signaling transduction pathway. Moreover, addition of excess TGF-β further decreases the capacity of the cells to remove H2O2 (Fig. 10 B), resulting in higher intracellular H2O2concentrations. The fact that treatment of stellate cells with a single initial dose of H2O2 resulted in an increase in TGF-β production is not in contradiction with our model. In this experimental approach, the added H2O2 is rapidly removed by the stellate cells. This will not lead to depletion of the cellular glutathione stores, and the cells may consequently consider this H2O2 as a mediator in the signal transduction pathway. The opposite was observed when chronic oxidative stress was applied by treating the cells with menadione, a redox cycler. In this case, TGF-β production was strongly decreased, as expected when glutathione becomes depleted. In conclusion, 1) activation of stellate cells results in a strong increase of catalase expression; 2) activated but not quiescent stellate cells are able to remove efficiently added H2O2; 3) this capacity is due to catalase, rather than GSH peroxidase; 4) TGF-β stimulates stellate cells to produce H2O2; 5) H2O2levels, TGF-β activity, and differentiation are closely linked, suggesting a role for H2O2 as a mediator in the TGF-β signal transduction cascade in stellate cells; 6) increased catalase expression may provide a way for the stellate cells to control cellular H2O2 levels and indirectly the autocrine TGF-β loop; 7) there is a link between cellular GSH levels and TGF-β production; and 8) cellular GSH levels discriminate whether H2O2 is considered as oxidative stress or as second messenger in the TGF-β signaling pathway.

The initial cleavage of the prodomain of PCs does not result in the immediate activation of the enzyme; rather the prosegment appears to remain tightly associated with the convertase until it reaches its final cellular destination. At this point, the increase in H+ and/or Ca2+ concentrations in the TGN or secretory granules triggers a secondary cleavage(s), resulting in the dissociation of the prosegment (12Anderson E.D.

In response to these challenges, we have begun exploring the possibility that prosegments of PCs can be employed to inhibit specifically and efficiently the processing of cellular substrate proproteins. Here we examine the in vitro and ex vivo inhibitory characteristics and specificities of the prosegments of furin and PC7. Synthetic peptides derived from these prosegments are used to identify the regions of these molecules that are most important for potent inhibition. We then explored whether cellular overexpression of the preprosegments of furin and PC7 can, acting in trans as independent domains, inhibit the PC-mediated maturation of two neurotrophin precursors ex vivo. The bacterial expression vector pET24b (+) (Novagen) was cut with 5′ NdeI and 3′ BamHI to remove the N-terminal T7 tag. It was then ligated with a linker composed of pre-annealed sense 5′ TACACATATG 3′ and antisense 5′ GATCCATATGTG 3′ oligonucleotides (the underlined codon represents the initiator Met, which is followed in the recombinant vector by an Asp-Pro sequence). The cDNAs coding for the N-terminal prosegments of human furin (aa 27–107 of hfurin (42van den Ouweland A.M. van Duijnhoven H.L. Keizer G.D. Dorssers L.C. Van de Ven W.J.M.

The hfurin and rPC7 oligonucleotides used were as follows: sense (5′ GGATCCGCAGAAGGTCTTCACCAACACGT 3′ and 5′ GGATCCGCTAACAGAGGCAGGTGGTCTTG 3′) and antisense, which contains a hexa-His anti-coding sequence (5′ CTCGAGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCCGTTTAGTCCG 3′ and 5′ CTCGAGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGCGCTTGGCCCT 3′), respectively. These 277- and 346-bp cDNAs were cloned into the PCR 2.1 TA cloning vector for sequencing and then were transferred into theBamHI/XhoI sites of the above modified bacterial expression vector pET 24b. These recombinants were transformed into theEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, after which the cultures were grown for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g. Since the prosegments were localized to the inclusion bodies, the cell pellets were sonicated on ice in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.9). The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml column containing a Ni2+-immobilized resin (Novagen), pre-equilibrated at room temperature with binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole in order to eliminate weakly bound species. Elution was then carried out with the same buffer now containing 1 m imidazole. The eluant was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 4 °C overnight. The prosegments were further purified with a Varian 9050/9010 instrument by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a 5-μm C4 column (0.94 × 25 cm; Vydac). After binding in an aqueous phase containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, proteins were eluted at 2 ml/min with a 1%/min linear gradient (10–70%) of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN (monitored at 210 nm). The purity, concentrations, and masses of the prosegments were determined by Coomassie staining of 15% Tricine/SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.1), quantitative amino acid analysis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. All Fmoc protected amino acid derivatives (l-configuration), the coupling reagents, and the solvents were purchased from PE Biosystems Inc. (Framingham, MA), Calbiochem, and Richelieu Biotechnologies (Montréal, Québec, Canada). The furin-derived synthetic peptides are as follows: Fur-M15,62GDYYHFWHRGVTKRS76; Fur-C24,84HSRLQREPQVQWLEQQVAKRRTKR107; Fur-C10,98QQVAKRRTKR107; and Fur-C10A,98QQVAKRRTKA107. The rPC7-derived synthetic peptides are as follows: PC7-N20,39EAGGLDTLGAGGLSWAVHLD58; PC7-M18,86GRIGELQGHYLFVQPAGH103; PC7-C24,117EAVLAKHEAVRWHSEQRLLKRAKR140; PC7-C18, 123HEAVRWHSEQRLLKRAKR140; PC7-C10,131EQRLLKRAKR140; and PC7-C18A,123HEAVRWHSEQRLLKRAKA140. The PC7 N-20, M-18, C-24, and C-18 as well as the furin M-15, and C-24 peptides were kindly provided by Dr. Feng Ni (the Biotechnology Research Institute, Montréal, Canada), all other peptides were synthesized with the C terminus in the amide form (CONH2), on a solid phase automated peptide synthesizer instrument (Pioneer), PE Biosystems, following theO-hexafluorophospho-[7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl]-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium)/diisopropyl ethyl amine-mediated Fmoc chemistry. All syntheses were accomplished using an unloaded polyamino linker-polyethylene glycol resin. The following side chain-protecting groups were used: 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran 5-sulfonyl for Arg;t-butyl for Ser, Thr, Asp, and Tyr, and trityl for His, Asn, and Gln, respectively. The crude peptides were cleaved from the resin and fully deprotected by 3 h treatment with reagent B (trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/water/triisopropyl silane = 88:5:5:2). The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a semi-preparative CSC-Exsil C18 column (0.94 × 25 cm, Chromatography Specialty Co.), followed by further purification on a ultrasphere C18 analytical column (0.46 × 25 cm, Beckman) following the conditions as described above. High performance liquid chromatography fractions were mixed with one of two matrix solutions as follows: 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) for prosegments, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) for synthetic peptides. Spectra were obtained on a Voyageur DE-Pro MALDI-TOF instrument (PE PerSeptive Biosystems).

In particular, they have been implicated in the membrane trafficking events by which membranes and proteins are sorted into vesicles and targeted to various cell compartments (1De Camilli P. Emr S.D.

Golgi-to-vacuole trafficking of membranes and proteins inSaccharomyces cerevisiae has provided a very informative system for the study of phosphoinositide-dependent membrane trafficking, because it is not essential for growth and so lends itself to mutational analysis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)1 that is made by the phosphatidylinositol kinase Vps34p is essential for the targeting of proteins from the Golgi to the yeast prevacuolar compartment and also for the prevacuolar compartment-to-vacuole trafficking step (2Schu P.V.

J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we predicted that ScFab1p would be the first member of a novel family of PtdInsP kinases (PIPkins) that would be dedicated to PtdIns(3,5)P 2synthesis: the PtdIns3P 5-kinases of other organisms would be their Fab1p homologues (3Cooke F.T.

We suggested that an appropriate general name for this group of enzymes would be “Type III PIPkins,” to distinguish them from Type I PIPkins (which are PtdIns4P5-kinases) and Type II PIPkins (which are PtdIns5P4-kinases) (for a recent review, see Ref. 8Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Irvine R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Shisheva et al. (9Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have recently suggested that p235, a murine protein that displays extensive homology to ScFab1p, has PtdIns 5-kinase activity. Moreover, Tolias et al. (10Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) observed that a recombinant Type I PIPkin can make PtdIns(3,5)P 2 from PtdIns3P in lipid kinase assays and suggested that enzymes of this type may make PtdIns(3,5)P 2 in vivo in mammalian cells. Taken alone, however, such enzyme assays in vitro do not unambiguously define the biological substrate specificities of inositol lipid kinases. In order to determine what lipids the Fab1p-like kinases make in vivo, we therefore determined in what ways the expression of a mammalian Type Iβ PIPkin, the murine Fab1p-like protein p235, or the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Fab1p (SpFab1p) would change the endogenously synthesized phosphoinositide complements of yeasts carrying mutants of MSS4 (which encodes PtdIns4P 5-kinase) and of yeasts in which theFAB1 gene was knocked out. The conditional-lethalmss4-1 mutants that we used have a reduced PtdIns(4,5)P 2 content (our data); such mutants show defects in their actin cytoskeleton (11Desrivières S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J.

Strain SDY500 was constructed by mating the 616-3-2 (fab1-1) strain with SEY6210 and sporulating the resulting diploids to recover haploid segregants. The complete upstream and coding sequence of the ScFAB1 gene, as a NotI-XhoI restriction fragment, was excised from pEMY105 and ligated into theNotI-Xho I sites of the single-copy pRS416 vector. The resulting plasmid was designated pFABCEN. Plasmid pRM19 was constructed by ligating the entire SpFAB1 ORF (amplified using Pwo polymerase from genomic S. pombe DNA using primers that inserted BamHI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends) into the BglII site of pYO2144. The SpFAB1 ORF was cloned into the BamHI restriction site of pEG-KT to generate plasmid pRM22. The p235s splice variant, which lacks 11 amino acids from a region upstream of the FYVE domain (9Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell.

The 5′ and 3′ ends of the p235s ORF were polymerase chain reaction-tagged withXbaI and SalI restriction sites, respectively and ligated with XbaI-XhoI-restricted pVT102U to produce plasmid pRM24. For in vitro characterization,XbaI-SalI-tagged p235s was cloned into theXbaI and SalI sites of pEG-KT, producing pRM23.

As appropriate, cells were subjected to hyperosmotic shock by the addition of 1.8 m NaCl to a final concentration of 0.9 m. For comparison between strains, the levels of radioactivity were corrected by standardizing the counts against glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns), glycero-phosphoinositol 3-phosphate (GroPIns3P), and glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate (GroPIns4P), as appropriate. Experiments reported (performed in duplicate) are representative of at least two independent experiments that gave similar results. For use as standards, [14C]glycerophosphoinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate ([14C]GroPIns(3,5)P 2), and [14C]glycerophosphoinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate ([14C]GroPIns(4,5)P 2) from [14C]inositol-labeled yeast were isolated and deacylated as described elsewhere (20Dove S.K. Michell R.H. Milligan G. Signalling Research: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1999: 255-281Google Scholar). Purified [14C]GroPInsP ns were stored in buffered solutions (10–15 mm HEPES KOH, pH 7.5) at −80 °C. [32P]GroPIns5Pwas prepared by dephosphorylating [32P]GroPIns(3,5)P 2using washed erythrocyte ghosts as described previously (21Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F.

Plasmids pRM22 and pRM23 were introduced into strain fab1-Δ1 using standard techniques and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura). Liquid cultures were grown overnight in SC-Ura plus 2% (w/v) raffinose, supplemented with all other amino acids. 200 ml of SC-Ura containing 2% (w/v) raffinose was then inoculated to 4 × 105 cells·ml−1 and grown for 12–16 h. Cells were diluted to 4 × 106cells·ml−1 in SC-Ura/2% (w/v) raffinose/2% (w/v) galactose, grown for a further 5 h, harvested, and lysed using a GlasCol Bio-Nebuliser. GST-fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose as before (3Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr.

Phosphoinositide kinase assays on recombinant Fab1p, SpFab1p and p235 proteins were performed according to Cooke et al. (3Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N.

GroPInsP ns were resolved on a Partisphere 5 μm SAX column (Whatman) using gradient 1 (23Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Downes C.P. Biochem.

For separating all known isomers of GroPInsP, the novel SD001 gradient based on Buffers A (water) and B (1.25 m(NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.8) was used at a flow rate of 1 ml·min−1: 0 min, 0% B; 5 min, 0% B; 20 min, 2% B; 100 min, 2% B; 120 min, 12% B; 140 min, 12% B; 180 min, 80% B; 200 min, 80% B; 205 min, 0% B. At least one sample from each strain of yeast was spiked with internal [32P]GroPIns5P, [14C]GroPIns(3,5)P 2, and [14C]GroPIns(4,5)P 2standards to confirm their retention times. Radioactivity eluting from the column was quantified either by an on-line Radiomatic Flow detector (A520) with a 1 ml flow cell (Packard), or by collecting 30 s fractions, mixing with 3–4 ml of Ultima Flo AP (Packard), and then determining [3H]/[14C] ratios by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. We tested whether expression of the presumptive murine Fab1p-like protein (protein p235 of Shisheva et al. (9Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell.

In pFABCEN cells, which express a single copy of the ScFAB1gene behind its own promoter, PtdIns(3,5)P 2synthesis is restored (Fig. 1,right), the vacuoles revert to a multilobed morphology similar to that of wild-type cells (Fig.2 a), and the otherwise temperature-sensitive fab1-1 cells grow at their restrictive temperature (Fig. 2 b).Figure 2p235, a mammalian Fab1p homologue, complements the phenotypic defects of Δfab1cells and catalyzes PtdIns(3,5)P 2synthesis in vivo. a, p235 expression partially suppressed the vacuolar morphological defects offab1::LEU2 cells. The vacuoles of strains transformed with plasmids pRM24 (fab1::LEU2 + p235) and pFABCEN (fab1::LEU2 + pFABCEN) and with the empty pRS424 vector (fab1::LEU2) were stained with FM4–64 and photographed (rhodamine channel). b, FAB1 homologues were tested for their ability to complement temperature-sensitive fab1-1 mutants at the restrictive temperature. Strains expressing p235 on a multicopy plasmid (pRM24) orFAB1 on a single-copy plasmid (pFABCEN) were streaked on SC-Ura plates and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days; fab1-1transformed with empty pRS416 and pVT102U plasmids served as controls.c, anion-exchange HPLC analysis of GroPInsP ns in a p235-expressingfab1::LEU2 strain.

Moreover, p235 restored the ability of Δfab1 cells, which make no PtdIns(3,5)P 2 (3Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr.

However, hyperosmotic stress (0.9 m NaCl for 1–10 min) provoked no increase in PtdIns(3,5)P 2synthesis in the p235-expressing cells (Fig. 1, right; Fig.2 c, right panel): this type of stress provokes rapid PtdIns(3,5)P 2 synthesis in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (6Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H.

The negative result obtained with p235 is consistent with the fact that none of the mammalian cell lines we have tested have shown enhanced PtdIns(3,5)P 2 synthesis when hyperosmotically stressed (6Dove S.K.

Michell, unpublished results. Under some experimental conditions in vitro, p235 synthesizes a phosphoinositide that appears to be PtdIns5P(9Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 49Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, we never detected any PtdIns5P in yeast lipids that were analyzed by an HPLC method that resolves deacylated PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P and PtdIns5P, even in the p235-expressing cells (Fig. 2 c, left panel). Moreoverin vitro, recombinant p235 phosphorylated PtdIns3P much more readily than PtdIns or PtdIns4P under the experimental conditions under which we previously defined the PtdIns3P 5-kinase activity of ScFab1p (Fig. 3 a). When PtdInsP 2 spots from such PtdIns3Pkinase assays were deacylated, the resulting GroPInsP 2 co-chromatographed with GroPIns(3,5)P 2, confirming that PtdIns(3,5)P 2 was synthesized (Fig.3 c). p235 preferentially synthesized PtdIns(3,5)P 2, even when the only PtdIns3P present was a contaminant present in commercially available PtdIns and PtdIns4P preparations. We conclude that p235 serves solely as a PtdIns3P 5-kinase in vivoand that its main activity in kinase assays in vitro is the 5-phosphorylation of PtdIns3P. Expression of SpFab1p also restored the ability of Δfab1cells to make a basal concentration of PtdIns(3,5)P 2 similar to that present in wild-type cells (∼5% of the concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P 2) and about half of that present in pFABCEN cells (Fig. 1, right; Fig.4 a, left panel). SpFab1p-expressing cells showed a modest increase in PtdIns(3,5)P 2 synthesis in response to hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 4 a, right panel). There was an approximately 2-fold elevation in PtdIns(3,5)P 2concentration, as compared with a 14-fold increase in cells expressing ScFAB1 from a single-copy plasmid (Fig. 1,right). This behavior is similar to that of strains carrying the fab1–2 temperature-sensitive allele of ScFAB1, which at restrictive temperatures show only a 2-fold stimulation in PtdIns(3,5)P 2 in response to hyperosmotic shock (3Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1219-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with p235, expression of SpFab1p neither complemented the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of fab1-1 cells (data not shown) nor corrected the vacuolar morphology of fab1::LEU2cells (Fig. 4 b). However, when recombinant SpFab1p was assayed for lipid kinase activity in vitro, it was an active PtdInsP kinase that showed a marked preference for PtdIns3P as a substrate (Fig. 3 a). Deacylation of the product and co-chromatography with a GroPIns(3,5)P 2 standard confirmed that the PtdInsP 2 synthesized was PtdIns(3,5)P 2 (Fig. 3 b). We examined the effect of expressing a Type I PIPkin and the Fab1p proteins in strain YOC808, which is wild-type for theFAB1 gene but harbors the temperature-sensitiveMSS4 allele mss4-1. YOC808 cells fail to grow at 37 °C, at least partly because of defects in their actin cytoskeleton, and this fault is overcome by overexpression of a mammalian Type I PIPkin (12Homma K. Terui S. Minemura M. Qadota H. Anraku Y. Kanaho Y. Ohya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15779-15786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To confirm that the mss4-1lesion limits PtdIns(4,5)P 2 synthesis, the PtdIns(4,5)P 2 content of YOC808 cells was analyzed at 23 °C and after 2 h at the restrictive temperature (38 °C). Even at the lower temperature, the mss4-1 cells contained about one-quarter of the [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P 2 of wild-type cells (Fig. 5, a versus b; Fig.6, left). When the temperature was raised, the wild-type cells increased their PtdIns(4,5)P 2 complement but PtdIns(4,5)P 2 declined further in themss4-1 cells (Fig. 6, left). Expression of Type Iβ PIPkin in these cells restored their PtdIns(4,5)P 2 content to a level somewhat higher than that of wild-type cells, confirming that the Type Iβ PIPkin is an active PtdIns4P 5-kinase in yeast (Fig. 5 c). Expression of a mammalian Type II PIPkin, described as a PtdIns5P 4-kinase (25Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), had no effect on the PtdIns(4,5)P 2 complement (not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2044994826,"Ndr is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to a subfamily of kinases implicated in the regulation of cell division and cell morphology. This subfamily includes the kinases LATS, Orb6, Cot-1, and Dbf2. We show here that Ndr is potently activated when intact cells are treated with okadaic acid, suggesting that Ndr is normally held in a state of low activity by protein phosphatase 2A. We mapped the regulatory phosphorylation sites of Ndr protein kinase and found that active Ndr is phosphorylated on Ser-281 and Thr-444. Mutation of either site to alanine strongly reduced both basal and okadaic acid-stimulated Ndr activity, while combined mutation abolished Ndr activity completely. Importantly, each of these sites (and also the surrounding sequences) are conserved in the kinase relatives of Ndr, suggesting a general mechanism of activation for kinases of this subfamily. Ser-281 and Thr-444 are also similar to the regulatory phosphorylation sites in several targets of the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1.1 However, PDK1 does not appear to function as an upstream kinase for Ndr. Thus, Ndr and its close relatives may operate in a novel signaling pathway downstream of an as-yet-unidentified kinase with specificity similar to, but distinct from, PDK1.

Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons show that, within the protein kinase superfamily, Ndr is most closely related to a subgroup of kinases known to be important in the control of cell growth, cell division, and cell morphology. This subgroup is exemplified by the kinases LATS, Orb6, Cot-1 (50–60% catalytic domain identity with Ndr) and Dbf2 (40% catalytic domain identity with Ndr). Several indications suggest that kinases of this type function, either directly or indirectly, as negative regulators of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes. The mammalian LATS kinase (also called Wts) is the product of a tumor suppressor gene and possesses an NH2-terminal domain that is able to directly interact with and inhibit Cdc2 (2St. John M.A. Tao W. Fei X. Fukumoto R. Carcangiu M.L. Brownstein D.G. Parlow A.F. McGrath J. Xu T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 3Tao W. Zhang S. Turenchalk G.S. Stewart R.A. St John M.A. Chen W. Xu T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, LATS interacts genetically with Cdc2 in Drosophila. Orb6 overexpression delays the onset of mitosis in fission yeast, and this effect is dependent upon the presence of a functional Wee1 protein, implying that Orb6 can signal through Wee1 to down-regulate Cdc2 activity (4Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Dbf2 is part of a network of genes required for down-regulation of Cdc28-cyclin B at the end of mitosis in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (5Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Tinker-Kulberg R.L. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Dbf2 is transiently activated at the metaphase/anaphase transition, coincident with changes in its phosphorylation status, and mutation of Dbf2 causes cells to arrest in late mitosis with high Cdc28 activity (6Toyn J.H. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Finally, the Cot-1 protein of Neurospora crassa is required for hyphal elongation, although it is not known how Cot-1 functions in this process (7Yarden O. Plamann M. Ebbole D.J. Yanofsky C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2159-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Ndr thus belongs to a subfamily of kinases that are important in cell growth control. Because of the high degree of homology between the members of this kinase subgroup, it is probable that they share, at least to some extent, related substrates and that they are subject to similar regulation.In the current work, we have analyzed the regulation of Ndr protein kinase with regard to phosphorylation. Although some members of the kinase family to which Ndr belongs are known to exist as phosphoproteins, their putative regulatory phosphorylation sites have not been mapped. We demonstrate here that the kinase activity of Ndr depends upon phosphorylation of Ndr on two sites, Ser-281 and Thr-444. Both of these sites, as well as the sequences surrounding them, are highly conserved in LATS, Orb6, and Cot-1 and are also present (albeit with slightly lower homology) in Dbf2. Ser-281 and Thr-444 of Ndr are also similar to phosphorylation sites in several PDK1 substrates, but despite this Ndr does not appear to be a target of PDK1. Thus, Ndr and its kinase relatives may be regulated by an upstream kinase distinct from PDK1, but with PDK1-like specificity.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have shown that the activity of Ndr protein kinase is critically dependent on phosphorylation at two sites, Ser-281 and Thr-444. Based on these results, we predict that LATS, Orb6, Cot-1, and possibly Dbf2 are regulated by phosphorylation on homologous sites. Both Ser-281 and Thr-444 must be phosphorylated for full Ndr activity, but phosphorylation of either site alone is sufficient for a more limited degree of activity. Two of the kinases closely related to Ndr, LATS and Dbf2, are already known to exist as phosphoproteins, although their phosphorylation sites have not been mapped (3Tao W. Zhang S. Turenchalk G.S. Stewart R.A. St John M.A. Chen W. Xu T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Toyn J.H. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Both LATS and Dbf2 are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, as shown by cell cycle stage-dependent changes in their mobility on SDS gels that can be reversed by in vitro treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase. Ndr protein kinase is the closest known relative of the tumor suppressor LATS in mammalian cells, and several tissues and cell types co-express Ndr and LATS. The high level of homology of these kinases in regions targeted for phosphorylation in Ndr suggests the possibility that they could be regulated by the same upstream kinase.Ser-281 of Ndr shows homology to activation-loop phosphorylation sites that are found in several members of the AGC subgroup of serine/threonine kinases, such as PKB/Akt (20Alessi D.R.

A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The activation-loop site in each of these kinases is a substrate for PDK1. Based on sequence comparisons, Cheng et al. (26Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) proposed a consensus phosphorylation motif for PDK1 asThr-Xaa-Cys-Gly-Thr-Xaa-Asp/Glu-Tyr-Xaa-Ala-Pro-Glu, where Xaa is a hydrophobic residue, and the first Thr in the sequence is the phosphoacceptor. The sequence around Ser-281 of Ndr is homologous to this consensus in 9 out of 12 positions. Moreover, most PDK1 targets contain a second phosphorylation site approximately 60 amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the end of the kinase catalytic domain, which is flanked by hydrophobic amino acids (consensus Phe-Xaa-Xaa-Phe-Ser/Thr-Phe/Tyr) and which, at least in the case of PKB, is phosphorylated by a modified form of PDK1 (27Balendran A.

Thr-444 of Ndr shows similarity to this second motif both in terms of the sequence surrounding it and in terms of its positioning within the polypeptide chain. However, our results suggest that Ndr is not phosphorylated by PDK1. One potential explanation for this could be an unusual structural feature present in Ndr. As shown in Fig. 3, Ndr and its close relatives contain an insert of ∼40 amino acids between the catalytic subdomains VII and VIII, which is absent from all other known kinases. This insert interrupts the canonical kinase catalytic domain, beginning COOH-terminally to the conserved “DFG” kinase motif and ending directly NH2-terminal to Ser-281. The close proximity of this domain to Ser-281 might influence the recognition of Ser-281 by upstream kinases, such that phosphorylation by PDK1 is prevented. Moreover, in Ndr this domain harbors a nuclear localization signal so that in the cell, Ndr and PDK1 may be separated from each other in distinct compartments (1Millward T. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that Ndr might be the target of an as-yet-unidentified nuclear activation loop kinase that has a substrate specificity similar to, but distinct from, PDK1. In addition, the stimulation of Ndr activity by OA in intact cells, as well as the ability of protein phosphatase 2A to inactivate Ndr in vitro, indicate that Ndr may be a physiological substrate of protein phosphatase 2A. Human Ndr is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that has been highly conserved during evolution and which is expressed in almost all cell types of the body (1Millward T. Cron P.

However, our results suggest that Ndr is not phosphorylated by PDK1. One potential explanation for this could be an unusual structural feature present in Ndr. As shown in Fig. 3, Ndr and its close relatives contain an insert of ∼40 amino acids between the catalytic subdomains VII and VIII, which is absent from all other known kinases. This insert interrupts the canonical kinase catalytic domain, beginning COOH-terminally to the conserved “DFG” kinase motif and ending directly NH2-terminal to Ser-281. The close proximity of this domain to Ser-281 might influence the recognition of Ser-281 by upstream kinases, such that phosphorylation by PDK1 is prevented. Moreover, in Ndr this domain harbors a nuclear localization signal so that in the cell, Ndr and PDK1 may be separated from each other in distinct compartments (1Millward T. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that Ndr might be the target of an as-yet-unidentified nuclear activation loop kinase that has a substrate specificity similar to, but distinct from, PDK1. In addition, the stimulation of Ndr activity by OA in intact cells, as well as the ability of protein phosphatase 2A to inactivate Ndr in vitro, indicate that Ndr may be a physiological substrate of protein phosphatase 2A.

https://openalex.org/W2083950698,"Thermal convection experiments in a rapidly rotating hemispherical shell suggest a model in which the convection in Earth's liquid outer core is controlled by a thermally heterogeneous mantle. Experiments show that heterogeneous boundary heating induces an eastward flow in the core, which, at a sufficiently large magnitude, develops into a large-scale spiral with a sharp front. The front separates the warm and cold regions in the core and includes a narrow jet flowing from the core-mantle boundary to the inner-core boundary. The existence of this front in the core may explain the Pacific quiet zone in the secular variation of the geomagnetic field and the longitudinally heterogeneous structure of the solid inner core."
https://openalex.org/W2033036104,"Activation energies for partial reactions involved in oxidation of quinol by the bc 1complex were independent of pH in the range 5.5–8.9. Formation of enzyme-substrate complex required two substrates, ubihydroquinone binding from the lipid phase and the extrinsic domain of the iron-sulfur protein. The activation energy for ubihydroquinone oxidation was independent of the concentration of either substrate, showing that the activated step was in a reaction after formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. At all pH values, the partial reaction with the limiting rate and the highest activation energy was oxidation of bound ubihydroquinone. The pH dependence of the rate of ubihydroquinone oxidation reflected the pK on the oxidized iron-sulfur protein and requirement for the deprotonated form in formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. We discuss different mechanisms to explain the properties of the bifurcated reaction, and we preclude models in which the high activation barrier is in the second electron transfer or is caused by deprotonation of QH2. Separation to products after the first electron transfer and movement of semiquinone formed in the Qo site would allow rapid electron transfer to heme b L. This would also insulate the semiquinone from oxidation by the iron-sulfur protein, explaining the efficiency of bifurcation."

For the purification of Rad59, extract from the protease-deficient yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring pR59.1 (2μ, PGK-RAD59) was subject to a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatographic fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, Sephacryl S200, and Mono S. Rad59 from the last step of purification in Mono S (Fraction VII) was nearly homogeneous (Fig. 1 B), and was used in all the biochemical experiments.We used DNA mobility shift in agarose gels for examining whether Rad59 binds DNA. As shown in Fig. 2,A and B, Rad59 binds both φX174 ssDNA and dsDNA in a protein concentration dependent manner. Whereas 0.6 μm Rad59 was sufficient to shift greater than 70% of the ssDNA (35 μm nucleotides), only about 10% of the dsDNA (35 μm nucleotides) was shifted by the same concentration of Rad59. The treatment of Rad59-ssDNA and Rad59-dsDNA nucleoprotein complexes with SDS and proteinase K released intact DNA, indicating that the DNA had not undergone any covalent modification (Fig.2 A, lane 9 in both panels). As shown in Fig.2 C, panel I, DNA binding is reduced appreciably by 150 mm KCl, but, as shown in panel II, is relatively insensitive to magnesium up to 12.5 mm.Figure 2DNA binding by Rad59. A, φX single-stranded DNA (ss; panel I) or linear duplex (ds; panel II), each at 35 μm nucleotides, was incubated with Rad59 (0.15, 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9, and 1.05 μm in lanes 2–8, respectively) at 37 °C for 5 min. In lane 9, the DNA was incubated with 1.05 μm Rad59 at 37 °C for 5 min, but the reaction was treated with SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (PK; 500 μg/ml) for 2 min at 37 °C prior to electrophoresis. Nucleoprotein complexes are marked as complex, and the well position of the gel is indicated. B, the gels inA were subject to image analysis and the results plotted.Symbols: ●, ssDNA binding; ○, dsDNA binding.C, φX 174(+) strand and the linear duplex, 35 μm nucleotides, were incubated with 1 μmRad59 as described in A but with increasing KCl (panel I) and MgCl2 (panel II). In all the reactions in panel II, KCl was present at 25 mm. Symbols: ●, ssDNA binding; ○, dsDNA binding. D, φX (+)-strand (18.5 μm nucleotides) and linear duplex (12.3 μm nucleotides) were co-incubated with increasing amounts of Rad59 (0.09, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.5, and 0.64 μm inlanes 2–7, respectively) at 37 °C for 5 min either in the absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of 5 mm MgCl2, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We wished to examine the relative affinities of Rad59 for ssDNA and dsDNA in greater detail by including both DNA substrates in the same binding mixture, done in the absence of magnesium or in the presence of 5 mm magnesium (Fig. 2 D). It both cases, Rad59 binds specifically to the ssDNA, such that at 0.64 μmRad59, whereas essentially all of the ssDNA (18.5 μmnucleotides) was shifted, little if any shifting of the dsDNA (12.3 μm nucleotides) occurred. There was no evidence for co-aggregation of the ssDNA and dsDNA by Rad59. Taken together, the results indicate that Rad59 binds ssDNA with a considerably higher avidity than dsDNA. Preferential binding of Rad59 to ssDNA over dsDNA was also verified using oligonucleotide-based ss and ds substrates. 3G. Petukhova and P. Sung, unpublished observations. Recent genetic experiments conducted in the laboratories of Haber and Symington (16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)2 have indicated that Rad59 affects the efficiency of recombination by SSA. Because of this genetic observation, it was of considerable interest to examine whether Rad59 in fact has the ability to mediate the annealing of complementary DNA strands. Complementary φX single strands were incubated with Rad59, followed by deproteinization and electrophoresis in agarose gels. As shown in Fig. 3 A, incubation of the complementary φX DNA strands with Rad59 resulted in the appearance of DNA product that migrated more slowly than the input DNA strands. The level of the new DNA species was proportional to the concentration of Rad59 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–9). These DNA species were the product of DNA strand annealing because (i) they were completely stable to the treatment with SDS and proteinase K (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–9); (ii) no higher DNA species was observed with undenatured duplex DNA incubated with the highest amount of Rad59 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2); (iii) heating the DNA product released intact complementary DNA strands (Fig. 3 C, lane 4); and (iv) the generation of these DNA species is dependent on the presence of DNA homology in the DNA strands (Fig. 2 and see later in Fig. 5). Near-maximal DNA annealing was observed at Rad59 to ssDNA ratio of one protein monomer per 30 nucleotides (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). The annealed DNA species, which failed to enter the agarose gel, very likely contained multiple complementary DNA strands annealed together, as has been shown for other recombination proteins, Rad52 for instance (13Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which also have the ability to mediate DNA annealing.Figure 3Rad59 anneals complementary DNA strands. A , φX complementary strands (46 μm nucleotides, designated as ss,(+)/(−), were incubated with increasing amounts of Rad59 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 μm in lanes 4–9, respectively) at 37 °C for 5 min, deproteinized with SDS and proteinase K, and then analyzed. Duplex φX DNA (30 μm nucleotides) without heat denaturation (lanes 1 and 2) was also incubated with Rad59 (2.5 μm in lane 2) under the same conditions.B, results from image analysis of the gel in A(lanes 3–9). C, φX complementary strands (46 μm nucleotides), designated as ss , (+)/(−), were incubated without (lane 1) or with Rad59 (2.0 μm in lanes 2–4) as described inA, except that SDS (0.5%) was added to the reaction inlane 3 at the beginning of incubation and that the reaction product in lane 4 was boiled for 2 min and chilled on ice before being analyzed. D, φX complementary strands (46 μm nucleotides), designated as ss , (+)/(−), were incubated with Rad59 (2.0 μm) for the indicated times. E, results from image analysis of the gel in D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The addition of 0.5% SDS at the very beginning of the DNA annealing reaction completely abolished the ability of Rad59 to mediate this reaction (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). Magnesium at 5 mm was included in all of the reactions shown in Fig. 3, but DNA annealing occurs just as efficiently in the absence of magnesium.3 As can be seen in Fig. 3, D andE, the DNA annealing reaction is relatively rapid, such that maximal level of annealing was accomplished after 1 min of incubation, although the size of the annealed product appeared to continue to increase until about 2 min. Lowering the reaction temperature from 37 °C to 30 °C did not affect the kinetics of DNA annealing appreciably, but further decreasing the temperature to 25 °C slowed down the annealing reaction significantly.3 Taken together, the results indicate that Rad59 promotes rapid and efficient annealing of complementary DNA strands. From time course experiments, it is clear that Rad59 does not act catalytically in DNA annealing, as the amount of annealed DNA product is largely or entirely dependent on the initial amount of Rad59.3Rad52 binds to ssDNA preferentially and mediates annealing of complementary DNA strands (14Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA annealing by Rad52 is accelerated by the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding protein RPA (13Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,15Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of RPA on Rad59-mediated DNA annealing. From Fig. 4, it is clear that little if any effect on the kinetics of the annealing occurred at relatively low concentrations of RPA (0.2 μm), and at higher concentrations of RPA (0.6 μm and 1.2 μm), progressive inhibition of the annealing reaction was seen. We have also examined concentrations of RPA lower than 0.2 μm and intermediate between 0.2 and 0.6 μm and again found no stimulation of Rad59-mediated DNA strand annealing. Under these conditions, RPA, at the concentrations used, does not by itself mediate DNA annealing during the incubation time.Figure 4DNA annealing by Rad59 is not stimulated by RPA. A, φX complementary strands (46 μmnucleotides), designated as ss , (+)/(−), were incubated with Rad59 (2.0 μm in lanes 2–17) without RPA (lanes 2–5) or with 0.2 μm RPA (lanes 6–9), 0.6 μm RPA (lanes 10–13), and 1.2 μm RPA (lanes 14–17) for the indicated times.B, results from image analysis of the gels in Awere plotted. Symbols for the annealing reactions: ▪, Rad59 alone; ■, Rad59 with 0.2 μm RPA; Δ, Rad59 with 0.6 μm RPA; ▴, Rad59 with 1.2 μm RPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A possible stimulation of DNA strand annealing by RPA was also examined at concentrations of Rad59 lower than that used in Fig. 4. Here also, while relatively low concentrations of RPA had little or no effect on the extent or kinetics of DNA annealing by Rad59, relatively high concentrations of RPA inhibited the annealing reaction progressively.In prior experiments (Figs. 3 and 4), the complementary φX(+) and φX(−) DNA strands were incubated simultaneously with Rad59. In order to assess the effect of precoating either or both of the complementary strands on the annealing reaction, we turned to pBluescript SK(+) and SK(−) single strands (2,960 bases) that are homologous to each other. As shown in Fig. 5 A, incubation of Rad59 with a mixture of the SK(+) and SK(−) strands also resulted in annealed species (lanes 6 and 7). Incubation of Rad59 with either the SK(+) or the SK(−) strand alone did not generate any SDS/proteinase K-resistant high molecular size DNA species (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 4), again emphasizing the requirement for DNA homology in the formation of the annealed product. We next examined the effect of precoating either or both of the SK single strands with Rad59 on the annealing reaction. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, precoating of the SK(+) strand before the addition of the SK(−) strand resulted in a significant reduction of annealed product; a similar reduction in the level of annealed product was observed when the SK(−) strand was preincubated with Rad59 before the addition of the SK(+) strand. Interestingly, precoating both SK(+) and SK(−) strands with Rad59 in separate reactions before mixing resulted in further suppression of the annealing reaction (Fig. 5,B and C). These observations indicate that the highest efficiency of DNA strand annealing is achieved when both complementary strands are present at the time Rad59 is added.The results show that Rad59 binds ssDNA with considerably higher affinity than dsDNA, both in the absence or presence of magnesium and relatively high concentrations of KCl. The affinity of Rad59 for ssDNA could be important for the utilization of recombinogenic ssDNA substrates for homologous recombination pathways in vivo(12Bai Y. Symington L.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Consistent with the absence of nucleotide binding motifs in Rad59, we have not detected an ATPase activity in purified Rad59, both in the absence of DNA and presence of either ssDNA or dsDNA. Also Rad59 does not promote homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange between oligonucleotide-based DNA substrates or φX 174 DNA substrates. We have examined the effect of adding Rad59 to the strand exchange reaction mediated by Rad51 and RPA, but thus far have not observed any stimulatory effect of Rad59. In the model proposed by Bai and Symington (12Bai Y. Symington L.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), Rad59 is envisioned to function in the context of a complex with Rad51 and other recombination factors. Although our studies have not yet found an obvious role of Rad59 in the Rad51-mediated strand exchange reaction, it remains possible that other recombination factors are needed to reveal an effect of Rad59 in this reaction.Genetic evidence points to a role for RAD52 andRAD59 in the SSA mode of recombination (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).2Consistent with the observed genetic requirement, both Rad52 (14Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and Rad59 (this study) have now been shown to mediate the annealing of complementary DNA strands. However, whereas the DNA annealing activity of Rad52 is stimulated by RPA (13Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), Rad59 does not appear to depend on RPA for efficient single strand annealing. Whether Rad59 functionally cooperates with Rad52 in single strand annealing in vitro and in vivo remains to be determined. It also remains possible that the single strand annealing ability of Rad59 is germane for the DNA break-induced replication mode of long tract gene conversion in which a short heteroduplex joint may be formed via strand annealing to prime DNA synthesis (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD52 epistasis group genes, are required for mitotic and meiotic recombination. Because of their involvement in DNA double strand break repair, mutational inactivation of these genes also leads to greatly elevated susceptibility of cells to the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation (reviewed in Ref. 1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, RAD52 and RAD59 of this group also function in the single strand annealing (SSA)1 pathway of recombination (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). 2N. Sugawara and J. Haber, personal communication. 2N.

In the DNA double strand break repair model for recombination, subsequent to break formation, the ends of the break are processed in an exonucleolytic fashion to yield long ssDNA tails, to be utilized by other recombination factors for the formation of heteroduplex DNA with a DNA homolog.

Here we show that Rad59 binds ssDNA and mediates the annealing of complementary DNA strands, activities that are likely to be germane for the recombination functions of Rad59. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRAD59gene was amplified from S. cerevisiaegenomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and placed under the control of the yeast PGK promoter. For the purification of Rad59, extract from the protease-deficient yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring pR59.1 (2μ, PGK-RAD59) was subject to a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatographic fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, Sephacryl S200, and Mono S. Rad59 from the last step of purification in Mono S (Fraction VII) was nearly homogeneous (Fig. 1 B), and was used in all the biochemical experiments.We used DNA mobility shift in agarose gels for examining whether Rad59 binds DNA. As shown in Fig. 2,A and B, Rad59 binds both φX174 ssDNA and dsDNA in a protein concentration dependent manner. Whereas 0.6 μm Rad59 was sufficient to shift greater than 70% of the ssDNA (35 μm nucleotides), only about 10% of the dsDNA (35 μm nucleotides) was shifted by the same concentration of Rad59. The treatment of Rad59-ssDNA and Rad59-dsDNA nucleoprotein complexes with SDS and proteinase K released intact DNA, indicating that the DNA had not undergone any covalent modification (Fig.2 A, lane 9 in both panels). As shown in Fig.2 C, panel I, DNA binding is reduced appreciably by 150 mm KCl, but, as shown in panel II, is relatively insensitive to magnesium up to 12.5 mm.We wished to examine the relative affinities of Rad59 for ssDNA and dsDNA in greater detail by including both DNA substrates in the same binding mixture, done in the absence of magnesium or in the presence of 5 mm magnesium (Fig. 2 D). It both cases, Rad59 binds specifically to the ssDNA, such that at 0.64 μmRad59, whereas essentially all of the ssDNA (18.5 μmnucleotides) was shifted, little if any shifting of the dsDNA (12.3 μm nucleotides) occurred. There was no evidence for co-aggregation of the ssDNA and dsDNA by Rad59. Taken together, the results indicate that Rad59 binds ssDNA with a considerably higher avidity than dsDNA. Preferential binding of Rad59 to ssDNA over dsDNA was also verified using oligonucleotide-based ss and ds substrates. 3G. Petukhova and P. Sung, unpublished observations.

These DNA species were the product of DNA strand annealing because (i) they were completely stable to the treatment with SDS and proteinase K (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–9); (ii) no higher DNA species was observed with undenatured duplex DNA incubated with the highest amount of Rad59 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2); (iii) heating the DNA product released intact complementary DNA strands (Fig. 3 C, lane 4); and (iv) the generation of these DNA species is dependent on the presence of DNA homology in the DNA strands (Fig. 2 and see later in Fig. 5). Near-maximal DNA annealing was observed at Rad59 to ssDNA ratio of one protein monomer per 30 nucleotides (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). The annealed DNA species, which failed to enter the agarose gel, very likely contained multiple complementary DNA strands annealed together, as has been shown for other recombination proteins, Rad52 for instance (13Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which also have the ability to mediate DNA annealing.Figure 3Rad59 anneals complementary DNA strands. A , φX complementary strands (46 μm nucleotides, designated as ss,(+)/(−), were incubated with increasing amounts of Rad59 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 μm in lanes 4–9, respectively) at 37 °C for 5 min, deproteinized with SDS and proteinase K, and then analyzed. Duplex φX DNA (30 μm nucleotides) without heat denaturation (lanes 1 and 2) was also incubated with Rad59 (2.5 μm in lane 2) under the same conditions.B, results from image analysis of the gel in A(lanes 3–9).

E, results from image analysis of the gel in D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The addition of 0.5% SDS at the very beginning of the DNA annealing reaction completely abolished the ability of Rad59 to mediate this reaction (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). Magnesium at 5 mm was included in all of the reactions shown in Fig. 3, but DNA annealing occurs just as efficiently in the absence of magnesium.3 As can be seen in Fig. 3, D andE, the DNA annealing reaction is relatively rapid, such that maximal level of annealing was accomplished after 1 min of incubation, although the size of the annealed product appeared to continue to increase until about 2 min. Lowering the reaction temperature from 37 °C to 30 °C did not affect the kinetics of DNA annealing appreciably, but further decreasing the temperature to 25 °C slowed down the annealing reaction significantly.3 Taken together, the results indicate that Rad59 promotes rapid and efficient annealing of complementary DNA strands. From time course experiments, it is clear that Rad59 does not act catalytically in DNA annealing, as the amount of annealed DNA product is largely or entirely dependent on the initial amount of Rad59.3Rad52 binds to ssDNA preferentially and mediates annealing of complementary DNA strands (14Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA annealing by Rad52 is accelerated by the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding protein RPA (13Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,15Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of RPA on Rad59-mediated DNA annealing. From Fig. 4, it is clear that little if any effect on the kinetics of the annealing occurred at relatively low concentrations of RPA (0.2 μm), and at higher concentrations of RPA (0.6 μm and 1.2 μm), progressive inhibition of the annealing reaction was seen. We have also examined concentrations of RPA lower than 0.2 μm and intermediate between 0.2 and 0.6 μm and again found no stimulation of Rad59-mediated DNA strand annealing. Under these conditions, RPA, at the concentrations used, does not by itself mediate DNA annealing during the incubation time.Figure 4DNA annealing by Rad59 is not stimulated by RPA. A, φX complementary strands (46 μmnucleotides), designated as ss , (+)/(−), were incubated with Rad59 (2.0 μm in lanes 2–17) without RPA (lanes 2–5) or with 0.2 μm RPA (lanes 6–9), 0.6 μm RPA (lanes 10–13), and 1.2 μm RPA (lanes 14–17) for the indicated times.B, results from image analysis of the gels in Awere plotted. Symbols for the annealing reactions: ▪, Rad59 alone; ■, Rad59 with 0.2 μm RPA; Δ, Rad59 with 0.6 μm RPA; ▴, Rad59 with 1.2 μm RPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A possible stimulation of DNA strand annealing by RPA was also examined at concentrations of Rad59 lower than that used in Fig. 4. Here also, while relatively low concentrations of RPA had little or no effect on the extent or kinetics of DNA annealing by Rad59, relatively high concentrations of RPA inhibited the annealing reaction progressively.In prior experiments (Figs. 3 and 4), the complementary φX(+) and φX(−) DNA strands were incubated simultaneously with Rad59. In order to assess the effect of precoating either or both of the complementary strands on the annealing reaction, we turned to pBluescript SK(+) and SK(−) single strands (2,960 bases) that are homologous to each other. As shown in Fig. 5 A, incubation of Rad59 with a mixture of the SK(+) and SK(−) strands also resulted in annealed species (lanes 6 and 7). Incubation of Rad59 with either the SK(+) or the SK(−) strand alone did not generate any SDS/proteinase K-resistant high molecular size DNA species (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 4), again emphasizing the requirement for DNA homology in the formation of the annealed product. We next examined the effect of precoating either or both of the SK single strands with Rad59 on the annealing reaction. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, precoating of the SK(+) strand before the addition of the SK(−) strand resulted in a significant reduction of annealed product; a similar reduction in the level of annealed product was observed when the SK(−) strand was preincubated with Rad59 before the addition of the SK(+) strand. Interestingly, precoating both SK(+) and SK(−) strands with Rad59 in separate reactions before mixing resulted in further suppression of the annealing reaction (Fig. 5,B and C). These observations indicate that the highest efficiency of DNA strand annealing is achieved when both complementary strands are present at the time Rad59 is added.The results show that Rad59 binds ssDNA with considerably higher affinity than dsDNA, both in the absence or presence of magnesium and relatively high concentrations of KCl. The affinity of Rad59 for ssDNA could be important for the utilization of recombinogenic ssDNA substrates for homologous recombination pathways in vivo(12Bai Y. Symington L.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Consistent with the absence of nucleotide binding motifs in Rad59, we have not detected an ATPase activity in purified Rad59, both in the absence of DNA and presence of either ssDNA or dsDNA. Also Rad59 does not promote homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange between oligonucleotide-based DNA substrates or φX 174 DNA substrates. We have examined the effect of adding Rad59 to the strand exchange reaction mediated by Rad51 and RPA, but thus far have not observed any stimulatory effect of Rad59. In the model proposed by Bai and Symington (12Bai Y. Symington L.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), Rad59 is envisioned to function in the context of a complex with Rad51 and other recombination factors. Although our studies have not yet found an obvious role of Rad59 in the Rad51-mediated strand exchange reaction, it remains possible that other recombination factors are needed to reveal an effect of Rad59 in this reaction.Genetic evidence points to a role for RAD52 andRAD59 in the SSA mode of recombination (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).2Consistent with the observed genetic requirement, both Rad52 (14Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and Rad59 (this study) have now been shown to mediate the annealing of complementary DNA strands. However, whereas the DNA annealing activity of Rad52 is stimulated by RPA (13Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), Rad59 does not appear to depend on RPA for efficient single strand annealing. Whether Rad59 functionally cooperates with Rad52 in single strand annealing in vitro and in vivo remains to be determined. It also remains possible that the single strand annealing ability of Rad59 is germane for the DNA break-induced replication mode of long tract gene conversion in which a short heteroduplex joint may be formed via strand annealing to prime DNA synthesis (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAD59gene was amplified from S. cerevisiaegenomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and placed under the control of the yeast PGK promoter. For the purification of Rad59, extract from the protease-deficient yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring pR59.1 (2μ, PGK-RAD59) was subject to a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatographic fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, Sephacryl S200, and Mono S. Rad59 from the last step of purification in Mono S (Fraction VII) was nearly homogeneous (Fig. 1 B), and was used in all the biochemical experiments. We used DNA mobility shift in agarose gels for examining whether Rad59 binds DNA. As shown in Fig. 2,A and B, Rad59 binds both φX174 ssDNA and dsDNA in a protein concentration dependent manner. Whereas 0.6 μm Rad59 was sufficient to shift greater than 70% of the ssDNA (35 μm nucleotides), only about 10% of the dsDNA (35 μm nucleotides) was shifted by the same concentration of Rad59. The treatment of Rad59-ssDNA and Rad59-dsDNA nucleoprotein complexes with SDS and proteinase K released intact DNA, indicating that the DNA had not undergone any covalent modification (Fig.2 A, lane 9 in both panels). As shown in Fig.2 C, panel I, DNA binding is reduced appreciably by 150 mm KCl, but, as shown in panel II, is relatively insensitive to magnesium up to 12.5 mm. We wished to examine the relative affinities of Rad59 for ssDNA and dsDNA in greater detail by including both DNA substrates in the same binding mixture, done in the absence of magnesium or in the presence of 5 mm magnesium (Fig. 2 D). It both cases, Rad59 binds specifically to the ssDNA, such that at 0.64 μmRad59, whereas essentially all of the ssDNA (18.5 μmnucleotides) was shifted, little if any shifting of the dsDNA (12.3 μm nucleotides) occurred. There was no evidence for co-aggregation of the ssDNA and dsDNA by Rad59. Taken together, the results indicate that Rad59 binds ssDNA with a considerably higher avidity than dsDNA. Preferential binding of Rad59 to ssDNA over dsDNA was also verified using oligonucleotide-based ss and ds substrates. 3G. Petukhova and P. Sung, unpublished observations. Recent genetic experiments conducted in the laboratories of Haber and Symington (16Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)2 have indicated that Rad59 affects the efficiency of recombination by SSA. Because of this genetic observation, it was of considerable interest to examine whether Rad59 in fact has the ability to mediate the annealing of complementary DNA strands. Complementary φX single strands were incubated with Rad59, followed by deproteinization and electrophoresis in agarose gels. As shown in Fig. 3 A, incubation of the complementary φX DNA strands with Rad59 resulted in the appearance of DNA product that migrated more slowly than the input DNA strands. The level of the new DNA species was proportional to the concentration of Rad59 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–9). These DNA species were the product of DNA strand annealing because (i) they were completely stable to the treatment with SDS and proteinase K (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–9); (ii) no higher DNA species was observed with undenatured duplex DNA incubated with the highest amount of Rad59 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2); (iii) heating the DNA product released intact complementary DNA strands (Fig. 3 C, lane 4); and (iv) the generation of these DNA species is dependent on the presence of DNA homology in the DNA strands (Fig. 2 and see later in Fig. 5). Near-maximal DNA annealing was observed at Rad59 to ssDNA ratio of one protein monomer per 30 nucleotides (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). The annealed DNA species, which failed to enter the agarose gel, very likely contained multiple complementary DNA strands annealed together, as has been shown for other recombination proteins, Rad52 for instance (13Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which also have the ability to mediate DNA annealing. The addition of 0.5% SDS at the very beginning of the DNA annealing reaction completely abolished the ability of Rad59 to mediate this reaction (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). Magnesium at 5 mm was included in all of the reactions shown in Fig. 3, but DNA annealing occurs just as efficiently in the absence of magnesium.3 As can be seen in Fig. 3, D andE, the DNA annealing reaction is relatively rapid, such that maximal level of annealing was accomplished after 1 min of incubation, although the size of the annealed product appeared to continue to increase until about 2 min.

These signals control the expression of specific genes, which direct the cell to proliferate, differentiate, or respond to stress signals. The subgroups of the MAPK superfamily include extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). While proliferation and differentiation signals activate ERK, both proliferation and cellular stress signals activate JNK and p38 (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). The JNK signaling pathway is activated by various stimuli including UV light, γ irradiation (2Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), osmotic shock, oxidative stress, protein synthesis inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1, T-cell costimulatory signals, and mitogenic signals such as Ras (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). JNK activation leads to the phosphorylation of several transcription factors including c-Jun, ATF2, and Elk-1, which in turn increases their transcriptional activity (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). The JNK signaling pathway is a kinase cascade composed of different levels of MAPKs. Directly upstream of JNK, at the MAPK kinase (MAP2K) level, there are two dual specificity kinases that phosphorylate and activate JNK at serine and threonine residues. These kinases are MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4), and MKK7. These proteins are activated, in turn, by the upstream MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K): MAPK/ERK kinase kinases (MEKKs), mixed lineage kinase (MLK), TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl-2), MAPK upstream kinase (MUK), and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (3Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recently, a group of MAP4Ks homologous to the Ste20 kinase (an upstream member of the MAPK cascade involved in the pheromone response pathway inSaccharomyces cerevisiae) were identified and characterized (4Kyriakis J.M.

These MAP4K proteins provide another level of regulation for the MAPK/JNK signaling cascade and perhaps a link to regulatory proteins that interact with or are located at the plasma membrane.

In addition to MAP4K, the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are another subgroup of the Ste20-like kinases (13Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These mammalian Ste20-like kinases all share homology in their kinase domain (3Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The PAK kinases contain a Cdc42/Rac1-interactive binding (CRIB) domain that allows them to bind to the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (13Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This binding leads to an increase in the autophosphorylation and, therefore, activation of the PAK kinases (14Benner G.E. Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21121-21128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, proteins in the MAP4K subfamily (HPK1, GCK, GLK, HGK/NIK, and KHS/GCKR) do not contain a CRIB domain and consequently fail to bind to these regulatory proteins. In particular, the members of the MAP4K subfamily contain a conserved N-terminal kinase domain, a conserved C-terminal tail, and several proline-rich regions in the center of the protein documented to be involved in the association with adaptor proteins. Hematopoeitic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) was cloned from a subtractive cDNA library screen between two different progenitor cell libraries (5Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H.

HPK1's expression is restricted to adult hematopoietic tissues, and HPK1 protein is also found in hematopoietic cell lines. HPK1 is upstream of MEKK1 (5Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) (15Zhou G. Lee S.C. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

HPK1 associates with adaptor proteins such as Crk, CrkL, Grb2, and Nck through binding to the Src-homology domain 3 (SH3) of these proteins (17Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M.

Furthermore, association of HPK1 with these proteins increases HPK1's kinase activity and its association with the epidermal growth factor receptor (17Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W.

It has been demonstrated that the HPK1 proline-rich domains are important for its association with adaptor proteins and its relocation to the plasma membrane where its activity may be regulated. In this study we describe the cloning of a novel HPK1-interacting protein of 55 kDa (HIP-55), which binds to HPK1. Wild-type HIP-55 showed strong binding to HPK1 in vitro through the second proline-rich domain of HPK1 and in vivo after co-expression. However, a point mutation in HIP-55's SH3 domain abolished this binding to HPK1. Wild-type HIP-55 increased HPK1's kinase activity in co-transfected 293T cells, but the SH3 mutant of HIP-55 did not. The wild-type, but not mutant, form of HIP-55 also increased JNK's kinase activity, a phenomenon that could be specifically blocked by a dominant-negative HPK1 mutant. Collectively, we have identified a novel protein that activates the JNK signaling pathway through HPK1. Full-length GLK cDNA (9Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was subcloned into yeast plasmid pGBT9 (CLONTECH) to create an in-frame fusion with GAL4 DNA-binding domain gene. The pGBT9-GLK was transformed into yeast strain HF7c using the lithium acetate procedure and plated onto synthetic complete (SC) media lacking tryptophan. Plasmid DNA from human HeLa cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) was then transformed into the yeast strain containing the GLK bait plasmid and plated on SC medium minus tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and grown at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Library plasmid DNA was recovered by transformation into DH10B cells and sequenced on both strands. Full-length HIP-55 was cloned into mammalian expression vectors PCR3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by PCR using two oligonucleotide primers. The oligonucleotides used were the following: 5′-TACGCTGTCGACATGGCGGCGAACCTGAGCCGGAAC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGCGCGGCCGCCCTCAGCCTCACTCAATGAGCTC-3′. PCR products were cut with SalI and NotI and cloned into pME vector with an in-frame hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope sequence at the 5′ end. For construction of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HIP-55 protein, HIP-55 was subcloned into pGEX4T-3 vector. A tryptophan mutant in the SH3 domain was generated by replacing residue 408 with a lysine residue by site-directed mutagenesis using the overlapping PCR method as described (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide, NH2-(GC)KRVGKDSFWAKAEKEE-COOH corresponding to the peptide sequence 172–187 of HIP-55 was synthesized. A cysteine residue was added to the NH2proceeded by a glycine. The cysteines' sulfide bond is used for the conjugation of peptide to carrier and used to immunize rabbits. Serum was collected, and IgG was purified using a protein A-Sepharose column. Multi-tissue poly(A+) blots with 2 μg/lane RNA from 16 different human tissues were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The probe used was a full-length HIP-55 cDNA of ∼1.3 kilobases obtained by restriction digestion of the HA-HIP-55 plasmid with XhoI andNotI. The cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (300 Ci/mmol; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) by random priming, using the Prime-It random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and following the manufacturer's directions. The hybridizing and washing conditions followed were as described in the manual provided with ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) with the modification that hybridization was carried out for 12–18 h at 68 °C in a shaking water bath. In brief, the day after hybridization, the blots were washed first in 2× sodium citrate buffer (SSC) and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer for 30 min at room temperature, followed by two or three washes with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS buffer solutions with gentle agitation at 50–60 °C. The damp membrane was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak BioMax MR) for 24–48 h at −80 °C. 293T cells were cultured as described previously (10Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 293T cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were co-transfected with plasmids as indicated by calcium phosphate precipitation (Specialty Media, Inc.). 12–16 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. 36 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin). Kinase assays for FLAG-HPK1 (encoding human HPK1) and HA-JNK1 (encoding human JNK1β1) have been described previously (17Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GST-HIP-55 protein was purified as recommended by manufacturer (CLONTECH) and used in a binding assay as described previously (17Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T transfected cell lysate was incubated with the GST-HIP-55 protein for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin) and two times in LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (10Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted using an anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (Eastman Kodak Co.), and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For co-immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of transfected 293T lysate was used with 3 μl of an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (17Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled HPK1 protein was generated by in vitro transcription and translation (Promega Biotech, Inc.) following manufacturer's instructions. For the peptide competition assay, 1 mm peptides (previously described in Ref. 17Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) corresponding to HPK1's proline-rich domains were used in the same GST-HIP-55 in vitro binding conditions as described previously except for the presence of [35S]methionine-labeled HPK1 instead of cell lysate. The protein complexes were washed and separated on SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled protein was visualized by autoradiography. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with GLK. Several clones were identified and sequenced. Two clones (F1 and F2) appeared to contain novel cDNA sequences and were derived from the same gene. The cDNA was then transformed into yeast strain HF7c along with either GLK or HPK1 bait plasmids or several other bait plasmids. F1 and F2 were found specifically to interact with HPK1 and GLK but not with other kinases such as MKK6 or MAPKKK5 (data not shown). To isolate a full-length cDNA clone of F1 and F2, we searched the EST data base with F1 and F2 sequences for additional 5′ end sequence. Overlapping fragments were identified that contained an initiation codon followed by stop codons. These EST clones were obtained and sequenced on both strands. Primers were then synthesized based on the EST sequence and 3′ end sequence of the F1 and F2 clones and used to amplify the full-length cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA predicted an open reading frame of 430 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig.1 A). Further characterization of this protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa by SDS-PAGE. We therefore designated the novel molecule as HIP-55, HPK1-interacting protein of 55 kDa. Data base searches found that the N-terminal of HIP-55 contains a putative actin-binding domain that is found in drebrins (21Shirao T. Kojima N. Kato Y. Obata K. Brain Res. 1988; 464: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), actin-binding protein 1 (Abp1) (22Drubin D.G. Mulholland J. Zhu Z.M. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and coactosin (23de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Gerisch G. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 26: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). The C-terminal region of HIP-55 contains an SH3 domain (Fig. 1 C). HA-HIP-55 plasmids were transfected into 293T cells to detect the cDNA translated product by SDS-PAGE. The cDNA translated product was detected by an anti-HA antibody (Fig.2 A) and an anti-HIP-55 antibody (Fig. 2 B). To examine the endogenous HIP-55 protein expression, we used various cell lysates from 293T, HeLa, HL-60, and Jurkat (data not shown) cell lines (Fig. 2 B). Protein lysates from these cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with a purified anti-HIP-55 antibody. The HIP-55 proteins were expressed in all of the cell lines tested, and the expression levels appear to be high and similar between the various cell lines (Fig. 2 B). As mentioned previously, the HIP-55 protein had an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa, and was accordingly named HIP-55. Northern blot analysis of HIP-55 showed a single transcript of ∼2.3 kilobases in all the tissues studied, indicating that HIP-55 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 2 C). The level of HIP-55 mRNA expression appeared to be higher in the spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes when compared with other tissues. In order to confirm the binding results from the yeast two-hybrid system, we examined the in vitro binding of HIP-55 to HPK1. We chose to focus on HPK1, rather than GLK, since more is known about HPK1 and its interactions with other adaptor proteins including Grb2, Crk, CrkL, and Nck (17Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GST-HIP-55 was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed proteins were then affinity-purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. Lysate from 293T cells transfected with FLAG-HPK1 was incubated with the immobilized GST-HIP-55 protein. The protein complex was washed extensively, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was blotted using anti-FLAG antibody. Transfected HPK1 associated with GST-HIP-55, but not with the GST protein. In addition, no unspecific associations with GST-HIP-55 were detected in the vector-transfected lane (Fig. 3 A). To analyze the in vivo binding of HPK1 and HIP-55, we co-transfected these two plasmids or HPK1 and the HIP-55 SH3 mutant (W408K) into 293T cells. The cells were lysed 36 h after transfection, and HIP-55 was immunoprecipitated, using an anti-HA antibody. The protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was subsequently blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-HPK1. HPK1 protein co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type HIP-55 protein but failed to bind to the HIP-55 SH3 mutant (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that HIP-55 interacts with HPK1 in vivo, and this interaction is mediated through HIP-55's SH3 domain. We further analyzed HPK1's proline-rich domains to identify the one(s) involved in this binding. We performed the in vitro binding assays of GST-HIP-55 and HPK1 using [35S]methioninein vitro translated and labeled HPK1 protein. To compete for binding to HPK1, we also included synthetic peptides corresponding to HPK1's four proline-rich domains (PR1–PR4) (Fig. 3 C). The protein complexes were washed and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of radioactive HPK1 was determined by autoradiography. Only the addition of a peptide corresponding to HPK1's second proline-rich domain (PR2) weakened the interaction between HPK1 and GST-HIP-55 (Fig.3 C). None of the other peptides appeared to diminish the binding between HIP-55 and HPK1. These results suggest that HPK1 binds to HIP-55 through a proline-rich domain/SH3 interaction that involves HPK1's second proline-rich domain. More detailed analysis of the HPK1 and HIP-55 binding was carried out using immunodepletion studies. The total percentage of HIP-55 bound to HPK1 could not be studied owing to the co-migration of HIP-55 with the immunoglobin heavy chain during immunoprecipitation. However, about 58% of HIP-55 was in the free or unbound form following HPK1 depletion from the lysate (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that the remaining 42% was bound to HPK1. Furthermore, 22% of total HPK1 bound to HIP-55 and the remaining 78% was in the free or unbound form (Fig. 4 B). To determine the effect of HIP-55 binding to HPK1, we analyzed HPK1's kinase activity from cells co-transfected with HIP-55. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-HPK1 and HA-HIP-55 plasmids alone or in combination. HPK1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and incubated in a kinase reaction with myelin basic protein as a substrate. Co-transfection of HIP-55 with HPK1 resulted in an increase in HPK1's kinase activityin vitro (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that HIP-55 not only binds to HPK1 but may also be involved in the regulation of HPK1's kinase activity. Since wild-type HIP-55 bound to and activated HPK1, an upstream regulator of the JNK1 signaling pathway, we analyzed whether HIP-55 could activate JNK. 293T cells were transiently transfected with HIP-55 wild-type or the SH3 mutant in addition to HA-JNK1. JNK1 kinase assays showed that the wild-type HIP-55 could activate the MAPK while the SH3 mutant failed to do so (Fig. 5 B). To examine if HPK1 was mediating the activation of JNK1 by HIP-55, we added a dominant-negative mutant of HPK1, HPK1-M46 (5Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), to the transfections. The presence of the HPK1 mutant completely blocked activation of JNK1 by HIP-55, indicating that HPK1 kinase mediates the activation of JNK1 by HIP-55 (Fig.5 B). Furthermore, HGK-KE (10Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a dominant-negative HGK mutant, did not block HIP-55 induced JNK1 activation. Additionalin vitro binding assays using GST-HIP-55 showed that it did not bind to the HGK protein, which lacks the proline-rich domains (data not shown). These results indicate that HIP-55 activates JNK1 through HPK1 and this is mediated by binding of HPK1 to HIP-55. We have cloned a novel protein, HIP-55, that bound to HPK1. From the two-hybrid system and the in vitro competition binding assays, we found that HPK1 bound to HIP-55 through its second proline-rich domain. We also show that HPK1 and HIP-55 are capable of interacting with each other in 293T cells. Our studies show that the presence of HIP-55 in HPK1-transfected lysate increases HPK1's kinase activity, suggesting that the interaction between these two proteins is functionally relevant in cells. We detected a reproducible increase in HPK1 protein levels when co-transfected with wild type HIP-55. This increase in HPK1 protein levels was not seen in co-transfection assays with a SH3 mutant of HIP-55, indicating that interaction with HPK1 is required for the increase in protein levels, and hence HPK1 kinase activity. In comparison, HPK-KD protein levels (and kinase activity) did not change when co-transfected with HIP-55 (data not shown). HPK-KD is in the same vector as wild type HPK1, thus eliminating any effect of HIP-55 on transcriptional up-regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven HPK1 expression. Furthermore, HPK-KD does not contain the proline-rich domains found on wild type HPK1. This emphasizes the importance of binding of HPK1 to HIP-55 for increases in HPK1 kinase activity and protein levels. We also found that p38 protein levels did not increase when co-transfected with HIP-55 (data not shown), indicating that the increase in protein levels is not a general effect of HIP-55. Our observations suggest that HIP-55 specifically activates HPK1 and this is in part through increasing HPK1 protein levels. We are currently pursuing the mechanisms by which HIP-55 may lead to increases in HPK1 protein levels. HIP-55 increases JNK1's kinase activity, and the activation of JNK1 is mediated by HPK1 since it can be blocked by a dominant-negative HPK1 mutant. Therefore, HIP-55 acts as an upstream activator of HPK1 and the JNK1 signaling pathway. We also showed that HIP-55's SH3 domain is critical for its effect on kinase activity of HPK1 and JNK1 since mutated HIP-55 failed to bind to HPK1 and also failed to activate HPK1 and JNK1. This result suggests that binding of the HIP-55 SH3 domain to HPK1 is required for the increase on HPK1's kinase activity. We are actively studying the detailed mechanism by which HIP-55 leads to HPK1 activation. HIP-55 homology searches (BLAST, FASTA) identified several proteins that shared homology to HIP-55. Three actin-binding proteins were identified: drebrin, an actin-binding protein expressed in brain tissue and neurons (21Shirao T. Kojima N. Kato Y. Obata K. Brain Res. 1988; 464: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); actin-binding protein 1 (Abp1), an S. cerevisiae protein involved in spatial organization of cell surface growth (22Drubin D.G. Mulholland J. Zhu Z.M. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and coactosin, a Dictyostelium discoideum protein known to bind actin filaments (23de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Gerisch G. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 26: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More detailed analysis of these proteins showed that the actin-binding regions of drebrin, Abp1, and coactosin were homologous (36%, 36%, and 21%, respectively) with the N terminus of HIP-55 (Fig.1 B). In addition to our homology search results, we found a mouse clone named SH3P7 that was isolated in a screen conducted to identify SH3 domain-containing proteins (24Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). SH3P7 is 85% identical to HIP-55 at the amino acid level. We therefore suspect SH3P7 may be the mouse ortholog of HIP-55. Interestingly, SH3P7 was recently classified as an actin-binding protein containing an actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) domain and grouped with drebrin and Abp1 (25Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). HIP-55 (and SH3P7) retains all of the residues shown important for actin binding in yeast cofilin as well as the secondary structural elements (as derived from models) of the ADF domain. Furthermore, SH3P7 is capable of binding to actin filaments (25Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is very likely, therefore, that HIP-55 protein will also bind to actin filaments. This possibility suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of MAP4Ks through interaction with HIP-55 and the cytoskeleton. However, this prospect remains to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W1973073381,"The activated 20 S proteasome, which has been found only in mammalian cells, is composed of two heptamer rings of an activator protein on each end of the 20 S proteasome and is inducible by interferon-γ. A 20 S proteasome has been recently identified in a protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, but there has been no experimental evidence yet for the presence of a 26 S proteasome. Instead, an activated form of 20 S proteasome was isolated from this organism, which has significantly enhanced peptidase activities. It consists of an additional activator protein with an estimated molecular mass of 26 kDa (PA26) (To, W. Y., and Wang, C. C. (1997)FEBS Lett. 404, 253–262). The profile and sequences of tryptic peptides from PA26 were determined by mass spectrometry; no matches were found in the data base. The peptide sequences were used in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to isolate a full-length cDNA clone encoding PA26. The protein sequence thus derived from it indicates little sequence identity with those of mammalian activator proteins PA28 α, β, or γ. There is only a single copy of PA26 gene in T. brucei. Purified recombinant PA26 polymerizes spontaneously to form heptamer ring with an outer diameter of 8.5 nm. The ring binds and activates 20 S proteasomes from T. brucei as well as rat, whereas human PA28α can neither bind nor activate T. brucei 20 S proteasome. The former is thus apparently more ubiquitous than PA28 in its capability of binding to and activating 20 S proteasomes. Its presence in T. brucei may also suggest a more ancient origin of proteasome activator proteins and a much wider involvement in protein degradation among other eukaryotic organisms than was originally envisaged. The activated 20 S proteasome, which has been found only in mammalian cells, is composed of two heptamer rings of an activator protein on each end of the 20 S proteasome and is inducible by interferon-γ. A 20 S proteasome has been recently identified in a protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, but there has been no experimental evidence yet for the presence of a 26 S proteasome. Instead, an activated form of 20 S proteasome was isolated from this organism, which has significantly enhanced peptidase activities. It consists of an additional activator protein with an estimated molecular mass of 26 kDa (PA26) (To, W. Y., and Wang, C. C. (1997)FEBS Lett. 404, 253–262). The profile and sequences of tryptic peptides from PA26 were determined by mass spectrometry; no matches were found in the data base. The peptide sequences were used in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to isolate a full-length cDNA clone encoding PA26. The protein sequence thus derived from it indicates little sequence identity with those of mammalian activator proteins PA28 α, β, or γ. There is only a single copy of PA26 gene in T. brucei. Purified recombinant PA26 polymerizes spontaneously to form heptamer ring with an outer diameter of 8.5 nm. The ring binds and activates 20 S proteasomes from T. brucei as well as rat, whereas human PA28α can neither bind nor activate T. brucei 20 S proteasome. The former is thus apparently more ubiquitous than PA28 in its capability of binding to and activating 20 S proteasomes. Its presence in T. brucei may also suggest a more ancient origin of proteasome activator proteins and a much wider involvement in protein degradation among other eukaryotic organisms than was originally envisaged. interferon-γ reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization time of flight matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization delayed extraction post source decay Tris-buffered saline N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone Proteasome is a multicatalytic protease complex present in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. The proteasome-mediated proteolysis removes abnormal proteins and short-lived regulator proteins, such as cyclins and transcription factors, during cell cycle (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 2Goldberg A.L. Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Lee D.H. Rohrwild M. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 377-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome from archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum, serving as a structural model for eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes (5Dahlmann B. Kopp F. Kuehn L. Niedel B. Pfeifer G. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), has a cylindrical structure consisting of four stacked rings of seven subunits each. There are only two distinctive subunits in archaebacterial proteasome, α and β. α-Subunits form the two outer rings, whereas β-subunits, which are the catalytic subunits, form the two inner rings (6Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Similar 20 S proteasome identified in the actinomycete Rhodococcus erythropolis (7Zühl F. Tamura T. Dolenc I. Cejka Z. Nagy I. De Mot R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) contains two α-type and two β-type subunits, which can be assembled efficientlyin vitro in any combination (8Zühl F. Seemüller E. Golbik R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasomes in eukaryotes have a greater subunit complexity and, in a given source, are composed of 14 different subunits: 7 distinct α subunits in the α-ring, and 7 distinct β subunits in the catalytic β-ring (9Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of both archaebacterial and yeast 20 S proteasomes have become available (6Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 9Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). There is a narrow 13-Å portal at the center of T. acidophilum 20 S proteasome that apparently provides an access for protein substrates to the cylindrical chamber (6Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). In yeast 20 S proteasome, however, the portal is blocked by the amino-terminal portions of α subunits. There is no obvious path by which protein substrates can reach the active sites (9Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a need for opening the portal and facilitating influx of substrates into eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes, which turns out to be mediated by specific regulatory proteins that bind to the terminal α-rings of proteasome. There are at least two different pathways leading to activation of eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes. It can be either through binding to a 19 S protein complex at both ends of the proteasome to form the 26 S proteasome or by binding to a heptamer ring of an activator protein PA28 at each end of the proteasome to yield the activated 20 S proteasome (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 4Peters J.M. Trends Biochem.

A hybrid with a 19 S complex at one end and a PA28 heptamer at the other end has also been identified (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasomes are capable of performing ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and have been identified among all eukaryotes thus far with a possible exception in Trypanosoma brucei, a primitive protozoan pathogen (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The activated 20 S proteasome is only capable of digesting peptides in vitro (13Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and has been found only among mammalian cells until our recent identification of an activated 20 S proteasome species in T. brucei (see below) (14To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 19 S complex is a multisubunit complex that binds to ubiquitinated proteins and hydrolyzes ATP (13Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 15Peters J.M. Cejka Z. Harris J.R. Kleinschmidt J.A. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This complex contains at least one subunit that binds polyubiquitinated proteins and six homologous subunits that contain ATP binding domains (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 16Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). PA28 has no hydrolytic activity of its own and is without a homologue in yeast (17Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Ma C.P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally conceived to be involved in major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing, because synthesis of PA28 is strongly induced by interferon-γ (IFNγ)1 (19Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shibmara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). There are three isoforms of PA28: PA28α, PA28β, and PA28γ, sharing about 50% amino acid sequence identity (20Mott J.D. Pramanik B.C. Moomaw C.R. Afendis S.J. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31466-31471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α and β isoforms form a complex with 20 S proteasome in the form of a heptamer ring of three PA28α and four PA28β or three PA28β and four PA28α (21Zhang Z. Realini C. Clawson A. Endicott S. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9501-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Z. Clawson A. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30660-30668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of recombinant human PA28α has been recently resolved in the form of a self-assembled heptamer ring (23Knowlton J.R. Johnston S.C. Whitby F.G. Realini C. Zhang Z. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It contains a central channel that has an opening of 20 Å diameter at one end and 30 Å diameter at the presumed proteasome-binding surface. Presumably, binding to such a ring structure may cause conformational changes that could open the pore in proteasome α-ring to allow the passage of peptide substrates. T. brucei, a member of the Kinetoplastidae family, is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness (24Adam K.M.G. Paul J. Zaman V. Medical and Veterinary Protozoology. Longman Group Limited, London1971Google Scholar). It is generally regarded as a relatively primitive eukaryote farther removed from mammals than yeast (25Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Recently, the 20 S proteasome from T. brucei was identified, isolated, and characterized in our laboratory (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The morphology and dimensions of T. brucei20 S proteasome are similar to those of archaebacterial, yeast, and mammalian 20 S proteasomes. However, diameter of the portal in T. brucei 20 S proteasome is apparently larger than that in rat 20 S proteasome (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). T. brucei 20 S proteasome is also likely made of 7 distinctive α-subunits and 7 distinctive β-subunits by the number of proteins separated on two-dimensional gels (14To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but its profile of peptidase activity differs from that of other eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Instead of the primary chymotrypsin-like activities commonly observed among mammalian 20 S proteasomes, it exhibits mainly trypsin-like activity. There has not yet been any biochemical evidence suggesting the presence of a 26 S proteasome in T. brucei(14To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Instead, an activated form of 20 S proteasome, similar to the mammalian activated 20 S proteasome, was identified and isolated fromT. brucei (14To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This activated 20 S proteasome demonstrated enhanced peptidase activities, up to 100-fold of the original level. It consists of the 20 S proteasome and an extra protein with an estimated molecular mass of 26 kDa. The extra protein was separated from 20 S proteasome, purified, and found capable of reconstituting the activated 20 S proteasome in vitro with purified 20 S proteasome. This protein, designated “proteasome activator protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa” (PA26), was further analyzed in the present investigation. Molecular masses of the mixture of tryptic peptides of PA26 were determined by mass spectrometry, but did not match any protein in the data base. Hence, de novo sequencing of PA26 tryptic peptides was performed by tandem mass spectrometry, which enabled us to clone the encoding gene and to engage in further structural and functional characterizations of the recombinant PA26. T. brucei strain 427 procyclic form and bloodstream form cells were cultivated and harvested as described previously (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Red blood cells were collected from Wistar rats. Glycerol was from Fisher Scientific. The fluorogenic peptides succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methyl-7-amidocoumarin (LLVY-MAC), Pro-Phe-Arg-MAC (PFR-MAC), and Cbz-Gly-Gly-Arg-MAC (GGR-MAC) were purchased from Sigma. Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore. Molecular weight standards for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were a group of broad range protein markers from Bio-Rad. Molecular mass markers for calibrating gel filtration column were purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody against hexahistidine was from Babco. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antiserum against mouse or rabbit IgG, the random primer labeling system, and RedivueTM[α-32P]dCTP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reagents for electrophoresis were obtained either from Sigma or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade solvents were obtained from Fisher. The rest of the chemicals used in current study were of the highest purity commercially available. Protein spots were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gel and digested with trypsin as described previously (26Huang L. Shen M. Chernushevich I. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. Robertson C.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Peptides were extracted by washing the gel with HPLC grade water followed by three washes in 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The combined supernatants were dried in a SpeedVac and redissolved in the same solvent prior to analysis in mass spectrometer. The peptide extracts were further separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac microbore C18 column (1.0 mm × 15 cm). Each of the HPLC fractions was collected, concentrated, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Molecular masses of the tryptic peptides were determined with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) delayed extraction (DE) reflection time-of-flight (TOF) instrument (Perceptive Biosystem, Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Workstation, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm), which has a typical mass resolution, M/ΔM, of ∼8000. Peptides were cocrystallized with equal volumes of matrices consisting of saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The MALDI spectra were internally calibrated with trypsin autolysis products to obtain accurate monoisotopic masses of all the tryptic peptides (<20 ppm). Peptide mass values were used for gene and protein mass data base search using MS-Fit (27Karl R. Clauser Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). For de novo peptide sequencing by MALDI- post source decay (PSD)-DE, the peptides displaying the highest pseudomolecular ion abundance in the MALDI spectra of HPLC fractions were each subjected to PSD analysis on the same MALDI instrument to determine individual peptide sequences. All PSD spectra were manually interpreted. For determination of molecular mass of the polymerized PA26 complex, the procedures employed were similar to that described previously (28Tang X.J. Brewer C.F. Saha S. Chernushevich I. Ens W. Standing K.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,29Zhang Z. Krutchinsky A. Endicott S. Realini C. Rechsteiner M. Standing K.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5651-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The experiment was performed on an electrospray ionization (ESI)-orthogonal-TOF mass spectrometer at the University of Manitoba. Samples, stored in a buffer solution of 150 mm NaCl, 0.5m NaN3, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, had the latter replaced by 100 mmNH4HCO3 using an Amicon Centricon (M r cut-off 10,000), through several exchanges for a total of 106-fold dilution. Molecular mass measurement of the protein complex was performed immediately thereafter to minimize potential dissociation of the complex. An electrospray ion source that operates at a low nanoliter/min sample flow rate was used for all measurements (30Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). For the best signal, the de-clustering voltage was maintained at 250 V. Based on the amino acid sequences of peptides #1 and #7 (Table I), degenerate oligonucleotides of both sense (F) and antisense (R) strands (1F, GCIGCIGCIGA(A/G)GCICACGG; 1R, CCGTGIGC(T/C)TCIGCIGCIGC; 7F, GGIGTIGCIGTI(C/A)A(A/G)CACGC; 7R, ACIGCGTG(C/T)T(G/T)IACIGCIACICC) were synthesized for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using poly(A)+ RNA from T. brucei as template. The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed at 42 °C for 50 min and then at 50 °C for 10 min using 500 ng of the poly(A)+ RNA, 50 pmol of oligo(dT)12–18, 0.5 mm of each dNTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Life Techologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture of subsequent PCR contained 1 μl of the reverse transcription solution plus 200 pmol of each primer, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 units of TaqGold polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR included 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min with a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplification product was inserted into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) by T-A ligation and sequencing.Table IPartial peptide sequences from the tryptic digest of PA26 determined by mass spectrometry1.

Using primer M5′ with oligo(dT)30 (forward reaction) and primer M3′ with primer SL (spliced leader) (31Campbell D.A. Thornton D.A. Boothroyd J.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (TTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG; reverse reaction), the full-length cDNA and the full-length gene encoding PA26 were obtained from RT-PCR and PCR, using poly(A)+ RNA and genomic DNA as template, respectively. The reaction conditions were the same as described above except that the annealing temperatures were 55 °C and 60 °C for the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. The genomic DNA was isolated from procyclic forms of T. brucei as described (32Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A sample of 3.5 μg of purified genomic DNA was digested using various restriction enzymes and electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (33Wahl G.M. Meinkoth J.H. Kimmel A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 573-581Google Scholar), and prehybridized in 5× Denhardt's containing 5× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 42 °C. It was then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the same freshly prepared solution containing 106 dpm/ml [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe. The membrane was washed twice with 1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, once with 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min, and once with 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min prior to autoradiography at −70 °C overnight. Samples of genomic DNA (3.5 μg) from Trypanosoma cruzi(Dr. Jerry Manning, University of California, Irvine), Leishmania donovani (Dr. Richard Locksley, University of California, San Francisco), Tritrichomonas foetus, and Giardia lamblia WB (Dr. Alice L. Wang, University of California, San Francisco) were each digested with EcoRI, XhoI,NdeI, and BclI, respectively, and electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The rest of the procedures of blotting and hybridization were as described above except for washing the membranes only once with 5× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and once with 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at room temperature for another 15 min. The PA26 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers N (CATCATCATCATCATCACCCACCGAAACGCGCCGCACTC) and C (GGCTCTAGATCAACTCACCATATGATCGGTTCC) to yield a DNA fragment containing 6 extra histidine codons at the 5′-end of open reading frame behind the initiation codon and a XbaI site at the 3′-end of full-length cDNA. This fragment was cloned into a pBAce expression vector (34Craig S.P.I. Yuan L. Kuntz D.A. McKerrow J.H. Wang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which was cleaved with NdeI, filled in with Klenow fragment, inactivated at 75 °C for 15 min, and digested again with XbaI. The His6-PA26-encoding sequence in the resulting plasmid pBtbpa was verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Sφ606 cells and expressed (35Jochimsen B. Nygaard P. Vestergaard T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The transformed bacterial cells were grown to anA 600 of approximately 1.6, harvested and resuspended in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl) plus 1 mmtosyl-l-lysyl-chloromethylketone (TLCK) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication, the cell lysate was cleared by a centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min and passed through a Ni2+-agarose column equilibrated with TBS. The column was washed with 15 volumes of TBS plus the protease inhibitors and followed by 10 volumes of the same solution plus 25 mm imidazole. The protein still bound to the column was eventually eluted with 6 volumes of TBS containing 0.5m imidazole. SDS-PAGE in 12.5% gels was performed as described (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the procedure was as described in a previous report (26Huang L. Shen M. Chernushevich I. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. Robertson C.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out by a previously described procedure (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 20 S proteasomes were purified from T. brucei procyclic forms and rat red blood cells, respectively, as described previously (12Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Samples of purified 20 S proteasome (2.5 μg) were each incubated with varying levels of purified recombinant His6-PA26 or purified recombinant human PA28α, kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Hill (University of Utah). Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 20 min in TSDG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 20% glycerol) containing 1 mm TLCK and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a final volume of 40 μl. The incubated samples were then analyzed in native PAGE with the peptidase activity stained by a gel overlay assay (14To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using a mixture of fluorogenic peptides GGR-MCA, LLVY-MCA, and PFR-MCA. In order to determine the precise difference in subunit compositions between the 20 S proteasome and the activated 20 S proteasome ofT. brucei, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed. The result shows that the subunit patterns of 20 S proteasome (Fig. 1 A) and activated 20 S proteasome (Fig. 1 B) are essentially identical except for one additional protein spot from the activated 20 S proteasome. This protein has an estimated molecular mass of 26 kDa and a pI of 5.8 on the gel, suggesting that it may be the activator protein (PA26) of T. brucei 20 S proteasome (14To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The extra protein spot from T. brucei activated 20 S proteasome (Fig. 1 B) was excised from the two-dimensional gel and digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptide mass values determined in MALDI-TOF were submitted for gene, protein, and expression sequence tag mass data base search using MS-Fit (27Karl R. Clauser Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), but no matching protein entries were found, indicating that PA26 is a unique protein. De novo peptide sequencing was then pursued with MALDI-PSD-DE, and the sequences of nine peptides were determined and presented in Table I. Based on the amino acid sequences of two of the nine peptides, 1 and 7 (the underlined sequences in Table I were used for designing primers), both the corresponding sense (F) and antisense (R) degenerated oligonucleotides were synthesized. Two possible pairs of 1F with 7R and 1R with 7F were tried in RT-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The first pair produced a cDNA fragment of 216 bp, which was subcloned and sequenced; the deduced amino acid sequence coincided with that of peptides 1 and 7 at the NH2 and COOH termini, respectively, and also contained the sequences of peptides 5, 6, and 9 in between (Table I). Two specific primers, M5′ and M3′, derived from the 216-bp cDNA fragment were then paired with oligo(dT)30 and the SL sequence (31Campbell D.A. Thornton D.A. Boothroyd J.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in RT-PCR and produced a 672- and a 408-bp cDNA fragment, respectively. The former included the sequences of peptides 2, 4, 6, and 7, whereas the latter contained the sequences of peptides 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9. The two combined cDNA fragments consist of a full-length open reading frame of 231 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 25,243.93 for the PA26T isoform (see below) and a pI of 5.87 (Fig.2) similar to the estimated molecular mass and pI of the designated PA26 protein spot from two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1 B). Sequence alignments of the cloned PA26 with α, β, and γ isoforms of mammalian PA28 show exceedingly low sequence homology (Fig. 2). It has a 23–24% sequence identity with PA28α, whereas the identity with PA28β and PA28γ falls below 18% (Table II). There is an added 10% sequence s"

We report here for the first time the purification of this liver HA receptor. Using lectin and immuno-affinity chromatography, two HA receptor species were purified from detergent-solubilized membranes prepared from purified rat LECs. In nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), these two proteins migrated at 175- and ∼300 kDa corresponding to the two species previously identified by photoaffinity labeling of live cells as the HA receptor (Yannariello-Brown, J., Frost, S. J., and Weigel, P. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20451–20456). These two proteins co-purify in a molar ratio of 2:1 (175:300), and both proteins are active, able to bind HA after SDS-PAGE, electrotransfer, and renaturation. After reduction, the 175-kDa protein migrates as a ∼185-kDa protein and is not able to bind HA. The 300-kDa HA receptor is a complex of three disulfide-bonded subunits that migrate in reducing SDS-PAGE at ∼260, 230, and 97 kDa.

The daily total body turnover of HA in humans is at least 1 g/day (4****Google Scholar). HA degradation and removal in the body occurs via two clearance systems (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar): one is in the lymphatic system, which accounts for ∼85% of the HA turnover, and another system is hepatic, accounting for ∼15% of the total body HA turnover. HA in tissues throughout the body is continuously synthesized and degraded. Very large HA molecules (∼107 Da) are partially degraded to large fragments (∼106 Da) that are then released from the matrix and flow with the lymph to lymph nodes. The majority of HA (∼85%) is completely degraded in the lymph nodes by unknown mechanisms and the remaining HA (∼15%) that passes through the nodes finally enters the blood. Clearance of this circulating HA is presumably important for normal health (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 4****Google Scholar). Elevated serum HA levels are found in several disease conditions such as liver cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, and some cancers (5Yamad M. Fukuda Y. Nakano I. Katano Y.

LECs have a very active recycling, endocytic receptor that removes HA and other glycosaminoglycans, such as chondroitin sulfate, from the circulation (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E.

Forsberg N. Gustafson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30081-30084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also known as CD54, which is a 90-kDa protein. This finding was later recognized as an artifact in that ICAM-1 bound nonspecifically to the HA affinity resin employed (13McCourt P.A.G. Gustafson S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In two previous studies, one using a photoaffinity derivative of HA (14Yannariello-Brown J. Frost S.J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20451-20456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the other using a novel ligand blot assay with 125I-HA (15Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we identified two specific HA-binding proteins in isolated rat LECs at 175 and ∼300 kDa. In the present study, we have finally purified these two proteins for the first time. Our results show the ∼300-kDa HAR protein contains three subunits after reduction but does not contain the 175-kDa HAR protein, which itself contains no other subunits. RCA-I-agarose gel was purchased from EY laboratories, Inc. Tris, SDS, ammonium persulfate,N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, and SDS-PAGE molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad. Na125I was from Amersham Pharmacia Corp. Nonidet P-40 was from CalBiochem. HA (human umbilical cord) from Sigma was purified as described previously (16Raja R.H. LeBoeuf R. Stone G. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Acrylamide and urea were from U. S. Biochemical Corp.p-Nitrophenyl phosphate was from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. N-Glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52), and all other chemicals, which were reagent grade, were from Sigma. TBS contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were from Harlan, Indianapolis, IN. LECs were isolated by a modified collagenase perfusion procedure (17Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), followed by differential centrifugation and then discontinuous Percoll gradient fractionation. Cells were collected from the 25/50% interface and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. For preparation of LEC membranes, the cells were hypotonically swollen, homogenized, and centrifuged at 1000 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 105,000 × g to obtain the total membrane fraction (18Yannariello-Brown J. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Samples were solubilized in an SDS sample buffer: 16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). No reducing agent was added unless as noted. Cell or membrane samples were sonicated on ice for 10–20 s. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was electrotransferred to a 0.1-μm nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h at 24 V at 4 °C using 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS. The nitrocellulose was treated with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight, and then incubated with 2 μg/ml 125I-HA in TBS without or with a 150-fold excess of HA (as competitor) to assess total or nonspecific binding, respectively. The membrane was washed five times (5 min each) with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, dried, and the 125I-HA bound to protein was detected by autoradiography with Kodak BioMax film. Nonspecific binding in this assay is typically <5% (15Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). LEC membranes from 18 rats were suspended in 3.6 ml of TBS, 2% Nonidet P-40 and mixed by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The solubilized membranes were diluted with TBS to 0.5% Nonidet P-40, centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g, and the supernatant was loaded at room temperature onto a RCA-I gel column (10 ml). The column was washed with 10 volumes of TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mmlactose in distilled water, dialyzed against multiple changes of TBS at 4 °C overnight, concentrated 10-fold using a Centricon-30 (from Amicon), and then passed over an immuno-affinity column (∼8 ml) containing monoclonal antibody 175HAR-30 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (∼2 mg/ml resin). Details on the preparation and characterization of this and other monoclonal antibodies raised against the rat LEC 175-kDa HAR will be described elsewhere. 2B. Zhou, J. A. Oka, and P. H. Weigel, manuscript in preparation. The affinity column was washed with 10 volumes of 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS and then eluted with 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0. Eluted fractions were neutralized by collection into 1 m Tris. Fractions containing protein were pooled, dialyzed against TBS at 4 °C overnight, and then concentrated using a Centricon-30. Purified HAR (1.17 μg) was heated with 0.5% SDS at 90 °C for 3 min. Samples (22 μl) were chilled on ice for 4 min and then 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. One-half unit of N-glycopeptidase F (20Tarentino A.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) and distilled water were added to give a final volume of 25 μl. The samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight, 9 μl of 4-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer was added, and they were heated for 3 min at 90 °C. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and protein was detected by silver staining, or receptor activity was determined by the 125I-HA ligand blot assay. Affinity-purified HAR (∼1.5 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE without reduction, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The 175- and 300-kDa proteins were excised from the gel, cut into smaller pieces, divided into two portions, and incubated at 90 °C for 4 min with SDS sample buffer with or without 10 mm dithiothreitol followed by 50 mm iodoacetamide. The samples were then subjected to a second dimension of SDS-PAGE without reducing agent. Proteins were visualized by silver staining (21Blum H. Beier H. Goss H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar), and HAR activity was assessed by the 125I-HA ligand-blot assay. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Receptor protein content was assessed after precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove detergent. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). 125I-HA was prepared using Iodogen (Pierce) and a uniquely modified hexylamine derivative of HA, synthesized, and radiolabeled as described previously (16Raja R.H. LeBoeuf R. Stone G. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 125I radioactivity was measured using a Packard Cobra Auto-Gamma Counting system, model 5002. In addition to the normal turnover of HA in tissues throughout the body, a wide range of biomedical and clinical applications use exogenous HA that is also removed from the lymphatics or ultimately from the blood and degraded by the LEC HAR (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 4****Google Scholar). For example, HA is used extensively in eye surgery (23Goa K.L. Benfield P. Drugs. 1994; 47: 536-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), in the treatment of joint diseases including osteoarthritis (24Bragantini A. Molinaroli F. Curr. Ther. Res. 1994; 55: 319-325Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and is being developed as a drug delivery vehicle (25Yui N. Nihira J. Okano T. Sakurai Y. J. Control. Release. 1993; 25: 133-143Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have explored the benefit of HA during wound healing (26King S.R. Hickerson W.L. Proctor K.G. Newsome A.M. Surgery. 1991; 109: 76-84PubMed Google Scholar, 27Burd D.A.R. Greco R.M. Regauer S. Longaker M.T. Siebert J.W. Garg H.G. Br. J. Plast. Surg. 1991; 44: 579-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The exogenous HA introduced in these various applications is naturally degraded by the lymph and LEC systems noted above. Despite the very large endocytic and degradative capacity of the LEC HAR (28McGary C.T. Yannariello-Brown J. Kim D.W. Stinson T.C. Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and its importance in removing HA from the blood, the HAR had not yet been successfully purified. The ability to purify the LEC HAR occurred with our discovery that two very active and specific HA-binding proteins, at 175 and 300 kDa, could be readily detected in LECs by ligand blotting using125I-HA (15Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These HA binding activities corresponded perfectly to our previous identification of two HAR proteins on intact LECs using an HA photoaffinity derivative that specifically labeled proteins of 175 and 300 kDa (14Yannariello-Brown J. Frost S.J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20451-20456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two HAR species observed by ligand blotting with 125I-HA also showed the same specificity with a panel of polyanionic competitors (15Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as observed for intact LECs (9Raja R.H. McGary C.T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16661-16668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have prepared2several useful monoclonal antibodies against the rat LEC 175-kDa HAR, including 175HAR-30, which recognizes this protein in Western blots (Fig. 1 A) and removes the protein and the HA binding activity from extracts (Fig. 1 B). The latter result demonstrates that 175HAR-30 recognizes the bone fide LEC HAR. Another antibody, 175HAR-174, behaves identically to 175HAR-30, but also inhibits specific HA endocytosis in live LECs by ≥90%.2 175HAR-30 binds the 175-kDa HAR species and also recognizes the 300-kDa HAR species. However, as described below, the 300-kDa species is not a dimer of the 175-kDa protein and does not contain a 175-kDa subunit. The 175HAR-30 antibody immunoprecipitates both HAR proteins from LEC extracts, thus enabling the 175-kDa HAR and the 300-kDa HAR proteins to be purified for the first time (Fig.2). Nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis showed that these two proteins comprise >98% of the final purified HAR preparations. Based on silver and Coomassie Blue staining of nonreduced gels, the 175-kDa HAR and 300-kDa HAR proteins are purified in an apparent molar ratio of 2:1. The fraction of total staining in the 175-kDa band was 0.47 ± 0.07 (n = 5) and 0.55 ± 0.09 (n = 3), respectively, for Coomassie- and silver-stained gels.Figure 2Immuno-affinity purification of the LEC HA Receptors. HARs were purified from Nonidet P-40 extracts of LEC membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Lane 1, run-through from the RCA-I column; lane 2, the starting Nonidet P-40 extract of LEC membranes; lane 3, proteins purified from the RCA-I column; lane 4, the purified HARs eluted from the 175HAR-30 column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The two purified HAR proteins remained active, as assessed by the ligand blot assay (Fig. 3, lane 1). Both the 175-kDa and ∼300-kDa HAR proteins were shifted to a lower mass by treatment with N-glycosidase F, indicating that both HAR species contain N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and2). The de-N-glycosylated 175-kDa HAR and 300-kDa HARs were still capable of 125I-HA binding (Fig. 3,lane 2). Therefore, N-linked oligosaccharides do not appear necessary for the HA binding activity of these receptors. However, the reduced 175- and 300-kDa HAR proteins no longer bind125I-HA (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4).Figure 4Effects of reduction and endoglycosidase F treatment on composition of the purified 175-kDa HAR and 300-kDa HAR . HARs were immuno-affinity-purified as in Fig. 1 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after treatment with N-glycosidase F and/or reduction with β-mercaptoethanol as indicated. The four nondeglycosylated proteins (lane 3, labeled a–dwith arrowheads) generated by reduction of the purified HARs are all shifted to lower apparent size by enzyme treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether either protein contains disulfide-bonded subunits, the co-purified 175-kDa HAR and 300-kDa HAR were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). After reduction with β-mercaptoethanol, four protein species were evident ranging in apparent size from 97 to 260 kDa. In order to determine which HAR species yielded each of these four proteins, the 175-kDa HAR and 300-kDa HAR were first separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The two HAR bands were then excised and reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE with or without reduction (Fig. 5). The reduced 175-kDa HAR yielded no other protein species, but the apparent size of the protein increased to ∼185 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 3). This shift to higher M r is typical of membrane receptors with extracellular domains whose compact or tightly folded structures require intraprotein disulfide bridges. After reduction, the 300-kDa HAR gave rise to three protein species with apparent masses of 260, 230, and 97 kDa, which we designate, respectively, as the α, β, and γ subunits of the 300-kDa HAR (Fig. 5, lane 2). None of these three reduced proteins were able to bind 125I-HA (Fig. 3, lane 3). All three subunits contain N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 4,lane 4). Based on Coomassie Blue and silver staining, and their apparent sizes, the molar ratio of the three protein components of the 300-kDa HAR is 1:1:1 (Table I). The 300 HAR could be a (αβγ) heterotrimer with these three subunits being the products of several different genes. Alternatively, the 300 HAR could be a homodimer of ∼300-kDa subunits, with one subunit specifically cleaved into ∼97- and ∼230-kDa species. In purified HAR preparations, the stoichiometry of the 175- and 300-kDa proteins has consistently been 2–3:1 (175:300). Therefore, the overall stoichiometry of the four proteins in reduced, affinity-purified HAR preparations was 2:1:1:1, respectively, for the 175-kDa protein and the α, β, and γ subunits of the 300-kDa complex (Fig.6).Table IStoichiometry of subunits in purified HARExperimentProtein band185 kDa97 kDa230 kDa260 kDafraction of the total staining10.430.140.240.1920.460.050.210.2830.510.100.240.15Mean:0.47 ± 0.040.10 ± 0.050.23 ± 0.020.21 ± 0.07Mole ratio:2.51.01.00.8Affinity-purified LEC HAR preparations were first reduced with 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with silver as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Stained protein bands were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer.

The fraction of total staining in each of the four bands is shown. Although the 175- and 300-kDa species could represent monomeric and dimeric forms of one LEC HAR, the present results show this is not the case. The 175-kDa HAR is not a covalently bound part of the 300-kDa HAR complex. Nonetheless, our earlier photoaffinity approach (14Yannariello-Brown J. Frost S.J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20451-20456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified the correct HAR proteins. Likewise, the ligand blot assay, subsequently developed to identify the LEC HAR (15Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), also monitors the same proteins purified in the present study. Our results, therefore, have consistently identified proteins of 175- and ∼300-kDa as the LEC HAR. These points are relevant in light of earlier reports that the LEC HAR was not larger than 100 kDa (11Forsberg N. Gustafson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and was, in fact, ICAM-1 (12McCourt P.A.G. Ek B. Forsberg N. Gustafson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30081-30084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ICAM-1, which is also designated in lymphocytes as CD54, is not a likely candidate for the very active endocytic HAR of LECs, because ICAM-1 is not a recycling receptor that operates via the coated pit pathway (29Cook G. Dumbar M. Franklin I.M. Acta Haematol. 1997; 97: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although this identification of the LEC HAR as ICAM-1 is now recognized to be incorrect (13McCourt P.A.G. Gustafson S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), erroneous studies based on this report were published (30Gustafson S. Bjorkman T. Forsberg N. Lind T. Wikstrom T. Lidholt K. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Fuxe K. Agnati L.F. Tinner B. Forsberg N. McCourt P. Gustafson S. Brain Res. 1996; 736: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and may be widely cited. A 1:1:1 complex of the three 300-kDa subunits might be expected to migrate as a >500-kDa species in nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Although the lack of good standards above 200 kDa makes it difficult to assign relative mass, the 300-kDa HAR appears to migrate anomalously fast (i.e. to a smaller than appropriate size position). We noted earlier (15Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the 175-kDa HAR and 300-kDa HAR are very elongated, not globular, molecules that behave like elongated rods during SDS-PAGE. Their apparent M r values depend greatly on the pore size of the gels. Therefore, the anomalous migration of the nonreduced 300-kDa HAR may be explained if the two large α and β subunits are also very extended or rod-like in the ternary complex (Fig. 6). We propose that LECs contain the 175- and 300-kDa species as two highly similar but distinct and separate isoreceptors for HA. The consistent 2:1 stoichiometry of the purified 175-kDa HAR and 300-kDa HAR species in LECs may reflect the tight and coordinated regulation of their expression, rather than their physical association. The reason for having two HARs may be related to the great polydispersity of HA. More than one HAR may be required to mediate effective removal from the blood of HA molecules that can vary over a mass range from 103 to 106 Da. Each HA isoreceptor may be specialized to interact with either smaller or larger HA. Ongoing studies to clone and further characterize the four purified HAR subunit proteins will enable us to determine their primary structures and their roles in normal health and a variety of diseases.

A linear relation is observed between the measured fractionation factor and the density of water (0.070 to 1.035 grams per cubic centimeter). The trend of the isotope pressure effect is the same as that of recent theoretical studies, but the magnitude is smaller. The pressure effect must be accounted for in the interpretation of isotopic data of geologic systems involving water (paleotemperature, source of fluids)."

These data suggest the existence of a hitherto unrecognized enzymatic pathway for the formation of allantoin. 5-hydroxyisourate 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline hydroxyisourate hydrolase Nitrogen is a key component of plant metabolism, and its availability often limits the growth of important crop plants. Leguminous plants are able to acquire their nitrogen through association with bacterial symbionts in the root nodules, which fix atmospheric nitrogen to form NH4+ through the action of nitrogenase. The fixed nitrogen is then transported from the bacteria into the host cell cytoplasm, where it is assimilated into organic form and used for the synthesis of nucleic acids, amino acids, and secondary products. The ureides are the major form of nitrogen transport molecules in tropical legumes such as soybean. In nodulated soybean ureides constitute 70–80% of the organic nitrogen in the xylem sap (1McClure P.R. Israel D.W. Plant Physiol. 1979; 64: 411-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ureides are efficient nitrogen transport species; the ratio of C to N in allantoin and allantoate is 1:1, so minimal carbon is diverted from other metabolic functions in support of nitrogen transport. The conversion of inorganic nitrogen into organic forms is an energetically expensive process, however. It has been estimated that 68 ATPs are required for the synthesis of allantoin if the cost of N2fixation is included (2Schubert K.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1986; 37: 539-574Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect mechanisms for the efficient utilization of fixed nitrogen to have arisen. Purine oxidation is the major route for ureide biogenesis, and the so-called ureide pathway is constituted by the enzymes that carry out the conversion of IMP to allantoin and allantoate. It is commonly considered that the role of urate oxidase in this pathway is the conversion of urate to allantoin (3Reynolds P.H.S. Boland M.J. Blevins D.G. Randall D.D. Schubert K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 366-368Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been demonstrated that allantoin is not the true product of the urate oxidase reaction (4Kahn K. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4731-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Modric N. Derome A.E. Ashcroft S.J.H. Poje M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 6691-6694Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Urate oxidase catalyzes the conversion of urate to 5-hydroxyisourate, which decomposes cleanly to allantoin under most in vitro conditions. The half-life of HIU1 at neutral pH is on the order of 30 min in vitro (6Kahn K. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11651-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because the flux through the ureide pathway is critical for nitrogen fixation and metabolism, it is difficult to conceive that the nonenzymatic conversion of HIU to allantoin is the mechanism for ureide synthesisin vivo. A second confounding factor arises from the fact that nonenzymatic decomposition of HIU generates racemic allantoin (7Kahn K. Kinetic and Mechanistic Characterization of the Urate Oxidase Reaction.Ph.D. thesis. University of Missouri, 1998Google Scholar). However, soybean allantoinase is specific for (S)-allantoin (8Lee K.W. Roush A.H. Arch. Biochem . Biophys. 1964; 108: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and we are not aware of reports of an allantoin racemase occurring in plants. The half-time for racemization of allantoin at neutral pH is ∼10 h, 2K. Kahn and P. A. Tipton, manuscript submitted for publication. so again, it would seem that nonenzymatic chemistry is far too slow to support the ureide pathway. These considerations raise the possibility that there exist previously unrecognized enzymes which are responsible for the stereospecific conversion of HIU to (S)-allantoin. In this report we present evidence for the existence of a novel enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of HIU to form OHCU. OHCU has previously been characterized as the next species in the pathway leading from HIU to allantoin under nonenzymatic conditions (Ref. 9Kahn K. Serfozo P. Tipton P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5435-5442Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar and SchemeFS1). We have purified the enzyme, which we designate hydroxyisourate hydrolase, to apparent homogeneity. Sequence data obtained at the amino terminus confirm the novelty of this protein. Uric acid and catalase were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant soybean urate oxidase was purified as described (4Kahn K. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4731-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein sequencing was performed at the University of Missouri Protein Core Facility. 5-Hydroxyisourate was generated by urate oxidase-catalyzed turnover of urate. Approximately 1.5 units of recombinant urate oxidase was added to a 3.0 mm urate solution in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and the solution was gently bubbled with O2. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically, and when HIU formation was maximal the enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration, and the filtrate was stored as aliquots at −80 °C. The HIU concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε302 = 8300 m/cm; Ref. 6Kahn K. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11651-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We estimate that the HIU solutions contained no more than 10% residual urate. HIUHase activity was routinely measured by monitoring the disappearance of HIU at 302 nm. The standard assay mix contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 100 μm HIU; the reaction was initiated by addition of enzyme. For each assay a control reaction from which enzyme was omitted was also monitored to determine the rate of nonenzymatic HIU decomposition. The background rate, which typically did not exceed 25% of the enzyme-catalyzed rate, was subtracted from each enzyme activity measurement to determine the actual HIUHase activity. One unit of activity was defined to be that amount of enzyme that turned over 1 μmol of HIU/min under the above conditions at 25 °C. HIUHase activity was also detected in crude soybean root nodule extract by monitoring the change in optical activity of a solution containing HIU generated in situ by purified urate oxidase. Reactions were conducted in 1-mm pathlength cuvettes, and circular dichroism spectra were obtained with an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter. The purification of HIUHase was accomplished from soybean root nodule extracts (10Karr D.B. Waters J.K. Suzuki F. Emerich D.W. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) generously supplied by Prof. David Emerich (Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri). All enzyme purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Nucleic acids were removed from the crude extract by the addition of protamine sulfate to a final concentration of 1% and subsequent centrifugation. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to reach 65% saturation, and the pelleted protein obtained after centrifugation was dissolved in a minimal amount of 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.3, containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 m NaCl. The solution was applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.2 × 20 cm) and developed with a step gradient of decreasing NaCl concentration. HIUHase was eluted with buffer containing no salt. Active fractions were concentrated by addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 65% saturation. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 50 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol (v/v) and applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex-200, 1.2 × 100 cm). The column was developed with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the highest activity were combined and applied to an immobilized metal affinity column (1 × 10 cm, Chelate Spherilose; Isco). The resin was charged with copper according to the manufacturer's instructions. After sample application, the column was washed with 3–4 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol (v/v). The enzyme was eluted with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration. The sample was exchanged into 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8, by repeated dilution and concentration via ultrafiltration and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1 × 5 cm). After initially washing the column with 3 column volumes of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, a linear gradient to 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, over 50 ml was formed to elute the enzyme. Approximately 8 μg of HIUHase and 1 unit of purified urate oxidase were added to a 1-ml solution containing 2.5 mm [4,6-13C2]urate (9Kahn K. Serfozo P. Tipton P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5435-5442Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and 400 units of catalase in 95 mm sodium phosphate in D2O, pD 7. The solution was transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube, and 13C NMR spectra were obtained at regular time intervals at 17 °C. The 13C NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker AVANCE DRX500 spectrometer using a sweep width of 49,682 Hz. 1,4-Dioxane was included as a chemical shift standard. The observation that urate oxidase catalyzed the conversion of urate, not to allantoin, but to 5-hydroxyisourate prompted us to search for an enzyme that utilized 5-hydroxyisourate as a substrate. The effect of added crude soybean root nodule extract to a solution of HIU generated in situis shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that the extract contained a component that caused the rapid disappearance of HIU. Boiled root nodule extract had no effect on the kinetics of decomposition of HIU. Monitoring the reaction by absorbance spectroscopy confirmed that the disappearance of the optically active HIU was caused by conversion to another species, not racemization. HIUHase was purified from extracts of 4-week-old soybean root nodules using standard protein purification techniques. Table I shows the results from a typical purification of HIUHase. Because of severe interference by polyphenolic compounds during the measurements of activity and protein content in the crude extract and protamine sulfate fractions, the ammonium sulfate fraction is designated as the initial fraction for the purpose of calculating the purity and recovery of activity at each purification step.Table IPurification of HIUHase from 25 ml of soybean root nodule extractFractionActivityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationunitsmgunits/mg%-foldAmmonium sulfate151620.091001Phenyl-Sepharose6110.54406Superdex-20031.22.52028Chelate Spherilose20.752.71330Hydroxyapatite10.1106111 Open table in a new tab The mass of the enzyme under nondenaturing conditions was determined by gel filtration chromatography on a calibrated Superdex-200 column; HIUHase eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified protein yielded a single band upon staining with Coomassie Blue, which had an apparent molecular mass of 68 ± 2 kDa (Fig.2). Thus, HIUHase appears to be a monomer. The purified protein was subjected to automated Edman degradation, and the sequence of the first 19 amino acids at the amino terminus was determined to be ADNYSRDDFPLDFVFVFGS. Searches of available data bases did not reveal any proteins with significant homology to this peptide sequence. The product of the HIUHase reaction was identified by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 13C NMR spectra of HIU and the intermediates on the pathway to allantoin formation (Scheme FS1) have previously been assigned (9Kahn K. Serfozo P. Tipton P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5435-5442Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, in the presence of urate oxidase and HIUHase, [4,6-13C2]urate is rapidly converted to HIU and OHCU, and the subsequent conversion of OHCU to allantoin is evident. In experiments conducted under very similar conditions but in the absence of HIUHase, the formation of HIU before the appearance of OHCU is apparent, and the complete conversion of HIU to allantoin requires several hours (9Kahn K. Serfozo P. Tipton P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5435-5442Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). HIUHase obeyed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics; the K m for HIU was determined to be 15 ± 3 μm, and the turnover number was 11/s. Because we were concerned that residual urate in our solutions of HIU might effect the kinetics of the reaction, we examined the effect of urate on the activity of HIUHase. Urate did not inhibit HIUHase up to concentrations of 1 mm (data not shown). The values of the kinetic parameters determined for HIUHase are similar to the kinetic constants that characterize the preceding ureide pathway enzymes. Xanthine dehydrogenase has a K m for xanthine of 5 μm and a turnover number of 5/s (11Boland M.J. Blevins D.G. Randall D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and urate oxidase has a K m for urate of 10 μm and a turnover number of 2/s (4Kahn K. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4731-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The identification of HIUHase raises several important issues. First, the description of allantoin biogenesis remains incomplete. OHCU decomposes to allantoin, but for the same reasons discussed for HIU, a nonenzymatic pathway for allantoin formation does not seem likely. OHCU must undergo decarboxyation and tautomerization to form allantoin. In the nonenzymatic pathway a highly unusual 1,2-carboxylate shift leading to the formation of allantoin 5-carboxylate occurs (9Kahn K. Serfozo P. Tipton P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5435-5442Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There is no reason to believe that this transformation occurs in a presumptive enzymatic pathway to allantoin formation, nor is there any evidence to rule out its occurrence. The results reported here suggest that a search for an enzyme that acts on OHCU is required, and we are undertaking that investigation. Finally, the in vitro characterization we describe here, although suggestive, does not prove a role for HIUHase in the ureide pathway. Evidence for its in vivo role will come only from studies in which its activity is manipulated in planta using the techniques of molecular biology or the application of inhibitors. We have undertaken the cloning of the gene that encodes HIUHase, which we hope will facilitate investigations of its metabolic role."

Numerous other importin β-related proteins have subsequently been identified and found to be also involved in import and export pathways of proteins and RNA. One of these, termed transportin or karyopherin β2, has been shown to mediate the import of the heterogeneous nuclear RNP protein A1 by binding to a novel, nonbasic type NLS, named the M9 sequence (40Siomi M.C.

An analogous protein, Kap104p, appears to be required for the import of various heterogeneous nuclear RNP proteins in yeast, although no matching M9-like yeast import signal has been identified to date (45Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Nuclear import of U snRNPs also appears to rely on the activity of importin β (46Palacios I. Hetzer M. Adam S.A. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, the nuclear import signal of U snRNPs is defined by the trimethyl guanosine cap structure on the one hand and by the assembled Sm core proteins on the other (47Fischer U.

Snurportin, a protein containing an importin α-like importin β binding domain, directly interacts with the trimethyl guansine cap structure of the RNA and stimulates U snRNP import inXenopus oocytes. It therefore appears likely that Snurportin serves as an importin α-like adaptor molecule, mediating the binding of the transport substrate (U snRNP) to the import receptor (importin β). It is not yet clear, however, how the Sm core proteins carrying the second import signal are recognized. It seems possible that an additional, yet to be identified import factor binds to the Sm core proteins (54Huber J. Cronshagen U. Kadokura M. Marshallsay C. Wada T. Sekine M. Lührmann R.

The NLSs of several different ribosomal proteins have been defined. Although some of these resemble the basic NLSs of the SV40 type (55Schmidt C. Lipsius E. Kruppa J. Mol. Biol.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that importin β, transportin, RanBP5, and RanBP7 are capable of binding to and mediating the import of different ribosomal proteins (including L5) in permeabilized HeLa cells (64Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). After translocation to the nucleus, ribosomal proteins must migrate to the nucleolus for ribosomal subunit assembly. Despite of the fact that some regions of nucleolarly localized proteins have been shown to be necessary for nucleolar accumulation, no consensus targeting sequence has been defined to date. Nucleolar localization is likely to occur by diffusion through the nucleoplasm, followed by nucleolar retention via interaction with other nucleolar components (65Zirwes R.F. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S.

In some cellular proteins, as well as in a number of viral proteins, very small regions have been identified that were found to be sufficient to target a reporter protein to the nucleolus, although there is no direct evidence for signal/receptor-mediated transport (74Moroianu J.

Virol. 1990; 64: 881-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we analyze aspects of the nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosomal protein L5 and 5 S rRNA. L5 is found to contain three separate NLS elements that function in both somatic cells and oocytes, but none of these is sufficient to promote nucleolar accumulation at levels that are characteristic of the full-length protein. N- and C-terminal sequence elements in L5 are required for 5 S rRNA binding. Only two of the three NLSs, located at the N and C termini, respectively, are capable of mediating nuclear transfer of a covalently attached complex of TFIIIA and 5 S rRNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the ability of L5 to bind to a set of different known import receptors reflects a function of the N-terminal NLS but not of the other two NLSs.DISCUSSIONOur analysis of RNA binding and nuclear import activities in the ribosomal protein L5 from X. laevis allows for several different conclusions. L5 contains three separate nuclear localization signals, which are functionally distinct. Whereas L5-NLS-1 and -3 function in RNP import, L5-NLS-2 does not. L5-NLS-1 binds to a number of different known NLS receptors in vitro, and L5-NLS-2 and -3 do not. Complex formation with 5 S ribosomal RNA requires both N- and C-terminal sequence elements of L5. Finally, we also report that NLS function and RNA binding activity are not sufficient to allow wild-type levels of nucleolar accumulation.The existence of multiple nuclear localization signals in ribosomal proteins has been reported previously, such as for yeast L25 and L29, as well as for human S6, S7, and L7 (55Schmidt C. Lipsius E. Kruppa J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 56Annilo T. Karis A. Hoth S. Rikk T. Kruppa J. Metspalu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 58Underwood M.R. Fried H.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 59Schaap P.J. van't Riet J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5229-5235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Many of these NLSs consist of basic amino acid stretches, which show similarities to nuclear localization signals of the SV40 or nucleoplasmin type; however, others do not fit into any of these types of consensus sequences. Of the three different NLSs in L5, the two located at the N and C termini resemble the canonical NLS of the nucleoplasmin type. The third one, referred to as L5-NLS-2 and located within the central portion of the protein, is structurally distinct and includes sequence elements that are widely separated within the primary structure of L5. L5-NLS-2 is also functionally distinct from L5-NLS-1 and -3; in contrast to these latter NLSs, it is not capable of mediating the nuclear import of a covalently attached, heterologous RNP. Because the NLS-2 bearing L5 fragment retains 5 S rRNA binding activity and also due to its complex structure, one could imagine that L5-NLS-2 is masked in the 5 S RNP and thus only visible in the free L5 protein. Candidate nuclear import receptors for L5-NLS-2 remain to be identified, because results obtained in in vitro binding assays with a set of different known import receptors were negative. However, the fact that L5-NLS-2 can mediate nuclear protein import but not RNP import seems to indicate that these processes may occur via separate, perhaps only partially overlapping pathways.The redundancy of nuclear import signals in L5 may also directly reflect a redundancy of nuclear import pathways. Very recently, Jäkel and Görlich (64Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate that four different importin β-like transport factors, namely importin β, transportin, Ran BP5, and Ran BP7, are able to mediate the nuclear transport of ribosomal proteins, including L5, in vitro. This raises the question of whether the three different NLSs in L5 may represent binding sites for different transport factors. Interestingly, L5-NLS-1 reproduces the spectrum of import receptor binding that is observed with the full-length protein. Thus, it seems likely that this basic, N-terminal NLS in L5 can utilize different import receptors or pathways. This situation is reminiscent of what has been described for ribosomal protein L23a. A relatively small sequence element in the N-terminal region of L23a, which is equally enriched in basic amino acids, serves as a binding site for four different import receptors, and it has been proposed that this sequence element might be considered as an archetypal import signal that evolved before the various import receptors diverged in evolution (64Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Our observations with NLS-1 in L5 appear to reinforce the same notion, even though L5 NLS-1 does not seem to be closely related to the corresponding sequence element in L23a, referred to as the BIB domain (64Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), except for the notion that both sequences appear relatively enriched in basic amino acids.Our RNA binding studies with ribosomal protein L5 demonstrate that sequence elements located in the N-terminal as well as in the C-terminal portion of the protein are required for 5 S rRNA recognition and binding. Previous coprecipitation analyses by Michael and Dreyfuss (89Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11571-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using biotinylated 5 S rRNA had suggested that an N-terminal fragment of rat L5 containing amino acids 1–93, as well as several other fragments that contain the same N-terminal portion of the protein, are sufficient to bind specifically to human 5 S rRNA. Using the same type of binding assay, we have been able to reproduce those results, and we have also obtained qualitatively similar results with fragments derived from Xenopus L5. However, using biotinylated U6 snRNA as a control revealed a high background of unspecific binding with the same set of proteins (data not shown). We conclude that the stringency of our coimmunoprecipitation analyses with antibodies directed against the protein moiety of the RNP complex and with an unmodified RNA substrate is significantly higher than in this latter type of assay. The importance of N- and C-terminal amino acid residues in the yeast L5 homolog, referred to as YL3, for binding to yeast 5 S rRNA has similarly been reported previously. By in vitro and in vivo binding assays, it was demonstrated that point mutations in the N- and C-terminal part of the protein, as well as C-terminal deletions, interfere with 5 S rRNA binding activity (90Deshmukh M. Stark J. Yeh L.C. Lee J.C. Woolford Jr., J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30148-30156Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).After translocation into the nucleus, ribosomal proteins must travel to the nucleolus in order to be able to participate in ribosomal subunit assembly. Despite the fact that some regions of nucleolar proteins, including some ribosomal proteins, have been shown to be necessary for nucleolar targeting, no consensus targeting sequence has been defined to date. Nucleolar localization could either occur by a combination of diffusion through the nucleoplasm and nucleolar retention by interaction with other nucleolar components (65Zirwes R.F.

In transient transfection experiments, we were able to show that only the full-length L5 protein is able to mediate efficient nucleolar accumulation. This observation is compatible with the idea that nucleolar accumulation of L5 requires the complex activities of the protein, i.e. its ability to interact with ribosomal RNA and other ribosomal proteins in the context of ribosomal subunit assembly. However, our experiments do not exclude the existence of a specific nucleolar localization signal that would have a complex architecture and would not be maintained in the different L5 fragments that we have used. Large quantities of 5 S ribosomal RNA are synthesized in excess over other ribosomal components and stored in the cytoplasm during early stages of oogenesis in Xenopus (1Mairy M. Denis"

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), whereas in budding yeast, a unique Cdk, Cdc28 kinase, functions by associating with distinct cyclins (2Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin.

Budding yeast also has a Cdk family whose members, including Pho85, Kin28, and Srb10 kinases, function in various cellular events (3Toh-e A. Tanaka K. Uesono Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Gen.

Tsai, personal communication.These similarities prompted us to test whether mouse Cdk5 kinase expressed in yeast cells can substitute Pho85 kinase and interact with Pho85-cyclins. Here we report that mouse Cdk5 kinase can suppress some of pho85Δ mutant phenotypes and can associate with Pho85-cyclins, including Pcl1, Pcl2, Pcl6, Pcl9, and Pho80, to phosphorylate Pho4. Thus mouse Cdk5 kinase is a functional homologue of yeast Pho85 kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Media—Yeast strains used were MFY115 (MATα leu2 ura3 trp1 ade1 his GAL +), MFY116 (MFY115pho85Δ::LEU2), MFY121 (MATa leu2 ura3 trp1 ade1 his GAL + pho85Δ::URA3), and MFY151 (MATa ade2–1 trp1–1 leu2–3, 112 his3–11, 15 ura3 GAL cln1::hisG cln2 METp-CLN2(TRP1)pho85Δ::LEU2) (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MFY164 (pho85Δ) was derived from MFY121 by selecting a resistant to 5-fluoro-orotic acid (24Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) and was used to construct double mutants with pcl1Δ (MFY165), pcl2Δ (MFY175),pcl6Δ (MFY166), pcl9Δ (MFY167), orpho80Δ (MFY168). Yeast cells were grown in SD medium containing 0.67% Difco Yeast Nitrogen Base, 2% glucose, and appropriate nutritional supplements (25Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 177-178Google Scholar); SGal medium where galactose replaces glucose in SD; or SGlyLac medium where glycerol plus lactate replace glucose.Polymerase chain reaction Cloning and Construction of PlasmidsCloning of PCL1, PCL2, CLB2, andPHO80 was described previously (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encodingPCL6 or PCL9 were similarly cloned (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar): the primers were synthesized to incorporate an NcoI site at the start codon of PCL6 (5′-AAATAGCGGCGCCATGGCTATCAAAGG) or an EcoRI site immediately downstream of the start codon of PCL9 (5′-CACAAAGAGATGAATTCTGACTACGAT) and aBglII site at the 3′-end of each ORF (5′-CATATTACGCATTTAGATCTGCCCGTAACTAG for PCL6 and 5′-GGCGAGTAACTTAAGATCTTTGCTTGAAAAACG for PCL9). These fragments were incorporated into pMF906 (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), together with aTRP1 marker, to produce HA-cyclins under the control of theGAL10 promoter. To disrupt genomic loci of these cyclins, aTRP1 fragment was used to replace anEcoRV-SalI fragment of PCL1, anSspI-SspI fragment of PCL2, aBamHI-XbaI fragment of PCL6, and anNcoI-EcoRV fragment of PCL9, and aLEU2 fragment was to replace aClaI-XbaI fragment of PHO80. Successful disruption was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. A cDNA clone encoding mouse Cdk5 kinase (26Tsai L.-H. Takahashi T. Caviness V. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a URA3marker were cloned into pMF906 plasmid to generate pMF1086. The cDNA fragment was also incorporated into pMF568 (URA3) to generate pMF1057 in which the kinase was produced under the control of the PYK1 promoter (27Nishizawa M. Taga S. Matsubara A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMF1079 consists of aBamHI-SalI fragment containing the promoter and the ORF of PHO85 2Nishizawa, M., Suzuki, K., Fujino, M., Oguchi, T., and Toh-e, A. (1999) Genes Cells, in press.and a URA3 marker. To overproduce Pho4 and Clb2 proteins, DNA fragments encoding each protein were cloned into pMF906, together with a TRP1 or a LEU2 marker to generate pMF869 (GAL10-PHO4-TRP1), pMF1084 (GAL10-PHO4-LEU2), pMF922 (GAL10-CLB2-TRP1), and pMF1085 (GAL10-CLB2-LEU2).Analysis of Mutant Phenotypes and Its SuppressionUtilization of nonfermentable carbon source, production of acid phosphatase, and accumulation of glycogen were assayed as described (11Toh-e A.

Suppression of growth arrest of acln1 cln2 pho85 triple mutant was tested with strain MFY151 as described (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Morphological defects were microscopically observed with overnight culture, and cell number was counted with a hemocytometer. Suppression of growth defect caused by overproduction of Pho4 or Clb2 proteins was analyzed by streaking yeast transformants on SD and SGal media supplemented with nutrients but lacking uracil and leucine. For spotting cell suspension, overnight culture of yeast transformants were adjusted to ∼5 × 107 cells/ml, and serial 10-fold dilutions of the suspension were plated on SD and SGal media supplemented with nutrients but lacking uracil, leucine, and tryptophan.Immunoprecipitation and Kinase AssayPreparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and kinase assay were as described (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the induction of the production of HA-cyclin and Cdk5 in SGal medium at 30 °C for 3 h, the extracts were prepared from cells suspended in lysis buffer by vortexing with glass beads (0.45-mm diameter). To 50 μl of the extract containing ∼200 μg of protein, 1 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HAmAb; clone 16B12, Berkeley Antibody Company) or 1 μl of anti-GST antibody (GST Ab) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. The immunocomplex was recovered by absorbing with Protein A-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (lysis buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl) and twice with kinase assay buffer, and subjected to kinase assay using Pho4, Sic1, or histone H1 as substrate. Immunoblotting of Cdk5 and HA-cyclins were performed essentially as described (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using anti-Cdk5 monoclonal antibody (a gift of G. Patrick and L.-H.

Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MFY164 (pho85Δ) was derived from MFY121 by selecting a resistant to 5-fluoro-orotic acid (24Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) and was used to construct double mutants with pcl1Δ (MFY165), pcl2Δ (MFY175),pcl6Δ (MFY166), pcl9Δ (MFY167), orpho80Δ (MFY168). Yeast cells were grown in SD medium containing 0.67% Difco Yeast Nitrogen Base, 2% glucose, and appropriate nutritional supplements (25Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

Polymerase chain reaction Cloning and Construction of PlasmidsCloning of PCL1, PCL2, CLB2, andPHO80 was described previously (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encodingPCL6 or PCL9 were similarly cloned (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar): the primers were synthesized to incorporate an NcoI site at the start codon of PCL6 (5′-AAATAGCGGCGCCATGGCTATCAAAGG) or an EcoRI site immediately downstream of the start codon of PCL9 (5′-CACAAAGAGATGAATTCTGACTACGAT) and aBglII site at the 3′-end of each ORF (5′-CATATTACGCATTTAGATCTGCCCGTAACTAG for PCL6 and 5′-GGCGAGTAACTTAAGATCTTTGCTTGAAAAACG for PCL9). These fragments were incorporated into pMF906 (19Nishizawa M. Kawasumi M. Fujino M. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), together with aTRP1 marker, to produce HA-cyclins under the control of theGAL10 promoter. To disrupt genomic loci of these cyclins, aTRP1 fragment was used to replace anEcoRV-SalI fragment of PCL1, anSspI-SspI fragment of PCL2, aBamHI-XbaI fragment of PCL6, and anNcoI-EcoRV fragment of PCL9, and aLEU2 fragment was to replace aClaI-XbaI fragment of PHO80. Successful disruption was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. A cDNA clone encoding mouse Cdk5 kinase (26Tsai L.-H. Takahashi T. Caviness V. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a URA3marker were cloned into pMF906 plasmid to generate pMF1086. The cDNA fragment was also incorporated into pMF568 (URA3) to generate pMF1057 in which the kinase was produced under the control of the PYK1 promoter (27Nishizawa M. Taga S. Matsubara A. Mol. Gen.

Suppression of growth defect caused by overproduction of Pho4 or Clb2 proteins was analyzed by streaking yeast transformants on SD and SGal media supplemented with nutrients but lacking uracil and leucine. For spotting cell suspension, overnight culture of yeast transformants were adjusted to ∼5 × 107 cells/ml, and serial 10-fold dilutions of the suspension were plated on SD and SGal media supplemented with nutrients but lacking uracil, leucine, and tryptophan.Immunoprecipitation and Kinase AssayPreparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and kinase assay were as described (19Nishizawa M.

In addition to the documented effect of diabetes to increase p36 mRNA and protein in the liver and kidney, a ∼2-fold increase in the mRNA abundance of p46 was found in liver, kidney, and intestine, and a similar increase was found in the p46 protein level in liver. In HepG2 cells, glucose caused a dose-dependent (1–25 mm) increase (up to 5-fold) in p36 and p46 mRNA and a lesser increase in p46 protein, whereas insulin (1 μm) suppressed p36 mRNA, reduced p46 mRNA level by half, and decreased p46 protein by about 33%. Cyclic AMP (100 μm) increased p36 and p46 mRNA by >2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, but not p46 protein. These data suggest that insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia might each be responsible for up-regulation of G6Pase in diabetes. It is concluded that enhanced hepatic glucose output in insulin-dependent diabetes probably involves dysregulation of both the catalytic subunit and the putative glucose-6-phosphate translocase of the liver G6Pase system.

Diabetes. 1993; 42: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Studies in Fao hepatoma cells showed that insulin suppressed p36 mRNA levels and that cyclic AMP (cAMP) counteracted this effect (5Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas cAMP alone increased p36 mRNA by a factor of four (6Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liu et al. (2Liu Z.Q. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) observed that blood glucose concentrations correlated with G6Pase mRNA levels, suggesting that G6Pase transcription might be controlled by glucose or a glucose-derived metabolite. This presumption was later verified by direct demonstration of glucose (7Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (8Argaud D. Kirby T.L. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12854-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) stimulation of p36 expression. A major breakthrough in the G6Pase field has been the finding of a human cDNA sequence encoding a 46-kDa protein (p46) homologous to bacterial phosphate ester transporters (9Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mutations of the p46 gene were found in glycogen storage disease type 1b patients, which have impaired G6Pase activity despite normal p36 catalytic subunit (9Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that p46 was the putative G6P translocase of the G6Pase system. Until now, there has been no report on the regulation of the expression of p46, and its role in the control of G6Pase activity is unknown. Here we show that p46 mRNA and protein are induced by glucose and are repressed by insulin, in parallel to p36, and that p36 and p46 mRNA are increased by cAMP. These results may explain the present finding that both the catalytic subunit and the putative G6P translocase are impaired in insulin-dependent diabetes. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) (Charles River, Canada) were given one intravenous administration of streptozocin (75 mg/kg) (Upjohn, Ontario) dissolved in citrate, pH 4.0 (n, 6) or vehicle alone (n, 7). The diabetic state was assessed by the presence of hyperglycemia after a 24-hour fasting period by glucosuria and by a lesser weight gain. The two groups were sacrificed by decapitation after an overnight fast, 1 week after the treatment. Blood was obtained as well as tissue samples (liver, heart, hind limb skeletal muscle, kidney, small intestine, and brain), that were quickly freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. Rat liver microsomes were isolated individually from each rat as described previously (10St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and resuspended at a protein concentration of about 7 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.3, 250 mmsucrose. G6Pase activity was assayed with 5 mm[U-14C]G6P after detergent (CHAPSO 0.8%) treatment as described in Ref. 10St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine fetal serum. To investigate the effect of glucose, cells were kept in the presence of the indicated glucose concentrations for 48 h at 37 °C. Insulin (1 μm) or cAMP (0.5–100 μm in the presence of 50 μm methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) to inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterases) was added to 80–90% confluent HepG2 cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the indicated times, in the presence of 5 mm glucose. Cells were harvested by scraping after different times of glucose or hormone treatment and kept at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the recombinant G6Pase catalytic subunit (antibody against p36) was a kind gift from Dr. J. Y. Chou (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The rabbit antiserum against the N terminus of p46 (GYGYYRTVIFSAMFGGY) was produced in our laboratory as explained by Xieet al. (11Xie W.S. Li Y.Z. Mechin M.C. van de Werve G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and according to the methods described in detail by Mechin et al. (12Mechin M.C. Rousset E. Girardeau J.P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3555-3564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions isolated from different tissues or HepG2 cell homogenates (50 μg protein) were subjected to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 100 V for about 1 h in Laemmli buffer (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were then electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 h. The membrane was saturated for 1 h in 100 mmTris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 10% dried milk (w/v) and further incubated overnight in the primary antibody solution (diluted to 1/500 for anti-p36 or 1/200 for anti-p46). After washing, the membrane was incubated in the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG solution (diluted to 1/2000) for 2 h, washed again, and detected in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate system (Promega). The membrane was scanned, and the quantification of each specific band was analyzed by using a Dual LightTM Transilluminator. Total RNA was isolated from either frozen tissues of the two groups of rats or from HepG2 cells with Trizol LS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the protocol of the manufacturer. About 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-denatured-agarose gel in 1 × MOPS running buffer. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary action overnight. The membrane was then hybridized with32P-labeled G6Pase catalytic subunit (p36) (14Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) probes overnight at 68 °C in ExpressHybTM Hybridization solution (CLONTECH). After hybridization, membranes were washed five times with different proportions of SSC/SDS buffer and exposed to an x-ray film for the indicated times at −80 °C. Both p36 and p46 probes were full-length human cDNA fragments labeled by a random primer method with Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probes were then purified with MicroSpinTM G-50 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantification was performed with a scanning densitometer (Dual LightTM Transilluminator) and equal amount of loading was verified by the 28 S ribosomal RNA signal obtained by ethidium bromide staining. Glucose was assayed with a blood glucose monitor (Accu-Chek® AdvantageMD, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein with a Bio-Rad kit based on the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Statistical analysis was performed according to Student's ttest. Differences were considered significant when the pvalue was less than 0.05. TableI shows the effect of streptozocin or vehicle treatment on body weight, fasting blood glucose, glucosuria, and liver G6Pase activity of the two groups of rats. As expected, diabetic animals were markedly hyperglycemic, had glucosuria, and gained less weight after treatment than the corresponding controls. G6Pase activity measured in microsomes isolated from livers of the rats was increased by about 2-fold in the diabetic group, as documented before (1Burchell A. Cain D.I. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Liu Z.Q. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(n, 6 or 7). The catalytic subunit of G6Pase, p36, is known to be expressed mainly in gluconeogenic tissues such as liver and kidney (16Nordlie R.C. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 33-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and has been also found recently in small intestine (17Rajas F. Bruni N. Montano S. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is apparent from the Northern blots shown in Fig.1 A that the tissue distribution of p46 in rats is parallel to that of p36 (16Nordlie R.C. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 33-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Rajas F. Bruni N. Montano S. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with higher mRNA abundance of p46 in liver and kidney compared with intestine and no signal in skeletal muscle as well as in brain and heart (results not shown). Using a more sensitive Northern blotting analysis with poly(A)+ RNAs, Lin et al. (18Lin B. Annabi B. Hiwaiwa H. Pan C.J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found p46 mRNA in almost all rat tissues investigated. Insulin-deficient streptozocin diabetes increased the p46 transcript by 2–3-fold in liver, kidney, and intestine and, as reported previously, also increased liver p36 mRNA (Fig. 1 A) (2Liu Z.Q. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fig.1 B further shows by immunoblotting analysis that p36 protein is increased in diabetic liver and kidney compared with control as shown before (2Liu Z.Q. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Nordlie R.C. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 33-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and that p46 protein is increased in liver in parallel with p36. Both proteins were undetectable either in control or in diabetic skeletal muscle. These results indicate that in the G6Pase system, p46, in addition to p36, could play a role in glucose production by liver and their dysregulation in diabetes. They also show that p46 mRNA is up-regulated similarly to p36 mRNA by diabetes in tissues (liver, kidney, and intestine) where p36 is present and where p36 mRNA is also enhanced (2Liu Z.Q. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Rajas F. Bruni N. Montano S. Zitoun C. Mithieux G.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The relative contributions in diabetes of insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and cAMP (resulting from counterregulatory hormones unopposed by the lack of insulin) on p36 and p46 were further assessed in HepG2 cells. A dose-dependent increase by glucose (1–25 mm) of both p36 and p46 mRNA was observed in these cells (Fig.2 A). Whereas a maximal level of p46 mRNA was obtained at 15 mm glucose, the p36 mRNA level still increased at higher (25 mm) glucose concentrations (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, these changes already occurred at physiological (5–10 mm) concentrations of glucose and were further exacerbated at higher (15–25 mm) concentrations, corresponding to those found in the circulation of the diabetic rats (see Table I). Accordingly, p46 protein levels were also increased by glucose in a dose-dependent (1–25 mm) manner (Fig.2 B), but the effect was smaller than that on the corresponding mRNA. P46 mRNA was decreased by half after a 24-h exposure to insulin (1 μm) and increased by 2-fold after 6 h in the presence of cAMP (100 μm in the presence of 50 μm MIX). P36 mRNA was suppressed by insulin and increased by cAMP (Fig. 3 A), as previously documented (5Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A lower concentration of cAMP (0.5 μm plus 50 μm MIX) already caused a 1.5-fold increase in p36 and p46 mRNA (results not shown). Fig.3 B shows that the p46 protein level was decreased by insulin (1 μm, 24 h) to a lesser extent than mRNA and was unaffected by cAMP. The fact that the regulation of p46 expression is parallel to that of p36 may suggest that similar response elements for insulin and cAMP, respectively (20Schmoll D. Allan B.B. Burchell A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11698-11701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), are involved in the control of the two genes. The dichotomy between changes in p46 mRNA and p46 protein with cAMP suggests either increased degradation of p46 or less translation of p46 mRNA in that condition. Taken together, these results indicate that several parameters (insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and increased intracellular cAMP consequent to unopposed counterregulatory hormones) contribute independently from each other to elevated p36 and p46 in insulin-dependent diabetes and may exacerbate hyperglycemia by increased hepatic glucose output. Consistent with this idea, a potent inhibitor of p46, chlorogenic acid (22Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Callaway E.S. Burger H.J. Hemmerle H. Schubert G. Herling A.W. Oekonomopulos R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6223-6227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), is currently being studied as a pharmaceutical tool to inhibit hepatic glucose production in diabetes (23Herling A.W. Burger H.J. Schwab D. Hermmerle H. Below P. Schubert G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1087-G1093PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of p36 in primary hepatocytes with a recombinant adenovirus (24Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) resulted in increased flux through G6Pase, suggesting that an increase in the catalytic subunit alone is sufficient to activate G6Pase in the intact cell. The mechanism(s) by which overexpression of p46 might affect p36 catalytic activity is however not known and deserves further studies. We thank Dr. Emile Van Schaftingen for providing the cDNA for human p46 and Dr. Janice Y. Chou for providing the cDNA for human p36 and antibodies against p36.

S. mansoni stathmin-like protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Stathmin is a ubiquitous and highly conserved phosphoprotein, the synthesis and phosphorylation of which vary in close association with growth and differentiation of vertebrate cells (1Sobel A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 2Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Although stathmin-like proteins have been recently identified in plants (3Flurkey W.H. Prentice D.A. Fox M.T. Hughes J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), no similar proteins have been reported for invertebrates. We describe here a protein of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni that bears structural and functional similarity with stathmin. Parasitic trematodes of the genus Schistosoma are the causative agents of schistosomiasis, a disease currently estimated to affect 200 million people in tropical and subtropical countries. Schistosomes have a complex life cycle involving a mammalian host in which adults of the two sexes mate and deposit eggs, a free aquatic stage (miracidium) derived from eggs excreted into the environment, a molluscan stage with active asexual multiplication, and another free aquatic stage (cercaria) that is capable of infecting the mammalian host by rapidly penetrating through intact skin. The newly penetrated larva (schistosomulum) migrates to its final location in the venous system of the mammalian host and differentiates into adult male and female worms. The life cycle is characterized by dramatic morphological transformations and by rapid physiological adaptations, such as those required by the drastic temperature and osmolarity variations that schistosomes encounter in their changes of host and environment. Practically nothing is known of the molecular mechanisms that govern these processes, e.g. of the signals exchanged between hosts and parasites, between the environment and the parasite, and between the two sexes of the parasite. The S. mansoni stathmin-like protein (SmSLP)1 is abundantly expressed during a very short and critical period of the parasite life cycle, whereas it is undetectable at other stages. We propose that SmSLP plays important regulatory roles during the life cycle of schistosomes. A Puerto Rican strain of S. mansoniwas maintained by serial passages in outbred Swiss mice and the aquatic mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata (4Cioli D. Int. J. Parasitol. 1976; 6: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Adult schistosomes were obtained by portal perfusion of 7-week-infected mice. Three-hour schistosomula were produced by mechanical transformation of cercariae (5Ramalho-Pinto F.J. Gazzinelli G. Howells R.E. Mota-Santos T.A. Pellegrino J. Exp. Parasitol. 1974; 36: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), whereas later schistosomulum stages were obtained by in vitro maintenance of 3-h schistosomula. Labeling with the Bolton-Hunter reagent and lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination were performed as described previously (6Liberti P. Festucci A. Ruppel A. Gigante S. Cioli D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 18: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling at the sporocyst stage, infected snails were exposed for 4 h to [35S]methionine (25 μCi/ml in water), and aliquots of the snail hepatopancreas were boiled in sample buffer and used for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis. PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (7Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing gels contained a total amount of 2% ampholines, of the pH ranges 7–9, 9–11, and 3–10 in the proportion 2:2:1. The gel was run overnight at 1 mA and separated proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose after an incubation of 10 min in transfer buffer containing 0,2% SDS. Autoradiographic procedures have been previously described (6Liberti P. Festucci A. Ruppel A. Gigante S. Cioli D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 18: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed using a 1:1,000 dilution of the anti-SmSLP serum, followed by goat anti-rabbit serum (1: 5,000) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Cercariae or 3-h schistosomula were suspended in a Tris-buffered high salt solution (1.2 mNaCl, 83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C and then for another 1 h at 37 °C (6Liberti P. Festucci A. Ruppel A. Gigante S. Cioli D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 18: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The supernatant containing SmSLP was removed at the end of the incubation by letting the parasites settle at the bottom of the tube. When used for in vitrotubulin assembly experiments, SmSLP was further purified by molecular sieving on a Sephadex G-100 column in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01m Tris, pH 7.4. Using the eluate of a pool of SmSLP bands cut from PAGE runs of schistosomulum high salt extracts, a rabbit was injected intradermally in 30 different sites with about 50 μg of protein in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed 1 month later by two additional injections of the same antigen in incomplete adjuvant. The serum obtained 1 week after the last immunization was capable of specifically precipitating the radioactive SmSLP band labeled in vivo and of recognizing the same band in Western blots of schistosomulum extracts. A purified preparation of SmSLP was obtained by isolating the corresponding band from a PAGE run of a high salt extract of schistosomula, eluting a pool of such bands, and rerunning the eluate on a second gel. The protein was transferred to a Problot membrane (Applied Biosystems) and N-terminally sequenced using a Perkin-Elmer AB 476A apparatus (sequencing courtesy of Prof. D. Barra, University of Rome). Degenerate primers were designed on the N-terminal sequence obtained from the protein and were used in polymerase chain reaction to amplify the DNA obtained from a λgt11 sporocyst library kindly supplied by Dr. J. McKerrow (University of California, San Francisco). The same library was screened according to standard procedures (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the plaque-purified clones were sequenced after subcloning in pUC-18. The vector pQE9 (Qiagen) was used for expression, and the expressed proteins were analyzed by PAGE and Western blotting. A high salt extract from 104 schistosomula was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with 10 units of alkaline phosphatase attached to oxirane-activated macroporous acrylic beads (Sigma), in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS in a final volume of 80 μl. The reaction was terminated by freezing, and the sample was prepared for isoelectric focusing together with an identically treated aliquot incubated in the absence of phosphatase. The turbidimetric polymerization assay (9Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Shelanski M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 737-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) was performed using bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO; catalog no. M113) and monitoring theA 340 at 37 °C. The polymerization buffer contained 0.1 m MES, pH 6.6, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 m glycerol, 1 mm GTP. In the course of a study aimed at the identification of surface larval proteins of S. mansoni, we noticed that, using the Bolton-Hunter reagent on 3-h schistosomula, a number of labeled bands could be detected by SDS-PAGE, but the most prominent concentration of radioactivity was in the 19-kDa region (Fig.1 A, lane 1). We have previously described an 18-kDa polypeptide that was preferentially iodinated in 3-h schistosomula using lactoperoxidase (6Liberti P. Festucci A. Ruppel A. Gigante S. Cioli D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 18: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We initially thought that the same protein also became labeled using the Bolton-Hunter reagent, but on closer examination, we realized that the relative mobility of the protein labeled with the latter reagent is slightly different (about 19 kDa, Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and that the two molecules have different biochemical characteristics. In addition, although the radioactivity of SmSLP is exactly superimposed on a discrete protein band detected by Coomassie Blue staining, the radioactivity obtained by lactoperoxidase labeling does not coincide with a detectable band in the protein pattern of whole schistosomula (not shown). Because it was assumed that the preferential labeling of SmSLP could be due to its location at or near the surface of the schistosomulum, the production of surface membrane vesicles (10Kusel J.R. Gazzinelli G. Colley D.G. de Souza C.P. Cordeiro M.N. Parasitology. 1984; 89: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) seemed an appropriate method for the purification of the protein. When 3-h schistosomula were kept in high salt buffer for 1 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h at 37 °C, a band corresponding to the position of SmSLP was quantitatively extracted in the first supernatant (which does not contain vesicles), as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1 B). An identical experiment carried out using schistosomula labeled with the Bolton-Hunter reagent confirmed that the labeled band was also quantitatively extracted (not shown). Because this procedure yielded a limited number of released proteins, elution of SmSLP from acrylamide gels of extraction supernatants provided a fraction containing SmSLP in very high purity. The same extraction procedure used with schistosomula could be applied directly to cercariae. In order to select the life cycle stage to be used as the source of SmSLP mRNA, we incubated 3-h schistosomula, adult worms, and infected snails with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated the labeled products with the specific anti-SmSLP serum. Whereas 3-h schistosomula and adult worms failed to show any incorporation of precursor in the SmSLP band (not shown), the immunoprecipitate of infected snails showed a labeled band of the 19-kDa mobility expected for SmSLP (Fig.1 C), demonstrating that the synthesis of this protein occurs in the sporocyst of infected snails. Before undertaking immunoscreening of the cDNA library, we also made sure that our antiserum was not directed against carbohydrate determinants that could be possibly present in SmSLP. We could not detect any binding of labeled SmSLP to a number of lectins (concanavalin A, wheat germ, peanut, or lentil lectin). In addition, when labeled SmSLP was subjected to digestion with endoglycosidase F in a test tube containing unlabeled fetuin as a control, no modification in SDS-PAGE mobility could be detected for SmSLP, whereas fetuin was clearly shifted to lower molecular weights after digestion (results not shown). We could thus conclude that SmSLP is very unlikely to be glycosylated. A purified fraction of SmSLP was prepared by extraction of schistosomula in high salt buffer, SDS-PAGE separation of the supernatant, and elution of the gel region corresponding to trace amounts of labeled SmSLP. The following N-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained by Edman degradation of the purified fraction: TTLEEAPHPS EKDMELVYID AEYEKEGGLK SIXNEIK Based on the partial amino acid sequence, two degenerate primers were designed and synthesized (forward, 5′-GAA TTC GAR AAY GCN CCN CAY CC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAA TTC CCY TCY TTY TCR TAY TC-3′). Polymerase chain reaction amplification using these primers on a template consisting of the DNA from a cDNA library of S. mansoni sporocysts yielded a 71-base pair product that had the sequence expected for the N-terminal region of SmSLP. The anti-SmSLP rabbit antiserum was used to screen a λgt11 cDNA expression library from S. mansoni sporocysts and led to the isolation of a clone corresponding to the 3′-region comprising the poly(A). Sequencing of the whole transcript was obtained through polymerase chain reaction amplification and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using various combinations of the primers designed according to the sequences of the 5′- and 3′-regions of the gene and the λgt11 forward and reverse primers (Fig. 2). The coding sequence contains at the N terminus a typical hydrophobic leader peptide of 22 amino acids, followed by the sequence originally determined by Edman degradation of the mature protein (Fig. 2, underlined). The open reading frame corresponds to a protein of 117 residues and is followed by three closely spaced termination codons. Downstream of 99 untranslated nucleotides, a polyadenylation signal is followed by 15 additional nucleotides and by the poly(A). The deduced protein is predominantly hydrophilic, is predicted to be mostly in α-helical conformation, and has a theoretical pI of 8.0. No potential glycosylation sites are available, whereas two serine residues (positions 32 and 61) are present within protein kinase C phosphorylation consensus sequences. The mature protein (without leader peptide) has a calculated molecular weight of 11,345, which is considerably smaller than the size estimated from SDS-PAGE analysis (19 kDa). However, when the recombinant SmSLP without leader sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli, it showed a mobility of 19 kDa, which corresponded exactly to the R F of high salt extracted and iodinated SmSLP (not shown). Therefore, we interpret the discrepancy between calculated and observed molecular mass as an instance of anomalous electrophoretic behavior, such as is occasionally encountered with small proteins. A BLITZ search (11Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 227-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the SwissProt data base revealed a similarity with proteins of the stathmin family, with about 1% probability that the similarity could occur by chance (Fig. 3). After sequence alignment, the 117 residues of SmSLP were 26% identical and 43% similar to chicken stathmin, whereas 33% of residues had identity and 50% had similarity to one or more of the proteins shown in Fig. 3. In addition, the position of mouse introns was found to coincide in one case with a SmSLP intron and in two other cases with the start and the end, respectively, of the SmSLP coding sequence (data not shown). A further element of similarity with stathmins was found at the biochemical level, because stathmins are known to be particularly heat-soluble (2Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 12Sobel A. Boutterin M.C. Beretta L. Chneiweiss H. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3765-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Maucuer A. Moreau J. Mechali M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16420-16429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SmSLP retained its solubility after 10 min of boiling, as shown in Fig. 1 B, lane 4. When schistosomula of various ages were labeled with the Bolton-Hunter reagent, the typical radioactive band of 19 kDa was only observed at 3, 9, and 24 h; at 48 h, it was very faint, and it totally disappeared thereafter (not shown). This was not the result of decreased protein exposure, but it reflected the actual disappearance of SmSLP, as shown by the parallel disappearance of the corresponding Coomassie Blue band (Fig.4). Parasites of 14 days or adult worms of either sex were totally negative for the labeling of SmSLP, as well as for the presence of the Coomassie Blue band. In order to obtain a precise assessment of the timing of SmSLP synthesis in the sporocyst, the hepatopancreas of infected snails was tested by Western blotting at various times after exposure of the molluscs to schistosome miracidia. It can be seen from Fig.5 that no SmSLP band was detectable in eggs, in miracidia, or in snail hepatopancreas during the prepatent period (up to 27 days). Only on the same day (day 28) that a snail first showed the presence of emerging cercariae upon crushing of the shell did the SmSLP band appear in Western blots. The SmSLP band was present in cercariae and in 3-h schistosomula, but it had disappeared in 3-day-old schistosomula. It could thus be concluded that SmSLP is synthesized in the sporocyst just in the very few hours preceding and accompanying cercarial shedding and that the protein is present in cercariae (which usually have a life span of less than 24 h) and remains present during the first day or two after transformation into the mammalian form of the life cycle. Because the major functional property of stathmins is connected with their variable state of phosphorylation, it was of interest to determine whether SmSLP was also phosphorylated. A high salt schistosomulum extract was digested with alkaline phosphatase, separated by electrofocusing, and analyzed by Western blotting with the specific anti-SmSLP serum. Fig.6 shows that the undigested sample presents two major reactive bands (lane 1), whereas the phosphatase-digested sample has been essentially converted to a single band (lane 2). Preliminary evidence of SmSLP binding to tubulin was obtained by immune co-precipitation. Purified bovine tubulin (Cytoskeleton, catalog no. T238) was iodinated using the Bolton-Hunter reagent, yielding a single 55-kDa radioactive band in SDS-PAGE. Labeled tubulin was incubated 3 h at 4 °C with SmSLP, anti-SmSLP serum was added, and an immunoprecipitate was obtained upon addition of protein A-Sepharose. The washed pellet contained 7550 cpm, whereas a control pellet from a tube without SmSLP contained 2070 cpm. Native SmSLP, prepared from cercariae by high salt extraction followed by Sephadex purification, was mixed in vitro with bovine tubulin, in a standard polymerization assay (9Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Shelanski M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 737-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), using a SmSLP:tubulin molar ratio of 0.8. As shown in Fig. 7 A,SmSLP had a clear inhibitory effect on microtubule formation. In addition, SmSLP added to preassembled microtubules at a molar ratio of 0.5 caused a marked depolymerization (Fig. 7 B). Purity of SmSLP used in these experiments could be estimated to be better than 97.5%, as shown by the absence of contaminants in a PAGE run of 40× the concentration, giving a detectable band of SmSLP (Fig.7 C). We have described a protein of S. mansoni that is expressed in large amounts only during a very restricted period of the parasite life cycle. It can be estimated that at the early schistosomulum stage, SmSLP may represent a fraction of total proteins on the order of about 1%, whereas the protein becomes undetectable, by Western blots of total parasites, in mammalian stages older than a couple of days. The timing of SmSLP appearance is equally striking, because the protein is totally absent during the first 27 days of intramolluscan development—comprising sporocyst formation and active asexual multiplication of cercarial precursors—and it only appears to be first synthesized when it is time for the sporocyst to break open and release mature cercariae. The natural infective life span of cercariae is just a few hours, during which the next dramatic event occurs, i.e. penetration of the mammalian skin with passage from freshwater to the isotonic and isothermic environment of the host. Thus, it seems logical to assume that SmSLP has a function in the emergence of the larva from the snail into the water, the penetration from the water into the mammalian host, or both. Because no SmSLP is detectable at the egg/miracidium stage, it appears that the passage from the egg to the free-swimming miracidium is not regulated by similar mechanisms. The structure of SmSLP gave us a clue about its function. We found a moderate, but significant, similarity between its amino acid sequence and the sequence of a family of proteins that include stathmin (12Sobel A. Boutterin M.C. Beretta L. Chneiweiss H. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3765-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (also termed p19 (14Schubart U.K. Alago Jr., W. Danoff A. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1615-1618PubMed Google Scholar), and prosolin (16Cooper H.L. Fuldner R. McDuffie E. Braverman R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3689-3696PubMed Google Scholar)), as well as the neuron-specific proteins SCG10 (17Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and XB3 (13Maucuer A. Moreau J. Mechali M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16420-16429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional elements of similarity with stathmins are the predominantly α-helical structure predicted for SmSLP, its thermal stability, and the similar position of intron sequences in the respective genes (18Okazaki T. Yoshida B.N. Avraham K.B. Wang H. Wuenschell C.W. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Anderson D.J. Mori N. Genomics. 1993; 18: 360-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 2C. Valle, unpublished data. The strongest element of similarity, however, is the developmentally regulated pattern of expression. Thus, stathmin shows a 15-fold greater abundance in newborn than in adult brain (19Schubart U.K. Banerjee M.D. Eng J. DNA. 1989; 8: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, SCG10 levels are maximal in the embryonic central nervous system but are dramatically reduced in the adult (17Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Stathmin is a soluble cytosolic protein, whereas SCG10 contains an NH2-terminal extension of 34 amino acids that directs it to the Golgi membrane (20Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The SmSLP gene is about the same length as stathmin, but the first 22 residues form a leader peptide that is cleaved in the mature protein (as demonstrated by our N-terminal amino acid sequencing), so that SmSLP is found as a soluble and easily extractable protein. Stathmin contains four serine phosphorylation sites that are differentially phosphorylated in response to a variety of extracellular and cell cycle dependent signals (21Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). SmSLP contains two protein kinase C phosphorylation consensus sequences, and we have obtained evidence that the protein is actually phosphorylated in the parasite, because phosphatase digestion modifies its mobility in isoelectric focusing. It remains to be established whether one or both the potential serine acceptor residues are phosphorylated and whether the state of phosphorylation changes during the life cycle events that accompany the expression of SmSLP. Previous studies have demonstrated that stathmin is a regulator of microtubule dynamics because its association with tubulin promotes microtubule depolymerization by increasing the “catastrophe” rate in a way that is dependent on its state of phosphorylation (2Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 22Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have shown that SmSLP possesses the same functional properties, despite its simplified structure. Thus, SmSLP associates with tubulin, inhibits the in vitro tubulin assembly, and causes the depolymerization of preassembled microtubules. We have attempted to express SmSLP in bacterial, yeast, and insect systems, but we have invariably obtained very low yields of the recombinant protein, accompanied by signs of death of the host cells. If confirmed, this might be an indication of SmSLP in vivo action on cell microtubules. We propose that this parasite protein may fulfil important regulatory roles in the critical events that, within a short time span, lead to the passage of the organism from the mollusc to the water and then to the mammalian environment. These events are accompanied by dramatic changes in the rate of cell division as well as in the overall size and shape of the organism. Although the functioning of signal transduction in these complex chains of events is still totally obscure, SmSLP is likely to belong to the set of schistosome regulatory molecules that are beginning to be identified as essential actors in the adventurous life of the parasite (23Schussler P.

Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β peptide amyloid-β precursor protein hexafluoroisopropanol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and containing 2% galactose Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is characterized by an intracranial amyloidosis that develops in an aging-dependent manner. This amyloidosis appears to be dependent on the production of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) from the amyloid-β precursor protein (βAPP) (1Glenner G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 885-890Crossref Scopus (4143) Google Scholar, 2Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). βAPP is a type 1 transmembrane protein, which can be proteolytically processed through two mutually exclusive pathways. Cleavage of a lysine-leucine bond within the lumenal portion of the Aβ region of βAPP, a reaction catalyzed by a membrane-associated proteolytic activity termed α-secretase, releases the lumenal portion of βAPP as a soluble protein (βAPPsα) and precludes the formation of Aβ (3Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Aβ is produced by the successive proteolytic processing of βAPP by at least two activities termed β-secretase and γ-secretase. Aβ includes the final 28 residues of the N-terminal lumenal domain and the first 12–14 residues of the transmembrane domain of βAPP. All known genetic alterations underlying familial AD increase the accumulation of Aβ in the brain, suggesting that an important early step in the pathogenesis of AD involves production or deposition of Aβ. This invariant pathological phenotype has made Aβ metabolism a potential target for therapeutic intervention.Isolation of the enzymes responsible for Aβ generation has proven extremely challenging. We have sought to overcome many of the barriers inherent in mammalian enzyme discovery by searching in a simpler organism for a gene homologous to one of the mammalian secretases. For these studies, we chose yeast because of the ease of genetic manipulation. More specifically, we selected the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae because it is the only yeast for which the genome has been fully sequenced. Combined genetic and biochemical approaches have identified several important proteolytic processing enzymes in yeast, which have proven homologous to enzymes that catalyze the same reaction in higher eukaryotes (4Thomas G.

Miller D.L. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 273-284PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that human βAPP can be expressed in S. cerevisiae and successfully trafficked through the secretory pathway. In the current study, S. cerevisiae expressing human βAPP19–751 fused to a yeast α-mating pheromone precursor, prepro-α-factor (Fig.1), were metabolically labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine in galactose-containing growth medium. After this labeling period, the yeast were harvested, and the media were collected. Cell lysates were precleared with antiserum 369 to remove full-length and C-terminal fragments. Using antibody 4G8 for immunoprecipitation, a prominent 8-kDa species and a much weaker 12–14-kDa species were recovered from the lysates (Fig.2), but not the media (data not shown), of cells (CRY1) expressing βAPP. Parallel immunoprecipitations were performed on the same strain with antibody 6E10 or 26D6, each of which recognizes an epitope within Aβ N-terminal to the α-secretase cleavage site. The results obtained with 6E10 or 26D6 were similar to those obtained with 4G8 (Fig. 2). The “Swedish” mutation, which results in a KM to NL tandem missense substitution at the β-secretase cleavage site of βAPP, was introduced into the βAPP plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis. In mammalian cell lines expressing Swedish βAPP (11Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar), there is increased production of Aβ. Similarly, introduction of the Swedish mutation into yeast increased the production of the 8- and 12–14-kDa bands (Fig. 2), suggesting that these species were generated by a yeast enzyme with an authentic β-secretase-like activity.To further characterize the identities of the 8-kDa and 12–14-kDa bands, their N termini were radiosequenced by labeling βAPP-expressing yeast with [35S]methionine and [3H]phenylalanine. Lysates from these cells were precleared with 369, immunoprecipitated with 4G8, separated on 10–20% tricine gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The bands were eluted from nitrocellulose, subjected to Edman degradation, and analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The radioactivity profiles of the first 22 residues of the 8-kDa species (Fig.3, left) and of the 12–14-kDa species (Fig. 3, right) suggest N termini identical to that of Aβ, because 3H radioactivity was detected at residues 4, 19, and 20.Figure 3Radioactivity profile of 3H incorporation into 8- and 12–14-kDa Aβ-immunoreactive species. Cells expressing wild type βAPP were harvested after 4 h of metabolic labeling in SGal-ura containing [35S]methionine and [3H]phenylalanine. Lysates were sequentially immunoprecipitated with 369 (preclearing) followed by 4G8. The proteins recovered by 4G8 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The 8- and 12–14-kDa bands were excised and eluted from the nitrocellulose after which Edman degradation was performed. Fractions were diluted in liquid scintillation fluid, and the tritium incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Radioactivity was present in fractions 4, 19, and 20 of both species, as would be expected for a peptide bearing Aβ at its N terminus. CPM, counts/minute.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It seemed possible that the absence of a typical 4-kDa Aβ species might be attributable to protease activity, to aggregation, or to both. Evidence in support of the first possibility was obtained by screening a series of βAPP-expressing yeast strains, deficient in one or another protease, for their ability to generate an Aβ-immunoreactive species. In a strain deficient for Kex2 (BFY-106-4D), an Aβ-immunoreactive species with apparent molecular mass of 4 kDa was detected (Fig. 4 A). N-terminal radiosequencing of this 4-kDa species was consistent with the N terminus of Aβ (Fig. 4 B) One explanation for the appearance of the 4-kDa band only in a Kex2-deficient strain could be that the presence of Kex2 results in degradation of Aβ. Alternatively, the absence of Kex2 could affect the activity of an as yet unidentified enzyme, which promotes the formation of the 4-kDa species, or lead to a missorting of βAPP to an inappropriate intracellular compartment, such as the vacuole, where proteases are highly active. Any of these possibilities could account for the generation of the 4-kDa Aβ-like species in yeast strains deficient for Kex2. Evidence in support of the possibility of peptide aggregation was obtained by sonication of yeast lysates in the presence or absence of formic acid or HFIP. Following either treatment, the recovery of the 8- and 12–14-kDa species was reduced (but not abolished), and a 4-kDa band became apparent (Fig. 5), suggesting that the larger species represent, at least in part, dimers and trimers of Aβ. The determination of the exact C terminus of this 4-kDa species will be required to determine whether this peptide corresponds to Aβ 1–40 or 1–42, both of which occur in mammalian cells. Preliminary studies, using an high pressure liquid chromatography system, which is capable of resolving these two variants, suggest that the 4-kDa species is predominantly similar to Aβ42. 2A.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is characterized by an intracranial amyloidosis that develops in an aging-dependent manner. This amyloidosis appears to be dependent on the production of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) from the amyloid-β precursor protein (βAPP) (1Glenner G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 885-890Crossref Scopus (4143) Google Scholar, 2Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). βAPP is a type 1 transmembrane protein, which can be proteolytically processed through two mutually exclusive pathways. Cleavage of a lysine-leucine bond within the lumenal portion of the Aβ region of βAPP, a reaction catalyzed by a membrane-associated proteolytic activity termed α-secretase, releases the lumenal portion of βAPP as a soluble protein (βAPPsα) and precludes the formation of Aβ (3Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Aβ is produced by the successive proteolytic processing of βAPP by at least two activities termed β-secretase and γ-secretase. Aβ includes the final 28 residues of the N-terminal lumenal domain and the first 12–14 residues of the transmembrane domain of βAPP. All known genetic alterations underlying familial AD increase the accumulation of Aβ in the brain, suggesting that an important early step in the pathogenesis of AD involves production or deposition of Aβ. This invariant pathological phenotype has made Aβ metabolism a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Isolation of the enzymes responsible for Aβ generation has proven extremely challenging. We have sought to overcome many of the barriers inherent in mammalian enzyme discovery by searching in a simpler organism for a gene homologous to one of the mammalian secretases. For these studies, we chose yeast because of the ease of genetic manipulation. More specifically, we selected the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae because it is the only yeast for which the genome has been fully sequenced. Combined genetic and biochemical approaches have identified several important proteolytic processing enzymes in yeast, which have proven homologous to enzymes that catalyze the same reaction in higher eukaryotes (4Thomas G. Thorne B.A. Thomas L. Allen R.G. Hruby D.E. Fuller R. Thorner J. Science. 1988; 241: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Fuller R.S. Brake A. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1434-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It was previously demonstrated that yeast could execute an α-secretase-like cleavage of human βAPP (6Zhang H. Komano H. Fuller R.S.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious work (6Zhang H. Komano H. Fuller R.S. Gandy S.E. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27799-27802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hines V. Zhang W. Ramakrishna N. Styles J. Mehta P. Kim K.S. Innis M. Miller D.L. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 273-284PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that human βAPP can be expressed in S. cerevisiae and successfully trafficked through the secretory pathway. In the current study, S. cerevisiae expressing human βAPP19–751 fused to a yeast α-mating pheromone precursor, prepro-α-factor (Fig.1), were metabolically labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine in galactose-containing growth medium. After this labeling period, the yeast were harvested, and the media were collected. Cell lysates were precleared with antiserum 369 to remove full-length and C-terminal fragments. Using antibody 4G8 for immunoprecipitation, a prominent 8-kDa species and a much weaker 12–14-kDa species were recovered from the lysates (Fig.2), but not the media (data not shown), of cells (CRY1) expressing βAPP. Parallel immunoprecipitations were performed on the same strain with antibody 6E10 or 26D6, each of which recognizes an epitope within Aβ N-terminal to the α-secretase cleavage site. The results obtained with 6E10 or 26D6 were similar to those obtained with 4G8 (Fig. 2). The “Swedish” mutation, which results in a KM to NL tandem missense substitution at the β-secretase cleavage site of βAPP, was introduced into the βAPP plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis. In mammalian cell lines expressing Swedish βAPP (11Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar), there is increased production of Aβ. Similarly, introduction of the Swedish mutation into yeast increased the production of the 8- and 12–14-kDa bands (Fig. 2), suggesting that these species were generated by a yeast enzyme with an authentic β-secretase-like activity.To further characterize the identities of the 8-kDa and 12–14-kDa bands, their N termini were radiosequenced by labeling βAPP-expressing yeast with [35S]methionine and [3H]phenylalanine. Lysates from these cells were precleared with 369, immunoprecipitated with 4G8, separated on 10–20% tricine gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The bands were eluted from nitrocellulose, subjected to Edman degradation, and analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The radioactivity profiles of the first 22 residues of the 8-kDa species (Fig.3, left) and of the 12–14-kDa species (Fig. 3, right) suggest N termini identical to that of Aβ, because 3H radioactivity was detected at residues 4, 19, and 20.It seemed possible that the absence of a typical 4-kDa Aβ species might be attributable to protease activity, to aggregation, or to both. Evidence in support of the first possibility was obtained by screening a series of βAPP-expressing yeast strains, deficient in one or another protease, for their ability to generate an Aβ-immunoreactive species. In a strain deficient for Kex2 (BFY-106-4D), an Aβ-immunoreactive species with apparent molecular mass of 4 kDa was detected (Fig. 4 A). N-terminal radiosequencing of this 4-kDa species was consistent with the N terminus of Aβ (Fig. 4 B) One explanation for the appearance of the 4-kDa band only in a Kex2-deficient strain could be that the presence of Kex2 results in degradation of Aβ. Alternatively, the absence of Kex2 could affect the activity of an as yet unidentified enzyme, which promotes the formation of the 4-kDa species, or lead to a missorting of βAPP to an inappropriate intracellular compartment, such as the vacuole, where proteases are highly active. Any of these possibilities could account for the generation of the 4-kDa Aβ-like species in yeast strains deficient for Kex2. Evidence in support of the possibility of peptide aggregation was obtained by sonication of yeast lysates in the presence or absence of formic acid or HFIP. Following either treatment, the recovery of the 8- and 12–14-kDa species was reduced (but not abolished), and a 4-kDa band became apparent (Fig. 5), suggesting that the larger species represent, at least in part, dimers and trimers of Aβ. The determination of the exact C terminus of this 4-kDa species will be required to determine whether this peptide corresponds to Aβ 1–40 or 1–42, both of which occur in mammalian cells. Preliminary studies, using an high pressure liquid chromatography system, which is capable of resolving these two variants, suggest that the 4-kDa species is predominantly similar to Aβ42. 2A.

https://openalex.org/W2006063265,"A homohexameric molecule of Escherichia coli pyrophosphatase is arranged as a dimer of trimers, with an active site present in each of its six monomers. Earlier we reported that substitution of His136 and His140 in the intertrimeric subunit interface splits the molecule into active trimers (Velichko, I. S., Mikalahti, K., Kasho, V. N., Dudarenkov, V. Y., Hyytiä, T., Goldman, A., Cooperman, B. S., Lahti, R., and Baykov, A. A. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 734–740). Here we demonstrate that additional substitutions of Tyr77 and Gln80 in the intratrimeric interface give rise to moderately active dimers or virtually inactive monomers, depending on pH, temperature, and Mg2+ concentration. Successive dissociation of the hexamer into trimers, dimers, and monomers progressively decreases the catalytic efficiency (by 106-fold in total), and conversion of a trimer into dimer decreases the affinity of one of the essential Mg2+-binding sites/monomer. Disruptive substitutions predominantly in the intratrimeric interface stabilize the intertrimeric interface and vice versa, suggesting that the optimal intratrimeric interaction is not compatible with the optimal intertrimeric interaction. Because of the resulting “conformational strain,” hexameric wild-type structure appears to be preformed to bind substrate. A hexameric triple variant substituted at Tyr77, Gln80, and His136 exhibits positive cooperativity in catalysis, consistent with this model.

The three or four contact zones (see below), which are not well separated, cover about 24% of the accessible surface area of a monomer. The intratrimer contacts are of a circular “head-to-tail” type, meaning that each monomer has two different intratrimer contact regions (Fig. 1 B) (5Kankare J. Salminen T. Lahti R. Cooperman B.

Another important interaction occurs through Mg2+ bound at the intertrimeric interface. The Mg2+ ion is octahedrally associated with six water molecules, which in turn hydrogen bond to the side chains of Asn24/24′ and Asp26/26′, as well as to the backbone carbonyls of Asn24 and Ala25(8Harutyunyan E.H.

This interface mainly consists of hydrophobic contacts between strands and contains few hydrogen bonds between monomers (Fig. 1 C). The side chains of Tyr77 and Gln80 are thus in a rather hydrophobic environment. We show that Y77D and Q80E substitutions markedly destabilize the intratrimeric contact and, in combination with substitutions at the intertrimeric contact, yield moderately active dimeric and virtually inactive monomeric E-PPase.

Tyr77 acts as a link between the intratrimer interface, the minor intertrimer interface, and the major intertrimer interface. The larger intertrimer interface in E-PPase (640 Å2) chiefly involves α-helix A, including an ion-triple formed between His140, Asp143, and His136′ (5Kankare J. Salminen T. Lahti R. Cooperman B.

Replacing either His136 or His140 with Gln destabilizes the E-PPase hexamer (9Baykov A.A. Dudarenkov V.Y. Käpylä J. Salminen T. Hyytiä T. Kasho V.N. Husgafvel S. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Lahti R.

Another important interaction occurs through Mg2+ bound at the intertrimeric interface. The Mg2+ ion is octahedrally associated with six water molecules, which in turn hydrogen bond to the side chains of Asn24/24′ and Asp26/26′, as well as to the backbone carbonyls of Asn24 and Ala25(8Harutyunyan E.H.

Substitution of Asp26 with Asn or Ser eliminates Mg2+ binding to the intertrimeric site and somewhat decreases hexamer stability but hardly affects catalysis (12Efimova I.S. Salminen A. Pohjanjoki P.

Hexamer dissociation into trimers greatly decreases the rate constant for substrate binding to enzyme but has no effect on the catalytic constant (10Velichko I.S. Mikalahti K. Kasho V.N.

Here we describe the effects of substitutions of Tyr77 and Gln80, predominantly at the intratrimeric interface, on the quaternary structure and catalytic activity of E-PPase. This interface mainly consists of hydrophobic contacts between strands and contains few hydrogen bonds between monomers (Fig. 1 C). The side chains of Tyr77 and Gln80 are thus in a rather hydrophobic environment. We show that Y77D and Q80E substitutions markedly destabilize the intratrimeric contact and, in combination with substitutions at the intertrimeric contact, yield moderately active dimeric and virtually inactive monomeric E-PPase. The results of this study also shed light on the interactions between different subunit contacts in E-PPase. We thank P. V. Kalmykov for help in ultracentrifugation."
