https://openalex.org/W2031637294,"We show that high doses of salicylates reverse hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rodents by sensitizing insulin signaling. Activation or overexpression of the IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) attenuated insulin signaling in cultured cells, whereas IKKbeta inhibition reversed insulin resistance. Thus, IKKbeta, rather than the cyclooxygenases, appears to be the relevant molecular target. Heterozygous deletion (Ikkbeta+/-) protected against the development of insulin resistance during high-fat feeding and in obese Lep(ob/ob) mice. These findings implicate an inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and identify the IKKbeta pathway as a target for insulin sensitization."

https://openalex.org/W2079003739,"The nuclear expression and action of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factor requires signal-coupled phosphorylation and degradation of the IkappaB inhibitors, which normally bind and sequester this pleiotropically active factor in the cytoplasm. The subsequent molecular events that regulate the termination of nuclear NF-kappaB action remain poorly defined, although the activation of de novo IkappaBalpha gene expression by NF-kappaB likely plays a key role. Our studies now demonstrate that the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB is subject to inducible acetylation and that acetylated forms of RelA interact weakly, if at all, with IkappaBalpha. Acetylated RelA is subsequently deacetylated through a specific interaction with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). This deacetylation reaction promotes effective binding to IkappaBalpha and leads in turn to IkappaBalpha-dependent nuclear export of the complex through a chromosomal region maintenance-1 (CRM-1)-dependent pathway. Deacetylation of RelA by HDAC3 thus acts as an intranuclear molecular switch that both controls the duration of the NF-kappaB transcriptional response and contributes to the replenishment of the depleted cytoplasmic pool of latent NF-kappaB-IkappaBalpha complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2126344344,"Cyclin E binds and activates the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 and catalyzes the transition from the G 1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. The amount of cyclin E protein present in the cell is tightly controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase responsible for cyclin E ubiquitination as SCF Fbw7 and demonstrate that it is functionally conserved in yeast, flies, and mammals. Fbw7 associates specifically with phosphorylated cyclin E, and SCF Fbw7 catalyzes cyclin E ubiquitination in vitro. Depletion of Fbw7 leads to accumulation and stabilization of cyclin E in vivo in human and Drosophila melanogaster cells. Multiple F-box proteins contribute to cyclin E stability in yeast, suggesting an overlap in SCF E3 ligase specificity that allows combinatorial control of cyclin E degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2038653804,"Both ErbB1 and ErbB2 are overexpressed or amplified in breast tumours. To examine the effects of activating ErbB receptors in a context that mimics polarized epithelial cells in vivo, we activated ErbB1 and ErbB2 homodimers in preformed, growth-arrested mammary acini cultured in three-dimensional basement membrane gels. Activation of ErbB2, but not that of ErbB1, led to a reinitiation of cell proliferation and altered the properties of mammary acinar structures. These altered structures share several properties with early-stage tumours, including a loss of proliferative suppression, an absence of lumen, retention of the basement membrane and a lack of invasive properties. ErbB2 activation also disrupted tight junctions and the cell polarity of polarized epithelia, whereas ErbB1 activation did not have any effect. Our results indicate that ErbB receptors differ in their ability to induce early stages of mammary carcinogenesis in vitro and this three-dimensional model system can reveal biological activities of oncogenes that cannot be examined in vitro in standard transformation assays."

https://openalex.org/W2049741730,"The developmental signaling functions of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are dependent on their sulfation states. Here, we report the identification of QSulf1, the avian ortholog of an evolutionarily conserved protein family related to heparan-specific N-acetyl glucosamine sulfatases. QSulf1 expression is induced by Sonic hedgehog in myogenic somite progenitors in quail embryos and is required for the activation of MyoD, a Wnt-induced regulator of muscle specification. QSulf1 is localized on the cell surface and regulates heparan-dependent Wnt signaling in C2C12 myogenic progenitor cells through a mechanism that requires its catalytic activity, providing evidence that QSulf1 regulates Wnt signaling through desulfation of cell surface HSPGs."

https://openalex.org/W2003359633,"Although C4 plant expansions have been recognized in the late Miocene, identification of the underlying causes is complicated by the uncertainties associated with estimates of ancient precipitation, temperature, and partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (PCO2). Here we report the carbon isotopic compositions of leaf wax n-alkanes in lake sediment cores from two sites in Mesoamerica that have experienced contrasting moisture variations since the last glacial maximum. Opposite isotopic trends obtained from these two sites indicate that regional climate exerts a strong control on the relative abundance of C3 and C4 plants and that in the absence of favorable moisture and temperature conditions, low PCO2 alone is insufficient to drive an expansion of C4 plants."

https://openalex.org/W2029811564,"Energy conversion cycles are aimed at driving unfavorable, small-molecule activation reactions with a photon harnessed by a transition metal complex. A challenge that has occupied researchers for several decades is to create molecular photocatalysts to promote the production of hydrogen from homogeneous solution. We now report the use of a two-electron mixed-valence dirhodium compound to photocatalyze the reduction of hydrohalic acid to hydrogen. In this cycle, photons break two RhII-X bonds of a LRh0-RhIIX2 core in the presence of a halogen trap to regenerate the active LRh0-Rh0 catalyst, which reacts with hydrohalic acid to produce hydrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1969670626,"Cardiac valve formation is a complex process that involves cell signaling events between the myocardial and endocardial layers of the heart across an elaborate extracellular matrix. These signals lead to marked morphogenetic movements and transdifferentiation of the endocardial cells at chamber boundaries. Here we identify the genetic defect in zebrafish jekyll mutants, which are deficient in the initiation of heart valve formation. The jekyll mutation disrupts a homolog of Drosophila Sugarless, a uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose dehydrogenase required for heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid production. The atrioventricular border cells do not differentiate from their neighbors in jekyll mutants, suggesting that Jekyll is required in a cell signaling event that establishes a boundary between the atrium and ventricle."
https://openalex.org/W1990191742,"The coagulation protease thrombin triggers fibrin formation, platelet activation, and other cellular responses at sites of tissue injury. We report a role for PAR1, a protease-activated G protein-coupled receptor for thrombin, in embryonic development. Approximately half of Par1-/- mouse embryos died at midgestation with bleeding from multiple sites. PAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells, and a PAR1 transgene driven by an endothelial-specific promoter prevented death of Par1-/- embryos. Our results suggest that the coagulation cascade and PAR1 modulate endothelial cell function in developing blood vessels and that thrombin's actions on endothelial cells-rather than on platelets, mesenchymal cells, or fibrinogen-contribute to vascular development and hemostasis in the mouse embryo."

https://openalex.org/W1969550217,Scanning tunneling microscopy data revealed the atomic processes in propagating reaction fronts that occur in the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen on Pt(111). The fronts were also characterized on mesoscopic length scales with respect to their velocity and width. Simulations on the basis of a reaction-diffusion model reproduce the experimental findings qualitatively well. The quantitative comparison reveals the limitations of this traditional approach to modeling spatiotemporal pattern formation in nonlinear dynamics.

https://openalex.org/W2004801897,"Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are vasoactive cyclic-peptide hormones important in blood pressure regulation through interaction with natriuretic cell-surface receptors. We report the hormone-binding thermodynamics and crystal structures at 2.9 and 2.0 angstroms, respectively, of the extracellular domain of the unliganded human NP receptor (NPR-C) and its complex with CNP, a 22â€“amino acid NP. A single CNP molecule is bound in the interface of an NPR-C dimer, resulting in asymmetric interactions between the hormone and the symmetrically related receptors. Hormone binding induces a 20 angstrom closure between the membrane-proximal domains of the dimer. In each monomer, the opening of an interdomain cleft, which is tethered together by a linker peptide acting as a molecular spring, is likely a conserved allosteric trigger for intracellular signaling by the natriuretic receptor family."
https://openalex.org/W2088939436,"Anaphase in budding yeast is triggered by cleavage of the central subunit, Scc1, of the chromosomal cohesin complex by the protease separase. Here we show that separase also cleaves the kinetochore-associated protein Slk19 at anaphase onset. Separase activity is also required for the proper localization of a stable Slk19 cleavage product to the spindle midzone in anaphase. The cleavage and localization of Slk19 are necessary to stabilize the anaphase spindle, and we show that a stable spindle is a prerequisite for timely exit from mitosis. This demonstrates the cleavage of targets other than cohesin by separase in the orchestration of high-fidelity anaphase."
https://openalex.org/W2088065503,"We report a flexible strategy for transducing ligand-binding events into electrochemical responses for a wide variety of proteins. The method exploits ligand-mediated hinge-bending motions, intrinsic to the bacterial periplasmic binding protein superfamily, to establish allosterically controlled interactions between electrode surfaces and redox-active, Ru(II)-labeled proteins. This approach allows the development of protein-based bioelectronic interfaces that respond to a diverse set of analytes. Families of these interfaces can be generated either by exploiting natural binding diversity within the superfamily or by reengineering the specificity of individual proteins. These proteins may have numerous medical, environmental, and defense applications."
https://openalex.org/W2035672571,"An afterimage induced by prior adaptation to a visual stimulus is believed to be due to bleaching of photochemical pigments or neural adaptation in the retina. We report a type of afterimage that appears to require cortical adaptation. Fixating a neon-color spreading configuration led not only to negative afterimages corresponding to the inducers (local afterimages), but also to one corresponding to the perceptually filled-in surface during adaptation (global afterimage). These afterimages were mutually exclusive, undergoing monocular rivalry. The strength of the global afterimage correlated to a greater extent with perceptual filling-in during adaptation than with the strength of the local afterimages. Thus, global afterimages are not merely by-products of local afterimages, but involve adaptation at a cortical representation of surface."

They both speak to the primary mission of the research university, which is not merely carrying out research but training students to do research. The knowledge-based global economy, with its wealth of information and opportunities, has increased undergraduate students' need for research skills as well as graduate students' desire for personal guidance. As the research university matures, the boundaries between graduate and undergraduate education are blurring. Indeed, if we focus on the learning process, we find not two but five levels of learning at the research university: lower division, upper division, master's, doctoral, and postdoctoral. All five levels form a continuum, a series of gradual steps. The mission of the university is to introduce students to research, to inspire in them a passion for discovery at each of these levels."

I investigated the influence of the Iceland hotspot on the adjacent mid-Atlantic spreading center using phase-delay times of seismic surface waves, which show anomalous polarization anisotropy-a delay-time discrepancy between waves with different polarizations. This anisotropy implies that the hotspot induces buoyancy-driven upwelling in the mantle beneath the ridge."
