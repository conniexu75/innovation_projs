https://openalex.org/W2145848169,"Trastuzumab resistance emerges to be a major issue in anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy for breast cancers. Here, we demonstrated that miR-21 expression was up-regulated and its function was elevated in HER2(+) BT474, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells that are induced to acquire trastuzumab resistance by long-term exposure to the antibody, whereas protein expression of the PTEN gene, a miR-21 target, was reduced. Blocking the action of miR-21 with antisense oligonucleotides re-sensitized the resistant cells to the therapeutic activities of trastuzumab by inducing growth arrest, proliferation inhibition, and G(1)-S cell cycle checking in the presence of the antibody. Ectopic expression of miR-21 in HER2(+) breast cancer cells confers resistance to trastuzumab. Rescuing PTEN expression with a p3XFLAG-PTEN-mut construct with deleted miR-21 targeting sequence at its 3' UTR restored the growth inhibition of trastuzumab in the resistant cells by inducing PTEN activation and AKT inhibition. In vivo, administering miR-21 antisense oligonucleotides restored trastuzumab sensitivity in the resistant breast cancer xenografts by inducing PTEN expression, whereas injection of miR-21 mimics conferred trastuzumab resistant in the sensitive breast tumors via PTEN silence. Up-regulatin of miR-21 in tumor biopsies obtained from patients receiving pre-operative trastuzumab therapy was associated with poor trastuzumab response. Therefore, miR-21 overexpression contributes to trastuzumab resistance in HER2(+) breast cancers and antagonizing miR-21 demonstrates therapeutic potential by sensitizing the malignancy to anti-HER2 treatment."

Although it is well established that sclerostin is an osteocyte-secreted bone formation inhibitor, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We identified in tandem affinity purification proteomics screens LRP4 (low density lipoprotein-related protein 4) as a sclerostin interaction partner. Biochemical assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that sclerostin LRP4 interaction is direct. Interestingly, in vitro overexpression and RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments revealed that LRP4 specifically facilitates the previously described inhibitory action of sclerostin on Wnt1/β-catenin signaling. We found the extracellular β-propeller structured domain of LRP4 to be required for this sclerostin facilitator activity. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP4 protein is present in human and rodent osteoblasts and osteocytes, both presumed target cells of sclerostin action. Silencing of LRP4 by lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery blocked sclerostin inhibitory action on in vitro bone mineralization. Notably, we identified two mutations in LRP4 (R1170W and W1186S) in patients suffering from bone overgrowth. We found that these mutations impair LRP4 interaction with sclerostin and its concomitant sclerostin facilitator effect. Together these data indicate that the interaction of sclerostin with LRP4 is required to mediate the inhibitory function of sclerostin on bone formation, thus identifying a novel role for LRP4 in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2017536526,"The interactions between biochemical processes and mechanical signaling play important roles during various cellular processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, metastasis, and cell migration. While traditional traction force measurements have provided quantitative information about cell matrix interactions in two dimensions, recent studies have shown significant differences in the behavior and morphology of cells when placed in three-dimensional environments. Hence new quantitative experimental techniques are needed to accurately determine cell traction forces in three dimensions. Recently, two approaches both based on laser scanning confocal microscopy have emerged to address this need. This study highlights the details, implementation and advantages of such a three-dimensional imaging methodology with the capability to compute cellular traction forces dynamically during cell migration and locomotion. An application of this newly developed three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3D TFM) technique to single cell migration studies of 3T3 fibroblasts is presented to show that this methodology offers a new quantitative vantage point to investigate the three-dimensional nature of cell-ECM interactions."

The ϵ4 allele of apoE is a major risk factor for Alzheimer disease, and apoE deficiency in mice leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. However, the effect of apoE isoforms on BBB properties are as yet unknown. Here, using an in vitro BBB model consisting of brain endothelial cells and pericytes prepared from wild-type (WT) mice, and primary astrocytes prepared from human apoE3- and apoE4-knock-in mice, we show that the barrier function of tight junctions (TJs) was impaired when the BBB was reconstituted with primary astrocytes from apoE4-knock-in mice (apoE4-BBB model). The phosphorylation of occludin at Thr residues and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)η in mBECs were attenuated in the apoE4-BBB model compared with those in the apoE3-BBB model. The differential effects of apoE isoforms on the activation of PKCη, the phosphorylation of occludin at Thr residues, and TJ integrity were abolished following the treatment with an anti-low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) antibody or a LRP1 antagonist receptor-associated protein. Consistent with the results of in vitro studies, BBB permeability was higher in apoE4-knock-in mice than in apoE3-knock-in mice. Our studies provide evidence that TJ integrity in BBB is regulated by apoE in an isoform-dependent manner. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a major apolipoprotein in the brain.

Although the procedure has been demonstrated to induce global change in gene and microRNA expressions and even epigenetic modification, it remains largely unknown how this transcription factor-induced reprogramming affects the total glycan repertoire expressed on the cells. Here we performed a comprehensive glycan analysis using 114 types of human iPSCs generated from five different SCs and compared their glycomes with those of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs; nine cell types) using a high density lectin microarray. In unsupervised cluster analysis of the results obtained by lectin microarray, both undifferentiated iPSCs and ESCs were clustered as one large group. However, they were clearly separated from the group of differentiated SCs, whereas all of the four SCs had apparently distinct glycome profiles from one another, demonstrating that SCs with originally distinct glycan profiles have acquired those similar to ESCs upon induction of pluripotency. Thirty-eight lectins discriminating between SCs and iPSCs/ESCs were statistically selected, and characteristic features of the pluripotent state were then obtained at the level of the cellular glycome. The expression profiles of relevant glycosyltransferase genes agreed well with the results obtained by lectin microarray. Among the 38 lectins, rBC2LCN was found to detect only undifferentiated iPSCs/ESCs and not differentiated SCs. Hence, the high density lectin microarray has proved to be valid for not only comprehensive analysis of glycans but also diagnosis of stem cells under the concept of the cellular glycome.

However, establishment of a robust evaluation system of their properties, including differentiation propensity and risk of possible contamination of xenoantigens and even potential of tumorigenesis, has been hampered by the lack of comprehensive methodology directly applicable to target stem cells, although this is an emerging issue essential for the safe use of iPSCs in regenerative medicine. From many aspects, cell surface glycans are considered to be ideal targets for analyzing or identifying the phenotype of each cell in a direct manner by the following reasons (3Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 4Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). (a) Glycans are located at the outermost cell surface. (b) The total repertoire of cell surface glycans varies at every level of biological organization (i.e. species, tissues, cell types, and molecules). (c) Global alterations of the cellular glycome also occur during development, cellular activation, differentiation, malignant transformation, and inflammation. The cell surface glycans are therefore referred to as the “cell signature” that closely reflects cellular backgrounds and conditions, probably because they are actually functioning as cell-to-cell mediators in extensive biological phenomena. This fundamental nature of glycans should be understood with the fact that they are not encoded directly in the genome but are generated by a complex system of a number of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, whose expressions and activities are significantly affected by both intracellular and extracellular environmental changes. Indeed, cell surface molecules, such as stage-specific embryonic antigens (SSEA1 and -3/4) (5Muramatsu T. Muramatsu H. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and tumor rejection antigens (Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81) (6Schopperle W.M. DeWolf W.C. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Natunen S. Satomaa T. Pitkanen V. Salo H. Mikkola M. Natunen J. Otonkoski T. Valmu L.

Biol. 2007; 11: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) are glycobiomarkers widely used to evaluate pluripotency. Notably, however, these “representative” glycomarkers have been identified following rather fortuitous development of their specific antibodies, because most carbohydrate structures are poorly antigenic between mammals. In this context, a systematic search is necessary to draw a whole picture of the stem cell glycome and harness its effect on stem cell biology (8Lanctot P.M. Gage F.H. Varki A.P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Liang Y.J. Kuo H.H. Lin C.H. Chen Y.Y. Yang B.C. Cheng Y.Y. Yu A.L. Khoo K.H. Yu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22564-22569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For instance, the growth and directed differentiation of stem cells to specific progeny lineages in cell culture remain problematic. Understanding how stem cells communicate with one another and feeder cells through cell surface glycans may lead to rational design of specific culture systems. However, the glycome is a quite difficult target to predict solely based on any genomic data base because the biosynthetic process of the glycan moieties of glycoproteins is not template-driven and is subject to multiple sequential and competitive enzymatic pathways. In this sense, a rapid and sensitive system enabling direct monitoring of cell surface glycans is essential.Several methods have been developed for glycan analysis based on physicochemical principles, such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (10Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 2008; 144: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Wearne K.A. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. Glycoconj.

Lectin microarray is an alternative technology for structural glycomics, where a panel of lectins with various glycan-binding specificities is printed on a microarray, providing a versatile platform for rapid and high throughput analysis of glycan structures without liberation of glycans (13Pilobello K.T.

Methods. 2005; 2: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Lectins are a class of decoder molecules of cell surface glycans distributed throughout organisms, which mediate various functions through specific glycan recognition. Analytical protocols using lectin microarray have been developed for various sample types: free oligosaccharides (14Kuno A. Uchiyama N. Koseki-Kuno S. Ebe Y. Takashima S. Yamada M. Hirabayashi J.

This technology has just begun to be applied to a wide variety of biological researches, including virus profiling (21Krishnamoorthy L. Bess Jr., J.W. Preston A.B. Nagashima K. Mahal L.K. Nat. Chem.

For cell profiling, less than 100 ng of proteins in hydrophobic fractions are sufficient for each analysis (25Tateno H. Kuno A. Itakura Y. Hirabayashi J. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 478: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Kuno A. Itakura Y. Toyoda M. Takahashi Y. Yamada M. Umezawa A. Hirabayashi J. J. Proteomics Bioinform. 2008; 1: 68-72Crossref Google Scholar). Data processing and normalization procedures were optimized to ensure the proper interpretation of the data (25Tateno H. Kuno A.

Proteomics Bioinform. 2008; 1: 68-72Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, we have demonstrated that lectin microarray is also applicable to stem cells (27Toyoda M. Yamazaki-Inoue M. Itakura Y.

The Fourth International Conference on Computational Systems Biology (ISB2010). Suzhou, China2010: 381-388Google Scholar), although we have yet to reach a clear conclusion as to how the cellular glycome changes upon induction of pluripotency. Moreover, practical applicability of this technology to the quality control of stem cells has not been attained.Here, we developed an advanced platform of high density lectin microarray with the increased number of probe lectins (96 lectins) to expand the glycome coverage for more precise comparison of various stem cell glycomes. A systematic survey of the cellular glycome was then performed toward 135 cell types in total, including iPSCs (114 cell types) and ESCs (nine cell types). Through this comprehensive analysis, we obtained strong evidence that all of the four SCs with originally distinct glycan profiles have acquired those similar to ESCs upon induction of pluripotency. We also found structural features common to iPSCs and ESCs, which corresponded well to the results of gene expression analysis of glycosyltransferases. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of lectin microarray in the stem cell diagnosis of multiple factors, including discrimination between undifferentiated and differentiated cells as well as detection of the contamination of the xenoantigen, αGal epitope.DISCUSSIONUsing the developed high density lectin microarray, we performed a systematic analysis of cell surface glycans of a large set of human iPSCs (114 cell types) and ESCs (nine cell types). As a result, a basis for a rational stem cell evaluation system was established, which can reveal both the state of undifferentiation and inclusion of αGal epitope (a representative xenoantigen). Such a comprehensive glycome analysis targeting iPSCs and ESCs has never been carried out so far. There are at least three key advantages in using a lectin microarray. 1) An overall glycan profile of each cell type is readily obtained using a relatively small number of cells (∼1 × 103), and thus, the method is widely applicable to stem cells. 2) The proposed evaluation system includes selection of the best probe by a statistical strategy among a number of lectins, which are immobilized on the array. As candidate probes, carbohydrate-binding antibodies developed so far could also be included. 3) Various properties of stem cells can be assessed simultaneously (i.e. with “one-chip” technology). Using the same strategy described in this study, lectin-based evaluation methods targeting tumorigenesis and the differentiation propensity of stem cells could also be developed.Based on the lectin signals and the expression profiles of glycosyltransferases, we concluded that the expression of α2–6-sialylation, α1–2-fucosylation, and type 1 LacNAc increases, whereas that of α2–3-sialylation and tetra-antennary N-glycans decreases correspondingly upon the induction of pluripotency. These changes are consistent with the recent reports that relevant glycans (i.e. the expression of Globo H and H type 1 with an α1–2Fuc and α2–6Sia in human ESCs) are higher than that in differentiated embryoid body (9Liang Y.J. Kuo H.H. Lin C.H. Chen Y.Y. Yang B.C. Cheng Y.Y. Yu A.L. Khoo K.H. Yu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22564-22569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Satomaa T. Heiskanen A. Mikkola M. Olsson C. Blomqvist M. Tiittanen M. Jaatinen T. Aitio O. Olonen A. Helin J. Hiltunen J. Natunen J. Tuuri T. Otonkoski T. Saarinen J. Laine J. BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the increased expression of α1–2Fuc and type 1 LacNAc, which are synthesized by the action of FUT1/2 and B3GalT5, respectively, is closely related to the synthesis of the well known pluripotency markers, SSEA3/4 and Tra-1-60/81 (for a scheme, see supplemental Fig. S4).In this study, rBC2LCN was selected as the best lectin probe to evaluate pluripotency among the 96 lectins. BC2LCN is a TNF-like lectin molecule identified from a Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia (45Sulák O. Cioci G. Delia M. Lahmann M. Varrot A. Imberty A. Wimmerová M. Structure. 2010; 18: 59-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Glycoconjugate microarray analysis revealed that rBC2LCN binds specifically to Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAc (GalNAc)-containing glycans, such as H type 1 (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAc), H type 3 (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GalNAc), and Lewis b (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAc), which include the two structural characteristics related to the pluripotency (α1–2Fuc and type 1 LacNAc) as described above (supplemental Fig. S3). This observation is consistent with the previous report (45Sulák O. Cioci G. Delia M. Lahmann M. Varrot A. Imberty A. Wimmerová M. Structure. 2010; 18: 59-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in which Sulak et al. studied the glycan-binding specificity of BC2LCN in detail using glycan microarray and titration microcalorimetry. They also demonstrated that this lectin also binds to Globo H (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glc), which was recently proposed as a glycosphingolipid type pluripotency marker (supplemental Fig. S4) (9Liang Y.J. Kuo H.H. Lin C.H. Chen Y.Y. Yang B.C. Cheng Y.Y. Yu A.L. Khoo K.H. Yu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22564-22569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 45Sulák O. Cioci G. Delia M. Lahmann M. Varrot A. Imberty A. Wimmerová M. Structure. 2010; 18: 59-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results explain the mechanism of how this lectin could be used as the probe to discriminate pluripotency. rBC2LCN could be used to probe glycoproteins and possibly all glycoconjugates carrying Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAc (GalNAc), whereas anti-SSEA3 and anti-SSEA4 specifically target glycosphingolipids. From a practical viewpoint, rBC2LCN is cost-effective because it can be produced in large amounts by the conventional E. coli expression system (84 mg/liter). Thus, this lectin could be a versatile probe to evaluate pluripotency.In contrast, Globo H has also been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cell tumors (46Bremer E.G. Levery S.B. Sonnino S. Ghidoni R. Canevari S. Kannagi R. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14773-14777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, α2–6Sia up-regulated in iPSCs/ESCs has been reported to be overexpressed in many types of human cancers, and its high expression positively correlates with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis (47Zhuo Y. Bellis S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5935-5941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, the glycan alterations upon induction of pluripotency observed in this study are apparently similar to those occurring during malignant transformation, as was implied recently (9Liang Y.J. Kuo H.H. Lin C.H. Chen Y.Y. Yang B.C. Cheng Y.Y. Yu A.L. Khoo K.H. Yu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22564-22569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the reason for this similarity remains to be elucidated, the characteristic glycan changes should be related to the ability of eternal cell proliferation and maintenance, properties common to both cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells.Glycans are located at the outermost cell surface, where various events take place on the basis of cell-to-cell recognition and interactions. Endogenous lectins, major counterpart molecules of glycans, should play crucial roles in the events (e.g. by regulating several signaling pathways). In this context, interactions occurring between cell surface glycans and endogenous lectins are considered to be essential for the maintenance of pluripotency, self-renewal, and differentiation of iPSCs/ESCs (48Klim J.R. Li L. Wrighton P.J. Piekarczyk M.S. Kiessling L.L. Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Indeed, heparan sulfate proteoglycans were reported to regulate self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (49Sasaki N. Okishio K. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Toyoda H. Nishimura T. Suda Y. Hayasaka M. Hanaoka K. Hitoshi S. Ikenaka K. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3594-3606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, reduced sulfation on heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate were demonstrated to direct neural differentiation of mouse ESCs and human iPSCs (50Sasaki N. Hirano T. Kobayashi K. Toyoda M. Miyakawa Y. Okita H. Kiyokawa N. Akutsu H. Umezawa A. Nishihara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 401: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, synthetic substrates recognizing cell surface glycans were reported to facilitate the long term culture of pluripotent stem cells (48Klim J.R. Li L. Wrighton P.J. Piekarczyk M.S.

Thus, global analysis of the cellular glycomes of iPSCs and ESCs performed in this study will be necessary to provide the basis to explore the functions and applications of the stem cell glycobiology. They includes rational design of the effective substrates and culture conditions to support the long term propagation of ESCs and iPSCs (48Klim J.R. Li L. Wrighton P.J. Piekarczyk M.S. Kiessling L.L. Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Of course, the results obtained in this study could also be readily applied to staining (specification of the place the event occurs), enrichment (e.g. lectin-aided capturing of necessary cells), and targeting of specific cells (e.g. elimination of unwanted undifferentiated cells). In this regard, stem cell glycoengineering with the aid of a lectin microarray is a key issue in realization of regenerative medicine in the near future. IntroductionIncreasing attention has been paid to iPSCs 2The abbreviations used are: iPSCinduced pluripotent stem cellAMamniotic mesodermalESCembryonic stem cellMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastPAEplacental artery endothelialSCsomatic cellUtEuterine endometriumrMOArecombinant MOAFWERfamilywise error rate. and ESCs in their pluripotency and medical applications (1Takahashi K.

However, establishment of a robust evaluation system of their properties, including differentiation propensity and risk of possible contamination of xenoantigens and even potential of tumorigenesis, has been hampered by the lack of comprehensive methodology directly applicable to target stem cells, although this is an emerging issue essential for the safe use of iPSCs in regenerative medicine. From many aspects, cell surface glycans are considered to be ideal targets for analyzing or identifying the phenotype of each cell in a direct manner by the following reasons (3Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 4Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). (a) Glycans are located at the outermost cell surface. (b) The total repertoire of cell surface glycans varies at every level of biological organization (i.e. species, tissues, cell types, and molecules). (c) Global alterations of the cellular glycome also occur during development, cellular activation, differentiation, malignant transformation, and inflammation. The cell surface glycans are therefore referred to as the “cell signature” that closely reflects cellular backgrounds and conditions, probably because they are actually functioning as cell-to-cell mediators in extensive biological phenomena. This fundamental nature of glycans should be understood with the fact that they are not encoded directly in the genome but are generated by a complex system of a number of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, whose expressions and activities are significantly affected by both intracellular and extracellular environmental changes. Indeed, cell surface molecules, such as stage-specific embryonic antigens (SSEA1 and -3/4) (5Muramatsu T. Muramatsu H. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and tumor rejection antigens (Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81) (6Schopperle W.M. DeWolf W.C.

Biol. 2007; 11: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) are glycobiomarkers widely used to evaluate pluripotency. Notably, however, these “representative” glycomarkers have been identified following rather fortuitous development of their specific antibodies, because most carbohydrate structures are poorly antigenic between mammals. In this context, a systematic search is necessary to draw a whole picture of the stem cell glycome and harness its effect on stem cell biology (8Lanctot P.M. Gage F.H. Varki A.P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Liang Y.J. Kuo H.H. Lin C.H. Chen Y.Y. Yang B.C. Cheng Y.Y. Yu A.L. Khoo K.H. Yu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22564-22569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For instance, the growth and directed differentiation of stem cells to specific progeny lineages in cell culture remain problematic. Understanding how stem cells communicate with one another and feeder cells through cell surface glycans may lead to rational design of specific culture systems. However, the glycome is a quite difficult target to predict solely based on any genomic data base because the biosynthetic process of the glycan moieties of glycoproteins is not template-driven and is subject to multiple sequential and competitive enzymatic pathways. In this sense, a rapid and sensitive system enabling direct monitoring of cell surface glycans is essential.Several methods have been developed for glycan analysis based on physicochemical principles, such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (10Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 2008; 144: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Wearne K.A. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. Glycoconj.

Lectin microarray is an alternative technology for structural glycomics, where a panel of lectins with various glycan-binding specificities is printed on a microarray, providing a versatile platform for rapid and high throughput analysis of glycan structures without liberation of glycans (13Pilobello K.T.

Lectins are a class of decoder molecules of cell surface glycans distributed throughout organisms, which mediate various functions through specific glycan recognition.

https://openalex.org/W2165974021,"MicroRNAs play important roles in many cell processes, including the differentiation process in several different lineages. For example, microRNAs can promote differentiation by repressing negative regulators of transcriptional activity. These regulated transcription factors can further up-regulate levels of the microRNA in a feed-forward mechanism. Here we show that MyoD up-regulates miR-378 during myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. ChIP and high throughput sequencing analysis shows that MyoD binds in close proximity to the miR-378 gene and causes both transactivation and chromatin remodeling. Overexpression of miR-378 increases the transcriptional activity of MyoD, in part by repressing an antagonist, MyoR. The 3' untranslated region of MyoR contains a direct binding site for miR-378. The presence of this binding site significantly reduces the ability of MyoR to prevent the MyoD-driven transdifferentiation of fibroblasts. MyoR and miR-378 were anticorrelated during cardiotoxin-induced adult muscle regeneration in mice. Taken together, this shows a feed-forward loop where MyoD indirectly down-regulates MyoR via miR-378."

The contribution of hereditary variants in the genes of transient receptor potential channels to neuropathic pain is unknown. We investigated the frequency of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, transient receptor potential melastin 8 and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms and their impact on somatosensory abnormalities in neuropathic pain patients. Within the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (Deutscher Forscbungsverbund Neuropathischer Schmerz) 371 neuropathic pain patients were phenotypically characterized using standardized quantitative sensory testing. Pyrosequencing was employed to determine a total of eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms in transient receptor potential channel genes of the neuropathic pain patients and a cohort of 253 German healthy volunteers. Associations of quantitative sensory testing parameters and single nucleotide polymorphisms between and within groups and subgroups, based on sensory phenotypes, were analyzed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms frequencies did not differ between both the cohorts. However, in neuropathic pain patients transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 710G>A (rs920829, E179K) was associated with the presence of paradoxical heat sensation (p = 0.03), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 1911A>G (rs8065080, I585V) with cold hypoalgesia (p = 0.0035). Two main subgroups characterized by preserved (1) and impaired (2) sensory function were identified. In subgroup 1 transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 1911A>G led to significantly less heat hyperalgesia, pinprick hyperalgesia and mechanical hypaesthesia (p = 0.006, p = 0.005 and p<0.001) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 1103C>G (rs222747, M315I) to cold hypaesthesia (p = 0.002), but there was absence of associations in subgroup 2. In this study we found no evidence that genetic variants of transient receptor potential channels are involved in the expression of neuropathic pain, but transient receptor potential channel polymorphisms contributed significantly to the somatosensory abnormalities of neuropathic pain patients."

These mycobacteria-specific protein families are characterized by conserved N-terminal domains of 100 and 180 amino acids, which contain the proline-glutamic acid (PE) and proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) motifs after which they are named. Here we investigated secretion of the triacylglycerol lipase LipY, which in fast-growing mycobacteria contains a signal sequence, but in slow-growing species appears to have replaced the signal peptide with a PE or PPE domain. Selected LipY homologues were expressed in wild-type Mycobacterium marinum and its corresponding ESX-5 mutant, and localization of the proteins was investigated by immunoblotting and electron microscopy. Our study shows that Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE-LipY (LipYtub) and M. marinum PPE-LipY (LipYmar) are both secreted to the bacterial surface in an ESX-5-dependent fashion. After transport, the PE/PPE domains are removed by proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, Mycobacterium gilvum LipY, which has a signal sequence, is not transported to the cell surface. Furthermore, we show that LipYtub and LipYmar require their respective PE and PPE domains for ESX-5-dependent secretion. The role of the PE domain in ESX-5 secretion was confirmed in a whole cell lipase assay, in which wild-type bacteria expressing full-length LipYtub, but not LipYtub lacking its PE domain, were shown to hydrolyze extracellular lipids. In conclusion, both PE and PPE domains contain a signal required for secretion of LipY by the ESX-5 system, and these domains are proteolytically removed upon translocation.

Visual arrestin-1 preferentially binds rhodopsin, whereas the two non-visual arrestins interact with hundreds of G protein-coupled receptor subtypes. Here we show that an extensive surface on the concave side of both arrestin-2 domains is involved in receptor binding. We also identified a small number of residues on the receptor binding surface of the N- and C-domains that largely determine the receptor specificity of arrestins. We show that alanine substitution of these residues blocks the binding of arrestin-1 to rhodopsin in vitro and of arrestin-2 and -3 to β2-adrenergic, M2 muscarinic cholinergic, and D2 dopamine receptors in intact cells, suggesting that these elements critically contribute to the energy of the interaction. Thus, in contrast to arrestin-1, where direct phosphate binding is crucial, the interaction of non-visual arrestins with their cognate receptors depends to a lesser extent on phosphate binding and more on the binding to non-phosphorylated receptor elements.

All arrestin proteins were labeled by incorporation of [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine with a specific activity of the mix of 1.5–3 Ci/mmol, resulting in the specific activity of arrestin proteins within the range of 66–85 Ci/mmol (150–230 dpm/fmol). The translation of every mutant used in this study produced a single labeled protein band with the expected mobility on SDS-PAGE. Two parameters were used for the assessment of mutant relative stability, as described (30Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

This integral parameter calculated for a mutant was expressed as a percent of that for corresponding wild type (WT) arrestin. The relative stability of all mutants used in this study exceeds 85% that of the parental WT proteins. Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes containing rhodopsin phosphorylated by endogenous GRK1 (also know as rhodopsin kinase) and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal were prepared as described previously (31Vishnivetskiy S.A.

Briefly, in vitro translated radiolabeled arrestins (50 fmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium acetate were incubated with 7.5 pmol (0.3 μg) of phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin in a final volume of 50 μl for 5 min at 37 °C in room light. Radiolabeled arrestins (50 fmol) were incubated with 50 fmol of phosphorylated receptor in the presence of 100 μm muscarinic agonist carbachol for 35 min at 30 °C. After incubation with either receptor, the samples were immediately cooled on ice and loaded onto 2 ml of Sepharose 2B columns equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. Bound arrestin eluted with receptor-containing membranes in the void volume (between 0.5–1.1 ml). Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 0.3 μg liposomes (less than 10% of the total binding and less than 0.5% of the arrestin present in the assay) was subtracted. Arrestin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (33Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine-less arrestin-2 (A2-CL) (C59V, C125S, C140L, C150V, C242V, C251V, C269S) was used as a base mutant for the introduction of unique cysteines. The best substituting residue in each position was chosen based on our high resolution crystal structure of arrestin-2 (6Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C.

We have previously shown that cysteine-less arrestin-2 is fully functional in terms of receptor binding (34Hanson S.M. Cleghorn W.M. Francis D.J. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Raman D. Song X. Nair K.S.

Arrestin cysteine mutants were dialyzed into 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and labeled with a 10-fold molar excess of 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-yl-methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL; Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada) overnight at 4 °C to generate the R1 side chain, as described (22Hanson S.M.

Final protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. EPR samples contained 25 μm spin-labeled arrestin-2 and 250 μm light-activated phosphorhodopsin in native disc membranes (26Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a final volume of 10 μl. X-band EPR spectra were recorded for samples in glass capillaries at room temperature over a 100-gauge range with an incident microwave power of 10 milliwatts on a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 fitted with a super high Q cavity. Spectra shown are typically the average of 16–36 scans, base-line-corrected, and normalized to the same area for each graphic overlay in Fig. 1B. For a qualitative interpretation of EPR spectral line shapes, as used in the present study, the reader is referred to Crane et al. (36Crane J.M. Mao C. Lilly A.A. Smith V.F. Suo Y. Hubbell W.L.

The plasmids containing the sequences of the indicated arrestins N-terminal-tagged with Venus (a variant of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (38Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with an upstream EcoRI site followed by the coding sequence of arrestins between NcoI and HindIII sites. Venus was amplified by PCR using the 5′-AGTCAGAATTCGCGATCGCGGCCACGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGA-3′ forward primer that adds EcoRI and AsiSI sites upstream of the start codon and the 5′-TCTCCCCCATGGAGTCGAGCGCTCGCCGAGACTTAAGTCCGGAGGTGGCCT-3′ reverse primer that codes for a short spacer with the SGLKSRRALDS sequence and an in-frame NcoI site. Venus was subcloned between the EcoRI and NcoI restriction sites. The arrestins were subcloned in-frame with the Venus-spacer sequence using NcoI and HindIII sites. The Venus-arrestin fusion proteins were subcloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) modified as described (39Song X. Raman D. Gurevich E.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Gurevich V.V. J.

RLuc8 was fused in-frame with the sequence of the triple HA-tagged human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), M2 muscarinic cholinergic, and D2 dopamine receptors purchased from the cDNA resource center (Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center). To this end, the coding sequences of all GPCRs were amplified by PCR using forward primers that introduce EcoRI and AsiSI restriction sites upstream of the receptor start codon and reverse primers that introduce an in-frame SbfI restriction site. These fragments were subcloned using EcoRI and SbfI sites in-frame with a C-terminal RLuc8. The well established BRET1 assay (42Namkung Y. Dipace C. Javitch J.A. Sibley D.R. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (3 μl of LipofectamineTM 2000/1 μg of DNA). Increasing amounts of the indicated Venus-arrestin constructs (0–12 μg) along with 250 ng of the indicated receptor plasmid and empty pcDNA3 to equalize DNA were used to transfect 80–90% confluent COS-7 cells on 60-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and re-seeded at 100,000–200,000 cells per well onto white opaque 96-well microplates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) for luminescence measurements or black opaque microplates (Nunc) for fluorescence determination. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the medium was replaced with PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing 0.01% glucose (w/v), 36 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, and 25 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.2. Coelenterazine-h (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA) at a final concentration of 5 μm was added 8 min after agonist (25 μm isoproterenol) stimulation, and luminescence was measured immediately using a POLARstar Optima dual channel luminometer and fluorometer microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC). The light emitted by coelenterazine-h and Venus in each well was measured simultaneously 5 times through a 465–485-nm and a 522.5–547.5-nm bandpass filter, respectively. The net BRET ratio was calculated as the long wavelength emission divided by the short wavelength emission and expressed as the relative change compared with unstimulated cells. The expression of each Venus-arrestin was evaluated using fluorescence at 535 nm upon excitation at 485 nm. The Venus-arrestin fluorescence, which is directly proportional to the expression levels, was normalized by the basal luminescence from the β2-adrenergic receptor-RLuc8 to account for variations in cell number and expression levels. The curves resulting from the titration of the various amounts of Venus-arrestin were fit by non-linear regression to a one-site hyperbola model using Prism version 5.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To assess the difference between the respective WT and mutant arrestins curves, a global fit algorithm was used. An extensive surface covering most of the concave sides of both arrestin-1 domains was implicated in rhodopsin binding by several groups using a variety of methods (14Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B.

TDP-43-expressing cells displayed markedly increased markers of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and necrosis. Cytotoxicity was dose- and age-dependent and was potentiated upon expression of disease-associated variants. TDP-43 was localized in perimitochondrial aggregate-like foci, which correlated with cytotoxicity. Although the deleterious effects of TDP-43 were significantly decreased in cells lacking functional mitochondria, cell death depended neither on the mitochondrial cell death proteins apoptosis-inducing factor, endonuclease G, and cytochrome c nor on the activity of cell death proteases like the yeast caspase 1. In contrast, impairment of the respiratory chain attenuated the lethality upon TDP-43 expression with a stringent correlation between cytotoxicity and the degree of respiratory capacity or mitochondrial DNA stability. Consistently, an increase in the respiratory capacity of yeast resulted in enhanced TDP-43-triggered cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and cell death markers.

However, senescent cancer cells may re-enter the cell cycle and lead to tumor relapse. Understanding the mechanisms that control the viability of senescent cells may be helpful in eliminating these cells before they can regrow. Treating human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells with the anti-cancer compounds, resveratrol and doxorubicin, triggered p53-independent premature senescence by invoking oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage. This process involved the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT1 at serine 47, resulting in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. SIRT1 phosphorylation caused concomitant increases in p65/RelA NF-κB acetylation and the expression of an anti-apoptotic Bfl-1/A1. SIRT1 physically interacts with the mTOR-Raptor complex, and a single amino acid substitution in the TOS (TOR signaling) motif in the SIRT1 prevented Ser-47 phosphorylation and Bfl-1/A1 induction. The pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of mTOR, unphosphorylatable S47A, or F474A TOS mutants restored SIRT1 deacetylase activity, blocked Bfl-1/A1 induction, and sensitized prematurely senescent SCC cells for apoptosis. We further show that the treatment of UVB-induced SCCs with doxorubicin transiently stabilized tumor growth but was followed by tumor regrowth upon drug removal in p53+/−/SKH-1 mice. The subsequent treatment of stabilized SCCs with rapamycin decreased tumor size and induced caspase-3 activation. These results demonstrate that the inhibition of SIRT1 by mTOR fosters survival of DNA damage-induced prematurely senescent SCC cells via Bfl-1/A1 in the absence of functional p53.

IntroductionCellular senescence is a state of permanent replicative arrest that is linked to telomere erosion and dysfunction that engages at least two mechanisms, the p53 and the p16INK4a-pRB pathways (1Campisi J.

In cancer cells, the presence of oncogenic mutations, chemotherapeutic drugs, and oxidative stress can cause an acutely inducible, telomere-independent, stress-responsive form of cellular senescence, termed premature senescence (PS) 2The abbreviations used are: PS, premature senescence; PIS, prematurely induced senescent; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia, mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; Bfl-1/A1, Bcl2-related protein A1; Chk1/2, checkpoint kinase 1/2; DOX, doxorubicin; DYRK, the dual specificity, tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC1, the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1; PML, promyelocytic leukemia protein; RES, resveratrol; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; SIRT1, sirtuin 1; hSIRT1, human SIRT1; mtHSP70, mitochondrial HSP70; TOS, TOR signaling.

However, the physiological consequences of prematurely induced senescent (PIS) cancer cells remain elusive. PIS cancer cells have been shown to promote the growth of neighboring cells, and they are intrinsically resistant to chemotherapeutic agents (5Roberson R.S. Kussick S.J. Vallieres E. Chen S.Y.

Importantly, cells in prematurely senescent tumors are capable of escaping growth arrest and re-entering the cell cycle, leading to tumor relapse (5Roberson R.S. Kussick S.J. Vallieres E. Chen S.Y.

As for the mechanism underlying escape from DNA damage-induced senescence, overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 has been found in clones that bypassed replicative arrest in human non-small cell H1299 carcinoma (5Roberson R.S. Kussick S.J. Vallieres E. Chen S.Y. Wu D.Y. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (9Elmore L.W. Di X. Dumur C. Holt S.E. Gewirtz D.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that survivin is the immediate downstream effector of Cdc2/Cdk1 and that phosphorylated survivin is necessary for the escape of senescent cells (12Wang Q. Wu P.C. Roberson R.S. Luk B.V. Ivanova I. Chu E. Wu D.Y. Int. J. Canc. 2011; 128: 1546-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, Twist1, which is involved in the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells, was shown to override oncogene-induced senescence by abrogating cell cycle inhibition by p21 and p16 (11Evan G.I. d'Adda di Fagagna F.

These data collectively suggest that there exist mechanisms that foster survival of PIS cancer cells and promote escape of these cells from the senescent state, which are likely detrimental to the overall therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment. Because the p53 gene is frequently inactivated in 50% of human cancers, including SCCs, this study investigated the regulatory mechanisms that control the survival of PIS SCC cells lacking functional p53.DISCUSSIONOur observation that the survival of DNA damage-induced prematurely senescent A431 cells involves phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase activity provides a novel regulatory loop of SIRT1 activity. Our results indicate that mTOR is a cellular regulator of SIRT1 activity in response to DNA damage. mTOR is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein; it primarily regulates proteins involved in translation. However, a small fraction of mTOR is detected in the nucleus under normal conditions, and mTOR shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus (32Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). An intrinsic nuclear import signal has been identified in mTOR, and its cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling appears to be important for its cytoplasmic regulation of S6K1 (33Bachmann R.A. Kim J.H. Wu A.L. Park I.H. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7357-7363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). mTOR has been shown to accumulate in the nucleus following hypoxia. Moreover, PML was shown to physically interact with mTOR, favoring mTOR nuclear accumulation and resulting in reduced tumor angiogenesis (34Paglin S. Lee N.Y. Nakar C. Fitzgerald M. Plotkin J. Deuel B. Hackett N. McMahill M. Sphicas E. Lampen N. Yahalom J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11061-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Bernardi R. Guernah I. Jin D. Grisendi S. Alimonti A. Teruya-Feldstein J. Cordon-Cardo C. Simon M.C. Rafii S. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2006; 442: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, the signals and mechanisms controlling the nuclear translocation of mTOR, and its functional status in the nucleus, remain largely unknown. In particular, the role of nuclear mTOR in the context of PS has not previously been addressed. In PIS A431 cells, the nuclear accumulation of mTOR corresponded to a marked decrease in the phosphorylation levels of its cytoplasmic targets and was accompanied by the up-regulation of a cell survival gene, Bfl-1/A1. These data suggest that mTOR has a yet-to-be-identified regulatory mechanism in the nucleus, in addition to playing a role in enhancing cytoplasmic signaling. The mechanisms underlying the nuclear translocation of mTOR, such as whether the process requires catalytic activity, are not known. In the presence of p53, genotoxic stress was suggested to inhibit mTOR via the p53-regulated genes Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 (36Budanov A.V. Karin M. Cell. 2008; 134: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), thus providing a mechanistic link between genotoxic stress and mTOR. A direct role for mTOR signaling in DNA damage response in p53 mutant cancer cells is not clear. Our results indicate that DNA damage-dependent activation of mTOR is critically important for the survival of PIS A431 cells, in which the mTOR complex physically interacts with SIRT1, likely via the TOS motif. The importance of the TOS motif was further demonstrated as SIRT1-Raptor interaction was substantially reduced by the F474A mutation (supplemental Fig. S3). However, because the knockdown of mTOR also abolished the interaction of SIRT1 and Raptor (Fig. 4B), our data raise the possibility that the physical interaction between SIRT1 and mTOR-Raptor may not be entirely mediated via the TOS motif. The exact mechanism(s) of SIRT1 interaction with mTORC1, and whether additional mechanism(s) exist, is not clear at the present time. Of interest, PRAS40, an mTORC1 subunit and substrate, also binds to Raptor via a TOS motif in PRAS40 (37Fonseca B.D. Smith E.M. Lee V.H. MacKintosh C. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24514-24524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 38Oshiro N. Takahashi R. Yoshino K. Tanimura K. Nakashima A. Eguchi S. Miyamoto T. Hara K. Takehana K. Avruch J. Kikkawa U. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20329-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Binding of PRAS40 to Raptor inhibits mTORC1 signaling as it blocks access of TOS-mediated substrates (e.g. 4EBP1) to Raptor (39Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20036-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 40Dunlop E.A. Dodd K.M. Seymour L.A. Tee A.R. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A release of PRAS40 from the substrate binding site of Raptor is believed to allow substrate presentation to mTORC1 and subsequent phosphorylation (39Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20036-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although mTOR knockdown has been shown to disrupt the mTOR-PRAS40 interaction, the total endogenous levels of PRAS40 were not affected (39Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20036-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that in the absence of mTOR, and therefore in the absence of mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of PRAS40, PRAS40 could remain bound to Raptor, thereby blocking SIRT1 access to Raptor, in which case the knockdown of mTOR would likely prevent SIRT1-Raptor interaction. Moreover, the incubation of mTORC1 with rapamycin leads to a complete disintegration of mTORC1, which has been shown to exist as an obligate dimer with a central cavity and with Raptor, PRAS40, and mLSt8 bound to mTOR (38Oshiro N. Takahashi R. Yoshino K. Tanimura K. Nakashima A. Eguchi S. Miyamoto T. Hara K. Takehana K. Avruch J. Kikkawa U. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20329-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 41Yip C.K. Murata K. Walz T. Sabatini D.M. Kang S.A. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 768-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This obligate dimeric structure may be necessary for performing multiple phosphorylations, as may be the case for PRAS40 (37Fonseca B.D. Smith E.M. Lee V.H. MacKintosh C. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24514-24524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this scenario, destabilization of mTORC1 by rapamycin could block PRAS40 release from Raptor, which may explain the lack of SIRT1-Raptor interaction in cells treated with RES and rapamycin (Fig. 4B).The interaction between mTOR complex and SIRT1 appears to be a prerequisite for Ser-47 phosphorylation. SIRT1 is a phosphoprotein (42Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Villén J. Li J. Cohn M.A. Cantley L.C. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12130-12135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), and several studies show the implication of the post-translational regulation of SIRT1 for its biological functions. SIRT1 phosphorylation by JNK2 at serine 27 was shown to increase SIRT1 protein stability, resulting in elevated SIRT1 protein levels in human cancer cells (43Ford J. Ahmed S. Allison S. Jiang M. Milner J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3091-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SIRT1 was also shown to be phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdk1 at threonine 530 and serine 540 (32Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and by the dual specificity, tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and another pro-survival member of the DYRK family, DYRK3 at Thr-522, leading to cell survival in HEK293T cells (44Guo X. Williams J.G. Schug T.T. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13223-13232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Unlike our data, those of Nasrin et al. (45Nasrin N. Kaushik V.K. Fortier E. Wall D. Pearson K.J. de Cabo R. Bordone L. PLoS. One. 2009; 4: e8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) report that phosphorylations of three residues (Ser-27, Ser-47, and Thr5–30) by JNK1 increase its enzymatic activity; however, their study did not determine the effect of Ser-47 phosphorylation alone on its activity (45Nasrin N. Kaushik V.K. Fortier E. Wall D. Pearson K.J. de Cabo R. Bordone L. PLoS. One. 2009; 4: e8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that multiple phosphorylations can lead to quite distinct phenotypes. These data implicate the complexity of SIRT1 regulation as its activity is not only distinctively regulated by various kinases but may also be differentially regulated by various stimuli in a context-dependent manner.The factors regulating the reversibility of PS remain to be defined. However, several in vitro studies have shown that senescent cells (p53-null lung cancer) can escape the senescent state and re-enter the cell cycle (5Roberson R.S. Kussick S.J. Vallieres E. Chen S.Y. Wu D.Y. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 9Elmore L.W. Di X. Dumur C. Holt S.E. Gewirtz D.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2637-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, cancer cells (p53-null) following oxidative stress are arrested in a senescence-like state, but they eventually re-enter the cell cycle (46Macip S. Kosoy A. Lee S.W. O'Connell M.J. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6037-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our DOX-treated, growth-stabilized SCCs in p53+/−/SKH-1 mice also resumed growth upon DOX withdrawal. Our study raises questions about the biological consequences of drug therapies that induce prematurely senescent, but viable, cancer cells. These cells could escape from senescence and ultimately contribute to tumor regrowth and recurrence. The therapeutic efficacy of these treatments is likely to depend on whether senescence is followed by cell death (18Gewirtz D.A. Holt S.E. Elmore L.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 76: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Our data provide the first functional link between mTOR and SIRT1 in response to genotoxic stress and reveal a p53-independent mechanism that controls the survival of PIS SCC cells. These results further suggest that inhibition of mTOR signaling could eliminate tumors containing senescent cells and block tumor recurrences. IntroductionCellular senescence is a state of permanent replicative arrest that is linked to telomere erosion and dysfunction that engages at least two mechanisms, the p53 and the p16INK4a-pRB pathways (1Campisi J.

https://openalex.org/W1965366080,"Previously, we reported that α1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8)-deficient (Fut8(-/-)) mice exhibit emphysema-like changes in the lung and severe growth retardation due to dysregulation of TGF-β1 and EGF receptors and to abnormal integrin activation, respectively. To study the role of α1,6-fucosylation in brain tissue where Fut8 is highly expressed, we examined Fut8(-/-) mice using a combination of neurological and behavioral tests. Fut8(-/-) mice exhibited multiple behavioral abnormalities consistent with a schizophrenia-like phenotype. Fut8(-/-) mice displayed increased locomotion compared with wild-type (Fut8(+/+)) and heterozygous (Fut8(+/-)) mice. In particular, Fut8(-/-) mice showed strenuous hopping behavior in a novel environment. Working memory performance was impaired in Fut8(-/-) mice as evidenced by the Y-maze tests. Furthermore, Fut8(-/-) mice showed prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficiency. Intriguingly, although there was no significant difference between Fut8(+/+) and Fut8(+/-) mice in the PPI test under normal conditions, Fut8(+/-) mice showed impaired PPI after exposure to a restraint stress. This result suggests that reduced expression of Fut8 is a plausible cause of schizophrenia and related disorders. The levels of serotonin metabolites were significantly decreased in both the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the Fut8(-/-) mice. Likewise, treatment with haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic drug that antagonizes dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors, significantly reduced hopping behaviors. The present study is the first to clearly demonstrate that α1,6-fucosylation plays an important role in the brain, and that it might be related to schizophrenia-like behaviors. Thus, the results of the present study provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for schizophrenia and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2130434604,"In this study, we determined the molecular mechanisms whereby forkhead transcription factor Foxo1, a key downstream signaling molecule of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/insulin actions, regulates Runx2 activity and expression of the mouse osteocalcin gene 2 (Bglap2) in osteoblasts in vitro. We showed that Foxo1 inhibited Runx2-dependent transcriptional activity and osteocalcin mRNA expression and Bglap2 promoter activity in MC-4 preosteoblasts. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that Foxo1 physically interacted with Runx2 via its C-terminal region in osteoblasts or when co-expressed in COS-7 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Foxo1 suppressed Runx2 binding to its cognate site within the Bglap2 promoter. IGF1 and insulin prevented Foxo1 from inhibiting Runx2 activity by promoting Foxo1 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. In contrast, a neutralizing anti-IGF1 antibody decreased Runx2 activity and osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that IGF1 increased Runx2 interaction with a chromatin fragment of the proximal Bglap2 promoter in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of Foxo1 increased Runx2 interaction with the promoter. This study establishes that Foxo1 is a novel negative regulator of osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2 and modulates IGF1/insulin-dependent regulation of osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts.

In contrast, a neutralizing anti-IGF1 antibody decreased Runx2 activity and osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that IGF1 increased Runx2 interaction with a chromatin fragment of the proximal Bglap2 promoter in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of Foxo1 increased Runx2 interaction with the promoter. This study establishes that Foxo1 is a novel negative regulator of osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2 and modulates IGF1/insulin-dependent regulation of osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2071236821,"Vascular calcification is regulated in a process similar to bone formation. BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) is essential for osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells and thus has been implicated in the development of vascular calcification. Here we examined whether Notch signaling interacts with BMP2 signaling to regulate osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). BMP2 alone scarcely induced the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an ectoenzyme crucially required for active biomineralization, in human aortic SMCs (HASMCs), despite its strong induction in osteoblast precursor MC3T3-E1 cells. Notably, overexpression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1-ICD) markedly enhanced BMP2-mediated induction of ALP activity and mineralization of HASMCs. In HASMCs, expression of Msx2 gene, a well documented BMP2 target gene in osteoblasts, was barely induced by BMP2 alone, and N1-ICD clearly enhanced the BMP2-driven Msx2 gene expression. Deletion and site-directed mutation analysis of Msx2 gene promoter revealed that the RBPJk-binding site was necessary for BMP2 responsiveness. Using the RBPJk-deficient cells and siRNA for RBPJk, we showed that RBPJk was required for BMP2 induction of Msx2 gene expression and ALP activity. Moreover, we showed that Smad1, a transcription factor downstream of BMP2 signaling, interacted with N1-ICD to form a complex within the Msx2 promoter. Immunohistochemistry of human calcifying atherosclerotic plaques revealed colocalized expression of Notch1, BMP2, and Msx2. These results indicate that the Notch intracellular domain·RBPJk complex enhances the BMP2-induced Msx2 gene expression by cooperating with Smad1 and suggest that Notch signaling makes vascular SMC responsive to BMP2 and promotes vascular calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2115555391,"Lectins that bind surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV with high avidity can potently inhibit viral entry. Yet properties such as multivalency that facilitate strong interactions can also cause nonspecific binding and toxicity. The cyanobacterial lectin microvirin (MVN) is unusual as it potently inhibits HIV-1 with negligible toxicity compared with cyanovirin-N (CVN), its well studied antiviral homolog. To understand the structural and mechanistic basis for these differences, we solved the solution structure of MVN free and in complex with its ligand Manα(1-2)Man, and we compared specificity and time windows of inhibition with CVN and Manα(1-2)Man-specific mAb 2G12. We show by NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation that MVN is monomeric in solution, and we demonstrate by NMR that Manα(1-2)Man-terminating carbohydrates interact with a single carbohydrate-binding site. Synchronized infectivity assays show that 2G12, MVN, and CVN inhibit entry with distinct kinetics. Despite shared specificity for Manα(1-2)Man termini, combinations of the inhibitors are synergistic suggesting they recognize discrete glycans and/or dynamic glycan conformations on gp120. Entry assays employing amphotropic viruses show that MVN is inactive, whereas CVN potently inhibits both. In addition to demonstrating that HIV-1 can be inhibited through monovalent interactions, given the similarity of the carbohydrate-binding site common to MVN and CVN, these data suggest that gp120 behaves as a clustered glycan epitope and that multivalent-protein interactions achievable with CVN but not MVN are required for inhibition of some viruses."

To better elucidate the pathomechanism of the neuronal disorder and to search for a pharmacological treatment, Drosophila models of SCA12 were generated by overexpression of a human ppp2r2b and its Drosophila homolog tws. Ectopic expression of ppp2r2b or tws caused various pathological features, including neurodegeneration, apoptosis, and shortened life span. More detailed analysis revealed that elevated ppp2r2b and tws induced fission of mitochondria accompanied by increases in cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytochrome c, and caspase 3 activity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that fragmented mitochondria with disrupted cristae were engulfed by autophagosomes in photoreceptor neurons of flies overexpressing tws. Additionally, transgenic flies were more susceptible to oxidative injury induced by paraquat. By contrast, ectopic Drosophila Sod2 expression and antioxidant treatment reduced ROS and caspase 3 activity and extended the life span of the SCA12 fly model. In summary, our study demonstrates that oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial dysfunction plays a causal role in SCA12, and reduction of ROS is a potential therapeutic intervention for this neuropathy.

https://openalex.org/W2009503126,"CD44 is a cell surface receptor for the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan and is involved in processes ranging from leukocyte recruitment to wound healing. In the immune system, the binding of hyaluronan to CD44 is tightly regulated, and exposure of human peripheral blood monocytes to inflammatory stimuli increases CD44 expression and induces hyaluronan binding. Here we sought to understand how mouse macrophages regulate hyaluronan binding upon inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with tumor necrosis factor α or lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ (LPS/IFNγ) induced hyaluronan binding by up-regulating CD44 and down-regulating chondroitin sulfation on CD44. Hyaluronan binding was induced to a lesser extent in interleukin-4 (IL-4)-activated macrophages despite increased CD44 expression, and this was attributable to increased chondroitin sulfation on CD44, as treatment with β-d-xyloside to prevent chondroitin sulfate addition significantly enhanced hyaluronan binding. These changes in the chondroitin sulfation of CD44 were associated with changes in mRNA expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases, CHST3 and CHST7, which were decreased in LPS/IFNγ-stimulated macrophages and increased in IL-4-stimulated macrophages.

Thus, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli differentially regulate the chondroitin sulfation of CD44, which is a dynamic physiological regulator of hyaluronan binding by CD44 in mouse macrophages. IntroductionMacrophages differentiate from peripheral blood monocytes upon recruitment to the tissues. Under homeostatic conditions this process occurs constitutively to maintain a population of resident macrophages that provide a first line of defense against invading microorganisms (for review, see Refs. 1Zhang X. Mosser D.M. J. Pathol. 2008; 214: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar and 2Geissmann F. Manz M.G. Jung S. Sieweke M.H. Merad M. Ley K. Science. 2010; 327: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar). This is of particular importance in some tissues, such as the lungs, where phagocytosis of bacteria by resident alveolar macrophages can be sufficient to clear infection (3Marriott H.M. Dockrell D.H. Exp. Lung Res. 2007; 33: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During inflammatory conditions, recruitment of a different subpopulation of monocytes occurs, and the number of macrophages in the tissues is greatly increased. Macrophages initially undergo “classical activation” in response to IFNγ and toll-like receptor (TLR) 6The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; β-d-xyloside, p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; CHST1, KSGal6ST, galactose 6-sulfotransferase; CHST2, GlcNAcST1, N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfotransferase; CHST3, C6ST-1, GlcNAcST4, N-acetylglucosamine and galactosamine 6-sulfotransferase; CHST7, C6ST-2, N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfotransferase; fluorescent-hyaluronan, fluorescein-conjugated hyaluronan; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; M0-, M1-, and M2-macrophages, unstimulated, LPS/IFNγ-stimulated, and IL-4-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages; MFI, mean fluorescent intensity; PI, propidium iodide; CSGalNAcT, chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosamine transferase. ligands such as LPS and display increased anti-microbial abilities due to increased production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (for review, see Refs. 4Van Ginderachter J.A.

Immunol. 2007; 37: S9-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The production of proinflammatory and T helper cell 1 (TH1)-polarizing cytokines by these LPS- and IFNγ-polarized (M1) macrophages affects both the local and systemic immune response. Recruited macrophages are also important for resolving inflammation, as they phagocytose inflammation-inducing agents such as bacteria, cellular debris, and degraded extracellular matrix components (6Leibovich S.J. Ross R. Am J. Pathol. 1975; 78: 71-100PubMed Google Scholar, 7Duffield J.S. Forbes S.J. Constandinou C.M. Clay S. Partolina M. Vuthoori S. Wu S. Lang R. Iredale J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased levels of anti-inflammatory or T helper cell 2 (TH2)-polarizing cytokines such as IL-4 result in the “alternative activation” of macrophages. These alternatively activated (M2) macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β in addition to cytokines and chemokines that promote tissue growth, remodeling, and angiogenesis (for review, see Refs. 8Crowther M. Brown N.J. Bishop E.T. Lewis C.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 478-490PubMed Google Scholar and 9Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar).One of the components of the extracellular matrix degraded during an inflammatory response is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. Hyaluronan accumulation at an injury site is important in recruiting macrophages to skin wounds (10Jameson J.M. Cauvi G. Sharp L.L. Witherden D.A. Havran W.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of fragmented hyaluronan can promote inflammation by activating macrophages and dendritic cells through either TLR2 or 4 (for review, see Ref. 11Jiang D. Liang J. Noble P.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan internalization by macrophages requires the cell surface receptor CD44 (12Culty M. Nguyen H.A. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and hyaluronan uptake by macrophages is important for the local turnover of hyaluronan (13Underhill C.B. Nguyen H.A. Shizari M. Culty M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, hyaluronan accumulated in the inflamed lungs of CD44 null (CD44−/−) mice treated with bleomycin, and this was reduced in mice reconstituted with CD44+/+ bone marrow (14Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Puré E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest an important role for macrophage CD44 in the removal of fragmented hyaluronan from inflammatory sites. Although TLR2 and -4 are thought to be the receptors that activate macrophages and dendritic cells in response to fragmented hyaluronan, CD44 can modulate TLR4 responses by negatively regulating TLR signaling (15Kawana H. Karaki H. Higashi M. Miyazaki M. Hilberg F. Kitagawa M. Harigaya K. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4235-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Liang J. Jiang D. Griffith J. Yu S. Fan J. Zhao X. Bucala R. Noble P.W. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2469-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, through the removal of proinflammatory fragmented hyaluronan and down-regulation of TLR signaling, CD44 may dampen the inflammatory response and assist in the resolution of inflammation, as has been observed in the bleomycin model of lung inflammation (14Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Puré E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). However, CD44 may also promote the inflammatory response. Reduced macrophage recruitment into inflamed lungs has been observed in CD44−/− mice after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (17Leemans J.C. Florquin S. Heikens M. Pals S.T. van der Neut R. Van Der Poll T. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or LPS inhalation (18Hollingsworth J.W. Li Z. Brass D.M. Garantziotis S. Timberlake S.H. Kim A.

Johnson P. Hascall V.C. Toole B.P. Glycoforum: Science of Hyaluronan Review Series. 33. 2009: 1-20Google Scholar).

M2-inducing cytokines such as IL-4, meanwhile, can inhibit hyaluronan binding in human peripheral blood monocytes (23Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6184-6194PubMed Google Scholar). Hyaluronan binding is usually associated with increased expression of CD44 but is also affected by various post-translational modifications to CD44 such as glycosylation (26English N.M. Lesley J.F.

Miyagi T. Taniguchi H. Matsubara Y. Kadota J. Tominaga A. Kincade P.W. Matsukura S. Kohno S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5058-5061PubMed Google Scholar), and sulfation (24Brown K.L. Maiti A. Johnson P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5367-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Maiti A. Maki G. Johnson P. Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, which prevents CD44 clustering, can also affect hyaluronan binding (33Brown K.L. Birkenhead D. Lai J.C. Li L. Li R. Johnson P. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although artificially altering CD44 post-translational modifications can affect hyaluronan binding, the challenge is to determine which changes occur in response to physiological stimuli. In human monocytic cells, TNFα-induced hyaluronan binding correlated with the increased sulfation of CD44 (24Brown K.L. Maiti A. Johnson P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5367-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Maiti A. Maki G. Johnson P. Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and further examination revealed that TNFα increased the expression of two carbohydrate sulfotransferases, CHST2 and CHST7 (34Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which led to sulfation of CD44 on both O- and N-linked carbohydrates (35Delcommenne M. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the expression of a sialylated 6-sulfo-N-acetyl lactosamine epitope on the N-linked carbohydrate of CD44 (34Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At the same time the carbohydrate sulfation of CD44 was increased, the percent of sulfation due to chondroitin sulfate on CD44 was decreased (35Delcommenne M. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further work identified serine 180 as the site of chondroitin sulfate addition on the standard isoform of human CD44 and showed that chondroitin sulfate addition at this site negatively regulated hyaluronan binding on a CD44-immunoglobulin fusion protein (29Ruffell B. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The removal of sialic acid residues also promotes hyaluronan binding, and this is one of the physiological mechanisms that regulates hyaluronan binding in human peripheral blood monocytes after LPS stimulation through the induction of sialidase activity (31Katoh S. Miyagi T. Taniguchi H. Matsubara Y. Kadota J. Tominaga A. Kincade P.W. Matsukura S. Kohno S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5058-5061PubMed Google Scholar). Much less is known about hyaluronan binding in mouse macrophages, although alveolar macrophages are able to bind and degrade hyaluronan without additional stimulation (12Culty M. Nguyen H.A. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 36Culty M. O'Mara T.E. Underhill C.B. Yeager Jr., H. Swartz R.P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we examined the physiological mechanisms responsible for the induction of hyaluronan binding by mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages exposed to M1 or M2 promoting agents. Both M1- and M2-inducing agents up-regulated CD44 expression and induced hyaluronan binding, albeit to differing extents. The inflammatory mediators TNFα and LPS/IFNγ reduced the chondroitin sulfation of CD44, and the loss of chondroitin sulfate directly contributed to increased hyaluronan binding by CD44. In contrast, the M2-inducing agent IL-4 increased CD44 expression but only induced low levels of hyaluronan binding, which was attributable to the increased chondroitin sulfation of CD44. Thus, both M1 and M2-macrophages regulate hyaluronan binding by differentially regulating the chondroitin sulfation of CD44.DISCUSSIONHere we find an inverse correlation between chondroitin sulfate-modified CD44 and hyaluronan binding in mouse macrophages and show that the regulation of chondroitin sulfate is a physiological mechanism used to regulate hyaluronan binding in these cells. Inflammatory agents such as LPS/IFNγ and TNFα induce hyaluronan binding at least in part by reducing chondroitin sulfation on CD44, whereas the M2-inducing cytokine, IL-4, limits hyaluronan binding by enhancing chondroitin sulfation on CD44. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory agents differentially regulate the chondroitin sulfation on CD44 by their opposing effects on the expression of the chondroitin 6-sulfotransferases, CHST3 and -7, at the mRNA level. We, therefore, conclude that the regulation of chondroitin sulfation on CD44 is one mechanism to dynamically regulate hyaluronan binding in myeloid cells and macrophages.There are at least three possible mechanisms to explain how chondroitin sulfate addition to serine 180 in the standard form of human CD44, or serine 183 in mice, can negatively regulate hyaluronan binding. The first is blocking hyaluronan binding by the direct binding of the chondroitin sulfate side chain in the hyaluronan binding pocket of CD44. The second is the binding of the negatively charged chondroitin sulfate to a positively charged region on CD44 resulting in a non-favorable hyaluronan binding conformation. The third possibility is that the rigid chondroitin sulfate modified side chain of CD44 prevents CD44 clustering and creates an unfavorable spacing of CD44 for hyaluronan-binding. The standard form of CD44 only binds chondroitin sulfate with a low affinity compared with hyaluronan (53Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar), and although the proximity of chondroitin sulfate to CD44 may enhance binding kinetics, this seems unlikely to overcome the large differences in affinity. Our demonstration that short chondroitin sulfate chains are able to restrict hyaluronan binding, including the six-sugar chondroitin sulfate stub remaining after chondroitinase ABC digestion, and that this effect can be observed in vitro with purified CD44 fusion proteins when spacing and clustering is less likely to be an issue (29Ruffell B. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicates that this is also unlikely to explain the effect of chondroitin sulfate. We thus favor the second possibility, as the crystal structure of the amino-terminal region of CD44 identified two conformational forms of CD44, a hyaluronan-binding conformation and another in the absence of hyaluronan (54Banerji S. Wright A.J. Noble M. Mahoney D.J. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Jackson D.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), supporting the possibility that chondroitin sulfate could bind to the hyaluronan binding domain and stabilize a non-binding conformation. Because a basic residue within a Bx7B motif present in variable exon 10 of CD44 is required for the chondroitin sulfate- and CD44-dependent cell-cell adhesion (55Hayes G.M. Chiu R. Carpenito C. Dougherty S.T. Dougherty G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50529-50534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it is possible that chondroitin sulfate-modified CD44 may also interact with a basic residue within a Bx7B motif located at the back of the hyaluronan binding domain to stabilize a non-hyaluronan binding conformation. Although we do not know to what extent CD44v10 is expressed in M2-macrophages or whether it plays a role in regulating hyaluronan binding, it is tempting to speculate that the Bx7B motif in v10 may compete with the Bx7B motif in CD44s for the binding of chondroitin sulfate and thus relieve some of its inhibitory effect on hyaluronan binding.It should be noted that the modification of CD44 by chondroitin sulfate in bone marrow-derived macrophages does not significantly alter the molecular mass of CD44, implying that the chondroitin sulfate chains of CD44 are small. In addition, chondroitinase ABC did not affect hyaluronan binding in unstimulated macrophages, suggesting that either the enzyme could not access the site on CD44 on the macrophage surface or that the six-sugar stub left after chondroitinase digestion is sufficient to mediate its negative effect. It is also possible that regulation by chondroitin sulfate may operate in other immune cells as the expression of the human CD44s mutant, S180A, which lacks the site of chondroitin sulfate addition, led to constitutive hyaluronan binding in Jurkat T cells (56Ruffell B. Johnson P. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 7044-7054Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that T cells, which up-regulate hyaluronan binding upon antigen recognition (21Lesley J. Howes N. Perschl A. Hyman R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Maeshima N. Poon G.F.T. Dosanjh M. Felberg J. Lee S.S.M. Cross J.L. Birkenhead D. Johnson P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41: 1108-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), may also regulate hyaluronan binding by regulating chondroitin sulfate addition to CD44.In human peripheral blood monocytes, β-d-xyloside prevents IL-4 from down-regulating TNFα-induced hyaluronan binding (30Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 193: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), consistent with IL-4 increasing the amount of chondroitin sulfate-modified CD44 and inhibiting hyaluronan binding. Here, LPS treatment of M2-macrophages enhanced hyaluronan binding by further increasing CD44 expression and reversing the IL-4-induced increase in chondroitin sulfate, whereas IL-4 treatment of M1-macrophages had little effect on CD44 expression or hyaluronan binding. Similarly, whereas it has been shown that removal of sialic acid residues by LPS-induced sialidase increases hyaluronan binding in human monocytes (31Katoh S. Miyagi T. Taniguchi H. Matsubara Y. Kadota J. Tominaga A. Kincade P.W. Matsukura S. Kohno S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5058-5061PubMed Google Scholar), the removal of sialic acid residues by neuraminidase treatment in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage caused only a slight increase in hyaluronan binding in both unstimulated and TNFα-stimulated cells (data not shown). However, it is unlikely that hyaluronan binding in macrophages is regulated by CD44 expression and chondroitin sulfate addition alone, given the numerous modifications to CD44 that can affect hyaluronan binding. We did observe increased mRNA expression of variable exon 10 in macrophages stimulated with IL-4, and as this region contains a putative chondroitin sulfate addition site and a Bx7B motif (55Hayes G.M. Chiu R. Carpenito C. Dougherty S.T. Dougherty G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50529-50534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it is foreseeable that these may also modulate hyaluronan binding.Here we have shown that inflammatory stimuli and IL-4 down- or up-regulate mRNA expression of two chondroitin GalNAc 6-sulfotransferases in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, which would be predicted to alter the sulfation of all chondroitin sulfated proteins, not just CD44. There are examples of chondroitin sulfate synthesis being responsive to cytokine treatment, including the anti-inflammatory and M2 cytokine TGF-β, which modifies the expression of various chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and increases the length of chondroitin sulfate chains on secreted biglycan (57Schönherr E. Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decorin (57Schönherr E. Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate chain length is also increased on CD44 in human lung fibroblasts (60Romarís M. Bassols A. David G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and mouse melanoma cells (61Faassen A.E. Mooradian D.L. Tranquillo R.T. Dickinson R.B. Letourneau P.C. Oegema T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 501-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) upon TGF-β treatment, raising the possibility that this cytokine may reduce hyaluronan binding in some conditions. Platelet-derived growth factor also increases chondroitin sulfate addition to CD44 in human dermal fibroblasts (62Clark R.A. Lin F. Greiling D. An J. Couchman J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 266-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and can increase the ratio of 6-to 4-sulfation (57Schönherr E. Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Schönherr E. Järveläinen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this has not been shown for CD44.In addition to regulating hyaluronan binding, it is possible that the regulation of chondroitin sulfation to CD44 may have additional consequences. Several studies have suggested that chondroitin sulfate addition to CD44 is necessary for CD44-mediated binding to other extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin (63Jalkanen S. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and collagen (64Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 65Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The induced changes in chondroitin sulfate seen after cytokine treatment are important in promoting CD44-mediated motility on these substrates. Platelet-derived growth factor induces invasive migration of human dermal fibroblasts into a fibronectin/fibrin gel that can be blocked by both β-d-xyloside and anti-CD44 mAbs (62Clark R.A. Lin F. Greiling D. An J. Couchman J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 266-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas β-d-xyloside also inhibits invasion of rabbit wound microvascular endothelial cells into a fibrin matrix (66Henke C.A. Roongta U. Mickelson D.J. Knutson J.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2541-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Similarly, the invasion and migration of mouse melanoma on type I collagen is increased after TGF-β treatment and blocked by β-d-xyloside (61Faassen A.E. Mooradian D.L. Tranquillo R.T. Dickinson R.B. Letourneau P.C. Oegema T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 501-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human melanoma cell migration on type IV collagen also involves chondroitin sulfate-modified CD44 in a possible cooperative role with integrins (65Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus the presence of chondroitin sulfate can promote the migration of adherent cells on the extracellular matrix. It will be interesting to see if the regulation of chondroitin sulfate influences the migration of immune cells in inflamed tissues, particularly as we have shown that modulation of chondroitin sulfate on CD44 regulates its adhesion to the extracellular matrix component, hyaluronan. IntroductionMacrophages differentiate from peripheral blood monocytes upon recruitment to the tissues. Under homeostatic conditions this process occurs constitutively to maintain a population of resident macrophages that provide a first line of defense against invading microorganisms (for review, see Refs. 1Zhang X. Mosser D.M. J. Pathol. 2008; 214: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar and 2Geissmann F. Manz M.G. Jung S. Sieweke M.H. Merad M. Ley K. Science. 2010; 327: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar). This is of particular importance in some tissues, such as the lungs, where phagocytosis of bacteria by resident alveolar macrophages can be sufficient to clear infection (3Marriott H.M. Dockrell D.H. Exp. Lung Res. 2007; 33: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During inflammatory conditions, recruitment of a different subpopulation of monocytes occurs, and the number of macrophages in the tissues is greatly increased. Macrophages initially undergo “classical activation” in response to IFNγ and toll-like receptor (TLR) 6The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; β-d-xyloside, p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; CHST1, KSGal6ST, galactose 6-sulfotransferase; CHST2, GlcNAcST1, N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfotransferase; CHST3, C6ST-1, GlcNAcST4, N-acetylglucosamine and galactosamine 6-sulfotransferase; CHST7, C6ST-2, N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfotransferase; fluorescent-hyaluronan, fluorescein-conjugated hyaluronan; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; M0-, M1-, and M2-macrophages, unstimulated, LPS/IFNγ-stimulated, and IL-4-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages; MFI, mean fluorescent intensity; PI, propidium iodide; CSGalNAcT, chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosamine transferase. ligands such as LPS and display increased anti-microbial abilities due to increased production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (for review, see Refs. 4Van Ginderachter J.A. Movahedi K. Hassanzadeh Ghassabeh G. Meerschaut S. Beschin A. Raes G. De Baetselier P. Immunobiology. 2006; 211: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 5Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: S9-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The production of proinflammatory and T helper cell 1 (TH1)-polarizing cytokines by these LPS- and IFNγ-polarized (M1) macrophages affects both the local and systemic immune response. Recruited macrophages are also important for resolving inflammation, as they phagocytose inflammation-inducing agents such as bacteria, cellular debris, and degraded extracellular matrix components (6Leibovich S.J. Ross R. Am J. Pathol. 1975; 78: 71-100PubMed Google Scholar, 7Duffield J.S. Forbes S.J. Constandinou C.M. Clay S. Partolina M. Vuthoori S. Wu S. Lang R. Iredale J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased levels of anti-inflammatory or T helper cell 2 (TH2)-polarizing cytokines such as IL-4 result in the “alternative activation” of macrophages. These alternatively activated (M2) macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β in addition to cytokines and chemokines that promote tissue growth, remodeling, and angiogenesis (for review, see Refs. 8Crowther M. Brown N.J. Bishop E.T. Lewis C.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 478-490PubMed Google Scholar and 9Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar).One of the components of the extracellular matrix degraded during an inflammatory response is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. Hyaluronan accumulation at an injury site is important in recruiting macrophages to skin wounds (10Jameson J.M. Cauvi G. Sharp L.L. Witherden D.A. Havran W.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of fragmented hyaluronan can promote inflammation by activating macrophages and dendritic cells through either TLR2 or 4 (for review, see Ref. 11Jiang D. Liang J. Noble P.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan internalization by macrophages requires the cell surface receptor CD44 (12Culty M. Nguyen H.A. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and hyaluronan uptake by macrophages is important for the local turnover of hyaluronan (13Underhill C.B. Nguyen H.A. Shizari M. Culty M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, hyaluronan accumulated in the inflamed lungs of CD44 null (CD44−/−) mice treated with bleomycin, and this was reduced in mice reconstituted with CD44+/+ bone marrow (14Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Puré E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest an important role for macrophage CD44 in the removal of fragmented hyaluronan from inflammatory sites. Although TLR2 and -4 are thought to be the receptors that activate macrophages and dendritic cells in response to fragmented hyaluronan, CD44 can modulate TLR4 responses by negatively regulating TLR signaling (15Kawana H. Karaki H. Higashi M. Miyazaki M. Hilberg F. Kitagawa M. Harigaya K. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4235-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Liang J. Jiang D. Griffith J. Yu S. Fan J. Zhao X. Bucala R. Noble P.W. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2469-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, through the removal of proinflammatory fragmented hyaluronan and down-regulation of TLR signaling, CD44 may dampen the inflammatory response and assist in the resolution of inflammation, as has been observed in the bleomycin model of lung inflammation (14Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Puré E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). However, CD44 may also promote the inflammatory response. Reduced macrophage recruitment into inflamed lungs has been observed in CD44−/− mice after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (17Leemans J.C. Florquin S. Heikens M. Pals S.T. van der Neut R. Van Der Poll T. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or LPS inhalation (18Hollingsworth J.W. Li Z. Brass D.M. Garantziotis S. Timberlake S.H. Kim A. Hossain I. Savani R.C. Schwartz D.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 37: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and CD44−/− macrophages have reduced ability to migrate to atherosclerotic lesions in a mouse model of atherosclerosis (19Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Puré E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).Although CD44 is the primary cell surface receptor for hyaluronan on immune cells, the majority of immune cells do not bind hyaluronan constitutively (for review, see Refs. 20Ruffell B. Johnson P. Hascall V.C. Toole B.P. Glycoforum: Science of Hyaluronan Review Series. 33. 2009: 1-20Google Scholar). T lymphocytes are induced to bind hyaluronan after activation with antigen (21Lesley J. Howes N. Perschl A. Hyman R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Maeshima N. Poon G.F.T. Dosanjh M. Felberg J. Lee S.S.M. Cross J.L. Birkenhead D. Johnson P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41: 1108-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, induce hyaluronan binding in human peripheral blood monocytes (23Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6184-6194PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brown K.L. Maiti A. Johnson P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5367-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (25Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). M2-inducing cytokines such as IL-4, meanwhile, can inhibit hyaluronan binding in human peripheral blood monocytes (23Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6184-6194PubMed Google Scholar). Hyaluronan binding is usually associated with increased expression of CD44 but is also affected by various post-translational modifications to CD44 such as glycosylation (26English N.M. Lesley J.F. Hyman R. Cancer Research. 1998; 58: 3736-3742PubMed Google Scholar, 27Skelton T.P. Zeng C. Nocks A. Stamenkovic I. J.

Miyagi T. Taniguchi H. Matsubara Y. Kadota J. Tominaga A. Kincade P.W. Matsukura S. Kohno S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5058-5061PubMed Google Scholar), and sulfation (24Brown K.L. Maiti A. Johnson P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5367-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Maiti A. Maki G. Johnson P. Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, which prevents CD44 clustering, can also affect hyaluronan binding (33Brown K.L. Birkenhead D. Lai J.C. Li L. Li R. Johnson P. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although artificially altering CD44 post-translational modifications can affect hyaluronan binding, the challenge is to determine which changes occur in response to physiological stimuli. In human monocytic cells, TNFα-induced hyaluronan binding correlated with the increased sulfation of CD44 (24Brown K.L. Maiti A. Johnson P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5367-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Maiti A. Maki G. Johnson P. Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and further examination revealed that TNFα increased the expression of two carbohydrate sulfotransferases, CHST2 and CHST7 (34Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which led to sulfation of CD44 on both O- and N-linked carbohydrates (35Delcommenne M. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the expression of a sialylated 6-sulfo-N-acetyl lactosamine epitope on the N-linked carbohydrate of CD44 (34Tjew S.L. Brown K.L. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 7C-13CCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At the same time the carbohydrate sulfation of CD44 was increased, the percent of sulfation due to chondroitin sulfate on CD44 was decreased (35Delcommenne M. Kannagi R. Johnson P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further work identified serine 180 as the site of chondroitin sulfate addition on the standard isoform of human CD44 and showed that chondroitin sulfate addition at this site negatively regulated hyaluronan binding on a CD44-immunoglobulin fusion protein (29Ruffell B. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The removal of sialic acid residues also promotes hyaluronan binding, and this is one of the physiological mechanisms that regulates hyaluronan binding in human peripheral blood monocytes after LPS stimulation through the induction of sialidase activity (31Katoh S. Miyagi T. Taniguchi H. Matsubara Y. Kadota J. Tominaga A. Kincade P.W. Matsukura S. Kohno S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5058-5061PubMed Google Scholar). Much less is known about hyaluronan binding in mouse macrophages, although alveolar macrophages are able to bind and degrade hyaluronan without additional stimulation (12Culty M. Nguyen H.A. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 36Culty M. O'Mara T.E. Underhill C.B. Yeager Jr., H. Swartz R.P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we examined the physiological mechanisms responsible for the induction of hyaluronan binding by mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages exposed to M1 or M2 promoting agents. Both M1- and M2-inducing agents up-regulated CD44 expression and induced hyaluronan binding, albeit to differing extents. The inflammatory mediators TNFα and LPS/IFNγ reduced the chondroitin sulfation of CD44, and the loss of chondroitin sulfate directly contributed to increased hyaluronan binding by CD44. In contrast, the M2-inducing agent IL-4 increased CD44 expression but only induced low levels of hyaluronan binding, which was attributable to the increased chondroitin sulfation of CD44. Thus, both M1 and M2-macrophages regulate hyaluronan binding by differentially regulating the chondroitin sulfation of CD44."

We have previously reported that Smad1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in DN. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that induce and activate Smad1. Here, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) was found to up-regulate the expression of Smad1 in mesangial cells and subsequently to phosphorylate Smad1 downstream of the advanced glycation end product-receptor for advanced glycation end product signaling pathway. Moreover, Bmp4 utilized Alk3 and affected the activation of Smad1 and Col4 expressions in mesangial cells. In the diabetic mouse, Bmp4 was remarkably activated in the glomeruli, and the mesangial area was expanded. To elucidate the direct function of Bmp4 action in the kidneys, we generated transgenic mice inducible for the expression of Bmp4. Tamoxifen treatment dramatically induced the expression of Bmp4, especially in the glomeruli of the mice. Notably, in the nondiabetic condition, the mice exhibited not only an expansion of the mesangial area and thickening of the basement membrane but also remarkable albuminuria, which are consistent with the distinct glomerular injuries in DN. ECM protein overexpression and activation of Smad1 in the glomeruli were also observed in the mice. The mesangial expansion in the mice was significantly correlated with albuminuria. Furthermore, the heterozygous Bmp4 knock-out mice inhibited the glomerular injuries compared with wild type mice in diabetic conditions. Here, we show that BMP4 may act as an upstream regulatory molecule for the process of ECM accumulation in DN and thereby reveals a new aspect of the molecular mechanisms involved in DN.

DN is characterized by mesangial matrix expansion caused by an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the mesangial area, which ultimately progresses to glomerulosclerosis associated with renal dysfunction (1Mason R.M. Wahab N.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1358-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Kanwar Y.S. Wada J. Sun L. Xie P. Wallner E.I. Chen S. Chugh S. Danesh F.R. Exp. Biol. Med. 2008; 233: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Advanced glycation end products (AGE) produced as the result of hyperglycemia are known to stimulate the production of ECM proteins, resulting in glomerulosclerosis (3Doi T. Vlassara H. Kirstein M. Yamada Y. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 4Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T.

Physiol. 2005; 289: F645-F659Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). One of the major components of ECM is α1/α2 type IV collagen (Col4), which is overproduced in diabetic glomerulosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that Smad1 directly binds to the promoter of Col4 and transcriptionally up-regulates Col4 expression (6Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14201-14206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, glomerular expression of Smad1 is significantly increased in diabetic rats along with mesangial expansion (7Matsubara T. Abe H. Arai H. Nagai K. Mima A. Kanamori H. Sumi E. Takahashi T. Matsuura M. Iehara N. Fukatsu A. Kita T. Doi T. Lab. Invest. 2006; 86: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Mima A. Arai H. Matsubara T. Abe H. Nagai K. Tamura Y. Torikoshi K. Araki M. Kanamori H. Takahashi T. Tominaga T. Matsuura M. Iehara N. Fukatsu A. Kita T. Doi T. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1712-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In previous reports, it has been shown that Smad1 is absent in the renal glomeruli of normal adult human and mice (6Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14201-14206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For now, we still lack mechanistic insight into how Smad1 expression is induced and activated in DN. It is generally known that Smad1 is directly phosphorylated by TGF-β type I receptors as well as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) through type I and II BMP receptors (9Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Although BMPs are well known to be required for the normal development of various tissues and organs, including the kidneys (10Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar), the role of BMPs in adults or in diseases is unclear. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the BMP signaling pathway involved in the pathogenesis of DN remain largely unknown. Previous studies have reported that TGF-β and its downstream signaling are critical factors in mediating mesangial cell hypertrophy and fibronectin synthesis in diabetes and that angiotensin II plays an important role in the development of mesangial matrix expansion (11Fogo A.B. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2000; 35: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Fukami K. Ueda S. Yamagishi S. Kato S. Inagaki Y. Takeuchi M. Motomiya Y. Bucala R. Iida S. Tamaki K. Imaizumi T. Cooper M.E. Okuda S. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 2137-2147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (AT1 antagonist) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has been proved to slow slightly the progression of DN (13Lewis E.J. Hunsicker L.G. Bain R.P. Rohde R.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (4965) Google Scholar, 14Lewis E.J. Hunsicker L.G. Clarke W.R. Berl T. Pohl M.A. Lewis J.B. Ritz E. Atkins R.C. Rohde R. Raz I. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (4956) Google Scholar). However, medical research has still not found a way to halt the progression of DN. From these facts, we hypothesized that there might be other signaling pathways contributing to the progression of DN. Therefore, in this study we tried to demonstrate that the BMP signaling pathway is a regulatory molecular mechanism directly involved in the pathological features in DN by using both in vitro and in vivo. We generated inducible Bmp4 transgenic mice (tgm) by using the tamoxifen-regulated Cre-loxP system and provided an ideal model to investigate the direct role of Bmp4 in glomerular injury in vivo. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Institutional guidelines, and the ethical Review Board of Tokushima University granted permission for the procedures used in this study. To generate inducible Bmp4 transgenic mouse lines, we used the tamoxifen-regulated Cre-loxP system. This system consists of two transgenes. The first transgene is the inducible Bmp4 expression cassette, pMacII-floxed GFP pA-Bmp4, by using expression vector pMacII, consisting of cytomegalovirus enhancer, mouse β-actin promoter, and mouse β-globin genomic DNA (Fig. 4A, panel a). The second transgene is a construct for expression of a fusion protein of mutated murine estrogen receptor and Cre recombinase (MerCreMer (MCM)) with the pCAGGS vector (Fig. 4A, panel b) (15Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). MCM cDNA was a kind gift from Prof. M. Reth (16Zhang Y. Riesterer C. Ayrall A.M. Sablitzky F. Littlewood T.D. Reth M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Each of these two transgenes was microinjected to the pronuclei of C57BL/6J mouse fertilized eggs to make transgenic mouse lines. Two strains of inducible Bmp4 transgenic mouse lines were established as double transgenic mice, C57BL/6J-Tg(Actb-GFP-Bmp4)1Csk-Tg (CAG-MerCreMer)67Csk and C57BL/6J-Tg(Actb-GFP-Bmp4)5Csk-Tg(CAG-MerCreMer)67Csk. In this system, Cre is expressed and remains in the cytoplasm of expressing cells, where it is in an inactive form bound to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). After injection of tamoxifen, Cre is released from the Hsp90 and translocates to the nucleus, where it becomes active and mediates recombination of DNA-carrying loxP target sequences. MerCreMer contains two mutated estrogen receptor-binding domains and confers tight dependence on tamoxifen binding for translocation to the nucleus and recombinase activity (17Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons Jr., S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Verrou C. Zhang Y. Zürn C. Schamel W.W. Reth M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To induce Bmp4 gene expression, 8-week-old transgenic mice were fed a diet (CE-2, CLEA, Japan) containing 0.02% tamoxifen citrate (Sigma). Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice weighing 22–24 g were rendered diabetic by the intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg per kg body weight streptozotocin (STZ) in citrate buffer, pH 4.5, for 5 consecutive days. The diabetic state was confirmed 5 days after final injection by measurement of blood glucose level. All mice that were given STZ had a blood glucose concentration exceeding 400 mg/dl and were considered diabetic. Bmp4 knock-out mice (C57BL/6 Bmp4+/−) were gifts of B. Hogan and M. Saitou. Generation and characterization of this mutant mouse were described elsewhere (19Winnier G. Blessing M. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Bmp4+/− mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Diabetes was induced in 8-week-old male mice weighing 22–24 g by the intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg per kg of body weight STZ in citrate buffer, pH 4.5, for 2 days. Mice receiving an injection of citrate buffer were used as controls. The levels of blood glucose were determined 1 week after final injection of STZ. The mice that were given STZ with blood glucose levels exceeding 400 mg/dl were considered diabetic. The mice were classified into four groups as follows: (a) nondiabetic C57BL/6 (n = 6); (b) nondiabetic Bmp4+/− (n = 6); (c) diabetic C57BL/6 (n = 8); and (d) diabetic Bmp4+/− (n = 7). These mice were killed 20 weeks after final injection of STZ and citrate buffer. A glomerular mesangial cell line was established from glomeruli isolated from normal 4-week-old mice (C57BL/6) and identified according to a method described previously (20Davies M. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 320-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phenotypically stable cells, passage 14–24, were plated in 100-mm plastic dishes (Nunc) and maintained in B medium (a 3:1 mixture of minimal essential medium/F-12 modified with trace elements) (Nissui) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 mg/ml (Invitrogen), and 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen). The cultured cells fulfilled the criteria generally accepted for glomerular mesangial cells (20Davies M. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 320-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). AGE-BSA was prepared by incubating BSA (fraction V) in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm, pH 7.4) with 50 mm d-glyceraldehyde for 7 days at 37 °C with protease inhibitors and antibiotics as described previously (3Doi T. Vlassara H. Kirstein M. Yamada Y. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Yamagishi S. Inagaki Y. Okamoto T. Amano S. Koga K. Takeuchi M. Makita Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20309-20315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Unmodified BSA was incubated under the same conditions without d-glyceraldehyde as a control. Preparations were tested for endotoxin, but endotoxin was not detected. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method. All AGE protein-specific fluorescence intensities were measured at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. AGE-BSA contained 59.4 AGE units/mg of protein, and unmodified BSA contained 2.3 AGE units/mg of protein, respectively. The glomerular mesangial culture was examined with AGE exposure as described previously (4Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These cells were seeded on 100-mm plastic dishes and maintained in B medium/10% FCS. After a 48-h incubation, cells were starved for 24 h in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and then incubated with Bmp4 (R&D Systems) at 37 °C for the indicated times. These cells were incubated with carboxymethyl lysine (Nippi) at 10 μg/ml for 24 h followed by serum starvation. For the receptor for AGE (RAGE) and Bmp4 knockdown experiments, the cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection with siRNA for RAGE or scrambled siRNA (Invitrogen) and siRNA for Bmp4 or scrambled siRNA (TAKARA). Alk3 knockdown experiments were performed by transfecting the cells with shRNA for Alk3 or control (Takara), followed by serum starvation and stimulation with Bmp4 after 24 h. Western blots were performed with anti-Bmp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Smad1 (Sp125, a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Smad1, was generated in this study), anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling), anti-Col4 (Southern Biotech), anti-RAGE (ABR), anti-Alk3 (Abgent), anti-β-actin (Sigma), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies. Tissue for light microscopy was fixed in methyl Carnoy's solution and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with periodic acid Schiff and periodic acid methenamine silver-stained. Morphometry was evaluated in periodic acid methenamine-stained tissues by image processor for analytical pathology as described previously (22Takahashi T. Abe H. Arai H. Matsubara T. Nagai K. Matsuura M. Iehara N. Yokode M. Nishikawa S. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7100-7106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Kidney sections were treated with anti-Bmp4, anti-phospho-Smad1 (Upstate), anti-Smad1, anti-Col4, and Col1 (Abcam) antibodies. The immunoreactivity of Bmp4 was quantified by Bmp4-positive areas in the glomeruli using image processor for analytical pathology. Tissue for electron microscopy was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The mean GBM thickness was calculated with Image J (National Institutes of Health). We previously demonstrated that Smad1 is induced by AGE stimulation in mouse mesangial cells (MCs). Therefore, we first determined the expression of Bmp4 in mouse MCs treated with AGE. Expression of Bmp4 and Col4 was increased by AGE stimulation (1 and 10 μg/cm2) (Fig. 1A). Longer exposure to AGE (48 and 72 h) remarkably up-regulated the expression of Bmp4 as well as those of Smad1 and Col4 (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of the RAGE, which is thought to be the main receptor for AGE, attenuated the inductions of Bmp4 and Col4 by AGE (Fig. 1C) (23Lander H.M. Tauras J.M. Ogiste J.S. Hori O. Moss R.A.

Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Yamamoto H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smad1 (pSmad1) was strongly induced by Bmp4, and induction of Col4 by Bmp4 was observed in a time-dependent manner in mouse MCs (Fig. 1, D and E). Moreover, Bmp4 induced the expression of Smad1 and type 1 collagen (Col1) as well as Col4 in mouse MCs (Fig. 1F). Another ligand carboxymethyl lysine for RAGE also induced the expression of Bmp4 in MCs (Fig. 1G). These results suggest that Bmp4 is involved in the regulation of Smad1 activation and subsequent production of ECM proteins downstream of the RAGE signaling pathway in MCs. We next investigated the effects of the inhibition of Bmp4 signaling in the stimulation of AGE. The increased expression of Col4 caused by AGE was significantly inhibited by the knockdown of Bmp4 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained from an inhibition assay using a neutralizing antibody for Bmp4 or Noggin (Fig. 2B). Although the neutralizing antibody for Bmp4 clearly inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad1 (Fig. 2B), the inhibitory effect for Col4 was partial. Two BMP type I receptors, activin-like kinase 3 and 6 (Alk3 and Alk6), can bind Bmp4 in vitro and are also expressed during kidney and urinary tract development (26Miyazaki Y. Ueda H. Yokoo T. Utsunomiya Y. Kawamura T. Matsusaka T. Ichikawa I. Hosoya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We then performed RT-PCR analyses for mouse MCs in the presence or absence of AGE. Expression of Alk3, but not Alk6, was detected in MCs in both conditions of AGE (data not shown). Therefore, we carried out knockdown of Alk3 and confirmed the inhibitory effect of phosphorylation of Smad1 (Fig. 2C). Expression of Col4 was also suppressed by Alk3 silencing in mouse MCs (Fig. 2C). These findings implicate that Bmp4 and its receptor Alk3 affect the activation of Smad1 and Col4 expression in mouse MCs. We next investigated whether the Bmp4-Smad1 signaling pathway acts in vivo by using experimental models of DN. STZ mice exhibited glomerulosclerosis (Fig. 3B). A positive staining of Bmp4 was observed in expanded mesangial areas, which was merged with Col4 but not Podocin (Fig. 3B). The pSmad1 expression was also positive with a nucleic pattern in the glomeruli, indicating activation of the Smad1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy mice (Fig. 3B), although neither were detected in control mice. The increase in glomerulosclerotic areas detected by silver staining (periodic acid methenamine) was remarkable in STZ mice (7.2 ± 1.5%) compared with wild type mice (1.4 ± 0.3%) (Fig. 3C). Immunohistochemical positivity of Bmp4 levels was observed in accordance with the levels of glomerulosclerosis (correlation factor r = 0.927, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). Taken together, Bmp4 may contribute to Smad1 activation and subsequent overproduction of ECM proteins in these experimental models of DN. Hence, we propose the hypothesis that Bmp4 plays a critical role in the development of renal changes that are characteristic of DN. To examine whether Bmp4 is responsible for the formation of characteristic renal changes and albuminuria in the development of DN, we generated transgenic mice with inducible expression of Bmp4 using the tamoxifen-regulated Cre/LoxP system in a nondiabetic condition (Fig. 4A). It is well known that Bmp4 is a multifunctional signaling molecule required for normal embryonic development. Because no specific promoter-directed expression in MCs has been developed, we decided to use the CMV enhancer and β-actin promoter, which has been reported to be activated only in glomeruli but not in tubules, arteries, and interstitium (27Akagi Y. Isaka Y. Akagi A. Ikawa M. Takenaka M. Moriyama T. Yamauchi A. Horio M. Ueda N. Okabe M. Imai E. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1265-1269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the CMV/actin promoter drives the transgene expression predominantly in the whole glomeruli by monitoring GFP expression (Fig. 4C). To discuss the direct interaction of Bmp4 induction and pathophysiological changes in this inducible transgenic mouse system, we set several negative controls to exclude the possible nonspecific factors as follows: environmental and feeding conditions, insertion of the transgenes in the genome, and pharmacological actions of tamoxifen and nuclear translocation of MCM. The Bmp4 transgenic mice did not have any abnormalities before induction with tamoxifen as we show in the upper row of Fig. 5A, which indicates that neither environmental and feeding conditions nor insertion of the transgenes in the genome has any significant effect on their health. Additionally, the MCM transgenic mice did not have any obvious symptoms after they were fed with tamoxifen-containing diet (data not shown), even though translocation of activated MCM into nuclei takes place. These results indicate that both pharmacological actions of tamoxifen and nuclear translocation of the MCM did not have significant effects. Therefore, we concluded that pathophysiological changes in the Bmp4 transgenic mice described below are a direct consequence of induced Bmp4 overexpression. Tamoxifen-inducible Bmp4 transgenic mice revealed extensive expansion of the mesangial matrix, compared with noninducible glomeruli. To quantify the extent of mesangial expansion, we used an image processor for analytical pathology system, which showed an increase in the mesangial matrix fraction compared with noninducible mice (Fig. 5, A and B). These transgenic mice also showed significant induction of glomerular expressions of Smad1, pSmad1, Col4, and Col1 compared with noninducible mice (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the Bmp4 tgm exhibited marked thickening of the GBM as well as mesangial expansion in electron microscopic analyses (Fig. 5, C and D), both of which are characteristic of human DN. Albuminuria was dramatically increased in inducible Bmp4 tgm compared with noninducible mice. Moreover, the degree of expansion of mesangial areas in inducible Bmp4 tgm was significantly correlated with the degree of albuminuria (Fig. 5, E and F). These changes were similarly observed in another line of Bmp4 tgm. Collectively, inducible Bmp4 tgm were able to mimic diabetic changes in glomeruli by exhibiting pathological features remarkably resembling human DN in a nondiabetic condition. Although forced expression of Bmp4 in glomeruli caused renal changes similar to DN, there still remains the possibility that Bmp4 tgm showed renal changes of different renal diseases. Therefore, we investigated whether the reduction of Bmp4 expression improved the diabetic glomerular changes by using heterozygous Bmp4 knock-out mice. Blood glucose was increased, and body weight was decreased in both diabetic mouse groups compared with the control mouse group (Fig. 6A). We observed the attenuation of mesangial matrix expansion in diabetic Bmp4+/− mice compared with diabetic wild type mice (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the pSmad1 expression was decreased in Bmp4+/− STZ mice compared with C57BL/6 STZ mice (Fig. 6B). We also found that glomerular expression of Col4 was reduced in diabetic Bmp4+/− mice, compared with diabetic wild type mice (6.3 ± 2.4% in Bmp4+/− STZ mice versus 9.7 ± 0.7% in C57BL/6 STZ mice, p < 0.05) (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that BMP4 is a critical determinant for the development of DN. DN is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease and a major contributing cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes throughout the world. Typical features include thickening of the GBM and mesangial matrix hyperplasia (so-called glomerulosclerosis) (28Beisswenger P.G. Spiro R.G. Science. 1970; 168: 596-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Only the latter pathological finding is related to the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (29Kanwar Y.S. Rosenzweig L.J. Linker A. Jakubowski M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 2272-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which is the general clinical event for renal damage in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. There are several factors associated with the development of DN, including AGE, protein kinase C, oxidative stress, and an increase in glomerular hemodynamics. Among them, we have recently reported that Smad1 is induced and phosphorylated in diabetic kidneys, but the factors driving the induction as well as phosphorylation of Smad1 in diabetes mellitus have remained elusive. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that the BMP4 signaling pathway may play a crucial role in the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia is now recognized as the principal causal factor of diabetic complications (30Pirart J. Diabete Metab. 1977; 3: 245-256PubMed Google Scholar, 31.(1993) N. Engl. J. Med. 329, 977–986.Google Scholar). Its deleterious effects are attributable to the formation of sugar-derived protein adducts and cross-links known as AGE. Exposure of cultured mesangial cells to AGE results in a receptor-mediated up-regulation of mRNA and protein secretion of Col4 (4Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T.

We have previously shown that AGE/RAGE system is critical for progression of glomerulosclerosis, as shown in the study AGE breaker and RAGE knock-out mice (25Yamamoto Y. Kato I. Doi T. Yonekura H.

Previous studies have shown that TGF-β increases the levels of ECM protein in DN (36Yang C.W. Vlassara H. Peten E.P. He C.J. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pathol. 2004; 165: 2033-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is generally known that Smad3 functions as a key intracellular signal transducer for profibrotic TGF-β responses in various cells. Although the role of the Smad3 pathway in the pathogenesis of DN has only been demonstrated for interstitial fibrosis in a model of obstructive nephropathy (39Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), the interruption of Smad3 signaling did not improve albuminuria in STZ-diabetic Smad3 knock-out mice (40Fujimoto M. Maezawa Y. Yokote K. Joh K. Kobayashi K. Kawamura H. Nishimura M. Roberts A.B. Saito Y. Mori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similarly, albuminuria failed to improve in diabetic db/db mice treated with an anti-TGF-β antibody (41Ziyadeh F.N. Hoffman B.B. Han D.C. Iglesias-De La Cruz M.C. Hong S.W. Isono M. Chen S. McGowan T.A. Sharma K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8015-8020Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). These results suggest the existence of another signaling pathway involved in the development of DN. Here, we first confirmed that RAGE knockdown leads to the decreased expression of Bmp4 and the subsequent decrease of ECM production. In addition, we demonstrated that Bmp4 not only phosphorylated but also directly induced Smad1 in mesangial cells. Because it has been shown that Smad1 is absent in the normal glomeruli of adult mice and humans (6Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol.

Gene. 2000; 258: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Bmp4 may be involved in the initiation of glomerulosclerosis. Expression of Bmp4 levels were also correlated with the severity of glomerulosclerosis in STZ mice. Therefore, there is a possibility that the extent of induction of BMP4 via AGE-RAGE signal correlates with pathological changes in glomeruli in DN. The BMP family of proteins belongs to the TGF-β superfamily; these proteins exert their effects through association with two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II receptors (43Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 44ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H.

Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). The type IA receptor (BMPR-IA/ALK3) and BMPR-IB/ALK6 share a high similarity and specifically bind several BMP family members. First, we confirmed that Smad1 was phosphorylated through Alk3, but not Alk6, and induced the expression of Col4. We then investigated the possibility that Bmp2 and Bmp4, which originate from a single ancestral gene highly similar to the fly dpp gene (46Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar, 47McCauley D.W. Bronner-Fraser M. Evol. Dev. 2004; 6: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and share greater than 90% amino acid homology in the ligand domain, may influence the Smad1-induced Col4 expression. Notably, the inducible Bmp4 transgenic mice exhibited remarkable glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria, and Smad1 activation and elevated expression of Col1 and Col4 were observed in the glomeruli. These findings in the kidney are all consistent with the features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, forced expression of Bmp4 in glomeruli was able to mimic DN in a nondiabetic condition, strongly suggesting that Bmp4 plays a central role for the development of DN. Moreover, from the point of view of a therapeutic approach to DN, we induced diabetes on heterozygous Bmp4 knock-out mice and analyzed them. Diabetic heterozygous Bmp4 knock-out mice exhibited the reduction of glomerular changes compared with diabetic wild type mice, suggesting that the expression levels of Bmp4 correlates with the degree of expansion of mesangial areas in diabetes. In addition, a recent report demonstrates that Col4 itself contributes to acceleration of ECM expansion through the direct regulatory effect of Col4 on Bmp4 signaling (48Wang X. Harris R.E. Bayston L.J. Ashe H.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the activation of the BMP4 signaling pathway and overproduction of COL4 may cooperatively contribute to the progression of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Taken together, these results provide direct and specific evidence for the causal role of BMP4 in the pathogenesis of DN in vivo. Because the BMPs are a large family of proteins that share common structural features, highly specific inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies for BMP4 would offer us novel therapeutic tools to suppress the progression of diabetic nephropathy. In summary, we have clearly shown that the activation of BMP4 signal transduction through Smad1 may play an essential role for the initiation and progression of diabetic changes in the kidney. Preferential inhibition of the BMP4 signaling pathway may provide a novel therapeutic approach to DN without undesirable adverse effects, because, for instance, BMP2 might have a protective effect against renal damage (49Yang Y.L.

Our results indicate that the role of both the cell surface and exogenous glycosaminoglycans in gene delivery is controlled by the nature of the peptide and its complex with DNA. IntroductionProteoglycans are biologically important molecules that are ubiquitously expressed on the cell surfaces as well as the extracellular and intracellular spaces and are involved in a variety of functions including tissue organization, morphogenesis, cellular communication, adhesion, migration, growth, and signaling to name few (1Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). They are made up of a protein core linked to linear polysaccharide chains called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). 3The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; C6S, chondroitin 6-sulfate. These glycosaminoglycan chains are composed of different repeating disaccharide units that are sulfated at various positions. Based on the nature of the repeating units and the degree of sulfation, heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates, keratan sulfates, and hyaluronan are the different types of GAGs well known in the literature. Sulfated proteoglycans on the cell membranes are the major contributors to the negative charge on the cell surface, making it available for electrostatic interactions. These proteoglycans bind many ligands like growth factors and chemokines as well as large proteins. They have also been implicated in the internalization of foreign molecules and organisms through endocytotic pathways. Many viruses including adeno-associated virus (2Summerford C. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (3Chen Y. Götte M. Liu J. Park P.W. Mol. Cells. 2008; 26: 415-426PubMed Google Scholar) initially bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans to mediate their cellular entry.Non-viral gene delivery vectors like lipoplexes (lipid-DNA complexes) and polyplexes (polymer-DNA complexes), which are usually cationic in nature, can also interact with both cell surface and extracellular GAGs through electrostatic interactions. The cell surface GAGs have been thought to act as the primary receptor for the attachment of the cationic complexes followed by endocytosis of the complexes (for review, see Ref. 4Poon G.M. Gariépy J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 788-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Early reports showed that poly-l-lysine-DNA complexes as well as different cationic liposome-DNA complexes require cell surface proteoglycans (specifically, heparan sulfate proteoglycans) for delivery of DNA both in vitro and in vivo (5Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 6Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26164-26170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, many subsequent reports have shown that their function in cellular entry of non-viral vector complexes may be dispensable, and strong binding of cationic complexes to either cell surface or extracellular GAGs may actually prevent their uptake. It was demonstrated that cellular uptake of cationic lipoplexes occurred at similar levels in cell lines with cell surface GAGs as well as in GAG-deficient cell lines (7Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which implies that any role of GAGs in controlling transfection efficiency can at best come into play at a later step of the transfection process. It has also been suggested that cell surface proteoglycans protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of cationic lipids, and hence, proteoglycan-deficient cell lines give lowered transfection at high lipid to DNA ratios (7Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, another study showed that cationic polymers such as poly-l-lysine and polyethyleneimine, and lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP) and 1,2-dioleyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) show strong binding to the cell surface GAGs but decreased transfection efficiency in their presence due to decreased cellular uptake (8Ruponen M. Honkakoski P. Tammi M. Urtti A. J. Gene Med. 2004; 6: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The exact role of the cell surface proteoglycans in lipoplex or polyplex delivery is, thus, elusive, and different experimental conditions as well as different chemical and structural characteristics of the cationic carriers might be responsible for the differences observed in the data.Exogenous addition of negatively charged GAGs in vitro during transfection has also been studied in most of these systems and has usually been found to decrease the gene transfer efficiency (5Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 9Ruponen M. Rönkkö S. Honkakoski P. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Urtti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33875-33880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is thought that depending on the chemistry of the carrier, the nature of the complex, and the charge density of GAGs, the decrease in transfection may be due to one or all of the following reasons. (i) Sulfated GAGs cause premature extracellular release of DNA from its complexes with cationic polymers (10Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Burke R.S. Pun S. Bioconjugate Chem. 2008; 19: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or cationic lipids (12Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11493-11498Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). (ii) Soluble GAGs could compete with cell surface proteoglycans for binding to the complex, thereby decreasing cellular uptake (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). (iii) Binding of GAGs may change the endocytotic uptake route of the complex. (iv) GAGs may cause altered intracellular distribution of the complexes, significantly affecting the gene expression (9Ruponen M. Rönkkö S. Honkakoski P. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Urtti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33875-33880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).The strong and universal translocation of arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides in multiple cell types has also triggered speculation on the involvement of some common molecules like cell surface GAGs in the process of cellular entry, although it is still debatable whether membrane translocation and endocytotic uptake are both involved (14Futaki S. Nakase I. Tadokoro A. Takeuchi T. Jones A.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cell-penetrating peptides like naturally occurring protein transduction domains, e.g. the HIV-TAT peptide (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), Antennapedia peptide (15Console S. Marty C. García-Echeverría C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), penetratin, and even synthetic homoarginines of certain compositions (16Fuchs S.M. Raines R.T.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), are likely to involve cell surface GAGs in their cellular entry. It has also been seen that when these peptides are used for cargo delivery, the requirement of cell surface GAGs differs. Cellular uptake of HIV-1 TAT peptide conjugated to cargo was first surmised to occur in a manner dependent on the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which was confirmed by impaired uptake on enzymatic or genetic removal of the cell surface GAGs (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 18Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, uptake of free TAT peptide was suggested to involve either different receptors or pathways because its internalization was not completely inhibited in cells lacking surface heparan sulfate (19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Brooks H. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15300-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The involvement of cell surface proteoglycans on the cellular entry of the peptide and its complexes with cargo can be affected by many factors such as net charge of the complex (18Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) as well as the structure and distribution of positive charges on the peptides (17Nakase I. Tadokoro A. Kawabata N. Takeuchi T. Katoh H. Hiramoto K. Negishi M. Nomizu M. Sugiura Y. Futaki S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and hence, it is possible that the bare peptide and the complex behave in different ways. More recently, it was proposed that transduction mediated by TAT can occur in glycan-deficient cell lines and the cell surface glycans bind TAT and only affect the efficiency of transduction (20Gump J.M. June R.K. Dowdy S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1500-1507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, although arginine-rich peptides have high affinity to sulfated GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, and heparin (21Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and could co-internalize heparan sulfate, mediating nuclear delivery (18Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), soluble sulfated GAGs inhibited cargo delivery by arginine-rich peptides (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 15Console S. Marty C. García-Echeverría C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). All these evidences suggest that the role of GAGs in controlling cellular entry of cationic peptides with and without cargo needs further elucidation.Under this backdrop, we have explored the role of both cell surface and soluble GAGs during gene delivery using model peptide carriers, arginine, and lysine homopeptides (each 16-mer in length). Peptides containing these two amino acids either alone or in different proportions (e.g. TAT peptide) and often with simple chemical modifications like attachment of other additional amino-acids, polyethylene glycol, functional moieties like targeting ligands, and fusogenic peptides, etc. are the most commonly studied peptide based gene delivery agents (22Martin M.E. Rice K.G. AAPS J. 2007; 9: E18-E29Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 23Mann A. Thakur G. Shukla V. Ganguli M. Drug Discov. Today. 2008; 13: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We show that the 16-mer arginine and lysine homopeptides differ in their requirement of cell surface GAGs as well as in their interaction with soluble GAGs during gene delivery. This is reflected in the alterations of complex morphology, pattern of cellular binding, internalization, and eventual gene delivery efficiency between the two peptide systems. Our results highlight the importance of peptide chemistry as a key determinant for requirement of GAGs in gene delivery.DISCUSSIONCell surface glycosaminoglycans, by virtue of their negative charge density, are known to act as initial attachment sites or receptors for the internalization of a variety of ligands. However, although these molecules seem to be important in the entry of cell penetrating peptides like TAT, Antp, and some oligoarginines, a general consensus on their exact role is lacking. Multiple factors seem to affect the interaction between the positively charged peptides and the cell surface GAGs and eventually their internalization mechanism. The peptide sequence, charge distribution and the extracellular peptide concentration are the major influential factors (28Jiao C.Y. Delaroche D. Burlina F. Alves I.D. Chassaing G. Sagan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33957-33965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) along with the composition of the cell surface or the presence of other receptors. It has also been observed that the peptide conjugated to a cargo, either covalently or electrostatically, behave differently or may have alternative internalization mechanisms as compared with the free peptide (19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Brooks H. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15300-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). With respect to the peptide complexes with cargo molecules like DNA, the role of cell surface GAGs is ambiguous and seems to affect various stages of cellular entry like complex stability and cell surface binding as well as intracellular processing. Moreover, free exogenous GAGs may hinder the gene delivery efficiency by peptide-DNA complexes, as has already been reported for lipoplexes and polyplexes (5Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 9Ruponen M. Rönkkö S. Honkakoski P. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Urtti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33875-33880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).In this study, our aim was to explore the role of cell surface and exogenous GAGs on the DNA delivery efficiency of arginine and lysine homopeptides of similar length, with the main focus on the role of peptide chemistry in this process. These two amino acids are the most common residues in peptide-based carriers for gene delivery and were thus obvious choices for a comparative study. Our results indicate that arginine- and lysine-based peptides differ in their requirement of cell surface GAGs for both cellular entry as well as DNA delivery. In the case of R16, the free peptide and the polyplex appear to adopt different routes of internalization. The arginine peptide enters entirely by non-endocytotic pathway as observed by near complete internalization at low temperature. On the other hand, R16 polyplexes go through an endocytotic mechanism. However, it is interesting to note that in both cases, there is very little difference in the uptake or the transfection efficiency between the wild type and the glycan-deficient cell lines or under the conditions of enzymatic removal of cell surface GAGs (as seen from FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2), indicating that the peptide and polyplex probably utilize different entry paths, which are both non-GAG-dependent. In contrast, both the bare lysine homopeptide and its complex are taken up into the cells primarily through an endocytotic route of entry involving cell surface GAGs. There is a reduction in the uptake of both the K16 peptide and polyplex in the mutant cell line and a decrease in the transfection efficiency on enzymatic removal of cell surface GAGs (both HS and CS). This implicates GAGs as primary attachment sites for the polyplexes, which is confirmed by poor cell association and internalization at low temperature in the mutant cell line. However, the transfection efficiency in the mutant cell line is not hugely altered. This apparent discrepancy could arise from a step beyond the entry process, i.e. possible routing through a different intracellular processing pathway in the mutant cell line as compared with the wild type, leading to efficient gene expression. Altogether, these results indicate that a glycan-dependent pathway of entry seems to be the predominant mode for the lysine peptide.The cellular entry of arginine-rich peptides has been proposed to occur by multiple pathways, including direct translocation across the membrane and endocytosis (29Duchardt F. Fotin-Mleczek M. Schwarz H. Fischer R. Brock R. Traffic. 2007; 8: 848-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 30Nakase I. Takeuchi T. Tanaka G. Futaki S. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2008; 60: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Both the pathways were operational in the proteoglycan-deficient cell line as well, although at higher peptide concentration, showing that the cell surface proteoglycans are dispensable for cellular entry of arginine homopeptides (31Kosuge M. Takeuchi T. Nakase I. Jones A.T. Futaki S. Bioconjugate Chem. 2008; 19: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The polar, positively charged arginine oligomers can recruit negatively charged membrane components such as fatty acids to transiently produce a less polar ion pair complex that can partition into the lipid bilayer and thus translocate across the plasma membrane, driven by the membrane potential (32Rothbard J.B. Jessop T.C. Wender P.A. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2005; 57: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This is due to the more effective bidentate hydrogen bonding possible for guanidino groups in arginine versus the mondentate hydrogen bonding for ammonium groups in lysine. Therefore, lysine peptides form weaker interactions with membrane components, and direct translocation of lysine is not efficient (32Rothbard J.B. Jessop T.C. Wender P.A. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2005; 57: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 33Mitchell D.J. Kim D.T. Steinman L. Fathman C.G. Rothbard J.B. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). It is possible that such a mechanism of entry is operative here as well in case of the arginine peptides and polyplexes, whereas the lysine counterpart employs a GAG-dependent endocytotic route.We have also checked the transfection efficiency of the two peptides in the presence of exogenous soluble GAGs to explore whether there are differences in the interaction of arginine and lysine peptides with GAGs. Surprisingly, we observed that in the presence of exogenous HS and CS, the transfection efficiency of R16 increases by an order of magnitude or more under certain concentrations of GAGs (Fig. 3), which is contrary to some of the earlier reports. The increase is seen at relatively low GAG:peptide w/w ratios of 0.1:1 and 0.5:1 and is independent of cell surface GAGs. At relatively higher amounts of GAGs, there is a decrease in transfection, as has been observed earlier, possibly by destabilization of the complexes (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 15Console S. Marty C. García-Echeverría C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the case of K16 polyplexes, the addition of exogenous GAGs does not in general cause any major increase in the transfection efficiency and shows considerable drop at most of the GAG concentrations used.To explain this, we analyzed the stability of these polyplexes on anionic challenge. In vitro analysis of the stability of the polyplexes in the presence of soluble GAGs by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide exclusion assay shows that both types of polyplexes are destabilized only at very high amounts of HS or CS (significantly higher than the conditions under which increased transfection is seen). The extent of destabilization is higher in the case of K16 polyplexes. However, atomic force microscopy reveals that there are actually subtle changes in the polyplex morphology in the two cases in the presence of GAGs. R16 complexes show altered morphology in the presence of GAGs but do not release DNA, whereas the K16 polyplexes clearly release DNA at all concentrations of anionic challenge despite the fact that arginines are known to bind more strongly to GAGs than lysines (34Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). DNase I protection assay also confirms that low amounts of GAGs confer stability to the R16 polyplexes making the compacted DNA unavailable for nuclease degradation, as compared with the native polyplexes without GAGs. However, such protection is not offered in the case of K16 polyplexes. Thus, clearly the K16 complexes, by virtue of their loosened nature, are easily disassembled in presence of exogenous GAGs, which could be the major reason for their lowered transfection in such conditions.The differences in the interaction of arginine and lysine polyplexes with soluble GAGs can be ascribed to differences in the nature of the complexes formed by these peptides with DNA. We have earlier observed in a separate study that arginine- and lysine-based peptides have different DNA delivery efficiency due to differences in their DNA compaction and release mechanism. At a charge ratio 10, where maximum transfection efficiency (with least toxicity) is seen with both the peptides, the polyplexes show small size and uniform size distribution in the case of R16, whereas the particles are loosely packed in case of K16 (this is also shown in Fig. 5 under conditions where GAGs are absent). We have attributed this to the fact that K16 shows multiple modes of complexation (both monomolecular and multimolecular pathways are operative) as compared with R16 (where only multimolecular pathways are seen). The release of DNA from the polyplexes on anionic challenge also corroborates this, as K16 is more easily destabilized in the presence of anionic agents.4 It has also been shown in the literature that arginine polypeptide binds with higher affinity to different glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate than lysine, as the guanidino group of arginine can form electrostatic interaction as well as hydrogen bonds with the sulfate groups in GAGs when compared with the ammonium cation of lysine (25Verrecchio A. Germann M.W. Schick B.P. Kung B. Twardowski T. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For a similar reason, arginine polypeptide also binds with higher affinity to a negatively charged polymer like DNA. Thus, the stronger affinity for GAGs allows the more compact R16 complexes to accommodate low amounts of GAGs on the surface, leading to increase in size but minimal destabilization (Fig. 5A) along with increased transfection efficiency, whereas the loose packaging of K16 polyplexes is easily disturbed in presence of GAGs. It needs to be noted here that in terms of charge, 5 μg of HS has ∼5 times lesser negative charges than the positive charges on R16 peptides in a complex with DNA. Thus, if we assume that the GAGs attach to the complex surface, the polyplex still remains positively charged in the presence of the GAGs and possibly has a protective effect.We further dissected at which step the GAG protected R16 polyplexes score over the K16 polyplexes during cellular interaction. We observed that in the presence of GAGs at low concentrations (0.5:1 GAG:peptide) the R16 polyplex-GAG complex was associated with more than 95% of cells (at 4 °C) in the case of both the wild type and the glycan-deficient mutant cells as compared with only 30% cells when no GAG is present. This shows that the R16 polyplexes, in the presence of a GAG coating on them, show more cell association, but the binding sites possibly do not involve cell surface GAGs, as the effect is seen in both the wild type and the mutant cell line. Polyplexes were also internalized more efficiently in the presence of GAG coating both at 4 and 37 °C. Because internalization at 4 °C is usually indicative of a non-endocytotic route of entry, it is possible that multiple uptake routes are utilized by the GAG-coated R16 complexes. On the other hand, K16 polyplexes show decreased cell association and uptake in the presence of exogenous GAGs, which is even more prominent in the mutant cell line. Once again, this confirms the need for cell surface GAGs for the internalization of K16 polyplexes. But whether the cell surface proteoglycans are directly involved in the internalization of polyplexes by endocytosis or they act as primary receptors to present the complexes to specific endocytotic receptors is not clear and needs to be elucidated further.In summary, in this manuscript we have shown that arginine and lysine peptides have distinct behaviors in the presence of glycosaminoglycans. 16-Mer arginine homopeptides and their complexes with DNA can enter glycan-deficient cells as efficiently as the wild type cells, showing that cell surface GAGs are dispensable for their entry. But 16-mer lysine homopeptides and complexes prefer a GAG-dependent pathway for cellular entry. In the presence of relatively lower amounts of soluble GAGs, the arginine polyplexes show better stability and give an increase in the transfection efficiency in both cell types, unlike the lysine polyplexes. The chemical nature of the peptide and their different mechanisms of DNA compaction and release can thus cause differences in their behavior in the presence of both cell surface and soluble GAGs. The interaction between R16 and different GAGs does not seem to show specificity, as the consequential effects of R16 polyplex binding to GAGs remains similar for both HS and CS. The specificity might arise from differences in peptide length and structural characteristics as it has been demonstrated that the structures of arginine-rich peptides, specifically the distribution of positive charges, determine their dependence and specificity for heparan sulfate proteoglycan (17Nakase I. Tadokoro A. Kawabata N. Takeuchi T. Katoh H. Hiramoto K. Negishi M. Nomizu M. Sugiura Y. Futaki S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition to stabilization of the complexes and their higher membrane binding affinity and uptake in the presence of GAGs, arginine polyplexes might also be adopting a different route of uptake or intracellular processing which delivers functional DNA more efficiently. This aspect is currently under investigation. We are also trying to explore whether conjugating GAG to peptide-DNA complexes will be useful in targeting specific cell types or whether this modulation will enhance transfection efficiency in a GAG-rich environment. IntroductionProteoglycans are biologically important molecules that are ubiquitously expressed on the cell surfaces as well as the extracellular and intracellular spaces and are involved in a variety of functions including tissue organization, morphogenesis, cellular communication, adhesion, migration, growth, and signaling to name few (1Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). They are made up of a protein core linked to linear polysaccharide chains called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). 3The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; C6S, chondroitin 6-sulfate. These glycosaminoglycan chains are composed of different repeating disaccharide units that are sulfated at various positions. Based on the nature of the repeating units and the degree of sulfation, heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates, keratan sulfates, and hyaluronan are the different types of GAGs well known in the literature. Sulfated proteoglycans on the cell membranes are the major contributors to the negative charge on the cell surface, making it available for electrostatic interactions. These proteoglycans bind many ligands like growth factors and chemokines as well as large proteins. They have also been implicated in the internalization of foreign molecules and organisms through endocytotic pathways. Many viruses including adeno-associated virus (2Summerford C. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (3Chen Y. Götte M. Liu J. Park P.W. Mol. Cells. 2008; 26: 415-426PubMed Google Scholar) initially bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans to mediate their cellular entry.Non-viral gene delivery vectors like lipoplexes (lipid-DNA complexes) and polyplexes (polymer-DNA complexes), which are usually cationic in nature, can also interact with both cell surface and extracellular GAGs through electrostatic interactions. The cell surface GAGs have been thought to act as the primary receptor for the attachment of the cationic complexes followed by endocytosis of the complexes (for review, see Ref. 4Poon G.M. Gariépy J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 788-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Early reports showed that poly-l-lysine-DNA complexes as well as different cationic liposome-DNA complexes require cell surface proteoglycans (specifically, heparan sulfate proteoglycans) for delivery of DNA both in vitro and in vivo (5Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 6Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26164-26170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, many subsequent reports have shown that their function in cellular entry of non-viral vector complexes may be dispensable, and strong binding of cationic complexes to either cell surface or extracellular GAGs may actually prevent their uptake. It was demonstrated that cellular uptake of cationic lipoplexes occurred at similar levels in cell lines with cell surface GAGs as well as in GAG-deficient cell lines (7Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which implies that any role of GAGs in controlling transfection efficiency can at best come into play at a later step of the transfection process. It has also been suggested that cell surface proteoglycans protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of cationic lipids, and hence, proteoglycan-deficient cell lines give lowered transfection at high lipid to DNA ratios (7Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, another study showed that cationic polymers such as poly-l-lysine and polyethyleneimine, and lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP) and 1,2-dioleyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) show strong binding to the cell surface GAGs but decreased transfection efficiency in their presence due to decreased cellular uptake (8Ruponen M. Honkakoski P. Tammi M. Urtti A. J. Gene Med. 2004; 6: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The exact role of the cell surface proteoglycans in lipoplex or polyplex delivery is, thus, elusive, and different experimental conditions as well as different chemical and structural characteristics of the cationic carriers might be responsible for the differences observed in the data.Exogenous addition of negatively charged GAGs in vitro during transfection has also been studied in most of these systems and has usually been found to decrease the gene transfer efficiency (5Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 9Ruponen M. Rönkkö S. Honkakoski P. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Urtti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33875-33880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is thought that depending on the chemistry of the carrier, the nature of the complex, and the charge density of GAGs, the decrease in transfection may be due to one or all of the following reasons. (i) Sulfated GAGs cause premature extracellular release of DNA from its complexes with cationic polymers (10Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Burke R.S. Pun S. Bioconjugate Chem. 2008; 19: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or cationic lipids (12Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11493-11498Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). (ii) Soluble GAGs could compete with cell surface proteoglycans for binding to the complex, thereby decreasing cellular uptake (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). (iii) Binding of GAGs may change the endocytotic uptake route of the complex. (iv) GAGs may cause altered intracellular distribution of the complexes, significantly affecting the gene expression (9Ruponen M. Rönkkö S. Honkakoski P. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Urtti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33875-33880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).The strong and universal translocation of arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides in multiple cell types has also triggered speculation on the involvement of some common molecules like cell surface GAGs in the process of cellular entry, although it is still debatable whether membrane translocation and endocytotic uptake are both involved (14Futaki S. Nakase I. Tadokoro A. Takeuchi T. Jones A.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cell-penetrating peptides like naturally occurring protein transduction domains, e.g. the HIV-TAT peptide (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), Antennapedia peptide (15Console S. Marty C. García-Echeverría C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), penetratin, and even synthetic homoarginines of certain compositions (16Fuchs S.M. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Nakase I. Tadokoro A. Kawabata N. Takeuchi T. Katoh H. Hiramoto K. Negishi M. Nomizu M. Sugiura Y. Futaki S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), are likely to involve cell surface GAGs in their cellular entry. It has also been seen that when these peptides are used for cargo delivery, the requirement of cell surface GAGs differs. Cellular uptake of HIV-1 TAT peptide conjugated to cargo was first surmised to occur in a manner dependent on the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which was confirmed by impaired uptake on enzymatic or genetic removal of the cell surface GAGs (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 18Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, uptake of free TAT peptide was suggested to involve either different receptors or pathways because its internalization was not completely inhibited in cells lacking surface heparan sulfate (19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Brooks H. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15300-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The involvement of cell surface proteoglycans on the cellular entry of the peptide and its complexes with cargo can be affected by many factors such as net charge of the complex (18Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) as well as the structure and distribution of positive charges on the peptides (17Nakase I. Tadokoro A. Kawabata N. Takeuchi T. Katoh H. Hiramoto K. Negishi M. Nomizu M. Sugiura Y. Futaki S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and hence, it is possible that the bare peptide and the complex behave in different ways. More recently, it was proposed that transduction mediated by TAT can occur in glycan-deficient cell lines and the cell surface glycans bind TAT and only affect the efficiency of transduction (20Gump J.M. June R.K. Dowdy S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1500-1507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, although arginine-rich peptides have high affinity to sulfated GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, and heparin (21Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and could co-internalize heparan sulfate, mediating nuclear delivery (18Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), soluble sulfated GAGs inhibited cargo delivery by arginine-rich peptides (13Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 15Console S. Marty C. García-Echeverría C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). All these evidences suggest that the role of GAGs in controlling cellular entry of cationic peptides with and without cargo needs further elucidation.Under this backdrop, we have explored the role of both cell surface and soluble GAGs during gene delivery using model peptide carriers, arginine, and lysine homopeptides (each 16-mer in length). Peptides containing these two amino acids either alone or in different proportions (e.g. TAT peptide) and often with simple chemical modifications like attachment of other additional amino-acids, polyethylene glycol, functional moieties like targeting ligands, and fusogenic peptides, etc. are the most commonly studied peptide based gene delivery agents (22Martin M.E. Rice K.G. AAPS J. 2007; 9: E18-E29Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 23Mann A. Thakur G. Shukla V. Ganguli M. Drug Discov. Today. 2008; 13: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We show that the 16-mer arginine and lysine homopeptides differ in their requirement of cell surface GAGs as well as in their interaction with soluble GAGs during gene delivery. This is reflected in the alterations of complex morphology, pattern of cellular binding, internalization, and eventual gene delivery efficiency between the two peptide systems. Our results highlight the importance of peptide chemistry as a key determinant for requirement of GAGs in gene delivery."

N. meningitidis is endowed with a broad repertoire of adhesions, which are believed to support colonization and eventually invasion of mucosal epithelial cells.

The large diversity of cell adhesins and the capability of the polysaccharide capsule of N. meningitidis to mask the function of non-pilus adhesins hampers the analysis of the role of individual adhesins for host cell interaction including identification of receptors and prevention of complement lysis. Unraveling the host cell receptor for NadA would be pivotal for a better understanding of the role of NadA in meningococcal pathogenesis, particularly also with respect to the lack of a conventional mouse infection model. This prompted us to develop a novel approach for studying the interaction of neisserial adhesins with host cells and their role in colonization and/or pathogenesis in a mouse infection model by using Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:8 as heterologous gene carrier strain for meningococcal putative virulence genes. Y. enterocolitica O:8 (strain WA-314 or 8081) might be particularly suitable for this approach because these strains are pathogenic for mice, and their pathogenicity factors are well-known: (i) the virulence plasmid pYV encodes YadA, the type 3 secretion system Ysc-T3SS and a set of Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) with anti-host effector functions, and (ii) the chromosomally encoded invasin (Inv) which is recognized by α5β1 integrins, and (iii) the yersiniabactin system for ferric iron uptake, which is encoded by the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI) and is required for mouse virulence (16Cornelis G.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 17Schubert S. Rakin A. Heesemann J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 294: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By specific deletion of known virulence determinants Y. enterocolitica can be used as toolbox for studying pathogenicity factors in human serum, cell culture models, and experimentally infected mice. In this study we introduced the nadA gene into Y. enterocolitica to dissect putative virulence functions of NadA in regard of NadA host cell receptor interaction. For the first time we provide strong evidence that the Oca member NadA is directly recognized by β1 integrins and triggers an internalization signal. The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Y. enterocolitica strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) or brain heart infusion (BHI) medium at 27 °C. For induction of yadA expression, overnight cultures grown at 27 °C were diluted 1:40 in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and grown at 37 °C for 5 h (4Hoiczyk E. Roggenkamp A. Reichenbecher M. Lupas A. Heesemann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains were cultivated at 37 °C in LB medium.

The resulting DNA fragment was digested with SacI and cloned into pGPS-SS, resulting in pGPS-nadA. This plasmid was transformed into E. coli SM10 and subsequently transferred by conjugation into WA-314 ΔyadA. The transconjugants were selected for integration of pGPS-nadA into pYV-A-0 resulting in WA-314 ΔyadA:nadA construct. The pYVO8-nadA plasmid from WA-314 ΔyadA:nadA and the pYVO8-SS plasmid from WA-314 ΔyadA:SS were additionally transformed into WA-c Δinv resulting in WA-c Δinv(pYVO8-nadA) and WA-c Δinv(pYVO8-SS). For generation of nadA- or yadA-expressing Y. enterocolitica strains lacking the pYV plasmid and chromosomally encoded invasin, the pYV plasmid-cured and invasin-negative WA-c Δinv strain was used. To clone nadA and yadA genes carrying the yadA promoter and terminator region and the sequence encoding the YadA LP, nadA, and yadA were amplified by PCR from WA-314 ΔyadA:nadA or WA-314 ΔyadA:yadA, respectively, using the oligonucleotide primers A-144f (TTA ATC TAG ATA GTG CTG TTT TTT GCA TG, XbaI) and A-119r (AAT TGG ATC CAA CTG AAA CCA TGA TAA AAA GC, BamHI). After digestion DNA fragments were cloned into the plasmid pACYC184:virF (p) and transferred into WA-c Δinv resulting in WA-c Δinv(pnadA) and WA-c Δinv(pyadA). pACYC184:virF was generated by amplifying the Yersinia transcriptional activator gene virF from strain WA-314 with the oligonucleotide primers virF-151f (AAT AGC ATG CTT GCC AGT CAC CTA ATAC C, SphI) and virF-86r (AAT AGT CGA CTT GCT CAT CCC ATT GAA TC, SalI) digested with SphI and SalI and cloned into pACYC184 plasmid.TABLE 2Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionSource or Ref.pGP704Mobilizable suicide vector, R6K2 replicon, requires π proteins in trans from λpir positive strain(47Miller V.L.

The DNA fragment was cloned into pET21 vector b+ (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After transferring the plasmid into E. coli BL21 (DE3), protein expression was induced at 37 °C by addition of 1 mm IPTG at A600 ∼0.6 and subsequent incubation for additional 4–5 h. The recombinant NadA24–210 protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-conjugated chelating fast flow Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). 200–500 μg of purified recombinant NadA24–210 protein were additionally used to immunize rabbits for 91 days according to standard immunization protocol (Pineda Antikörper-Service, Berlin, Germany). Recombinant NadA24–210 protein and human α5β1 integrin (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) were labeled for flow cytometric analysis using Alexa Fluor® Succinimidyl Esters (Invitrogen). 50 μg of NadA24–210 protein or α5β1 integrin were incubated with 0.125 mg Alexa Fluor® Succinimidyl Esters in DMSO and 0.1 m bicarbonate in PBS (NadA24–210)or PBS-0.2% Triton X-100 (α5β1 integrin) for 1.5 h at 20 °C. The proteins were subsequently dialyzed with D-TubeTM Dialyzer Midi (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 4 liters of PBS or PBS-0.2% Triton X-100 overnight, followed by additional dialysis for 3 h. After exchange of dialysis buffer, protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein assay (Bio-Rad). Outer membrane preparations of Y. enterocolitica were performed as described elsewhere (18Mack D. Heesemann J. Laufs R. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 183: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and resuspended in SDS-loading buffer (10% 1 m MgCl2, 4% SDS, 10% glycerin, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 13% 750 mm Tris pH 6.8, 22% H2O, bromphenol blue). 10 μg of Yersinia outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were boiled at 100 °C for 10 min prior to separation by SDS-PAGE (11% polyacrylamide) and stained with Coomassie solution for visualization of proteins. For immunoblotting separated proteins were transferred onto PVDF-Star Transfer membrane (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany). After blocking with 5% milk powder in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween) detection of NadA was performed with rabbit anti-NadA serum (1:500) and goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) (Sigma) followed by development with ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (GE Healthcare). Far Western blotting to study the interaction of human integrin with NadA24–210 or Inv397 (O:8) (19Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was performed as described by Wu et al. (20Wu Y. Li Q. Chen X.Z. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3278-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). 1 μg of human α5β1 integrin (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) was resuspended in SDS-loading buffer without β-mercaptoethanol was separated by SDS-PAGE (11% polyacrylamide) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Immobilized integrins were subsequently renatured by varying concentrations of guanidine-HCl buffer according to the standard protocol (20Wu Y. Li Q. Chen X.Z. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3278-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS-T and incubated with 5 μg of NadA24–210 or Inv397 (O:8) protein overnight. Bound NadA24–210 was detected with anti-NadA serum (1:500) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) (Sigma), whereas bound Inv397 (O:8) was detected with anti-Invasin serum (1:5000) (Ingo Autenrieth, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Eberhard Karls University Tübingen, Germany) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) (Sigma). Immobilized β1 integrin was detected with anti-human β1 integrin specific antibody MAB1981 (LM534) (Millipore) and secondary anti-rabbit mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) (Sigma). Chang cells (Wong-Kilbourne derivate, clone 1–5c-4, human conjunctiva) were maintained in Medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Mouse embryonic cell lines GE-11-β1 (human β1 integrin-positive, epithelial-like), GE-11 (β1 integrin-knock-out, epithelial-like) (21Gimond C. van Der, Flier A. van Delft S. Brakebusch C. Kuikman I.

Fässler (MPI, Martinsried, Germany), were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 15 mm l-glutamine. β1 integrin-positive GE-11-β1 cells were cultivated under selection pressure of 220 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). For detection of NadA on the surface of Y. enterocolitica strain WA-314 Δyad:nadA, WA-314 ΔyadA, WA-c Δinv(pnadA), and WA-c Δinv(p) were grown for 6 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium, harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and diluted to A600 ∼0.1. Unfixed bacteria were coated onto glass slides and incubated with primary polyclonal anti-NadA serum (1:50) and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate (Sigma) (1:128) prior to fluorescence microscopic analysis. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica Leitz DMRD (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Surface exposition of β1 (CD29) integrins or α4, α5, α6, and αv integrins on GE-11 and GE-11-β1 cells was demonstrated by FACS analysis. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were incubated with FITC hamster anti-rat CD29 (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany) (1:200) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed twice with PBS. For detection of α4, α5, and αv integrins cells were incubated with 1 μg of mouse anti-human integrin α4 antibody (MAB16983Z), 1 μg of mouse anti-human integrin α5 antibody (MAB1956Z), or mouse anti-human integrin αv antibody (MAB1953Z) (Millipore) for 1 h at 4 °C washed twice with PBS prior to incubation with NL637-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100) (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany) for 1 h at 4 °C. Detection of surface exposed α6 integrins was performed by using 1 μg of rabbit anti-human integrin α6 antibody (MAB1378) and goat anti-rat PE conjugate (1:200) (Sigma-Aldrich). For binding studies with recombinant Alexa488-labeled NadA24–210 protein, GE-11-β1, GE-11, 2-4-8, or 2-4 cells (3 × 105 cells) were incubated with 1 μg/3 × 105 cells (5 μg/ml) Alexa488-labeled NadA24–210 protein for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by three washing steps with PBS and analysis by flow cytometry. Blocking experiments of GE-11-β1 and GE-11 cells were performed using the blocking rat anti-human β1 integrin antibody AIIB2 (1:40) and mouse anti-human integrin β1 monoclonal antibody LM534 (1:1000) (Millipore). Blocking of α integrin subunits was performed by incubation of cells with 1 μg of mouse anti-human integrin α4 antibody (MAB16983Z), 1 μg of mouse anti-human integrin α5 antibody (MAB1956Z), mouse anti-human integrin αv antibody (MAB1953Z), and 1 μg of rabbit anti-human integrin α6 antibody (MAB1378). Cells were preincubated with indicated antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS and incubated with 1 μg/3 × 105 cells (5 μg/ml) Alexa488-labeled NadA24–210 protein for 1 h at 4 °C. Competition assays were performed by incubation of GE-11-β1 and GE-11 cells with 5 μg/3 × 105 cells (20 μg/ml) of non-labeled NadA24–210 protein for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequent incubation with 5 μg/ml Alexa488-labeled NadA24–210 protein for 1 h at 4 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry. To analyze binding of Alexa488-labeled human α5β1 integrin to nadA-expressing yersiniae, 5 × 105 bacteria grown in RPMI at 37 °C for 4 h were incubated with 1 μg (5 μg/ml) of Alexa488-labeled α5β1 integrin in PBS-0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mm MnCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by three washing steps with PBS and flow cytometric analysis. Statistical significance of at least three independent experiments was determined by Student's t test. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen). For adhesion and invasion assays, 1 × 105 Chang cells per well were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates overnight and subsequently infected with WA-c Δinv(pnadA), WA-c Δinv(pyadA), or WA-c Δinv(p) with a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 100 in DMEM, and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Non-adherent bacteria were removed by washing cells three times with PBS, and cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Serial dilutions of lysed cell supernatants were plated onto LB agar containing chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) for selection of yersiniae. Quantification of intracellular bacteria was performed by the gentamicin protection assay. For this Chang cells were infected as described above, incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, non-adherent bacteria were removed, and cells were additionally incubated for 90 min in presence of 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After washing the cell monolayer, intracellular bacteria were released by cell lysis with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the lysates were plated on agar plates. Adherence assays with GE-11-β1 and GE-11 cells were also performed as described for Chang cells, with the exception that cells were infected with a moi of 50 for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Statistical significance of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates was determined by Student's t test. 1 × 105 GE-11-β1 and GE-11 cells per well were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to confluency overnight. N. meningitidis strains were grown on GC plates overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Neisseriae were scraped from plates, washed twice with PBS and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS. Afterward, a moi of 100 was adjusted in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS and adherence was performed for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The number of cell-associated bacteria was determined after washing the cell monolayer three times followed by cell lysis of cells with 1% saponin. Serial dilutions of supernatants were plated on GC agar. The number of intracellular bacteria was quantified by gentamicin protection assay (100 μg/ml gentamicin for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2). Statistical significance of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate was determined by Student's t test. To study the functional role of NadA in Y. enterocolitica under YadA promoter conditions we fused the upstream and proximal portion of yadA comprising its promoter region and leader peptide (LP) encoding region with the nadA gene sequence encoding the mature NadA protein (Fig. 1). The nadA gene was cloned into the suicide plasmid pGPS-SS and integrated into the pYV-A-0 plasmid of Y. enterocolitica strain WA-314 ΔyadA, via homologous recombination. Additionally, full-length nadA encoding the processed NadA together with the yadA promoter, LP and terminator regions was ligated into the plasmid pACY184:virF (p). The resulting plasmid pnadA was transferred into the pYV-cured invasin-negative Y. enterocolitica strain WA-c Δinv resulting in WA-c Δinv(pnadA). Expression of nadA in both strains was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Outer membrane fractions of WA-c Δinv(pnadA) incubated at 100 °C showed a high molecular mass protein at ∼120 kDa corresponding to the oligomeric form of NadA (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and a l"
https://openalex.org/W2042078404,"The structure of the unique bacterial tubulin BtubA/B from Prosthecobacter is very similar to eukaryotic αβ-tubulin but, strikingly, BtubA/B fold without eukaryotic chaperones. Our sequence comparisons indicate that BtubA and BtubB do not really correspond to either α- or β-tubulin but have mosaic sequences with intertwining features from both. Their nucleotide-binding loops are more conserved, and their more divergent sequences correspond to discrete surface zones of tubulin involved in microtubule assembly and binding to eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin, which is absent from the Prosthecobacter dejongeii draft genome. BtubA/B cooperatively assembles over a wider range of conditions than αβ-tubulin, forming pairs of protofilaments that coalesce into bundles instead of microtubules, and it lacks the ability to differentially interact with divalent cations and bind typical tubulin drugs. Assembled BtubA/B contain close to one bound GTP and GDP. Both BtubA and BtubB subunits hydrolyze GTP, leading to disassembly. The mutant BtubA/B-S144G in the tubulin signature motif GGG(T/S)G(S/T)G has strongly inhibited GTPase, but BtubA-T147G/B does not, suggesting that BtubB is a more active GTPase, like β-tubulin. BtubA/B chimera bearing the β-tubulin loops M, H1-S2, and S9-S10 in BtubB fold, assemble, and have reduced GTPase activity. However, introduction of the α-tubulin loop S9-S10 with its unique eight-residue insertion impaired folding. From the sequence analyses, its primitive assembly features, and the properties of the chimeras, we propose that BtubA/B were acquired shortly after duplication of a spontaneously folding α- and β-tubulin ancestor, possibly by horizontal gene transfer from a primitive eukaryotic cell, followed by divergent evolution."

Previous studies demonstrated impaired regulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in primary keratinocytes lacking the VDR. To identify the key effector of canonical Wnt signaling that interacts with the VDR, GST pulldown studies were performed. A novel interaction between the VDR and LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1) that is independent of β-catenin was identified. This interaction is dependent upon sequences within the N-terminal region of the VDR, a domain required for VDR-DNA interactions and normal hair cycling in mice. Mutation of specific residues within the N-terminal region of the VDR not only abrogated interactions between the VDR and LEF1 but also impaired the ability of the VDR to enhance Wnt signaling in vdr−/− primary keratinocytes. Thus, this study demonstrates a novel interaction between the VDR and LEF1 that is mediated by the DNA-binding domain of the VDR and that is required for normal canonical Wnt signaling in keratinocytes.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The skeletal changes observed in vdr−/− mice can be prevented by normalizing mineral ion homeostasis; however, alopecia persists, suggesting a unique role for the VDR in skin (4Li Y.C. Amling M. Pirro A.E. Priemel M. Meuse J. Baron R. Delling G. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alopecia is not observed in the absence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (5Dardenne O. Prud'homme J. Arabian A. Glorieux F.H. St-Arnaud R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3135-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Glorieux F.H. Arabian A. Delvin E.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2255-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in vitamin D-deficient humans; therefore, the VDR has 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-independent functions in the epidermis: the absence of receptor results in alopecia, whereas the absence of ligand does not (7Sakai Y. Kishimoto J. Demay M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Morphogenesis of the pilosebaceous unit is not impaired in the absence of the VDR; however, vdr−/− mice are unable to initiate postnatal hair cycles due to a defect intrinsic to the keratinocyte component of the hair follicle (7Sakai Y. Kishimoto J. Demay M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Skorija K. Cox M. Sisk J.M. Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Thompson C.C. Demay M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). vdr−/− mice also exhibit defects in self-renewal and lineage commitment of keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs), multipotent progenitor cells that can give rise to all lineages of the pilosebaceous unit (9Cianferotti L. Cox M. Skorija K. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9428-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although these studies demonstrate that the VDR is required for normal KSC function, the molecular mechanism by which the VDR exerts these effects is not clear. Hair follicle morphogenesis and the regulation of postnatal hair cycling are dependent upon reciprocal interactions between the epithelial component of the hair follicle, the keratinocyte, and the mesodermal component, the dermal papilla. Postnatally, the lower part of the epidermal component of the hair follicle undergoes cycles of growth (anagen) during which KSCs from the bulge area of the hair follicle give rise to the lower part of the hair follicle that produces a new hair shaft. These cells then undergo apoptosis, marking the beginning of the catagen phase of the hair cycle, resulting in approximation of the dermal papilla to the bulge area of the hair follicle. During the telogen phase, signals from the dermal papilla communicate with the KSCs in the bulge area, initiating a new hair cycle. Initiation of anagen is thought to be dependent upon activation of KSCs by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in induction of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and a proliferative response in keratinocytes that regenerate the hair follicle. Studies in genetically engineered mouse models have established the critical importance of these two pathways in the hair follicle. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of β-catenin leads to abnormal hair follicle morphogenesis and impairs hair follicle regeneration, whereas activating mutations of β-catenin result in de novo hair follicle formation and the appearance of hair follicle tumors (10Gat U. DasGupta R. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Cell. 1998; 95: 605-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Two transcriptional effectors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, TCF3 (T cell factor-3) and LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1), are also important for maintaining epidermal homeostasis. TCF3 is thought to act primarily in maintaining KSC populations in mice, whereas LEF1 is thought to direct KSC differentiation along the hair follicle lineage (11Merrill B.J. Gat U. DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). lef1 knock-out mice are born with few hair follicles and develop alopecia by 12 days of age (12van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Fariñas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Of note, keratinocyte-specific expression of a dominant-negative LEF1 transgene results in alopecia accompanied by lipid-filled dermal cysts and sebaceous tumors, a phenotype analogous to that observed in the vdr−/− mice (13Niemann C. Owens D.M. Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Watt F.M. Development. 2002; 129: 95-109PubMed Google Scholar). Shh contributes to morphogenesis of the pilosebaceous unit and is critical for anagen induction and progression (14Wang L.C. Liu Z.Y. Gambardella L. Delacour A. Shapiro R. Yang J. Sizing I.

Treatment of vdr−/− mice with a Shh agonist transiently restores hair cycling, suggesting that defective Hedgehog signaling contributes to the hair follicle defects in these mice (17Teichert A. Elalieh H. Bikle D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 225: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between the Hedgehog and canonical Wnt signaling pathways has been observed in many organ systems, including the epidermis, where activation of the canonical Wnt pathway induces Hedgehog signaling (10Gat U.

Because the unliganded VDR modulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in primary keratinocytes and co-immunoprecipitates with LEF1 and β-catenin (9Cianferotti L. Cox M. Skorija K. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9428-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), studies were undertaken to examine the molecular interactions of the VDR with effectors of this pathway and to determine the consequences of VDR ablation on the expression of shh and its downstream effector gli1 (22Jiang J. Hui C.C. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The human VDR lacking the initiator ATG codon was subcloned in frame with the GST tag into pGEX5x.1. Deletion mutants were engineered from wild-type pGEX5x.1-VDR by PCR. DNA sequencing was performed to ensure the fidelity of replication. 3Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. BL21 bacteria (GE Healthcare) were transformed with GST-VDR fusion genes. Large-scale cultures were grown and induced according to the manufacturer's instructions. After induction of protein expression, bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 20 min and frozen at −80 °C. Pellets were thawed on ice and lysed in 5 ml of bacterial lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 μg/ml RNase, 10 μg/ml DNase, and one Roche Complete mini protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min and used immediately or stored at −80 °C. For GST pulldown assays, equimolar amounts of GST-VDR lysates were bound to 40 μl of 50% GST-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 400 μl of bacterial binding buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with bacterial binding buffer at 4 °C. Equimolar amounts of COS-7 lysates expressing LEF1, β-catenin, or TCF3 were added in a final volume of 400 μl of COS binding buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, and 50 mm KCl) to GST-VDR-bound beads for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with COS binding buffer at 4 °C. Protein complexes were eluted with 40 μl of GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm reduced glutathione (pH 8.0)) for 15 min at room temperature. Input (10%) and eluted (25%) fractions were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then Western-blotted to detect proteins. The following antibodies were used to detect the VDR: 9A-7 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and H-81, N-20, and C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). An anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare) was used to detect short deletion mutants. HA-tagged LEF1 was detected using anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), whereas endogenous LEF1 was detected using anti-LEF1 antibody C12A5 (Cell Signaling Technology). TCF3 was detected using anti-TCF3 antibody M-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Endogenous and constitutively active β-catenin were detected using mouse anti-β-catenin antibody (BD Biosciences). Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-α was detected using anti-RXRα antibody F-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SRC3 (steroid receptor coactivator-3) was detected using anti-SRC3 antibody 5E11 (Cell Signaling Technology). VDR-interacting protein (DRIP)/Mediator was detected using anti-TRAP80 antibody ab70125 (Abcam). COS-7 cells were maintained DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For generation of cell lysates expressing pcDNA3.1-LEF1, pcDNA3.1-β-catenin, and pcDNA3.1-TCF3, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested after 48 h in cell lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, and Roche Complete mini protease inhibitor tablets). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and used immediately or stored at −80 °C. For reporter assays, cells were plated at a density of 150,000 cells/12-well plate overnight and then transfected as described above. Cells were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was determined using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as directed by the manufacturer using a PerkinElmer EnVision 2104 multilabel reader. Transfection efficiency was normalized by correcting firefly luciferase for cotransfected Renilla luciferase activity in each sample. Primary keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal vdr−/− mice as described previously (8Skorija K. Cox M. Sisk J.M. Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Thompson C.C. Demay M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, skin was harvested from neonatal mice (postnatal days 0–4) and digested overnight at 4 °C in 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen). The epidermis was separated from the dermis, minced, and stirred in modified minimal essential medium for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Cell suspensions were strained and plated onto collagen-coated dishes. Keratinocytes were maintained in modified minimal essential medium containing 0.1% glucose, 0.001% phenol red, and 0.045 mm CaCl2 supplemented with 4% Chelex-treated FBS, antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 10 ng/ml EGF (BD Biosciences). Keratinocyte differentiation was induced by culturing cells in medium supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 for 7 days. Keratinocytes were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Luciferase assays were performed as described above. Cells were rinsed with PBS and then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 50% protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-VDR antibody 9A-7 or control antibody CD49f (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, after which protein complexes were dissociated by boiling for 10 min in 1× reducing SDS loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western-blotted to detect proteins. Total RNA was extracted from mouse skin and cultured keratinocytes using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Primers were designed to span introns, and the absence of contaminating DNA was confirmed in all samples. The levels of mRNA encoding each gene of interest were normalized for actin mRNA in the same sample using the formula of Livak and Schmittgen (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin samples were isolated using a ChIP kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin samples were incubated with 10 μg of anti-VDR antibody C-20. Real-time PCR was performed with primers flanking the vitamin D response element (VDRE) consensus sequences (24Demay M.B. Kiernan M.S. DeLuca H.F. Kronenberg H.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 557-562PubMed Google Scholar) in regulatory regions of the shh and gli1 genes. Primer sets used for amplifying mouse VDR regions of interest included the following: shh, ATGCTCCTCATTTCTCCA (forward) and AGTCATACGTGCATGGAGT (reverse); and gli1, AGACAGAAGCAAGGGCAT (forward) and GGAGGTCATAGAGTAAGGTCA (reverse). Primers amplifying coding region sequences were used to normalize for DNA content and to calculate the relative enrichment of the regulatory to coding region sequences using the formula of Livak and Schmittgen (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar) in a method identical to that used to normalize the levels of RNA of interest to those of actin. -Fold enrichment reflects the ratio of regulatory to coding region sequences in the immunoprecipitated versus input samples. Standard error was determined for each sample. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Immunoprecipitation of LEF1 results in coprecipitation of the VDR and β-catenin (9Cianferotti L. Cox M. Skorija K. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9428-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because LEF1 and β-catenin interact directly and β-catenin has been shown to interact with the VDR in the presence of ligand (25Shah S. Islam M.N. Dakshanamurthy S. Rizvi I. Rao M. Herrell R. Zinser G. Valrance M. Aranda A. Moras D. Norman A. Welsh J. Byers S.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), studies were performed to determine whether the unliganded VDR interacts with LEF1, β-catenin, or both using GST pulldown assays. An N-terminal GST fusion of the VDR was expressed in bacteria. Pulldown experiments were performed in the absence of ligand using COS-7 cell extracts expressing HA-LEF1 and constitutively active or endogenous β-catenin (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Although LEF1 coeluted with GST-VDR, β-catenin did not, demonstrating that the VDR interacts with LEF1 in the absence of ligand, independently of β-catenin. GST pulldown assays were also performed with COS-7 cell lysates expressing TCF3 (Fig. 1B). No interaction was detected between GST-VDR and TCF3. GST pulldown experiments performed using GST alone or HA-Gαs demonstrated that HA-Gαs did not coelute with GST-VDR and that HA-LEF1 did not coelute with GST alone (data not shown). Therefore, the interaction between LEF1 and the VDR is not dependent upon the GST or HA tag. The GST pulldown studies demonstrated an interaction between the bacterially expressed VDR and LEF1. To determine whether the endogenous VDR and LEF1 interact, the VDR was immunoprecipitated from wild-type primary keratinocytes. Although basal levels of LEF1 were very low, it was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the VDR in both proliferating and differentiating keratinocytes. In contrast, β-catenin was well expressed but did not co-immunoprecipitate with the VDR in these assays. RXRα, which is known to heterodimerize with the VDR, although it is expressed only at very low levels, also co-immunoprecipitated with the VDR in both proliferating and differentiating keratinocytes (Fig. 2). The VDR has been shown to interact in a ligand-dependent fashion with DRIP/Mediator and SRC2 and SRC3 complexes during keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, respectively (26Oda Y. Sihlbom C. Chalkley R.J. Huang L. Rachez C. Chang C.P. Burlingame A.L. Freedman L.P. Bikle D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Oda Y. Sihlbom C. Chalkley R.J. Huang L. Rachez C. Chang C.P. Burlingame A.L. Freedman L.P. Bikle D.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89–90: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Oda Y.

Oda Y. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 121: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interactions between the VDR and these coactivators were not detected presumably because the keratinocytes were cultured in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2). The VDR is a 427-amino acid protein that contains multiple functional domains preserved among nuclear receptors (Fig. 3A). Two short activation function domains, AF1 and AF2, important for nuclear co-modulator recruitment are found at the N and C termini of the VDR, respectively. The ligand-binding domain is required for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binding. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) contains two zinc fingers that mediate VDR-DNA interactions. Between the DBD and the ligand-binding domain lies a flexible hinge region required for RXR heterodimerization. To identify the region of the VDR responsible for mediating interactions with LEF1, deletion mutants of the VDR were engineered as GST fusions. Pulldown experiments were performed to evaluate LEF1 binding. Although deletion of either the AF1 or AF2 domain did not affect VDR-LEF1 interactions, deletion of the N-terminal sequences containing both the AF1 domain and the DBD abrogated these interactions (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the sequences containing the AF1 domain and the DBD are sufficient for VDR-LEF1 interaction, a deletion mutant of the VDR expressing only these domains was engineered (Fig. 3B). Pulldown experiments demonstrated that this GST-AF1DBD-VDR interacted with LEF1. Mice lacking the first zinc finger of the VDR express a truncated protein that employs a surrogate ATG codon located between the two zinc fingers of the VDR (M52). Expression of this truncated VDR in mice results in rickets with alopecia, a phenotype identical to mice with total absence of the VDR (30Erben R.G. Soegiarto D.W. Weber K. Zeitz U. Lieberherr M. Gniadecki R. Möller G. Adamski J. Balling R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To determine whether the M52-VDR interacts with LEF1, it was engineered as an N-terminal GST fusion. Pulldown studies demonstrated that GST-M52-VDR did not interact with LEF1 (Fig. 3B), confirming that an intact DBD is required for interaction with LEF1. Because deletion of the AF1 domain in the context of full-length GST-VDR did not impair LEF1 interactions, a GST-DBD fusion was engineered. Pulldown studies demonstrated that the sequences in the DBD are sufficient to mediate interactions with LEF1. Thus, sequences within the DBD of the VDR are both necessary and sufficient for mediating interactions with LEF1. Because the DBD is both necessary and sufficient for VDR interactions with LEF1, C-terminal truncations of the DBD were engineered as N-terminal GST fusions to identify the minimal domain of the VDR necessary for interaction with LEF1 (Table 1). Although deletion of amino acids 58–114 did not affect VDR-LEF1 interactions, further C-terminal truncations abrogated these interactions. GST-ΔAF1Zn1-VDR, consisting of residues 21–57, is the shortest deletion mutant that retained the ability to interact with LEF1, demonstrating that residues in the first zinc finger of the VDR are required for interactions with LEF1.TABLE 1The region of the VDR required for interaction with LEF1 resides within the first zinc finger. GST-VDR truncation mutants bound to glutathione-Sepharose were tested for their ability to interact with LEF1. The results of these studies are summarized below. The name, domain structure, amino acid range, and ability to interact with LEF1 are indicated for each mutant. The GST tag is shown in the white boxes, the AF1 domain in the medium grey boxes, and the two zinc fingers of the DBD in light grey boxes. The asterisks denote Met-52, the alternative VDR start site in a line of vdr−/− mice with alopecia (30Erben R.G. Soegiarto D.W. Weber K. Zeitz U. Lieberherr M. Gniadecki R. Möller G. Adamski J. Balling R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Sequences in the DBD of nuclear receptor superfamily members are highly conserved. Residues that are divergent mediate interactions with specific cofactors and DNA response elements. Substitution of residues from loops IA and IB of the first zinc finger of the VDR with those of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is permissive for DNA binding and activation of VDREs, although to a lesser degree than the wild-type VDR (31Hsieh J.C. Whitfield G.K. Oza A.K. Dang H.T. Price J.N. Galligan M.A. Jurutka P.W. Thompson P.D. Haussler C.A. Haussler M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16347-16358Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the LEF1 interaction domain of the VDR resides within this region, these point mutations were engineered as N-terminal GST fusions lacking the AF1 domain. Pulldown studies demonstrated that both mutant VDRs retained the ability to interact with LEF1 (Fig. 4A). Two additional mutants were engineered by substituting non-conserved residues from thyroid receptor-β (TRβ) and the GR. GST pulldown studies demonstrated that the GST-ΔAF1GRZn1-VDR mutant retained the ability to interact with LEF1, whereas the GST-ΔAF1TRβZn1-VDR mutant did not (Fig. 4B). The VDR is required for synergistic activation of a Wnt reporter gene by β-catenin and LEF1 in primary keratinocytes (9Cianferotti L. Cox M. Skorija K. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9428-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine whether the VDR modulates canonical Wnt signaling in keratinocytes through an interaction with LEF1, full-length GST-TRβ-VDR was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector and tested for its ability to restore canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of the VDR. Wnt reporter assays (TOPflash) were performed in primary keratinocytes isolated from vdr−/− mice. Although the wild-type VDR enhanced TOPflash expression by >2-fold in the presence of β-catenin and LEF1 (p < 0.005), the TRβ-VDR was unable to enhance reporter gene expression relative to the empty vector pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the VDR-LEF1 interaction is required for the actions of the VDR on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. To determine whether the TRβ-VDR is able to activate ligand-dependent VDR transactivation, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with a VDRE-luciferase reporter and the wild-type or TRβ-VDR. In the presence of ligand, the wild-type VDR significantly enhanced VDRE reporter activity compared with untreated cells (p < 0.005 for 10−9 m and p < 0.05 for 10−8 m); however, the TRβ-VDR did not. These data suggest that the mutated residues are required not only for canonical Wnt signaling but also for transactivation in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (Fig. 5B). To determine whether canonical Wnt target genes are misregulated in the epidermis of vdr−/− mice, quantitative real-time PCR was performed on skin isolated from wild-type or vdr−/− mice at 28 days of age, the beginning of the first postnatal anagen in mice. These analyses demonstrated that expression of c-myc, a classical canonical Wnt target gene, was suppressed in the absence of the VDR. Furthermore, the expression of shh and gli1, canonical Wnt target genes critical for hair follicle response to canonical Wnt signaling during anagen, was also significantly down-regulated in vdr−/− skin compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 6A). Additional quantitative real-time PCR studies were performed in primary keratinocytes isolated from neonatal vdr−/− and wild-type mice. Although shh mRNA was not detectable in these cells, significant down-regulation of c-myc and gli1 was detected in vdr−/− keratinocytes compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 6B). To determine whether the TRβ-VDR is able to rescue the impaired activation of canonical Wnt target genes, vdr−/− keratinocytes were transfected with the wild-type VDR or TRβ-VDR. Although the wild-type VDR was able to enhance expression of c-myc and gli1, the TRβ-VDR was not (Fig. 6C). These data demonstrate that the expression of canonical Wnt target genes in keratinocytes is modulated by the VDR. Similarly, transfection of vdr−/− keratinocytes with the wild-type VDR, but not with the TRβ-VDR, enhanced expression of cyclin D1 and keratin 10, genes involved in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, respectively (Fig. 6D). Activation of Shh signaling transiently rescues the hair follicle phenotype in vdr−/− mice (17Teichert A. Elalieh H. Bikle D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 225: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the regulatory regions of shh and gli1 were reported to have multip"

Yeast Doa10 is a polytopic membrane ubiquitin ligase (E3) that along with its cognate ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), Ubc7 and the C-terminally membrane-anchored Ubc6, makes a major contribution to ER-associated degradation. Ubc6 is also a substrate of Doa10. One highly conserved Doa10 element, the uncharacterized ∼130-residue TEB4-Doa10 domain, includes three transmembrane helices (TMs). We find that the first of these, TM5, includes an absolutely conserved ΦPΦXXG motif that is required for Doa10 function, as well as highly conserved negatively charged glutamate and aspartate residues. The conservative exchange of the TM5 glutamate to aspartate (doa10-E633D) results in complete stabilization of Ubc6 but has little if any effect on other substrates. Unexpectedly, mutating the glutamate to glutamine (doa10-E633Q) specifically accelerates Ubc6 degradation by ∼5-fold. Other substrates are weakly stabilized in doa10-E633Q cells, consistent with reduced Ubc6 levels. Notably, catalytically inactive ubc6-C87A is degraded in doa10-E633Q but not wild-type cells, but an active version of Ubc6 is required in trans. Fusion of the Ubc6 TM to a soluble protein yields a protein that is degraded in a doa10-E633Q-dependent manner, whereas fusion of the C-terminal TM from an unrelated protein does not. These results suggest that the TEB4-Doa10 domain regulates Doa10 association with the Ubc6 membrane anchor, thereby controlling the degradation rate of the E2.

Most secreted and integral membrane proteins in eukaryotes are initially translocated from the cytoplasm, usually co-translationally, across the ER 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumERADendoplasmic reticulum-associated degradationE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin-protein ligaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininNEnuclear envelopePgk13-phosphoglycerate kinaseTD domainTEB4-Doa10 domainTMtransmembrane helix. membrane (1Blobel G.

The ER contains specialized membrane translocation and protein modification machineries that execute these complex protein localization and processing reactions. These processes are not 100% accurate, so ER quality control mechanisms have evolved to identify misfolded, unassembled, or aberrantly modified proteins and either repair the errors or eliminate the abnormal proteins. The latter mechanisms fall under the category of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (reviewed in Refs. 3Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Substrate modification by polyubiquitin appears to be necessary for both efficient retrotranslocation and degradation in most cases (3Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). A series of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by three types of enzymes promote ubiquitin conjugation to substrates as follows: E1 ubiquitin-activating, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating, and E3 ubiquitin-ligating enzymes. The E3s are the primary factors determining substrate specificity, and they also stimulate transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate. For ERAD, ubiquitin-substrate conjugation occurs at the cytoplasmic surface of the ER membrane (3Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Nature. 2009; 458: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and proteins are retrotranslocated through an as-yet unidentified conduit(s) across the membrane with the aid of different AAA+ ATPase-containing complexes, specifically the proteasome regulatory particle and/or the Cdc48/p97 homohexamer (9Tsai B.

Two integral membrane E3 ligases in the ER of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hrd1/Der3 and Doa10, account for most ER-associated proteasomal proteolysis (3Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 4Hirsch C. Gauss R. Horn S.C. Neuber O. Sommer T. Nature. 2009; 458: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Doa10 has a remarkably broad substrate range, being capable of recognizing both soluble nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates in addition to ER and nuclear envelope (NE) integral membrane proteins (11Ravid T. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12Deng M. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 2006; 443: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Doa10 orthologs are apparent in the great majority of fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes; among them is the human protein TEB4 (MARCH6/KIAA0597) (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 14Bartee E. Mansouri M. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Gouveia K. Früh K. J.

J. 2005; 388: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These proteins all contain a variant zinc-coordinating RING motif at their N termini called a RING-CH domain (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 16Dodd R.B. Allen M.D. Brown S.E. Sanderson C.M. Duncan L.M. Lehner P.J. Bycroft M. Read R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53840-53847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Doa10 is the only clear example of a RING-CH protein in S. cerevisiae, but the human genome encodes at least 11 different ones, most of which are also integral membrane proteins (the membrane-associated RING-CH or MARCH proteins) (14Bartee E. Mansouri M. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Gouveia K. Früh K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Kreft S.G. Wang L. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4646-4653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to the more broadly distributed proteins with RING-CH motifs, all of the presumptive Doa10 orthologs are predicted to have at least 10 transmembrane helices (TMs), and all contain a conserved ∼130-residue internal element known as the TEB4-Doa10 (TD) domain (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For Doa10, the E2 requirements are unusual, with two distinct enzymes, Ubc6 and Ubc7, both required for efficient ubiquitylation of substrates (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 18Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38369-38378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Ubc6 is bound to the ER membrane via a C-terminal transmembrane anchor (20Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), whereas the soluble Ubc7 enzyme localizes to the ER by binding the transmembrane Cue1 receptor protein, which also allosterically activates the E2 (21Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22Bazirgan O.A. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite knowledge of the E2s and other cofactors implicated in Doa10-mediated ubiquitylation, our understanding of the activities of the Doa10 ubiquitylation complex and the interplay between its constituents is currently very limited. It is not known why Doa10 requires two separate E2s, nor is it understood in any detail how these E2s, or other associated factors such as the Cdc48 complex, interact with Doa10. Unlike Ubc7, which is a stable protein as long as it is bound to Cue1 (24Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Ubc6 is constitutively turned over via the Doa10 pathway with a half-life of ∼55 min (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 25Walter J. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The physiological rationale behind this turnover is unclear. Doa10 was also proposed to have a direct role in substrate passage through the membrane bilayer to the cytosol (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), but this remains unproven. Here, we describe a surprising link between an intramembrane charged residue in the first TM of the TD domain of Doa10 and the behavior of the Ubc6 E2, which has uncovered at least one function of the TD domain. When the highly conserved TM5 glutamate residue, Glu-633, was mutated to an aspartate (E633D), Ubc6 was strongly stabilized, but degradation of other Doa10 substrates was not detectably impaired. Conversely, mutation of Glu-633 to glutamine (E633Q) dramatically enhanced Ubc6 turnover with a concomitant weak impairment in the degradation of other substrates. This rapid Ubc6 degradation required Doa10 RING-CH function as well as the Ubc7 E2, which is also true of the normal, much slower degradation of Ubc6 in wild-type (WT) DOA10 cells. Most interestingly, accelerated Ubc6 degradation also depended on the catalytic activity of Ubc6 itself, but this activity could be provided by a trans copy of the E2, unlike in WT cells. Thus, Ubc6 is both an integral component of the Doa10 ubiquitylation machinery and a substrate of this same machinery. Doa10 may either form a ubiquitylation complex containing both Ubc7 and (multiple subunits of) Ubc6, or it may interact sequentially with the E2s. We speculate that Doa10 has multiple binding sites for Ubc6, with one site (the “E2 site”) for ubiquitin transfer from the ubiquitin-Ubc6 thioester to a substrate and a nearby site (the “substrate site”) where substrates normally bind and become polyubiquitylated. In this model, Ubc6 access to the substrate site is normally inhibited by structural features of the TD domain that depend on Glu-633 in TM5; the barrier is reduced in the doa10-E633Q protein, leading to abnormally rapid Ubc6 degradation. The charged residue(s) in the TMs of the TD domain could stabilize the architecture of the Ubc6-binding site(s) of Doa10 and/or allosterically connect the two different binding sites. Yeast-rich (YPD) and minimal (SD) media were prepared as described previously, and standard methods were used for genetic manipulation of yeast (26Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Vol. 194. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar). Standard techniques were used for recombinant DNA work in Escherichia coli. Yeast strains and cultures were grown at 30 °C. For spot growth assays, cells were grown in minimal medium to log phase, serially diluted (5-fold steps) in water, and spotted onto different media. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–4 days. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. The full-length DOA10 gene is not stably maintained in E. coli. Therefore, for mutagenesis of DOA10, yeast strains with a mutated chromosomal copy of DOA10 were generated using the two-step delitto perfetto method (27Storici F. Lewis L.K. Resnick M.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the first step, a counterselectable reporter cassette (CORE cassette) containing KlURA3 and kanMX6 cassettes was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pCORE (27Storici F. Lewis L.K. Resnick M.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and integrated in the DOA10 locus after Doa10 ORF nucleotide 115 (for generation of the doa10-C39S allele) or 1914 (for generation of mutations in TM5). In the second step, the mutant doa10 allele was generated by replacing the CORE cassette by homologous recombination with an oligonucleotide duplex encoding the desired Doa10 mutation flanked with ∼45 bp of homologous sequence at both ends. Correct recombination to generate the desired doa10 allele was in each case verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids encoding fusions of the Deg1 degron-coding sequence to the URA3 reporter have been described previously (11Ravid T. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 18Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The p414MET25-Deg1-Vma12-KanMX plasmid was made by recombination in yeast between the PCR-amplified KanMX6 ORF from pFA6a-KanMX6 (28Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar) and gapped p414MET25-Deg1-Vma12-PrA (11Ravid T. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid for internally HA-tagged Ubc6 (pRS416-Ubc6HA) was a gift from T. Sommer (Max-Delbrück-Center, Berlin) and was described previously (25Walter J. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRS416-ubc6(C87A)HA was generated using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) with pRS416-Ubc6HA as template. Plasmid p414MET25-URA3-HA-Ubc6TM was generated in two steps. First, the URA3 ORF was PCR-amplified from pRS426 (29Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar), adding SpeI and PstI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Second, following digestion with SpeI and PstI, the URA3 insert was cloned into the same sites in p414MET25 (30Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) to yield p414MET25-URA3. The HA-Ubc6TM insert was generated by PCR amplification of the coding sequence for Ubc6TM (Ubc6 residues 213–250, which includes the membrane anchor plus 18 upstream residues) and adding a flanking sequence encoding HA and a PstI site at the 5′ end and a SalI site at the 3′ end. The HA-Ubc6TM insert was cloned into p414MET25-URA3 using the PstI and SalI sites to yield p414MET25-URA3-HA-Ubc6TM. To generate plasmid p414MET25-URA3-HA-Prm3TM, the sequence encoding Prm3 residues 92–133 was PCR-amplified from MHY500 genomic DNA, adding flanking BamHI and XhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The BamHI/XhoI-digested PRM3 PCR fragment was ligated to BamHI/SalI-cut p414MET5-URA3-HA-Ubc6TM to yield p414MET25-URA3-HA-Prm3TM. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (31Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 A600 eq of logarithmically growing cells were lysed in β-mercaptoethanol/NaOH, and proteins were precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was resuspended in SDS gel-loading buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection was carried out with appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive species were visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used: anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Covance); anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Covance); anti-Pgk1 mouse monoclonal antibody 22C5 (Molecular Probes); anti-Doa10 antiserum from rabbit raised against a His6-tagged N-terminal 128-residue fragment of Doa10 (17Kreft S.G. Wang L. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4646-4653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-Ubc6 antiserum (gift from T. Sommer, Max-Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany). Logarithmically growing yeast cells (25 A600 eq) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitors PMSF (625 μm) and aprotinin (5 μg/ml)). All steps were done at 4 °C except where indicated. Following addition of 1 volume of glass beads, cells were disrupted by four cycles of vortexing (30-s pulse/30 s on ice). Lysates were diluted with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer and cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 370 × g. The crude microsomal fraction was collected by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 16,000 × g for 10 min and was resuspended in 0.5 ml of resuspension buffer (RB) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaAc, 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors (625 μm PMSF and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin; 10 μg/ml pepstatin; and 2 μg/ml antipain)). Membranes were solubilized by addition of digitonin to 1% with a 10-min incubation on ice. The supernatant after centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min) was diluted 1:1 with RB. An aliquot (5% of total) of the diluted supernatant was removed and served as input for immunoblot. Rabbit anti-Doa10 serum or mouse 9E10 anti-Myc antibody was added to the remaining supernatant and incubated overnight with constant agitation. Subsequently, protein A-Sepharose beads (for anti-Doa10) or protein G-Sepharose beads (for anti-Myc) equilibrated in RB were added and incubated for 2 h with gentle agitation. Beads were washed four times with 0.5 ml of RB without protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were eluted by addition of 50 μl of 2× sample buffer and incubation for 15 min at 37 °C before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cycloheximide-chase/Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (17Kreft S.G. Wang L. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4646-4653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, cycloheximide (0.25 mg/ml) was added to logarithmically growing yeast cultures, and cell aliquots were removed at the indicated times after addition. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in cold STOP mix (0.5× SD, 10 mm NaN3), and stored on ice until all time points had been collected. Lysates were generated, and proteins were visualized by immunoblotting. Protein degradation rates were measured using a G:Box system (Syngene). Values for each time point were normalized using an anti-Pgk1 loading control. Pulse-chase analysis was carried out as described previously (18Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Deg1-βgal was immunoprecipitated with an anti-α2 antiserum (32Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Deg1-βgal was visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software, and half-lives were calculated from exponential curve fits using DeltaGraph 5. For localization of GFP fusion proteins, cells (MHY3612, Doa10-GFP; MHY3693, doa10-E633Q-GFP) were grown to mid-log phase, washed twice, and resuspended in sterile water; 2.5 μl were spotted on a slide and sealed under a coverslip. GFP was excited using a 470 nm (40-nm bandwidth) bandpass filter and visualized with a 525 nm (50-nm bandwidth) bandpass filter on a Axioplan epi-fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 100× plan-apochromat 1.4 NA objective lens. Pictures were taken on a Zeiss Axiocam camera using a Uniblitz shutter driver (model VMM-D1; Vincent Assocs., Rochester, NY) and the program Open Lab 3.1.5 (Improvision, Lexington, MA). With the availability of complete genome sequences from multiple eukaryotes, we could explore both the broad distribution of Doa10 orthologs throughout the Eukarya and the extent of conservation among these proteins. All Doa10 orthologs were characterized by an N-terminal RING-CH domain, an internal conserved segment of ∼130 residues called the TD domain, and at least 10 predicted TMs (Fig. 1A) (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The TD domain includes three TMs (17Kreft S.G. Wang L. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4646-4653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Sequences that fit the above criteria for a Doa10 ortholog are found in species from all four of the five currently recognized eukaryotic “supergroups” for which fully sequenced genomes are available (Plantae, Excavates, Unikonts, and Chromalveolates). From this, it can be inferred that a Doa10-like protein was already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (33Koonin E.V. Cell. 2010; 140: 606-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Doa10 has been lost in certain lineages within the different supergroups. For instance, among the Plantae, a Doa10 ortholog was not detected in three fully sequenced green alga genomes, but it is present in land plants and red algae (Cyanidioschizon merolae) (Fig. 1B). In species that lack Doa10, its functions in ERAD and nuclear protein degradation might be assumed by other ubiquitin ligases, such as HRD1 (34Arteaga M.F. Wang L. Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11178-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As expected, the most conserved regions in all the identified Doa10 orthologs were the RING-CH and TD domains (Fig. 1B). A striking feature of the TD alignment is the presence in TM5 (S. cerevisiae TM numbering) of two highly conserved charged residues as well as strictly conserved proline and glycine residues. In addition, TM6 has a fully conserved glycine and TM7 a strictly conserved serine; the latter residue has been associated with kinking of transmembrane helices from analysis of known membrane protein structures (35Hall S.E.

In TM5, the absolutely conserved proline and glycine residues are part of a ΦPΦXXG motif (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue). Such a motif has not been described previously but might help create a specific bend or interruption in the TM5 helix (see “Discussion”). Charged and polar residues are only infrequently encountered in the membrane interior (36Ulmschneider M.B. Sansom M.S. Di Nola A. Proteins. 2005; 59: 252-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and often form favorable contacts with residues of other proteins or other TMs of the same protein within the lipid bilayer (37Moore D.T. Berger B.W. DeGrado W.F. Structure. 2008; 16: 991-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). There are two highly conserved negatively charged residues in TM5. One is an aspartate (yeast Asp-646) that is broadly conserved, and the other is a glutamate (yeast Glu-633) that is absolutely conserved in the Unikonts and Plantae (Fig. 1B, first 10 species in alignment). By contrast, a lysine is found instead of glutamate at this position in all the fully sequenced stramenopiles (Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Thalassiosira pseudonana, Ectocarpus siliculosus, and Phytophthora infestans), which represent a major branch within the Chromalveolates. In land plants, a second Doa10-related protein can be identified, and it also has a lysine at this position, unlike its paralog, which has a glutamate (Fig. 1B, At). The charged side chains at these positions could mediate specific interactions with substrates or cofactors or could be important for achieving a specific structure of Doa10 within the membrane (or both). We focused our mutagenesis studies on TM5 because of its highly unusual sequence. First we asked whether the ΦPΦXXG motif in TM5 was indeed important for Doa10 function. To this end, we replaced the proline and glycine residues individually or together with either alanine or valine. Levels of the doa10-P638A and the P638A/G642A proteins expressed from the natural chromosomal locus were comparable with that of WT Doa10, whereas the levels of G642A and G642V were significantly reduced (to ∼40% and <5% of WT levels) (Fig. 2A). We tested the activity of the ΦPΦXXG motif mutants toward Ubc6, one of two cognate E2 enzymes of Doa10 (Fig. 2B). The C-terminally membrane-anchored Ubc6 protein is normally ubiquitylated and degraded relatively slowly by a mechanism that depends on Doa10, Ubc7, as well as the active site of Ubc6 itself (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 25Walter J. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, we found that a functional HA-tagged version of Ubc6 (20Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) had a half-life of ∼50–60 min in wild-type (WT) cells (Fig. 2B) and was strongly stabilized in cells lacking Doa10 (t½ >5 h). Ubc6 was only slightly stabilized in doa10-G642A-expressing cells (t½ = 73 min) but was significantly more stable in the other doa10 ΦPΦXXG mutant cells. We also evaluated the activity of each mutant toward the model Doa10 substrate Deg1-Ura3–3HA using a degradation-sensitive growth assay (Fig. 2C). The Deg1 degradation signal is within the first 67 residues of the yeast MATα2 transcriptional repressor and is recognized by the Doa10 pathway (13Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 18Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M.

FGF2 exerts its biological function by binding and dimerizing its receptor (FGFR), which activates signal transduction cascades. Effective binding of FGF2 to its receptor requires the presence of heparan sulfate (HS), a linear polysaccharide with N-sulfated domains (NS) localized at the cell surface and extracellular matrix. HS acts as a platform facilitating the formation of a functional FGF-FGFR-HS ternary complex. Crystal structures of the signaling ternary complex revealed two conflicting architectures. In the asymmetrical model, two FGFs and two FGFRs bind a single HS chain. In contrast, the symmetrical model postulates that one FGF and one FGFR bind to the free end of the HS chain and dimerization require these ends to join, bringing the two half-complexes together. In this study, we screened a hexasaccharide HS library for compositions that are able to bind FGF2. The library was composed primarily of NS domains internal to the HS chain with minor presence of non-reducing end (NRE) NS. The binders were categorized into low versus high affinity binders. The low affinity fraction contained primarily hexasaccharides with low degree of sulfation that were internal to the HS chains. In contrast, the high affinity bound fraction was enriched in NRE oligosaccharides that were considerably more sulfated and had the ability to promote FGFR-mediated cell proliferation. The results suggest a role of the NRE of HS in FGF2 signaling and favor the formation of the symmetrical architecture on short NS domains.

https://openalex.org/W1989417490,"In response to a shortage of intracellular energy, mammalian cells reduce energy consumption and induce cell cycle arrest, both of which contribute to cell survival. Here we report that a novel nucleolar pathway involving the energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex (eNoSC) and Myb-binding protein 1a (MYBBP1A) is implicated in these processes. Namely, in response to glucose starvation, eNoSC suppresses rRNA transcription, which results in a reduction in nucleolar RNA content. As a consequence, MYBBP1A, which is anchored to the nucleolus via RNA, translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. The translocated MYBBP1A induces acetylation and accumulation of p53 by enhancing the interaction between p300 and p53, which eventually leads to the cell cycle arrest (or apoptosis). Taken together, our results indicate that the nucleolus works as a sensor that transduces the intracellular energy status into the cell cycle machinery."

Using an ONL-coupled protein as the immunogen, we raised the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9K3 directed to the ONL and conclusively demonstrated that the ONL was produced during the oxidative modification of a low density lipoprotein (LDL) in vitro. In addition, we observed that the ONL was present in atherosclerotic lesions, in which an intense immunoreactivity was mainly localized in the vascular endothelial cells and macrophage- and vascular smooth muscle cell-derived foam cells. Using liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we also established a highly sensitive method for quantification of the ONL and confirmed that the ONL was indeed formed during the lipid peroxidation-mediated modification of protein in vitro and in vivo. To evaluate the biological implications for ONL formation, we examined the recognition of ONL by the scavenger receptor lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1). Using CHO cells stably expressing LOX-1, we evaluated the ability of ONL to compete with the acetylated LDL and found that both the ONE-modified and ONL-coupled proteins inhibited the binding and uptake of the modified LDL. In addition, we demonstrated that the ONL-coupled protein was incorporated into differentiated THP-1 cells via LOX-1. Finally, we examined the effect of ONL on the expression of the inflammation-associated gene in THP-1 and observed that the ONL-coupled proteins significantly induced the expression of atherogenesis-related genes, such as the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, in a LOX-1-dependent manner.

Monocyte-derived macrophages play a prominent role in the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque, particularly after their transformation into foam cells. When activated by inflammatory stimuli, the macrophages synthesize and secrete various mediators, including cytokines, prothrombotic substances, and eicosanoids, which cause the clinical manifestations and acute clinical complications of atherosclerosis. Various lines of evidence have indicated that an important part of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is the modification of plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Steinberg D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 369: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A large number of pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic properties have been ascribed to the oxidatively modified LDL (OxLDL) 2The abbreviations used are: OxLDL, oxidatively modified LDL; AcLDL, acetylated low density lipoprotein; SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; Bt-HSA, biotinylated human serum albumin; HSA, human serum albumin; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; OHE, 4-oxo-2-hexenal; ONE, 4-oxo-2-nonenal; ONL, Nϵ-(4-oxononanoyl)lysine; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; SR, scavenger receptor; DiD, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3, 3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MRM, multiple reaction monitoring; DPI, diphenyliodonium. and their components (3Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar). In particular, there is considerable evidence to support the role of oxidized fatty acids originating from the OxLDL as important signaling molecules in the context of the atherosclerotic lesion. Podrez et al. (4Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the OxLDL components, such as oxidized phosphatidylcholines, serve as endogenous ligands for the scavenger receptor, CD36, facilitating macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation. Nagy et al. (5Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) have shown that the oxidized fatty acids, such as the 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, regulate the macrophage gene expression through the ligand activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. In addition, the lipid peroxidation-derived short chain aldehydes, such as acrolein and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, are considered important mediators of cell damage because of their ability to covalently modify biomolecules, which can disrupt important cellular functions and can cause mutations (6Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). These reactive aldehydes have been shown to modulate the NF-κB-dependent signaling pathways, which play an important role in gene regulation during inflammatory and immune responses (7Uchida K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adduction of aldehydes to apolipoprotein B (apoB) in LDL has been strongly implicated in the mechanism by which LDL is converted into an atherogenic form that is taken up by macrophages, leading to the formation of foam cells (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Steinberg D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 369: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The oxidized lipids generated during the oxidative modification of LDL are therefore likely to be involved in the process of macrophage transformation into the foam cells during atherogenesis. 4-Oxo-2(E)-nonenal (ONE) is one of the major lipid peroxidation products and has been recently established to be formed by the free radical-initiated degradation of ω-6 PUFAs, such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid (8Rindgen D.

Because of the instability of the adducts, the structures of the ONE-modified amino acid adducts have not been determined except for the ONE-arginine and ONE-cysteine adduct (20Oe T. Lee S.H.

However, Zhu and Sayre (23Zhu X. Sayre L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2007; 20: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have recently identified a novel 4-ketoamide-type ONE-lysine adduct, Nϵ-(4-oxononanoyl)lysine (ONL), that arises from a reversibly formed ONE-lysine Schiff base (Fig. 1). They also demonstrated that the 4-ketoamide-type adduct is the most prominent long lived mono-lysine adduct formed by ONE (23Zhu X. Sayre L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2007; 20: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, to further evaluate the contribution of the protein modification by ONE in the pathogenesis of various diseases associated with oxidative stress, we raised a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed to ONL and determined its formation in lipid peroxidation-related events in vitro and in vivo. In addition, using liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), we also showed evidence that the ONL is indeed accumulated in the athero-prone regions of the apoE-deficient mice, although the levels in vivo are extremely low in comparison with those detected in the OxLDL in vitro. Furthermore, to evaluate the biological implication of the ONL formation, we attempted to examine the involvement of LOX-1, a scavenger receptor, in the recognition of the ONL adducts and the ONL-induced inflammatory responses. The antibodies against LOX-1 (for immunoblot analysis), NF-κB (p65), and lamin A were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Sigma, respectively. The anti-LOX-1 mouse monoclonal antibody (for neutralizing experiments) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Trolox and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) were from Sigma. Quercetin was obtained from Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. ONE was synthesized by the oxidative opening of the 2-pentylfuran ring as described previously (22Shimozu Y. Shibata T. Ojika M. Uchida K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, N-bromosuccinimide (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) and pyridine were sequentially added to 2-pentylfuran in THF/acetone/water (5:4:2) at ice bath temperature. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at ice bath temperature and then stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The solvent was then removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column (n-hexane/ethyl acetate = 3:1) (24Sun M. Deng Y. Batyreva E. Sha W. Salomon R.G. J. Org.

The white precipitate was removed by filtration and washed with dry N,N-dimethylformamide. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to give a white residue. The residue was washed with ether (three times, 10 ml) and dried to give a white solid (353.7 mg, 95.2%), which was used without further purification. A standard KLH solution was prepared according to the published procedure (25Sayre L.M. Sha W. Xu G. Kaur K. Nadkarni D. Subbanagounder G. Salomon R.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration (7.35 mg/ml) was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. To the standard KLH solution (2.7 ml, 19.8 mg) was added 2.3 ml of doubly distilled water and 4-oxononanoic acid N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (16.3 mg, 0.044 mmol). The solution was vortexed at 25 °C for 4 h and then centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed twice against 500 ml of a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of 100 mm NH4Cl (pH 7.4) and methanol for 12 h and then twice against 500 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 12 h. BSA (5 mg) and 4-oxononanoic acid N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (11.4 mg, 0.031 mmol) were added into 5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The mixture was vortexed at 25 °C for 4 h and then dialyzed twice against 500 ml of a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of 100 mm NH4Cl (pH 7.4) and methanol for 12 h and then twice against 500 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 12 h. The extent of lysine modification was determined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry by the procedure described previously (26Zhu X. Gallogly M.M. Mieyal J.J. Anderson V.E. Sayre L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 1050-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Female BALB/c mice were immunized three times with 4-oxononanoic acid-coupled KLH. Spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3U1 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxanthine/amethopterin/thymidine selection medium. Culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using ELISA, employing pairs of wells of ELISA plates on which were absorbed 4-oxononanoic acid-coupled BSA as the antigen (5 μg of protein/well). After incubation with 100 μl of the hybridoma supernatants, and with intervening washes with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.8) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the wells were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Solon, OH), followed by a substrate solution containing 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Hybridoma cells, corresponding to the supernatants that were positive on 4-oxononanoic acid-coupled BSA, were then cloned by limiting dilution. After repeated screening, four clones were obtained. Among them, a clone 9K3 showed the most distinctive recognition of the 4-oxononanoic acid-coupled BSA. Cross-reactivity of antibodies for aldehyde-treated proteins was determined by a direct ELISA. A coating antigen was prepared by incubating 1 mg of BSA with 1 mm aldehyde in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C. A 100-μl aliquot of the antigen solution was added to each well of a 96-well ELISA plate and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The antigen solution was then removed, and the plate was washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). Each well was incubated with 200 μl of 4% Block Ace (Yukijirushi, Japan) in PBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C to block the unsaturated plastic surface. The plate was then washed three times with PBS-T. A 100-μl aliquot of antibody was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with PBS-T, 100 μl of a 5 × 103 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (MP Biomedicals) in PBS-T was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed three times with PBS-T. Enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed by adding 100 μl/well of o-phenylenediamine (0.5 mg/ml) in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2 m sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 492 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). For the competitive ELISA analysis, results were expressed as the ratio B/B0, where B = (absorbance in the presence of competitor − background absorbance (no antibody)) and B0 = (absorbance in the absence of competitor − background absorbance). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The protein was stained with Coomassie Blue. The gel was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane Hybond ECL (GE Healthcare), incubated with skim milk (50 mg/ml in TBS-T) for blocking, washed, and treated with the primary antibody. This procedure was followed by the addition of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). The bands were visualized by LumiVision PRO 400EX (Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd., Aichi, Japan). HSA (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 20 mm PUFAs (arachidonic acid and linoleic acid) (Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN) in the presence of 10 μm Fe2+ and 2 mm ascorbate in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (100 μm) and dibutylhydroxytoluene (1 mm). LDL was separated from the plasma of healthy donor by ultracentrifugation as described in the literature (27Ramos P. Gieseg S.P. Schuster B. Esterbauer H. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2113-2128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) within a density cutoff of 1.019 to 1.063 g/ml and then dialyzed with cellulose membranes in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm EDTA. It was sterilized with a Mille-GV filter (Millipore) after dialysis. The protein concentration of LDL was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). LDL was dialyzed in PBS (pH 7.4) to remove EDTA. The oxidation of LDL (1 mg of protein/ml) by 5 μm Cu2+ was carried out at 37 °C under air in PBS (pH 7.4). Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed with the Titan Gel lipoprotein system (Helena Laboratories, Saitama, Japan) for lipoprotein samples and the Titan Gel high resolution protein system for protein samples. The samples were run on two separate gels. One gel was used for staining with Fat Red 7B, and the other was used for immunoblot analysis. This investigation was carried out on aortic wall samples obtained during autopsy from patients with generalized arteriosclerosis. Each autopsy was performed at Tokyo Women's Medical University after the family members granted informed consent according to the established guidelines. Each sample was fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stored at room temperature or embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan), frozen by the dry ice-acetone method, and stored at −80 °C. Multiple 6-μm-thick sections were cut from these paraffin-embedded and frozen materials and used for histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and frozen sections were air-dried, postfixed for 10 min at room temperature in 10% formalin, and rehydrated. These prepared sections were quenched for 10 min at 4 °C with 3% hydrogen peroxide for inhibiting endogenous peroxidase activity, rinsed in PBS, pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with 5% skim milk in PBS, and treated with the avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies such as the mAb 9K3 at a dilution of 1:200, polyclonal IgG against CD68 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:100, and polyclonal IgG against α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (AbCAM, Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1:500. Sections processed with omission of the primary antibodies or incubated with 5% skim milk in PBS served as negative reaction controls. Antibody binding was visualized by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method using the appropriate Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Immunohistochemical localization of the ONL was verified by comparison with consecutive sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin and immunostained for CD68 or SMA. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was used as the chromogen and hematoxylin as the counterstain. Immunostained sections were observed with a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). In addition, the location of the ONL immunoreactivity in macrophages was strictly identified by the double immunofluorescence method on frozen sections. In brief, sections were postfixed for 10 min at 4 °C in 100% acetone, rehydrated, rinsed in PBS, pretreated for 10 min at room temperature with 5% skim milk in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the mAb 9K3 and the anti-CD68 antibody or the anti-SMA antibody, simultaneously. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at the same time. Double-immunostained sections were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The appearance of yellowish signals at merging FITC (green) and Cy3 (red) was considered as the colocalization of the ONL and CD68 or SMA. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed using an ACQUITY TQD system (Waters) equipped with an ESI probe and interfaced with a UPLC system (Waters). The sample injection volumes of 10 μl each were separated on a Waters BEH C18 1.7-μm column (150 × 2.1 mm) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. A discontinuous gradient was used by solvent A (H2O containing 0.1% formic acid) with solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid) as follows: 5% B at 0 min, 5% B at 3 min, 40% B at 10 min, 95% B at 12 min. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on line using ESI-MS/MS in the positive ion mode with MRM mode (cone potential 30 eV/collision energy 25 eV). The MRM transitions monitored were as follows: reduced [U-13C6,15N2]ONL, m/z 311.1 → 90.1; reduced ONL, m/z 303.2 → 84.1. The amount of reduced ONL adduct was quantified by the ratio of the peak area of the target adducts and of the reduced ONL-stable isotope. QuanLynx software (Waters) was used to create standard curve (supplemental Fig. S3) and to calculate the adduct concentrations. For the LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of the reduced ONL in vitro, the protein samples were transferred into a glass tube containing butylated hydroxytoluene in methanol (1 mm) and then reduced with 100 mm NaBH4 for 2 h. The samples were then treated with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, mixed well, left on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with cold acetone (500 μl) and diethyl ether (500 μl) and dried under argon. The proteins were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) (500 μl) and hydrolyzed exhaustively by Pronase (Calbiochem) and leucine aminopeptidase (Sigma). Pronase (50 μl, 2 mg/ml) was added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The pH was then adjusted to 8.5, and MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Activated leucine aminopeptidase solution (55 μl) was subsequently added. Leucine aminopeptidase was activated by incubating 225 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) with 1 mm MgCl2 for 2 h at 40 °C. The internal standard, reduced [U-13C6,15N2]ONL, was added to the samples prior to the enzymatic digestion. After the enzymatic digestion, the samples were partially separated with Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridges (Waters). After the sample loading, the HLB cartridges were washed with 2 ml of 5% acetonitrile, and the reduced ONLs were eluted with 2 ml of 80% acetonitrile. The samples were then dried, dissolved in methanol, and subjected to LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. For the LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses of the reduced ONL in vivo, male apoE-deficient mice (apoE−/−: C57BL/6, Charles River Laboratory), weighing 28–33 g (27 weeks of age), were used. The circulation system was washed with cold PBS containing protease inhibitors. The aorta was excised from the root to the abdominal area, and the connective tissue was carefully removed. The aorta was then divided into two portions, apparently normal regions (thoracic and abdominal aorta) and athero-prone regions with several lesions (the aortic root and the aortic arch), and they were separately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were homogenized in 200 μl of RIPA buffer containing butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mm). The samples were reduced with 100 mm NaBH4 for 2 h and then treated with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, mixed well, left on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with cold acetone and diethyl ether and dried under argon. After the enzymatic hydrolysis, the samples were partially separated with HLB cartridges and subjected to LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. DiD-labeled AcLDL was prepared from human LDL according to the previously described methods for 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate labeling (28Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells that stably expressed CFP-tagged LOX-1 (29Matsunaga S. Xie Q. Kumano M. Niimi S. Sekizawa K.

Cells were treated with each concentration of adducts prepared in F-12 medium without FCS for 10 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, followed by incubation with DiD-AcLDL (0.4 μg/coverslip) for another 15 min. The cells were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde. Each coverslip was inverted onto a glass slide with a spacer, and the cells were examined using a Leica DM IRE2 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany) equipped with a ×100 NA 1.4 objective and a Cool SNAP-HG-digitalized cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) driven by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). The expression level of LOX-1 was examined by the CFP fluorescence intensity using an E4 filter with excitation at 436 nm (7-nm bandpass) and a 470-nm long pass emission filter. Images were acquired at a 0.2-s exposure time. The DiD-AcLDL uptake was analyzed by the amount of the DiD-derived fluorescence intensity using a Y5 filter, with excitation using a 620-nm (50-nm bandpass) and 700-nm (75-nm bandpass) emission filter. The images were acquired at a 1-s exposure. Human monocyte cell line THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 0.2% NaHCO3, at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The cells were differentiated by incubation with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 3 days, and then cultured with FBS-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. Cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture and homogenized with 20 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 120 min to obtain a crude membrane pellet. Crude membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was then incubated with skim milk (5 mg/ml in TBS-T) for blocking, washed, and treated with the biotin-labeled HSA (50 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of unlabeled ONL-HSA (400 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 12 h. This procedure was followed by the addition"

https://openalex.org/W2083304060,"Mass spectrometry-based hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/DX) has been used to define the polypeptide backbone dynamics of full-length methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) when free in solution and when bound to unmethylated and methylated DNA. Essentially the entire MeCP2 polypeptide chain underwent H/DX at rates faster than could be measured (i.e. complete exchange in ≤10 s), with the exception of the methyl DNA binding domain (MBD). Even the H/DX of the MBD was rapid compared with that of a typical globular protein. Thus, there is no single tertiary structure of MeCP2. Rather, the full-length protein rapidly samples many different conformations when free in solution. When MeCP2 binds to unmethylated DNA, H/DX is slowed several orders of magnitude throughout the MBD. Binding of MeCP2 to methylated DNA led to additional minor H/DX protection, and only locally within the N-terminal portion of the MBD. H/DX also was used to examine the structural dynamics of the isolated MBD carrying three frequent mutations associated with Rett syndrome. The effects of the mutations ranged from very little (R106W) to a substantial increase in conformational sampling (F155S). Our H/DX results have yielded fine resolution mapping of the structure of full-length MeCP2 in the absence and presence of DNA, provided a biochemical basis for understanding MeCP2 function in normal cells, and predicted potential approaches for the treatment of a subset of RTT cases caused by point mutations that destabilize the MBD."
https://openalex.org/W2089421073,"The type I and type II bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPRI and BMPRII) are present at the plasma membrane as monomers and homomeric and heteromeric complexes, which are modulated by ligand binding. The complexes of their extracellular domains with ligand were shown to form heterotetramers. However, the dynamics of the oligomeric interactions among the full-length receptors in live cell membranes were not explored, and the roles of BMP receptor homodimerization were unknown. Here, we investigated these issues by combining patching/immobilization of an epitope-tagged BMP receptor at the cell surface with measurements of the lateral diffusion of a co-expressed, differently tagged BMP receptor by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). These studies led to several novel conclusions. (a) All homomeric complexes (without or with BMP-2) were stable on the patch/FRAP time scale (minutes), whereas the heterocomplexes were transient, a difference that may affect signaling. (b) Patch/FRAP between HA- and myc-tagged BMPRII combined with competition by untagged BMPRIb showed that the heterocomplexes form at the expense of homodimers. (c) Stabilization of BMPRII·BMPRIb heterocomplexes (but not homomeric complexes) by IgG binding to same-tag receptors elevated phospho-Smad formation both without and with BMP-2. These findings suggest two mechanisms that may suppress the tendency of preformed BMP receptor hetero-oligomers to signal without ligand: (a) competition between homo- and heterocomplex formation, which reduces the steady-state level of the latter, and (b) the transient nature of the heterocomplexes, which limits the time during which BMPRI can be phosphorylated by BMPRII in the heterocomplex."

The pharmacological activation of cellular stress responses could be a new strategy to combat protein conformational diseases. Hydroxylamine derivatives act as co-inducers of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and can enhance HSP expression in diseased cells, without significant adverse effects. Here, we used Caenorhabditis elegans expressing polyQ expansions with 35 glutamines fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (Q35-YFP) in body wall muscle cells as a model system to investigate the effects of treatment with a novel hydroxylamine derivative, NG-094, on the progression of polyQ diseases. NG-094 significantly ameliorated polyQ-mediated animal paralysis, reduced the number of Q35-YFP aggregates and delayed polyQ-dependent acceleration of aging. Micromolar concentrations of NG-094 in animal tissues with only marginal effects on the nematode fitness sufficed to confer protection against polyQ proteotoxicity, even when the drug was administered after disease onset. NG-094 did not reduce insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1-like signaling, but conferred cytoprotection by a mechanism involving the heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 that potentiated the expression of stress-inducible HSPs.

IntroductionCytochrome P450 enzymes are nearly ubiquitous in nature. These hemoproteins are involved in the metabolism of numerous steroids, drugs, carcinogens, and other substrates in mammals and, in addition, in many pathways of secondary metabolism and defense in plants and microorganisms (1.Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., (ed) (2005) Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry, 3rd Ed., Plenum Pless, New York.Google Scholar). Humans have 57 CYP genes potentially coding for P450 enzymes (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar). One of these, P450 3A4, is involved in the metabolism of approximately one-half of the drugs marketed today (of those known to be oxidized) (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed.

In addition to drugs, this enzyme also has roles in both the bioactivation and detoxication of chemical carcinogens, e.g. aflatoxin B1 (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed.

Wienkers L. Pearson P. 2nd Ed. Inhibition of Drug Metabolizing Enzymes: Molecular and Biochemical Aspects. Marcel Dekker, New York2009: 203-226Google Scholar). Another consideration, which has received less discussion, is competition between drugs and endogenous compounds, e.g. sterols. Testosterone, progesterone, and estrogens are known substrates (7Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

However, cholesterol is present at high concentrations in liver. Even considering the low solubility of cholesterol and equilibrium with bound forms, the high concentration of cholesterol in the liver is a potential issue.In consideration of the demonstrated 4β-hydroxylation of cholesterol by P450 3A4 (9Bodin K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31534-31540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), if cholesterol is a substrate of P450 3A4, then it follows that it should also be an inhibitor, which may be an issue in the context of the aforementioned high concentrations of cholesterol in liver (and brain). We considered this issue and have described the in vitro kinetics, which appear to follow non-competitive behavior but can be considered in other paradigms presented by Segel (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). The level of cholesterol in cultured human hepatocytes could be elevated by treatment with cholesterol. Elevation of the cholesterol level led to attenuated nifedipine oxidation activity, a marker for P450 3A4 (7Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that consideration should be made for cholesterol inhibition of P450 3A4 in extrapolation to in vivo situations, analogous to binding of drugs and steroids to plasma proteins.DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of cholesterol on cytochrome P450 3A4, the major human P450 in liver and small intestine, in light of reports that cholesterol is a substrate for 4β-hydroxylation by P450 3A4 (Fig. 1) (9Bodin K.

Andersson U. Rystedt E. Ellis E. Norlin M. Pikuleva I. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Diczfalusy U. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2011; 71: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cholesterol was shown to bind to P450 3A4 (Kd = 8 μm) (Fig. 2) and to inhibit prototypic P450 3A4 reactions with a Ki value of ∼10 μm (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 and Table 1). These results, considered in the context of the known concentration of cholesterol in liver, suggest that cholesterol inhibition occurs in cells. Raising the level of cholesterol in cultured human hepatocytes resulted in the inhibition of nifedipine oxidation by P450 3A4 (Fig. 5).Cholesterol inhibition studies were done with human liver microsomes and a purified enzyme system (reconstituted with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5). Steroids (e.g. testosterone) and other hydrophobic substrates could not be utilized as substrates in these assays because they are bound to HPβCD, resulting in the inhibition of hydroxylation activity in the absence of cholesterol. Therefore, we used the drug nifedipine, the first P450 3A4 substrate identified (7Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPβCD did not inhibit nifedipine or quinidine oxidation activity. The inhibition of these activities by cholesterol appeared to be non-competitive, and the data were fit to a classic model (Equation 1) to obtain Ki values (Table 1). In the case of the results obtained with liver microsomes (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1), a poor fit was obtained but could be improved by the inclusion of an exponent (Hill factor) (Equation 2). However, we do not have a specific physical interpretation of this factor for inhibition, as in the case of Hill coefficients applied to cooperative phenomena observed with P450 3A4 substrates (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar, 15Ueng Y.F. Kuwabara T. Chun Y.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 38Sohl C.D. Isin E.M. Eoff R.L. Marsch G.A. Stec D.F. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7293-7308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Although the simplistic view of non-competitive inhibition is that the inhibitor is interacting at a site distinct from that of the substrate (39Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Longman's, Green and Co., London1964Google Scholar), a number of possibilities exist (Fig. 6) (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar), particularly in a case in which there is extensive evidence for the presence of multiple ligands in a large active site (15Ueng Y.F. Kuwabara T. Chun Y.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 16Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 23Ekroos M. Sjögren T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13682-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 40Yano J.K. Wester M.R. Schoch G.A. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38091-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In the model shown in Fig. 6, the substrate is nifedipine or quinidine (S). Cholesterol is the inhibitor (I), but it is also a substrate (the EI′ complex). However, in the configurations of EI and ESI, cholesterol (I) can block the oxidation of other substrates without being in the “S” site. This model comes from the classic text of Segel (41Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 109Google Scholar) and can explain the results observed here. Furthermore, the proposed proclivity for multiple modes of binding can explain the relatively weak absorbance changes observed when cholesterol binds to P450 (Fig. 2) in that only a small population of the modes of binding could result in H2O displacement (as an iron ligand) and spin-state shift. The multiplicity of configurations would also be an issue contributing to the low rate of catalysis, i.e. 4β-hydroxylation (Fig. 1).As in the general case of prediction of drug-drug interactions involving P450 and other enzymes, the Ki can be compared with the estimated free concentration of the inhibitor. A typical concentration of total cholesterol in human serum is ∼5 mm (i.e. 20 mg/ml or 200 mg/dl). One estimate of the amount of unesterified cholesterol in human liver is 840 μmol, based only on the concentration of unesterified cholesterol in human liver microsomes (∼56 nmol/mg of protein) (33Shinkyo R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4632-4643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) multiplied by a typical recovery factor of 10 mg of microsomal protein/g of liver (42Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For a liver (of 1.5 kg), this would give an “average” concentration of 560 μm. Our own work with human liver microsomes showed a mean value of 56 pmol of unesterified cholesterol/mg of microsomal protein or ∼100 nmol of free (unesterified) cholesterol/nmol of (total) P450. Some of the cholesterol is bound to lipoprotein complexes, so the exact concentration of free cholesterol is not precisely known. Another approach to the estimation is to consider the solubility of cholesterol in buffer (5.2 μm) (43O'Neil M.J. Merck Index. 13th Ed. Merck Research Laboratories, Whitehouse Station, NJ2001: 2223Google Scholar), although this value may not be appropriate in considering the overall equilibrium among various proteins. However, using a conservative value of 5 μm for an “effective” cholesterol concentration and a Ki value of 10 μm, Equation 1 would predict an increase in the “area under the curve” (integral) for an in vivo pharmacokinetic profile of 50% (i.e. 50% more exposure of the tissues to drug). If cholesterol were treated as an experimental drug candidate in development, this degree of inhibition would suggest caution. It is possible that the effective concentration of free cholesterol that P450 3A4 encounters is higher, given the ratio of 100 nmol of unesterified cholesterol/nmol of P450 in liver microsomal membranes. To put this in perspective, the decrease in nifedipine oxidation activity observed in the hepatocytes was ∼60% (Fig. 5) after raising the cholesterol concentration. However, this experiment did not directly address the question of how much inhibition was produced by the basal level of cholesterol in the hepatocytes.Use of an animal model to test the hypothesis that cholesterol inhibits P450 3A4 function in cells would not be trivial in that P450 3A4 is not present in mice, and mice contain seven subfamily 3A P450 enzymes, thus requiring a complex transgenic model. Accordingly, we designed experiments with cultured human hepatocytes and modulated the level of cholesterol in the cells. We considered reducing the level of cholesterol in the hepatocytes with the use of statin inhibitors of 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, but many of the statins are P450 3A4 substrates themselves and could not be used (44Wang R.W. Kari P.H. Lu A.Y. Thomas P.E. Guengerich F.P. Vyas K.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Pravastatin is not a P450 3A4 substrate, but we were able to achieve an attenuation of only ∼30% of the cholesterol level with this statin in the cells (supplemental Fig. S3), which is very significant clinically but in subsequent experiments was not sufficient to modify rates of nifedipine oxidation (at least at the level of statistical significance) (data not shown). Cholesterol levels in the hepatocytes could be elevated 4–6-fold by incubation with 200 μm cholesterol, concordant with the knowledge that hepatocytes are known to have active cholesterol uptake transporters (45Garcia-Calvo M. Lisnock J. Bull H.G. Hawes B.E. Burnett D.A. Braun M.P. Crona J.H. Davis Jr., H.R. Dean D.C. Detmers P.A. Graziano M.P. Hughes M. Macintyre D.E. Ogawa A. O'Neill K.A. Iyer S.P. Shevell D.E. Smith M.M. Tang Y.S. Makarewicz A.M. Ujjainwalla F. Altmann S.W. Chapman K.T. Thornberry N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8132-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar).Three individual lots of cultured human hepatocytes were used in this work. In one set, the viability decreased during the course of the experiment and was reversed by the presence of the added cholesterol, thus confounding any interpretation of results (data not shown). In the other two sets of experiments, nifedipine oxidation (a P450 3A4 marker) (7Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was significantly decreased when the level of cholesterol increased (Fig. 5). Nifedipine oxidation is considered a classic and reliable marker of P450 3A4 (7Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); we have not extended these studies to other substrates.In summary, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of cholesterol on P450 3A4 activities in human liver microsomes, a reconstituted system, and human hepatocytes. Cholesterol showed apparent non-competitive inhibition toward three oxidation reactions catalyzed by P450 3A4, with Ki values comparable with that of the clinically established typical P450 3A4 inhibitor verapamil (46Ohno Y. Hisaka A. Suzuki H. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2007; 46: 681-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The increased cholesterol could cause attenuation of P450 3A4 activity in hepatocytes (Fig. 5), indicating that cholesterol in human liver could affect the metabolism of drugs and other compounds by P450 3A4. This conclusion is relevant to the basal level of cholesterol as well as elevated levels. IntroductionCytochrome P450 enzymes are nearly ubiquitous in nature. These hemoproteins are involved in the metabolism of numerous steroids, drugs, carcinogens, and other substrates in mammals and, in addition, in many pathways of secondary metabolism and defense in plants and microorganisms (1.Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., (ed) (2005) Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry, 3rd Ed., Plenum Pless, New York.Google Scholar). Humans have 57 CYP genes potentially coding for P450 enzymes (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar). One of these, P450 3A4, is involved in the metabolism of approximately one-half of the drugs marketed today (of those known to be oxidized) (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar, 3Williams J.A. Hyland R. Jones B.C. Smith D.A. Hurst S. Goosen T.C. Peterkin V. Koup J.R.

Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In addition to drugs, this enzyme also has roles in both the bioactivation and detoxication of chemical carcinogens, e.g. aflatoxin B1 (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar, 5Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Toxicol. 1995; 8: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). P450 3A4 also has relatively high catalytic activities in the oxidation of a number of steroids, e.g. testosterone, progesterone, and 17β-estradiol (7Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H.

Nylén H. Elander P. Bertilsson L. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2011; 71: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).P450 3A4 has been described as displaying rather schizophrenic behavior toward some ligands, which has been difficult to understand (2Guengerich F.P.

We considered this issue and have described the in vitro kinetics, which appear to follow non-competitive behavior but can be considered in other paradigms presented by Segel (25Segel I.H.

The level of cholesterol in cultured human hepatocytes could be elevated by treatment with cholesterol. Elevation of the cholesterol level led to attenuated nifedipine oxidation activity, a marker for P450 3A4 (7Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2040585289,"Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR(2)) is one of four protease-activated G-protein-coupled receptors. PAR(2) is expressed on multiple cell types where it contributes to cellular responses to endogenous and exogenous proteases. Proteolytic cleavage of PAR(2) reveals a tethered ligand that activates PAR(2) and two major downstream signaling pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Peptides or peptidomimetics can mimic binding of the tethered ligand to stimulate signaling without the nonspecific effects of proteases. The most commonly used peptide activators of PAR(2) (e.g. SLIGRL-NH(2) and SLIGKV-NH(2)) lack potency at the receptor. However, although the potency of 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2) (2-f-LIGRLO-NH(2)) underscores the use of peptidomimetic PAR(2) ligands as a mechanism to enhance pharmacological action at PAR(2), 2-f-LIGRLO-NH(2) has not been thoroughly evaluated. We evaluated the known agonist 2-f-LIGRLO-NH(2) and two recently described pentapeptidomimetic PAR(2)-specific agonists, 2-aminothiazol-4-yl-LIGRL-NH(2) (2-at-LIGRL-NH(2)) and 6-aminonicotinyl-LIGRL-NH(2) (6-an-LIGRL-NH(2)). All peptidomimetic agonists stimulated PAR(2)-dependent in vitro physiological responses, MAPK signaling, and Ca(2+) signaling with an overall rank order of potency of 2-f-LIGRLO-NH(2) ≈ 2-at-LIGRL-NH(2) > 6-an-LIGRL-NH(2) ≫ SLIGRL-NH(2). Because PAR(2) plays a major role in pathological pain conditions and to test potency of the peptidomimetic agonists in vivo, we evaluated these agonists in models relevant to nociception. All three agonists activated Ca(2+) signaling in nociceptors in vitro, and both 2-at-LIGRL-NH(2) and 2-f-LIGRLO-NH(2) stimulated PAR(2)-dependent thermal hyperalgesia in vivo. We have characterized three high potency ligands that can be used to explore the physiological role of PAR(2) in a variety of systems and pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1977139291,"During implantation, the uterine stromal cells undergo terminal differentiation into decidual cells, which support the proper progression of maternal-embryo interactions to successful establishment of pregnancy. The decidual cells synthesize extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as laminins and collagens, which assemble into a unique basal lamina-like network that surrounds these cells. The functional significance of this matrix during implantation is unknown. We previously showed that the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) critically regulates decidualization in the mouse. We now provide evidence that C/EBPβ directly controls the Lamc1 gene, which encodes a predominant laminin constituent of the ECM produced by the decidual cells. Suppression of Lamc1 expression in mouse primary endometrial stromal cells prevented the assembly of this ECM and impaired stromal differentiation. Attenuation of expression of integrin β1, a major constituent of the integrin receptors targeted by decidual laminins, also inhibited this differentiation process. Disruption of laminin-integrin interactions led to impaired activation of the focal adhesion kinase, an integrin-mediated regulator of cytoskeletal remodeling during decidualization. To further analyze the role of the decidual ECM in modulating maternal-embryo interactions, we monitored trophoblast invasion into differentiating uterine stromal monolayers, using a co-culture system. Silencing of stromal Lamc1 expression, which prevented formation of the basal lamina-like matrix, resulted in marked reduction in trophoblast outgrowth. Collectively, our findings identified C/EBPβ as a critical regulator of the unique ECM that controls decidual cell architecture and differentiation, and it provided new insights into the mechanisms by which the uterine stromal microenvironment controls the progression of embryo implantation."

During definitive hematopoiesis, expression of HoxA10 is maximal in committed myeloid progenitor cells and decreases as differentiation proceeds. Aberrantly increased expression of HoxA10 was found in bone marrow cells in a poor prognosis subset of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with this, AML developed in mice transplanted with HoxA10-overexpressing bone marrow. However, relatively few target genes have been identified that explain the role of HoxA10 in leukemogenesis. In the current study, we identified CDX4 as a HoxA10 target gene. Cdx4 is a homeodomain transcription factor that was also implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis. Although relatively few Cdx4 target genes have been identified, Cdx4 was known to influence HOX gene transcription. We identified a HoxA10-binding cis element in the CDX4 promoter that activated transcription. We also identified a Cdx4-binding cis element that activated the HOXA10 promoter. Therefore, increased Cdx4 expression in HoxA10-overexpressing cells augmented transcription of the endogenous HOXA10 gene. Increased endogenous HoxA10 in these cells induced additional CDX4 transcription. We found that Cdx4 influenced transcription of HoxA10 target genes in a HoxA10-dependent manner. Similarly, HoxA10 influenced transcription of HOX genes in a Cdx4-dependent manner. We previously found that HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitors were hypersensitive to a variety of cytokines. In the current studies, we found that Cdx4 knockdown decreased cytokine hypersensitivity of HoxA10-overexpressing cells.

Thus, although the BK gating ring has a well defined structural identity, the functional properties linked to its ligand-sensing operation have not yet been investigated. We have probed the structural and functional properties of the recombinant human BK channel C terminus under physiologically relevant conditions, providing evidence that RCK1-RCK2 complexes assemble into a tetrameric gating ring structure that undergoes metal-dependent conformational rearrangements. The resolved molecular events are likely associated with the ligand-induced signal propagation that activates the channel pore. The gating ring superstructure appears to possess the structural and functional properties of a chemo-mechanical coupler able to transduce the free energy of ligand binding into mechanical work.

The purity of the expressed proteins was analyzed using a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using the Biuret-Lowry assay. Enzyme digestion was performed as follows. Purified human Slo1 was separated by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digested prior to analysis by mass spectrometry. Gel plugs were dehydrated in acetonitrile and dried completely in a SpeedVac. Samples were reduced and alkylated with 10 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine solution in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (30 min at 56 °C) and 100 mm iodoacetamide (45 min in dark), respectively. Gel plugs were washed with 50 mm NH4HCO3, dehydrated with acetonitrile, and dried down in a SpeedVac. Gel pieces were then swollen in digestion buffer containing 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 20.0 ng/μl chymotrypsin (25 °C, overnight). 10 μl of extracted peptides were analyzed by nanoflow LC/MS/MS on a Thermo Orbitrap with a dedicated Eksigent nanopump using a reversed phase column (75-μm inner diameter, 10-cm BioBasic C18, 5-μm particle size, New Objective).

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 47Yusifov T. Javaherian A.D. Pantazis A. Gandhi C.S. Olcese R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 136: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, far-UV spectra of purified gating ring in 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.2) were recorded as an average of 7–9 scans. Secondary structure fractions were calculated using the CONTINLL, SELCON3, and CDSSTR algorithms with the SMP56 reference set of the CDPro software package (48Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 318-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The numbers of α-helices and β-strands were calculated by dividing the numbers of residues included in the distorted α-helix and β-structure by a factor of four and two, respectively. Size-exclusion chromatography experiments were performed as described previously (47Yusifov T. Javaherian A.D. Pantazis A. Gandhi C.S. Olcese R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 136: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Purified BK gating ring in (in mm) 50 Tris-HCl, 2 β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 EGTA (pH 8.4) or (in mm) 20 MOPS (pH 7.2) was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 column equilibrated with the same buffer with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Calibration was performed using protein standards (Sigma). The time-resolved fluorescence lifetime of intrinsic Trp was measured with a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) using time-correlated single photon counting (λex = 296 nm, λem = 340 nm) in (in mm) 25 MOPS, 120 KCl, 2 EGTA, pH 7.2. Free ion concentrations were estimated using WEBMAXC or measured as described previously (47Yusifov T. Javaherian A.D. Pantazis A. Gandhi C.S. Olcese R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 136: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The instrument response function was acquired using a non-fluorescent, light scattering sample (Ludox, colloidal silica). The instrument response function is a function of the detector characteristics and timing electronics and demonstrates the speed of the instrument and its detection properties. It is the shortest time profile that can be recorded by the instrument (49Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York, NY2006: 97-155Crossref Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity decay data were fit to a sum of three exponential functions, using the DAS6 v6.4 software (Horiba Jobin Yvon)I(t)=∑i=1nαiexp(-t/τi)Eq. 1 where I is the fluorescence intensity and α and τ are the normalized pre-exponential factor and decay time constant, respectively. The average fluorescence lifetimes (τavg) for three-exponential iterative fittings are calculated from the decay times and pre-exponential factors using the equationτavg=∑i=1nfiτiEq. 2 where fi is the fractional contribution of each decay time to the steady-state intensity, which is given byfi=αiτi/∑αjτjEq. 3 The goodness of the fit was determined from its χ2 value and the variance of the weighted residual distribution (n = 3, unless otherwise noted). Steady-state Trp fluorescence emission spectra of the gating ring in (in mm) 25 MOPS, 120 KCl, 2 EGTA, pH 7.2, were acquired in the 310–400 nm range, λex = 295 nm (5 nm excitation/emission slit width). Normalized fluorescence data were fit with a Hill function in the formF=(Fmax-Fmin)/(1+([M2+])/K1/2)n+FminEq. 4 where F is the fluorescence intensity at 340 or 350 nm for WT and calcium bowl mutant gating ring, respectively; [M2+] is the concentration of Ca2+ or Mg2+; K½ is the apparent dissociation constant; and n is the Hill coefficient. DLS measurements were recorded using a NICOMP 380 submicron particle sizing system. The hydrodynamic properties of gating ring particles were determined by measuring the translational diffusion coefficient DT, which is related to the frictional coefficient f by the Einstein-Sutherland equationDT=KBT/f(cm2/s)Eq. 5 where KB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in K. The frictional coefficient of a spherical particle, fsph, is a function of the fluid viscosity, η, and the radius of the particle, rsph. It is defined by the Stokes law.fsph=6πηrsphEq. 6 Mean particle size distribution was analyzed in volume-weighted Nicomp-fit mode. The theoretical hydrodynamic radius (RtheoH) was calculated from the formulaRHtheo=[(3M(Vs+h))/4πNA]1/3Eq. 7 where M is the molecular mass of the gating ring (312,000), Vs is the particle specific volume (0.73 cm3 g−1), h is the hydration (0.35 g of H2O (g-protein)−1), and NA is Avogadro's constant (50Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. McCombs L.W. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1980: 539-590Google Scholar). The Perrin, or shape factor, is the ratio of the measured frictional coefficient f to the frictional coefficient ftheo of a hypothetical sphere, whereF=f/ftheo=RH/RHtheoEq. 8 The polydispersity (Pd) was evaluated according to the following equationPd=σ/DH⋅100%Eq. 9 where σ is the standard deviation of the distribution and DH is the mean hydrodynamic diameter from DLS measurements. The intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD, 684 amino acids) of the BK channel, which accounts for >60% of the whole channel and includes the two ligand-sensing modules RCK1 and RCK2 (supplemental Fig. S1), was expressed and purified. The CTD electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE corresponds to an estimated Mr = 72,000 (Fig. 1B), close to the theoretical molecular weight of the purified protein (78,000). The identity of the purified BK CTD was confirmed by mass spectrometry, which identified 67% of the primary sequence (supplemental Fig. S1). The secondary and quaternary structures of the protein were investigated under physiologically relevant ionic conditions similar to the intracellular environment to ascertain its proper folding and native assembly, information necessary for the validity of the results of subsequent functional assays. CD spectra were acquired to probe the secondary structure composition of the CTD in solution (Fig. 1C) and were subsequently analyzed using algorithms of the CDPro software (48Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 318-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The experimental (black) and calculated (red, CONTINLL algorithm) spectra are shown superimposed. The CD spectral analysis revealed a CTD secondary structure composition of ∼29% α-helix, ∼22% β-strand, organized in 22 α-helices and 30 β-strands, and ∼49% turn and unordered structure (supplemental Fig. S2A). Although a direct comparison of secondary structure composition across a crystal structure study is not straightforward because of differences in the regions purified and/or resolved, reasonable correlation exists (supplemental Fig. S2). The oligomeric state of the BK CTD was assessed by size-exclusion chromatography. A characteristic column elution and corresponding calibration curve is shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. The BK CTD eluted with an Mr = 324,000 ± 4,000, which is approximately four times the estimated molecular weight of the monomer (78,000), suggesting that in solution, the BK CTDs (RCK1-RCK2 complexes without transmembrane structures) self-assemble into tetramers, likely corresponding to the BK gating ring apparatus. As a chemo-mechanical signal transducer, the gating ring is expected to regulate BK channel open probability by converting the free energy of ligand binding into conformational rearrangements that facilitate channel opening (5Hou S.

The purified gating ring includes five Trp residues per subunit that serve as intrinsic environment-sensitive fluorophores reporting ligand-induced structural changes (49Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York, NY2006: 97-155Crossref Google Scholar). We probed the gating ring for metal-induced conformational rearrangements by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of gating ring Trp residues (λex = 296 nm; λem = 340 nm) in solutions with different [Ca2+] or [Mg2+], using time-correlated single-photon counting (49Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York, NY2006: 97-155Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows superimposed data obtained at four different concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A) or Mg2+ (Fig. 3B), represented as single photon detection events binned by the time interval of detection after the excitation pulse; shorter Trp fluorescence lifetimes will result in fewer photons detected at long time intervals, accelerating the decay of the photon histogram. Each photon histogram was fit by the sum of three exponentials (black curves) to determine the mean fluorescence lifetime (τavg) of the native gating ring Trp residues, under different [Ca2+] or [Mg2+]. The average fluorescence lifetime (τavg) of the gating ring in nominal zero Ca2+ (0.00058 μm) was 2.6 ± 0.010 ns. Increasing free [Ca2+] accelerated the decay of fluorescence intensity, as shown by the progressive reduction of τavg to a limiting value of 1.6 ± 0.0027 ns at 35 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S1), indicating a change within the immediate environment of one or more Trp residues. We found that the Trp fluorescence lifetime of the gating ring was also sensitive to Mg2+ (Fig. 3B) at concentrations in the millimolar range. As [Mg2+] was incrementally raised from 0 to 12 mm, τavg progressively decreased to the same limiting value obtained for Ca2+ (1.6 ± 0.015 ns; supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Thus, the binding of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ to the gating ring induced structural transitions at physiologically relevant concentrations, revealing the divalent metal cation-sensing properties of the isolated gating ring apparatus in solution. The following experiments were designed to estimate the apparent binding constants and assess the specificity of the BK gating ring for divalent cations, based on steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy of intrinsic Trp. The intensity of the fluorescence emission spectra of the gating ring (λex = 295 nm) was progressively reduced upon free [Ca2+] elevation in the buffer solution up to 35 μm, as shown in Fig. 4A. The [Ca2+]-dependent quenching of the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm was well described by the linear combination of two Hill functions with apparent binding constants K1½ = 0.29 ± 0.0043 μm (n1 = 3.4 ± 0.16) and K2½ = 3.5 ± 0.51 μm (n2 = 2.1 ± 0.35) (Fig. 4D), suggesting at least two Ca2+-binding sites and positive cooperativity. This apparent Ca2+ affinity is relevant to BK channel activation (4Cui J. Yang H. Lee U.S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 852-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 54Latorre R. Brauchi S. Biol. Res. 2006; 39: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). K1½ likely relates to Ca2+ binding to the RCK2 domain at the calcium bowl site, whereas the higher K2½ value likely reflects Ca2+ binding to the RCK1 domain, which has a lower apparent affinity in solution (33Yusifov T.

https://openalex.org/W2044867337,"Research on specialized biological systems is often hampered by a lack of consistent terminology, especially across species. In bacterial Type IV secretion systems genes within one set of orthologs may have over a dozen different names. Classifying research publications based on biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and microorganism species should improve the precision and recall of literature searches allowing researchers to keep up with the exponentially growing literature, through resources such as the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC, patricbrc.org). We developed named entity recognition (NER) tools for four entities related to Type IV secretion systems: 1) bacteria names, 2) biological processes, 3) molecular functions, and 4) cellular components. These four entities are important to pathogenesis and virulence research but have received less attention than other entities, e.g., genes and proteins. Based on an annotated corpus, large domain terminological resources, and machine learning techniques, we developed recognizers for these entities. High accuracy rates (>80%) are achieved for bacteria, biological processes, and molecular function. Contrastive experiments highlighted the effectiveness of alternate recognition strategies; results of term extraction on contrasting document sets demonstrated the utility of these classes for identifying T4SS-related documents."
https://openalex.org/W2069134127,"Partial digestion of fibrin by plasmin exposes C-terminal lysine residues, which comprise new binding sites for both plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). This binding increases the catalytic efficiency of plasminogen activation by 3000-fold compared with tPA alone. The activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) attenuates fibrinolysis by removing these residues, which causes a 97% reduction in tPA catalytic efficiency. The aim of this study was to determine the kinetics of TAFIa-catalyzed lysine cleavage from fibrin degradation products and the kinetics of loss of plasminogen-binding sites. We show that the k(cat) and K(m) of Glu(1)-plasminogen (Glu-Pg)-binding site removal are 2.34 s(-1) and 142.6 nm, respectively, implying a catalytic efficiency of 16.21 μm(-1) s(-1). The corresponding values of Lys(77)/Lys(78)-plasminogen (Lys-Pg)-binding site removal are 0.89 s(-1) and 96 nm implying a catalytic efficiency of 9.23 μm(-1) s(-1). These catalytic efficiencies of plasminogen-binding site removal by TAFIa are the highest of any TAFIa-catalyzed reaction with a biological substrate reported to date and suggest that plasmin-modified fibrin is a primary physiological substrate for TAFIa. We also show that the catalytic efficiency of cleavage of all C-terminal lysine residues, whether they are involved in plasminogen binding or not, is 1.10 μm(-1) s(-1). Interestingly, this value increases to 3.85 μm(-1) s(-1) in the presence of Glu-Pg. These changes are due to a decrease in K(m). This suggests that an interaction between TAFIa and plasminogen comprises a component of the reaction mechanism, the plausibility of which was established by showing that TAFIa binds both Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg."

https://openalex.org/W2128362168,"ERK1/2 is required for certain forms of synaptic plasticity, including the long-term potentiation of synaptic strength. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating synaptically localized ERK1/2 signaling are poorly understood. Here, we show that the MAPK scaffold protein kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) is directly phosphorylated by the downstream kinase ERK1/2. Quantitative Western blot analysis further demonstrates that expression of mutated, feedback-deficient KSR1 promotes sustained ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells in response to EGF stimulation, compared to a more transient activation in control cells expressing wild-type KSR1. Immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging of primary hippocampal neurons from newborn C57BL6 mice further show that feedback phosphorylation of KSR1 significantly reduces its localization to dendritic spines. This effect can be reversed by tetrodotoxin (1 μM) or PD184352 (2 μM) treatment, further suggesting that neuronal activity and phosphorylation by ERK1/2 lead to KSR1 removal from the postsynaptic compartment. Consequently, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal neurons expressing wild-type or feedback-deficient KSR1 demonstrate that KSR1 feedback phosphorylation restricts the potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our findings, therefore, suggest that feedback phosphorylation of the scaffold protein KSR1 prevents excessive ERK1/2 signaling in the postsynaptic compartment and thus contributes to maintaining physiological levels of synaptic excitability."
https://openalex.org/W1963875486,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 stimulates extracellular PPi (ePPi) generation and promotes chondrocalcinosis, which also occurs secondary to hyperparathyroidism-induced hypercalcemia. We previously demonstrated that ANK was up-regulated by TGF-β1 activation of ERK1/2 and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (PKCα). Thus, we investigated mechanisms by which calcium could affect ePPi metabolism, especially its main regulating proteins ANK and PC-1 (plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1). We stimulated articular chondrocytes with TGF-β1 under extracellular (eCa2+) or cytosolic Ca2+ (cCa2+) modulations. We studied ANK, PC-1 expression (quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting), ePPi levels (radiometric assay), and cCa2+ input (fluorescent probe). Voltage-operated Ca2+-channels (VOC) and signaling pathways involved were investigated with selective inhibitors. Finally, Ank promoter activity was evaluated (gene reporter). TGF-β1 elevated cCa2+ and ePPi levels (by up-regulating Ank and PC-1 mRNA/proteins) in an eCa2+ dose-dependent manner. TGF-β1 effects were suppressed by cCa2+ chelation or L- and T-VOC blockade while being mostly reproduced by ionomycin. In the same experimental conditions, the activation of Ras, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PKCα, and the stimulation of Ank promoter activity were affected similarly. Activation of SP1 (specific protein 1) and ELK-1 (Ets-like protein-1) transcription factors supported the regulatory role of Ca2+. SP1 or ELK-1 overexpression or blockade experiments demonstrated a major contribution of ELK-1, which acted synergistically with SP1 to activate Ank promoter in response to TGF-β1. TGF-β1 promotes input of eCa2+ through opening of L- and T-VOCs, to potentiate ERK1/2 and PKCα signaling cascades, resulting in an enhanced activation of Ank promoter and ePPi production in chondrocyte."

IntroductionAfrican trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause serious disease in humans and their domestic animals in Sub-Saharan Africa. These parasites have influenced the development of Africa and continue to cause socioeconomic devastation, especially by infecting cattle, the mainstay of many smallholder farmers (1Swallow B.M. PAAT Technical and Scientific Series. 2. FAO/WHO/IAEA/OAU-IBAR, Rome2000Google Scholar). Trypanosomes alternate between a mammalian host and an insect vector, the infamous tsetse (Glossina). In mammalian hosts, the trypanosomes live as bloodstream forms (BSFs) 4The abbreviations used are: BSFbloodstream formVSGvariant surface glycoproteinGARPglutamic acid/alanine-rich proteinrGARPrecombinant GARPPCFprocyclic culture formEMFepimastigote form. that are proficient at antigenic variation and host immune system evasion (2Donelson J.E. Acta Trop. 2003; 85: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, no suitable vaccine candidates for trypanosomiasis have been identified after more than a century of research. In contrast, the trypanosome life cycle stages that exist in the tsetse vector do not undergo antigenic variation. This potentially makes the vector-occupying trypanosomes much better targets for control if strategies can be devised to disrupt their life cycle in the vector or to interfere with their transmission to mammalian hosts. The primary impediment to developing strategies for disruption of trypanosome life cycles in the tsetse is a lack of understanding of the molecular basis of trypanosome-tsetse interactions. In alternating between their mammalian hosts and tsetse vectors, trypanosomes are subject to dramatic changes in environment. Therefore, it is not surprising that their response, in terms of metabolism and surface architecture, is equally dramatic. Several major surface molecules have been identified on insect forms of Trypanosoma brucei ssp. (3Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schürch N. Bütikofer P. Mol. Biochem.

Although some of these molecules have been extensively studied, no functional role has been assigned to any of them.All of the trypanosome surface proteins so far described are anchored to the surface membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (9Ferguson M.A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During all life cycle stages, the trypanosomes are covered with a continuous dense monolayer of proteins and glycoproteins proposed to protect the parasite from the host immune system or from the proteolytic environment of the tsetse (10Roditi I.

Both BSFs and metacyclic forms of trypanosomes express a dense surface coat of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) molecules (13Vickerman K. J.

Collectively, the data offer a rare insight into the possible function of a trypanosome surface protein. IntroductionAfrican trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause serious disease in humans and their domestic animals in Sub-Saharan Africa. These parasites have influenced the development of Africa and continue to cause socioeconomic devastation, especially by infecting cattle, the mainstay of many smallholder farmers (1Swallow B.M. PAAT Technical and Scientific Series. 2. FAO/WHO/IAEA/OAU-IBAR, Rome2000Google Scholar). Trypanosomes alternate between a mammalian host and an insect vector, the infamous tsetse (Glossina). In mammalian hosts, the trypanosomes live as bloodstream forms (BSFs) 4The abbreviations used are: BSFbloodstream formVSGvariant surface glycoproteinGARPglutamic acid/alanine-rich proteinrGARPrecombinant GARPPCFprocyclic culture formEMFepimastigote form. that are proficient at antigenic variation and host immune system evasion (2Donelson J.E. Acta Trop. 2003; 85: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, no suitable vaccine candidates for trypanosomiasis have been identified after more than a century of research. In contrast, the trypanosome life cycle stages that exist in the tsetse vector do not undergo antigenic variation. This potentially makes the vector-occupying trypanosomes much better targets for control if strategies can be devised to disrupt their life cycle in the vector or to interfere with their transmission to mammalian hosts. The primary impediment to developing strategies for disruption of trypanosome life cycles in the tsetse is a lack of understanding of the molecular basis of trypanosome-tsetse interactions. In alternating between their mammalian hosts and tsetse vectors, trypanosomes are subject to dramatic changes in environment. Therefore, it is not surprising that their response, in terms of metabolism and surface architecture, is equally dramatic. Several major surface molecules have been identified on insect forms of Trypanosoma brucei ssp. (3Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schürch N. Bütikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and on T. congolense (4Beecroft R.P. Roditi I. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem.

Although some of these molecules have been extensively studied, no functional role has been assigned to any of them.All of the trypanosome surface proteins so far described are anchored to the surface membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (9Ferguson M.A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During all life cycle stages, the trypanosomes are covered with a continuous dense monolayer of proteins and glycoproteins proposed to protect the parasite from the host immune system or from the proteolytic environment of the tsetse (10Roditi I.

In addition, a role for surface molecules in ligand-associated parasite vector signaling involved in programmed cell death has been proposed (12Pearson T.W. Beecroft R.P. Welburn S.C. Ruepp S.

Both BSFs and metacyclic forms of trypanosomes express a dense surface coat of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) molecules (13Vickerman K. J. Cell Sci. 1969; 5: 163-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that shields non-variant underlying membrane proteins and protects them from host immune responses.

https://openalex.org/W2036237909,"Early marine migratory behaviour and apparent survival of hatchery-reared Seymour River steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) smolts was examined over a four year period (2006-2009) to assess the impact of various management strategies on improving early marine survival. Acoustically tagged smolts were released to measure their survival using estuary and coastal marine receivers forming components of the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) array. Early marine survival was statistically indistinguishable between releases of summer run and winter run steelhead races, night and day releases, and groups released 10 days apart. In 2009, the survival of summer run steelhead released into the river was again trialed against groups released directly into the ocean at a distance from the river mouth. Apparent survival was improved significantly for the ocean released groups. The health and physiological status of the various release groups were monitored in years 2007-2009, and results indicate that the fish were in good health, with no clinical signs of disease at the time of release. The possibility of a disease event contributing to early marine mortality was further examined in 2009 by vaccinating half of the released fish against common fish diseases (vibriosis, furunculosis). The results suggest that marine survival may be enhanced using this approach, although not to the extent observed when the smolts were transported away from the river mouth before release. In summary, direct experimental testing of different release strategies using the POST array to measure ocean survival accelerated the scientific process by allowing rapid collection of data which enabled the rejection of several existing theories and allowed tentative identification of several new alternative approaches that might improve early marine survival of Seymour River steelhead."
https://openalex.org/W2060379847,"Owing to their potential for systematic analysis, complex networks have been widely used in proteomics. Representing a protein structure as a topology network provides novel insight into understanding protein folding mechanisms, stability and function. Here, we develop a new feature to reveal correlations between residues using a protein structure network. In an original attempt to quantify the effects of several key residues on catalytic residues, a power function was used to model interactions between residues. The results indicate that focusing on a few residues is a feasible approach to identifying catalytic residues. The spatial environment surrounding a catalytic residue was analyzed in a layered manner. We present evidence that correlation between residues is related to their distance apart most environmental parameters of the outer layer make a smaller contribution to prediction and ii catalytic residues tend to be located near key positions in enzyme folds. Feature analysis revealed satisfactory performance for our features, which were combined with several conventional features in a prediction model for catalytic residues using a comprehensive data set from the Catalytic Site Atlas. Values of 88.6 for sensitivity and 88.4 for specificity were obtained by 10fold crossvalidation. These results suggest that these features reveal the mutual dependence of residues and are promising for further study of structurefunction relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2085784145,"Protein domains that act as degradation and stabilization signals regulate the rate of turnover of proteasomal substrates. Here we report that the bipartite Gly-Arg repeat of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 acts as a stabilization signal that inhibits proteasomal degradation in the nucleus by promoting binding to cellular DNA. Protection can be transferred by grafting the domain to unrelated proteasomal substrates and does not involve changes of ubiquitylation. Protection is also afforded by other protein domains that, similar to the Gly-Arg repeat, mediate high avidity binding to DNA, as exemplified by resistance to detergent extraction. Our findings identify high avidity binding to DNA as a portable inhibitory signal that counteracts proteasomal degradation. Protein domains that act as degradation and stabilization signals regulate the rate of turnover of proteasomal substrates. Here we report that the bipartite Gly-Arg repeat of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 acts as a stabilization signal that inhibits proteasomal degradation in the nucleus by promoting binding to cellular DNA. Protection can be transferred by grafting the domain to unrelated proteasomal substrates and does not involve changes of ubiquitylation. Protection is also afforded by other protein domains that, similar to the Gly-Arg repeat, mediate high avidity binding to DNA, as exemplified by resistance to detergent extraction. Our findings identify high avidity binding to DNA as a portable inhibitory signal that counteracts proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the turnover of regulatory proteins and the disposal of aberrant polypeptides (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). The efficiency of proteasomal degradation is regulated by at least three features of the substrate (2Finley D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 477-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Constitutive or conditional degradation signals act as recruitment sites for ubiquitin ligases that mediate the conjugation of polyubiquitin tags that target the substrate to the proteasome (3Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In addition, efficient degradation requires the presence of unstructured domains of discrete length that anchor the substrate to the proteasome and serve as initiation sites for unfolding and translocation in the catalytic chamber of the protease (4Schrader E.K. Harstad K.G. Matouschek A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Verhoef L.G. Heinen C. Selivanova A. Halff E.F. Salomons F.A. Dantuma N.P. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally, proteolysis is regulated by signals that delay or block the activity of the proteasome. Similar to degradation signals, stabilization signals are modular domains whose removal accelerates protein turnover, whereas their grafting to unrelated proteasome substrates results in complete or partial inhibition of proteolysis (6Dantuma N.P. Masucci M.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The regulation of different steps of the proteolytic process by modular domains can be exploited to control proteolysis in a space- and time-dependent manner, as recently illustrated by the use of a conditional mutant Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) degradation signal that is inactivated by the small-molecule ligand trimethoprim (7Iwamoto M.

In addition to the GAr, other features of EBNA1 regulate its degradation by the proteasome because a GAr-deleted protein remains relatively stable (17Holowaty M.N. Zeghouf M. Wu H. Tellam J.

We have addressed this issue by monitoring the turnover of wild type and GAr-deleted EBNA1 (EBNA1-ΔGA) in different cellular compartments. We found that in the absence of the GAr, EBNA1 is stable in the nucleus but is efficiently degraded by the proteasome in the cytoplasm. The stability of nuclear EBNA1 was dependent on the presence of a bipartite Gly-Arg repeat (GRr) domain that tethers the protein to cellular DNA. Grafting the GRr or other protein domains that confer detergent-resistant binding to DNA inhibited the degradation of a short-lived proteasomal substrate without interfering with ubiquitylation. Thus, our findings identify high avidity binding to DNA as a portable inhibitory signal that counteracts proteasomal degradation.

The immunoglobulin variable κ light chain 3–20 (VK) cloned in the pET-26b(+) vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA) was provided by Riccardo Dolcetti (Oncology Reference Center, Aviano, Italy). VK was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-ACAAGCTTCTCGAGGAAATTGTGTTGACGCAGTCT-3′ and 5′-GCGCGCGGCCGCCTATGGTCGACCTCTATCTAGATCTTTGATTTCCAC-3′, and the fragment was cloned in the HindIII and NotI sites of pBK-CMV generating pBK-CMV-VK. The GA239 coding sequence was subsequently cloned in the SalI/NotI sites generating pBK-CMV-VKGA. VK and VKGA were subcloned in the HindIII/NotI sites of p3×FLAG-CMVTM-10 (Sigma-Aldrich) for eukaryotic expression.

AT1/2-VK and AT1/3-VK were generated by mutagenesis using the primer pairs 5′-AGCGAAGTGCCAAGCAAAAACAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGTTTTTGCTTGGCACTTCGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCAAAAACAAGCTCGAGGAAATT-3′ and 5′-AATTTCCTCGAGCTTGTTTTTGCT-3′. Semiconfluent monolayers of HeLa cells grown in 60-mm Petri dishes were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmid. After 24 h, each plate was split into two and cultured for an additional 24 h. One plate of each duplicate was treated with 10 μm MG132 for 6 h before lysis. To break non-covalent protein interactions, the cells were lysed for 30 min at room temperature in 100 μl of denaturing buffer containing: 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors. The lysates were then diluted 10 times with a non-denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors). Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and equal amounts of proteins were incubated for 2 h with an anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel (A-2220; Sigma) followed by elution with a 3×FLAG peptide (F-4799; Sigma). Western blots were carried out as described, and the membranes were sequentially probed with anti-ubiquitin Lys-48, anti-ubiquitin, and anti-FLAG specific antibody. Short-term protein turnover was assayed by chase in medium containing 60 μg/ml CHX. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors), and protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The lysates were fractionated in NUPAGE® Novex® Bis-Tris precast gels (Invitrogen) and blotted on 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences Hybond ECL, GE Healthcare,). After staining with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies, immunocomplexes were detected by chemiluminescence (PIERCE®ECL, Thermo Scientific). Long-term protein turnover was assayed in conditional transfectants after the addition of 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The dilution effect of cell proliferation was accounted for by monitoring the number of live cells by trypan blue dye exclusion. HeLa cells grown on round cover slides were transfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated plasmid using the JetPej kit. After 48 h, the slides were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min followed by permeabilization and blocking for 30 min in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA in PBS. Where indicated, detergent extraction was performed before fixation by incubating the slides for 5 min on ice in buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm d-glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7. After staining at room temperature for 1 h with anti-FLAG or anti-EBNA1 antibodies and for 1 h with the appropriate FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, the slides were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Digital images were captured using a LEITZ-DMRB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with Adobe Photoshop©. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. of three or more experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, two-way analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation coefficient. p values ≤0.05 were considered as significant. Conditional transfectants of the BJAB-tTA cell line were generated to examine the short- and long-term turnover of EBNA1 and EBNA1-ΔGA. The polypeptides were not detected by Western blots in transfected cells cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml Dox but were rapidly expressed upon Dox removal, reaching comparable plateau levels with 8–10 days of culture (Fig. 1A). Short-term protein turnover was assessed by CHX chase in cells expressing steady state levels of EBNA1 or EBNA1-ΔGA (Fig. 1B). The intensities of the specific bands detected in Western blots probed with the EBNA1 specific antibody OT-1x were virtually unchanged during 9 h of chase, indicating that both EBNA1 and EBNA1-ΔGA are long-lived proteins. CHX treatment may affect the turnover of proteasomal substrates by altering the expression of short-lived components of the proteolytic machinery. To address this possible artifact, we took advantage of the regulated expression of EBNA1 and EBNA-ΔGA that allows rapid shutoff of transcription by the addition of Dox and long-term monitoring of protein turnover under physiologic conditions. Representative Western blots illustrating protein decay over a period of 72 h are shown in Fig. 1C, and the relative rate of decay expressed as EBNA1-ΔGA/EBNA1 ratio in three independent experiments is summarized in Fig. 1D. Taking into account the dilution effect of cell proliferation, both EBNA1 and EBNA1-ΔGA appeared to be long-lived. However, although most of the input EBNA1 was recovered after 72 h, EBNA1-ΔGA exhibited a faster turnover with 50% decrease relative to EBNA1 in ∼24 h and 90% decrease within 72 h (p = 0.0028). Thus, although the GAr appears to be required for full stabilization, other properties of EBNA1 participate in the regulation of protein turnover. Because EBNA1 is a nuclear protein and binds to cellular DNA (22Leight E.R. Sugden B. Rev. Med. Virol. 2000; 10: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we tested whether these features may account for the inefficient degradation of EBNA1-ΔGA. The nuclear import of EBNA1 is dependent on the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) located between amino acids 379 and 387 of the prototype B95.8 encoded protein and on interaction with importin-α (23Kitamura R. Sekimoto T. Ito S. Harada S. Yamagata H. Masai H. Yoneda Y. Yanagi K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1979-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of nuclear localization on EBNA1 stability, an E1-ΔGA/NLS mutant was generated by deleting the NLS from EBNA1-ΔGA. Staining of transiently transfected HeLa cells with the EBNA1 specific antibody K67.3 confirmed that E1-ΔGA/NLS accumulates in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Representative Western blots illustrating the decay of EBNA1, EBNA1-ΔGA, and EBNA1-ΔGA/NLS in a 9-h CHX chase are shown in Fig. 2B, and the amount of residual polypeptides calculated from the densitometry of three independent experiments is shown in Fig. 2C. Cytosolic EBNA1-ΔGA/NLS was efficiently cleared with a half-life of ∼4 h, which is significantly shorter than the ∼24 h estimated for EBNA1-ΔGA and the more than 72 h estimated for EBNA1 (compare Fig. 1, C and D). The rapid decay of EBNA1-ΔGA/NLS was prevented by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2D), indicating that EBNA1-ΔGA is a proteasome substrate in the cytoplasm. To further address the role of the GAr in the regulation of protein turnover, we took advantage of the previously reported position-independent effect of the GAr (10Sharipo A. Imreh M. Leonchiks A. Imreh S. Masucci M.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Dantuma N.P. Heessen S. Lindsten K. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8381-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to generate E1-ΔGA/NLS chimeras containing GAr of different length fused at the C terminus (Fig. 3A). The chimeras maintained the cytosolic localization of E1-ΔGA/NLS (not shown) but were fully protected from proteasomal degradation (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, although confirming the capacity of the GAr to inhibit proteasomal degradation and supporting our earlier conclusion that EBNA1-ΔGA is a competent proteasomal substrate, these findings identify subcellular localization as an important determinant of EBNA1 turnover. EBNA1 interacts to cellular DNA through a bipartite GRr domain that flanks the GAr on both sides and anchors the protein to mitotic chromosomes, which is required for correct partitioning of the viral episomes in replicating cells (24Kapoor P. Frappier L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6946-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The two chromosome binding subdomains of the GRr were shown to be AT-hooks (25Sears J. Ujihara M. Wong S. Ott C. Middeldorp J. Aiyar A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11487-11505Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a DNA binding motif found in the architectural transcription factors of the high mobility group A (HMGA) family (25Sears J. Ujihara M. Wong S. Ott C. Middeldorp J. Aiyar A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11487-11505Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 27Reeves R. Gene. 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). To test whether binding to DNA affects protein stability, an EBNA1-ΔGA/GR polypeptide was expressed in HeLa cells. The subcellular localization of the mutant polypeptide is shown in Fig. 4A, a representative Western blot illustrating protein decay in a 9-h CHX chase is shown in Fig. 4B, and the amount of residual protein calculated from the densitometry of three independent experiments is shown in Fig. 4C. In line with the continued presence of the NLS, EBNA1-ΔGA/GR retained a predominant nuclear localization. Deletion of the GRr was associated with accelerated protein turnover corresponding to a half-life of ∼4 h. Protein degradation was inhibited by the addition of MG132 (Fig. 4D), supporting the conclusion that in the absence of the GAr, binding to DNA via the GRr may be sufficient to protect EBNA1 from proteasomal degradation. To further explore the effect of the GRr, an EBNA1 fragment encompassing the two subdomains located on either side of the GAr (Fig. 1A) was fused to an immunoglobulin VK polypeptide that is efficiently degraded by the proteasome (Fig. 5A) and, due to the small size, can freely diffuse in and out of the nucleus. FLAG-VK chimeras containing the GAr (VK-GA), the nuclear localization signal of EBNA1 (NLS-VK), the bipartite GRr domain (GR1/2-VK), or both the NLS and the GRr (GR1/2-NLS-VK) (Fig. 5B) were compared for their subcellular localization and rate of turnover in a 6-h CHX chase. In accordance with the small size, VK and VK-GA were evenly distributed throughout the cell, and insertion of the NLS induced nuclear accumulation, as expected (Fig. 5C). The GR1/2-VK chimera showed exclusive nuclear localization even in the absence of the NLS (Fig. 5C), indicating that the GRr is sufficient to tether the protein to cellular DNA, which was further supported by the virtually exclusive association of the chimera to mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 5, D and E). Insertion of the NLS alone did not affect the turnover of VK, which remained well below 2 h, whereas insertion of the GRr stabilized VK as efficiently as insertion of the GAr (Fig. 5, F and G). Thus, the GAr and GRr serve as independent cis-acting stabilization signals that inhibit proteasomal degradation. The GRr binds to cellular DNA via AT-hook-like motifs that interact with AT-rich regions in the minor groove of DNA (27Reeves R. Gene. 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). To obtain independent evidence for the effect of DNA binding on protein stabilization, we compared the effect of a set of known chromatin binding domains. To this end, FLAG-VK was fused to the AT-hook of HMGA-1a (AT1/2/3), the A/B box of HMGB-1 (A/B box), and histone H1, which interact with partially overlapping sites in the minor groove (28Hill D.A. Reeves R. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3523-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and with the DNA-targeting module of histone-lysine N-methyl-transferase SUV4-20h2 (SUV-DBD), which interacts with pericentric heterochromatin (29Souza P.P. Völkel P. Trinel D. Vandamme J. Rosnoblet C. Héliot L. Angrand P.O. BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Although HMGA and HMGB proteins are highly mobile in the nucleus, as determined in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays (30Harrer M. Lührs H. Bustin M. Scheer U. Hock R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3459-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), histone H1 and SUV4-20h2 are virtually immobile (29Souza P.P. Völkel P. Trinel D. Vandamme J. Rosnoblet C. Héliot L. Angrand P.O. BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Catez F. Yang H. Tracey K.J. Reeves R. Misteli T. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As expected, fusion of histone H1, the AT-hook of HMGAa1, and SUV-DBD at the N terminus of VK induced exclusive nuclear localization, whereas A/B box-VK showed some residual cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 6B, left panels). To further discriminate between different types of DNA binding, fluorescence assays were also performed on cells treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 prior to fixation, which extracts proteins loosely bound to chromatin (32Jung Y. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This treatment reduced significantly the nuclear fluorescence of A/B box-VK and SUV-DBD-VK, whereas the fluorescence of GR1/2-VK, AT1/2/3-VK, and H1-VK remained unchanged (Fig. 6, B, right panels, and C), suggesting higher binding avidity. When protein turnover was assayed by CHX chase, the GR1/2, AT1/2/3, and histone H1 protected VK from proteasomal degradation, whereas the SUV-DBD and A/B box had negligible effects (Fig. 6, D and E). A strong positive correlation (r = 0.94654) was observed by plotting the amount of residual fluorescence following Triton X-100 extraction versus the amount of residual protein after a 6-h CHX chase (Fig. 6F), suggesting that the capacity of the domains to inhibit proteasomal degradation is directly proportional to their capacity to induce high avidity binding to DNA. To explore this possibility further, we took advantage of the previous finding that the architecture of the GRr and AT-hook, fashioning multiple properly spaced DNA binding motifs, is required for high avidity interaction with DNA (30Harrer M. Lührs H. Bustin M. Scheer U. Hock R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3459-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and constructed FLAG-VK"

Our crystal structure showed that BlcR folded into the DNA- and SSA-binding domains and dimerized via the DNA-binding domains. Mutational analysis identified residues, including Phe(147), that are important for SSA association; BlcR(F147A) existed as tetramer. Two BlcR dimers bound to target DNA and in a cooperative manner, and the distance between the two BlcR-binding sequences in DNA was critical for BlcR-DNA association. Tetrameric BlcR(F147A) retained DNA binding activity, and importantly, this activity was not affected by the distance separating the BlcR-binding sequences in DNA. SSA did not dissociate tetrameric BlcR(F147A) or BlcR(F147A)-DNA. As well as in the SSA-binding site, Phe(147) is located in a structurally flexible loop that may be involved in BlcR oligomerization. We propose that SSA regulates BlcR DNA-binding function via oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2032755961,"Context-dependent adjustment of mating tactics can drastically increase the mating success of behaviourally flexible animals. We used the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior as a model system to study adaptive adjustment of male mating tactics. This species shows a male diphenism of wingless fighter males and peaceful winged males. Whereas the wingless males stay and exclusively mate in the maternal colony, the mating behaviour of winged males is plastic. They copulate with female sexuals in their natal nests early in life but later disperse in search for sexuals outside. In this study, we observed the nest-leaving behaviour of winged males under different conditions and found that they adaptively adjust the timing of their dispersal to the availability of mating partners, as well as the presence, and even the type of competitors in their natal nests. In colonies with virgin female queens winged males stayed longest when they were the only male in the nest. They left earlier when mating partners were not available or when other males were present. In the presence of wingless, locally mating fighter males, winged males dispersed earlier than in the presence of docile, winged competitors. This suggests that C. obscurior males are capable of estimating their local breeding chances and adaptively adjust their dispersal behaviour in both an opportunistic and a risk-sensitive way, thus showing hitherto unknown behavioural plasticity in social insect males."
