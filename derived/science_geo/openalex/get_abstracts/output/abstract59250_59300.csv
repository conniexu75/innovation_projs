https://openalex.org/W1580575515,"Abstract Fresh chicken liver contains two types of superoxide dismutase, one of which is localized in the mitochondria while the other is found in the cytosol. The mitochondrial superoxide dismutase was inactivated by treatment with mixtures of chloroform and ethanol whereas the cytosol superoxide dismutase was not. The cytosol superoxide dismutase was inhibited by cyanide, whereas the mitochondrial enzyme was not. The cytosol superoxide dismutase was purified to homogeneity and was found to contain copper and zinc and to be similar to the other cupro-zinc superoxide dismutases which have been isolated from diverse eukaryotes. In contrast, the superoxide dismutase present in chicken liver mitochondria, when isolated, was found to a manganoprotein which has a molecular weight of 80,000. It is composed of four subunits of equal size, which are not covalently joined. It contains 2.3 atoms of manganese per molecule and is strikingly similar to the superoxide dismutase previously isolated from bacteria (Keele, B. B., Jr., McCord, J. M., and Fridovich, I. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 6176–6181; Vance, P. G., Keele, B. B., Jr., and Rajagopalan, K. V. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 4782–4786). Avimanganin which was isolated from chicken liver mitochondria (Scrutton, M. C. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 3897–3905) appears to be an inactive form of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase. The similarity between the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and the corresponding enzymes from Escherichia coli and from Streptococcus mutans and the marked dissimilarity to the superoxide dismutase found in the cytosols of eukaryotes lends support to the theory that mitochondria have evolved from aerobic prokaryotes, which entered into an endocellular symbiosis with a protoeukaryote. Chicken liver was not unique in possessing distinct superoxide dismutases in cytosol and in mitochondrial compartments, since the same situation was shown to occur in pig heart. The chicken liver cytosol superoxide dismutase exhibited two peculiar properties. Thus when stored in deep, concentrated solutions it underwent autoreduction to a yellow cuprous form which retained enzymatic activity, and it polymerized to forms which likewise retained activity. Both of these changes were reversible and appeared to be due to reactive sulfhydryl groups which could act as the endogenous reductant and could form intermolecular disulfide bridges. The cytosol superoxide dismutase consisted of a family of electrophoretically distinct forms which could readily be separated on a preparative scale by isoelectric focusing. These multiple forms were indistinguishable in size and in specific activity. The chemical basis of these differences in charge was not explored."

https://openalex.org/W1544426283,"Abstract Liver and kidney organelles from rat and pig were separated by isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation and located by marker enzymes. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase was shown to be exclusively a mitochondrial enzyme. In liver, approximately 52% of carnitine acetyltransferase activity was mitochondrial, 14% peroxisomal, and 34% located in a lipid-rich membranous fraction. Microsomes were a component of this last fraction and, when isolated by differential centrifugation, contained carnitine acetyltransferase activity. This enzyme has not previously been reported to be in peroxisomes. The specific activity of carnitine acetyltransferase in liver peroxisomes was two to three times greater than in the mitochondria or microsomes. Partial fractionation of broken rat liver peroxisomes into core, membranes, and the soluble matrix indicated that carnitine acetyltransferase had a similar distribution to the matrix enzyme, catalase. In gradients of rat and pig kidney, carnitine acetyltransferase was found primarily in the mitochondrial fractions. This enzyme was also not detected in microbodies, mitochondria, or microsomes from plants. Carnitine acetyltransferase activity in liver fractions was confirmed by three separate assays—an 1(-)-carnitine-dependent release of coenzyme A (CoA) from acetyl-CoA, identification of the 14C-labeled reaction product acetylcarnitine, and the 1(-)-acetylcarnitine-dependent formation of acetyl-CoA from CoA. Carnitine acyltransferase activity for octanoyl-CoA in hepatic peroxisomes and microsomes was about equal to activity for acetyl-CoA. In the mitochondria, activity for octanoyl-CoA was six times greater than for acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1567886333,"The data on cyanide-insensitive respiration previously presented as well as additional results are discussed from the point of view of control of respiration in plant mitochondria. It is shown that the results are inconsistent with certain mechanisms for control of the alternate pathway rate. The control cannot be exerted through the oxidation-reduction state of the cytochromes or the mitochondrial energy state. If only irreversible reactions are considered, simple competition between the alternate pathway and the cytochrome pathway also fails to explain the data. The simplest explanation consistent with the known characteristics of the plant respiratory chain requires postulating a reversible equilibrium between two components in the flavoprotein region of the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W2048883785,"Contaminating particles which are ferromagnetic have been found in the human body. Their distribution was measured by applying an external magnetic field to the torso for a short time, and then, in a shielded room, mapping the steady magnetic field around the torso due to the magnetized particles. Maps of subjects show various distributions, including particles in the stomach from food cans and in the lungs from are welding. The fields from these two sources are strong enough to be detected with a flux-gate magnetometer, without the need for a shielded room. This simplicity of detection of larger amounts of ferromagnetic contamination suggests that this method may be used in two applications: in detecting the presence of large amounts of asbestos (ferromagnetic and harmful) in the lungs of asbestos workers, and in tests of the condition of the lung where FE(3)O(4) dust (ferromagnetic and harmless) would be used as an inhaled tracer material."

https://openalex.org/W1544070843,"Abstract Whole rabbit reticulocytes synthesize, in addition to globin, six predominant protein species. Lysates, free of whole cells or membranes, synthesize precisely the same proteins in nearly the same relative amounts. In cell-free extracts initiation of synthesis of all non-globin and globin species is inhibited by deprivation of hemin or by addition of 10-2 µg per ml of double-stranded RNA. Similarly, translation of an exogenous viral mRNA, prepared from reovirus, also requires hemin and also is inhibited by double-stranded RNA. Experiments using inhibitors of polypeptide chain elongation indicate that the amounts of mRNAs coding for the non-globin proteins do limit the amount of synthesis of these proteins. Furthermore, individual molecules of mRNA which code for certain non-globin proteins can initiate protein synthesis as much as four times as often as do those which code for other reticulocyte proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1966590978,"WE believe that the energy requirements of man and his balance of intake and expenditure are not known. Paradoxically, we conclude this from results of the increasingly sophisticated studies of food intake and energy expenditure which show that in any group of twenty or more subjects, with similar attributes and activities, food intake can vary as much as two-fold1–5. In those surveys where both intake and expenditure are measured, there is often good agreement between the two estimates for the average of the group, but usually very large discrepancies between individual intake and individual expenditure. The results of careful studies in a number of countries suggest that some people, perhaps through some mechanism of adaptation, are able to be healthy and active on energy intakes which, by current standards, would be regarded as inadequate. On the other hand, there are also studies in which subjects have been given large quantities of additional food with little or no increase in body weight6,7. In contrast, there are the difficulties experienced by the obese in reducing body weight in spite of a drastic reduction of food intake, and the well recognized fact that many fat people eat no more, and sometimes less, than those who are not obese. These observations underline the extent of our ignorance about the mechanisms by which energy balance is maintained."

https://openalex.org/W1979079068,"Correction of errors in localizing movements produced by laterally displacing vision by means of wedge prisms has been termed ""prism adaptation."" Intermanual transfer of prism adaptation from an exposed to an unexposed hand, with subject's head immobilized, has been reported not to occur. However, it was found that a standard learning variable, distribution of practice, controls the occurrence or nonoccurrence of transfer. When practice is massed, there is no transfer of adaptation; when it is spaced, the transfer is extensive. Spacing of practice also influences the amount of aftereffect displayed by the exposed hand."
https://openalex.org/W1556547151,"Abstract Mucin-type glycoprotein material was fractionated by gel filtration after cleavage from viable TA3-Ha mouse mammary adenocarcinoma ascites cells by a modified trypsin. The macromolecular species present in each fraction were characterized by electron microscopy of metal-contrasted replicas as highly asymmetric rods. Investigation of one fraction gave close agreement for length by electron microscopic measurements and for a length calculated for a single polypeptide backbone model from a molecular weight value by short column sedimentation equilibrium, amino acid composition, and percentage of protein. This result supports a single, extended chain configuration for this fraction. With this value of molecular weight per unit length, approximate molecular weights of particles of the other fractions were calculated. Lengths of polypeptide chains varied from 50 nm (55,000 daltons) to greater than 700 nm, suggesting an average molecular weight for one fraction of over 500,000."

https://openalex.org/W1503071920,"Abstract Antibodies to chromatographically purified rat thymus F1 histone subfractions were induced in rabbits by immunization with histone-RNA complexes. The immunological relatedness between each of the rat thymus F1 subfractions and subfractions derived chromatographically from calf thymus and rat liver F1 was determined by quantitative micro-complement fixation. The various rat thymus peaks elicited specific antibodies; in cross-reactions with these antibodies, indices of dissimilarity between cross-reacting and homologous subfractions ranged from 1.5 to over 20. It could be calculated that some of the peaks have sequence differences as high as 20%. None of the rat thymus subfractions corresponded immunologically to calf thymus subfractions. The highest interspecies cross-reactivity was found with antisera to rat thymus Peak II, where the indices of dissimilarity with calf thymus Peaks I to III were 4.0, 2.1, and 1.6, respectively. The ranges of sequence differences between rat and calf thymus were similar to those detected between rat thymus peaks. Comparison of rat thymus and rat liver F1 subfractions reveals that the organ specificity in F1 seems to be of a lower order than the species specificity. The only definitely distinct subfraction was rat thymus Peak I. Other thymus subfractions had close homologues in the liver."

https://openalex.org/W122120889,"Abstract The uptake of propionate by the isolated perfused rat liver is not influenced by oleate or glucagon. However, glucagon does stimulate glucose production in the presence of 10 mm propionate and increases the incorporation of isotope from [14C]propionate into glucose. These observations have been interpreted to indicate a sparing of the metabolism of propionate in the citric acid cycle by endogenous materials. As others have noted, propionate inhibits gluconeogenesis from lactate in the perfused liver. Studies of the influence of glucagon and oleate on glucose production from a mixture of propionate and lactate suggest that glucagon is acting at some point in common with the metabolism of propionate and lactate, whereas oleate selectively stimulates gluconeogenesis from lactate."
https://openalex.org/W1499790858,"Abstract Serine transhydroxymethylase was shown to catalyze the synthesis of l-serine from glycine and formaldehyde in the absence of tetrahydrofolate. Initial velocity, product inhibition, and exchange reaction studies showed that the addition of substrates was ordered, with glycine adding first. The effect of tetrahydrofolate on increasing the rate of serine synthesis was correlated with the effect of this coenzyme on the exchange of the α-hydrogen of glycine with protons of the solvent. The data were interpreted to mean that formaldehyde is transferred from serine to 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate through an intermediate enzyme-formaldehyde complex."

https://openalex.org/W1534248483,"Abstract The ion movements accompanying the mercurial-induced energized ejection of protons in beef heart mitochondria have been analyzed. These are of two kinds: symport movement of anions (as yet unidentified) and antiport movement of monovalent cations such as potassium. Thus in the massive energized ejection of protons induced by fluorescein mercuric acetate, the molar ratio of potassium ion taken up to proton released (potassium to proton ratio) is about 0.2. This ratio has been shown to reflect a balance between two processes: potassium-proton exchange with a ratio of 1.0 and extrusion of potassium and a chaotropic anion simultaneous with the exchange which can in the limit lower the ratio to 0. The nature of the ion movements accompanying the energized proton ejection induced by gramicidin can be modified by variation in the concentration of ionophore. At low concentration potassium-proton exchange predominates (K+:H+ ratio close to 1), whereas at higher concentrations, both symport and antiport ion movements take place (K+:H+ ratio about 0.2). It has been concluded that the induction of proton ejection by fluorescein mercuric acetate involves the release in the membrane phase of an ionophore specific for monovalent cations which permits proton-potassium exchange. When this exchange cannot take place for lack of an ionophore, energized proton release is interdicted. The induction of endogenous ionophore by fluorescein mercuric acetate permits not only energized, but also nonenergized potassium-proton exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1552311851,"Abstract Primer-template complexes were prepared by annealing synthetic deoxyribopolynucleotides with nucleotide sequences corresponding to the 3' end of transfer ribonucleic acidtyr to the r strand of φ80psuiii DNA, which contains the tRNAtyr gene (2). Using these systems, the nucleotide sequence beyond the 3' end of the primers was determined by the DNA polymerase I-catalyzed addition of nucleotides by using a restricted number of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates. In agreement with Altman and Smith (3), it was found that the sequence C-C-A is encoded in the tRNAtyr gene. The sequence of the 12 nucleotides following the C-C-A end was shown to be T-C-A-A-C-T-T-T-C-A-A-A."
https://openalex.org/W1579954276,"Abstract Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase has previously been shown to lose its ability to catalyze phosphoryl transfer when an essential lysyl e-amino group in each of the 4 subunits is converted to the N-trinitrophenyl derivative or when an essential sulfhydryl group in each of the 4 subunits is converted to a disulfide. The two modified forms have been examined for their ability to bind Mn2+ and substrates and to catalyze the detritiation of pyruvate, a partial reaction. Both forms bind four Mn2+ ions with an affinity indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme. The disulfide enzyme shows an order of magnitude decrease in the enhanced effect of the bound Mn2+ on the proton relaxation rate of water. Analysis of the temperature and frequency dependencies of the relaxation rates indicates this lowering of enhancement to be due to a decrease in both the number and the exchange rate of rapidly exchangeable water protons on the enzyme-bound Mn2+. The rate of water exchange decreases by two orders of magnitude. The trinitrophenyl-enzyme shows no significant change in the enhancement factor. Ternary enzyme-Mn2+-phosphoenolpyruvate complexes are detected with both modified enzymes. The affinity of the trinitrophenylenzyme-Mn2+ complex for phosphoenolpyruvate is unaltered but the affinity of the disulfide form for phosphoenolpyruvate is decreased by one order of magnitude. No indication of a ternary enzyme-Mn2+-ADP complex is detected with the lysine modification by proton relaxation titrations. With both modifications the ATP-activated detritiation of pyruvate is almost completely inhibited but the Pi-activated detritiation of pyruvate is preserved. With the trinitrophenylenzyme the Km of pyruvate and the Vmax of the detritiation reaction are indistinguishable from those of the native enzyme. With the disulfide modification, however, the Km of pyruvate is increased 3-fold and the Vmax is decreased by 26%. No evidence of ATP binding to the disulfideenzyme is obtained as judged by the effect of ATP on the phosphate-activated detritiation. It is therefore suggested that the sulfhydryl and lysine residues which are modified are both involved in the binding of nucleotides to the enzyme and that the sulfhydryl group is closer to, but not directly at, the Mn2+- and phosphoenolpyruvate-binding sites."

Their theory proposes that attack by electrophilic oxygen, produced in the hydroxylase system, occurs at the 6 position of the hydrocarbon to give a carbonium ion, localized primarily at the 1 and 3 positions, which can undergo attack with nucleophilic cellular components. Alternatively, initial attack could occur at 1 or 3, followed by nucleophilic reaction at 6."

https://openalex.org/W2036932768,Between January 1969 and August 1972 4 national Gallup surveys were conducted among white men and women of voting age as a part of a project to collect and analyze public attitudes on population issues. Public support for educational efforts in high school has been relatively high among men over the entire time period but during the past 2 years feminine assent has been increasing with 71% of each sex by August 1972 favoring birth control education in public high schools. The least approval came from less advantaged groups but the differential by educational level in 1972 compared to 1969 has become a minor instead of a major cleavage. Approval for making birth control services available to teenage girls was found in slightly more than 1/2 of the population. Among men approval increased 25% between 1969 and 1972; among women 77%. Among groups where the young are most in need of free birth control services such as the less advantaged approval though increasing is still low. In August 1972 less than 1/3 of white adult Americans regarded premarital relations as permissable. 65% of men and 42% of women under age 30 were permissive toward premarital relations as contrasted to 21% of men and 12% of women aged 45 or over. In effect the increase in approval of birth control services seems more to reflect a rise in permissiveness than pragmatism. There were no significant differences between Catholics and non-Catholics in any area of these surveys.

https://openalex.org/W2077645315,"THE diving reflex described for many species of animals involves a reduction in heart rate and the redistribution of blood flow to various tissues. Available evidence1,2 indicates that cardiac output decreases and that arterial pressure increases only modestly or remains unchanged during a dive. Flow measurements using restrained animals have tended to show cessation of flow to the kidney3,4 with diving. But it is well accepted that differences in these responses will exist with restrained and frightened animals as opposed to trained or free ranging animals. We investigated peripheral blood flow in a trained sea lion (Zalophus californiaus) by measuring the renal flow response to face immersion in water. Several months before surgery, the female sea lion was trained to place her head into a bucket, either empty or filled with water, and to remain in that position until otherwise commanded. During training, the animal wore a harness to which the necessary electronics were later attached."

Part of the challenge rests on the demonstration that a factor capable of blocking anti-self reaction is present in the serum, and part on in vitro studies indicating that cells capable of anti-self reaction occur in mice and rats. The studies with mice used chimaeras, also known as allophenic or tetraparental mice, which are made by fusing morulae of different genotypes. It is probably too early to say whether the forbidden-clone theory has been dethroned, but it may be pointed out that the studies with chimaeras are open to objection. As chimaeras may again be used for work of this nature, this objection is perhaps worth stating."
