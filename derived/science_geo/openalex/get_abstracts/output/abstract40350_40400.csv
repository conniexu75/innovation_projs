https://openalex.org/W1996024432,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) is tropic for human T cells with the helper-inducer phenotype, as defined by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies specific for the T4 molecule. Treatment of T4+ T cells with monoclonal antibodies to T4 antigen blocks HTLV-III/LAV binding, syncytia formation, and infectivity. Thus, it has been inferred that the T4 molecule itself is a virus receptor. In the present studies, the surfaces of T4+ T cells were labeled radioactively, and then the cells were exposed to virus. After the cells were lysed, HTLV-III/LAV antibodies were found to precipitate a surface protein with a molecular weight of 58,000 (58K). By blocking and absorption experiments, this 58K protein was identified as the T4 molecule. No cell-surface structures other than the T4 molecule were involved in the antibody-antigen complex formation. Two monoclonal antibodies, each reactive with a separate epitope of the T4 molecule, were tested for their binding capacities in the presence of HTLV-III/LAV. When HTLV-III/LAV was bound to T4+ T cells, the virus blocked the binding of one of the monoclonal antibodies, T4A (OKT4A), but not of the other, T4 (OKT4). When HTLV-III/LAV was internally radiolabeled and bound to T4+ T cells which were then lysed, a viral glycoprotein of 110K (gp110) coprecipitated with the T4 molecule. The binding of gp110 to the T4 molecule may thus be a major factor in HTLV-III/LAV tropism and may prove useful in developing therapeutic or preventive measures for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2004215286,"Introduction of torsional stress into active chromatin domains requires that linear DNA molecules be anchored in vivo to impede free rotation. While searching for these anchorage elements, we have localized a nuclear matrix association region (MAR) within the mouse immunoglobulin kappa gene that contains two topoisomerase II sites and is adjacent to the tissue-specific enhancer. The same matrix contact occurs when the kappa locus is in germ-line (inactive) or rear-ranged (transcribed) configurations. This constitutive anchorage site partitions the gene into V-J and C region chromatin domains. We demonstrate that at least 10,000 similar and evolutionarily conserved MAR binding sites exist in the nucleus. We propose that these sites, in association with topoisomerase II and possibly in conjunction with enhancers, play fundamental roles in the functional organization of chromatin loop domains."

https://openalex.org/W1991062831,"We corrected a defective gene residing in the chromosome of a mammalian cell by injecting into the nucleus copies of the same gene carrying a different mutation. We determined how the number, the arrangement, and the chromosomal position of the integrated gene, as well as the number of injected molecules influence the gene-targeting frequency. Recombination between the newly introduced DNA and its chromosomal homolog occurred at a frequency of 1 in 10(3) cells receiving DNA. Correction events were mediated by either double reciprocal recombination or gene conversion. This resulted in sequences in the genome being replaced by sequences of the introduced DNA or, in separate experiments, sequences in the incoming DNA being replaced by chromosomal sequences. Both point mutations and deletion mutations were corrected; however, the nature of the mutation carried by the respective sequence influenced whether the integrated or injected sequence was corrected."
https://openalex.org/W2036744157,"Steady-state cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol phosphates have been measured in two different fibroblast cell lines (NIH 3T3 and NRK cells) before and after transformation with three different ras genes. At high cell density the ratio of DAG to PIP2 was 2.5- to 3-fold higher in the ras-transformed cells than in their untransformed counterparts. The sum of the water-soluble breakdown products of the polyphosphoinositides, inositol-1,4-bisphosphate and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, was also elevated in ras-transformed NRK cells compared with nontransformed NRK cells. These findings suggest that the ras (p21) protein may act by affecting these levels, possibly as a regulatory element in the PIP2 breakdown pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2046961979,"We have analyzed the function of the only ras homolog in S. pombe detectable by Southern blotting, ras1, which is homologous to mammalian ras genes and has been cloned. We have disrupted the ras1 gene and have replaced it with ras1Val17, which corresponds to a transforming variant of mammalian ras. Loss of ras1 activity by disruption results in the complete inability to mate. The cell body of a ras1− strain is extensively deformed, and a diploid sporulates very poorly. Unlike RAS1 and RAS2 of S. cerevisiae, ras1 of S. pombe appears to have no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. This suggests that the target enzymes presumably modulated by ras proteins in signal transduction are not the same for all organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2089017680,"The in vivo distribution of topoisomerase I on specific DNA sequences is determined at high resolution in Drosophila cells using a photo-crosslinking method. Topoisomerase I-DNA adducts are generated by irradiation of intact cells with UV light and then purified by immunoprecipitation with antibody to topoisomerase I. Analyses of the DNA sequences crosslinked to topoisomerase I by blot-hybridization with appropriate DNA probes indicate that topoisomerase I is concentrated on transcribed regions and not on nontranscribed flanking sequences. Like RNA polymerase II, topoisomerase I is recruited to heat-shock genes during the heat-shock response. However, topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase II can interact independently with the transcribed region because different ratios of topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase II are crosslinked to the highly transcribed hsp70 gene and the moderately transcribed copia genes. We hypothesize that topoisomerase I allows topological changes in DNA that are required for transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1494980574,"Cytochrome P-450cam catalyzes the stereospecific methylene hydroxylation of camphor to form 5-exohydroxycamphor and is encoded by the camC gene on the CAM plasmid of Pseudomonas putida, ATCC 17453. The cytochrome P-450cam structural gene has been cloned by mutant complementation in P. putida (Koga, H., Rauchfuss, B., and Gunsalus, I. C. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 412-417). We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the camC gene along with 155 base pairs of 5‘ and 175 base pairs of 3‘ flanking sequence. Upon comparison of the amino acid sequence derived from the gene sequence to the one obtained from the purified protein (Haniu, M., Armes, L. G., Yasunobu, K. T., Shastry, B. A., and Gunsalus, I. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12664-12671), five differences were found. The most significant was the addition of a Trp and a Thr residue between Val-54 and Arg-55, thereby increasing the amino acid numbering scheme by 2 after Val-54, bringing the total number of amino acids to 414. Other differences were: Gln-274—-Glu-276, Ser-359—-His-361, and Asn-405—-Asp-407. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the cloned cytochrome P-450cam enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli under the lac promoter showed a faithful translation of the hemo-protein, with the N-terminal Met removed by processing as found in P. putida. Purification to homogeneity of the cloned protein was accomplished by the method used for the CAM plasmid-encoded enzyme of P. putida. The G + C content of the camC gene was found to be 59.0%, caused by a preferred usage of G and C terminated codons. The gene encoding putidaredoxin reductase, camA, was located 22 nucleotides downstream from the cytochrome P-450cam gene. The camA gene initiated with a novel GUG codon, the first such initiator documented in Pseudomonas."

https://openalex.org/W1532133113,"The (Na+ + K+)-ATPase of cultured chick sensory neurons was studied with the aid of antibodies specific for this enzyme. Immunofluorescent labeling indicated the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase is evenly distributed on the neuronal cell surface; cell bodies, neurites, and growth cones were labeled with comparable intensity. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation, indicated concurrent synthesis and rapid association of the alpha (Mr = 105,000) and beta (Mr = 47,000) subunits. The alpha subunit is oligosaccharide-free while the beta subunit contains three Asn-linked oligosaccharide chains attached to a core peptide of 32,000 molecular weight. The time required for oligosaccharide processing of the newly synthesized beta subunit to endoglycosidase H-resistance suggests the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase takes 45-60 min to move from the site of polypeptide synthesis to the Golgi apparatus. Significantly less time was required for transport through the Golgi apparatus and insertion in the plasma membrane. From 30% to 55% of the newly synthesized (Na+ + K+)-ATPase did not appear on the cell surface but accumulated intracellularly. When tunicamycin was used to inhibit glycosylation of the beta subunit, there was no effect upon subunit assembly, intracellular transport, or degradation rate (t1/2 = 40 h)."
https://openalex.org/W1499930709,"The effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), forskolin, and dibutyryl cAMP on arachidonic acid release, inositol phospholipid metabolism, and Ca2+ mobilization was investigated. The chemotactic tripeptide (formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP))-induced arachidonic acid release in neutrophils was significantly inhibited by PGE2, forskolin, and dibutyryl cAMP. Among them, PGE2 was found to be the most potent inhibitor. However, when neutrophils were stimulated by Ca2+ ionophore A23187, such inhibitory effect by these agents was less marked. PGE2 also suppressed the enhanced incorporation of [32P]Pi into phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol in a dose-dependent manner in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. Also in this case, Ca2+ ionophore-induced alterations were hardly inhibited by PGE2. As well, PGE2 inhibited the fMLP-induced decrease of [3H]arachidonic acid in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol and the increase in PA very significantly. But the inhibitory effect by PGE2 was found to be weak in Ca2+ ionophore-stimulated neutrophils. These results suggest that a certain step from receptor activation to Ca2+ influx is mainly inhibited by PGE2. Concerning polyphosphoinositide breakdown, PGE2 did not affect the fMLP-induced decrease of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate which occurred within 10 s but inhibited the subsequent loss of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and [32P]phosphatidylinositol, suggesting that the compensatory resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was inhibited. On the other hand, fMLP-induced diacylglycerol formation was suppressed for the early period until 1 min, but with further incubation, diacylglycerol formation was rather accelerated by PGE2. Moreover, the inhibition of PA formation by PGE2 became evident after a 30-s time lag, suggesting that the conversion of diacylglycerol to PA is inhibited by PGE2. The formation of water-soluble products of inositol phospholipid degradation by phospholipase C, such as inositol phosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, was also suppressed by PGE2 treatment. However, the inhibition was not so marked as that of arachidonic acid release and PA formation. Thus, PGE2 appeared to inhibit not only initial events such as polyphosphoinositide breakdown but also turnover of inositol phospholipids. PGE2, forskolin, and dibutyryl cAMP did not block the rapid elevation of intracellular Ca2+ which was observed within 10 s in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. However, subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+ which was caused from 10 s to 3 min after stimulation was inhibited by PGE2, forskolin, and dibutyryl cAMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1542410585,"The hypothesis that inositol phospholipid degradation is a step in the mechanism by which epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates mitogenesis in confluent monolayers of quiescent BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts was tested. The maximum mitogenic response (a nearly 30-fold increase in incorporation of [3H]thymidine) occurred at 1 ng/ml EGF (0.16 nM). This degree of stimulation corresponded to 60% of that elicited by 10% serum. To determine whether EGF stimulated formation of inositol phosphates via degradation of polyphosphoinositides, the intracellular levels of [3H] inositol phosphates and [3H]phosphoinositides were determined after EGF addition to BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts prelabeled with [3H]inositol. These experiments were performed under conditions designed to mimic exactly those conditions used to study mitogenesis. The results demonstrated that 10% serum or 10 ng/ml of platelet-derived growth factor, but not as much as 50 ng/ml EGF or 10 micrograms/ml insulin, increased the levels of inositol phosphates via degradation of phosphoinositides in the presence of 10 mM Li+. The serum-induced effects occurred in 30 s, the earliest time investigated. Phorbol dibutyrate (100 nM), alone or in conjunction with EGF (10 ng/ml), failed to stimulate inositol phospholipid degradation. However, phorbol dibutyrate inhibited the serum-induced stimulation. Finally, fetal bovine serum dialyzed so as to retain peptide mitogens lost almost 70% of the capacity to stimulate degradation of inositol phospholipids while remaining as mitogenic as the control serum. Thus, stimulation of inositol phospholipid degradation is an unlikely component in the mechanism by which EGF and probably insulin and serum stimulate mitogenesis in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2001912359,"Hairy-wing (Hw) mutations cause the differentiation of extra chaetes on the cuticle of Drosophila. They are associated with modifications of the achaete-scute complex that consist, in the mutants studied, of insertions of the transposable elements gypsy (Hw1, HwBS) or copia (HwUa). gypsy and copia are inserted in achaete and scute transcribed regions, respectively. Transcription of the insertion-split genes starts at the normal site but terminates within the transposable element sequences. The RNA truncated within gypsy is 5-20 times more abundant than its homolog in wild-type flies. The abundance is reduced in Hw1 revertants and Hw1 stocks carrying su(Hw) mutations. These and other data suggest that the excess function phenotypes of Hw mutations are generated by an increase in achaete or scute transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W1588770766,"Abstract This report describes a Cl- transport pathway in confluent monolayer cultures of the T84 human colonic carcinoma cell line which is: 1) activated by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, or other agents which induce or mimic cAMP; 2) independent of extracellular Na+ or K+; 3) refractory to inhibition by 0.1 mM bumetanide and 1 mM 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,-2'-disulfonic acid; 4) competitively inhibited by NO3-, I-, SCN-, and Br-; 5) inhibited in a noncompetitive-complex manner by the putative Cl- channel-blocking agent, N-phenylanthranilic acid; and 6) localized to the apical membrane of confluent monolayers. This Cl- transport system is, therefore, distinct from the bumetanide-sensitive, basolateral membrane-localized, Na+, K+, Cl- cotransport system previously described in these cells (Dharmsathaphorn, K., Mandel, K., Masui, H., and McRoberts, J.A. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 75, 462-471). Kinetic studies revealed that Cl- transport by this pathway fit simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km for Cl- of about 6 mM. Activation by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide increased the Vmax but did not alter the apparent Km. We discuss the possibility that this transport system is a Cl- channel which is intimately involved in hormonally mediated, electrogenic Cl- secretion across T84 cell monolayers."
https://openalex.org/W1546050560,"A series of neuroblastoma cell lines were screened for the presence of opioid receptor sites with the tracers [3H]diprenorphine (mu, delta, kappa ligand) and [3H]naloxone (mu-selective ligand). One human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, displayed avid binding for both tracers. Binding experiments with multiple tracers revealed the presence of both mu and delta sites. These sites were stereospecific, saturable, and proteinaceous in character. Saturation binding experiments provided an estimate of 50,000 mu and 10,000 delta sites/cell. NaCl (100 mM) and guanine nucleotide, guanylyl imidodiphosphate (50 microM), reduced opioid agonist but not antagonist binding to these sites. Etorphine at 1 nM inhibited prostaglandin E1-stimulated cyclic AMP production by approximately 20%, which was reversible by naloxone. The opioid-binding sites on SK-N-SH cells closely resemble the previously reported mu and delta sites in human and rodent brain. Therefore, the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line represents a useful tool to study the molecular functions of opioid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1553359417,"The specificity of the two intrasubunit cGMP binding sites of cGMP-dependent protein kinase was determined by measuring the ability of 46 cGMP analogs to compete with [3H]cGMP. Both sites of the enzyme exhibited high specificity for the ribose cyclic phosphate moiety, and lower specificity for the guanine moiety. Effects of modifications in the ribose cyclic phosphate moiety suggested that cGMP is bound at both sites by three hydrogen bonds at 2'-OH, 3'-O, and 5'-O. A negative charge in the cyclic phosphate is apparently required. Modifications of the pyrimidine part of guanine, particularly at C-1, generally caused selectivity for the rapidly exchanging site while modifications of the imidazole part of guanine at C-7 and C-8 caused selectivity for the slowly exchanging site. These increases in selectivity for a site were mainly due to losses in affinity of the other site. There was an apparent requirement of the intact amino group at C-2, particularly for the slowly exchanging site. Comparison of the molecular interactions of cAMP and cGMP with their specific protein kinases showed that both nucleotides are bound by similar forces in the 2', 3' and 5' region, both bases may be bound in syn conformation, but that each base moiety is bound by different molecular interaction, thus leading to the selectivity of the two enzymes. cGMP analogs which possessed strong selectivity for the rapidly exchanging site, but not those selective for the slowly exchanging site, stimulated the binding of [3H]cGMP. Only a few cGMP analogs were more potent than cGMP in stimulating protein kinase activity. The potency of cGMP analogs as stimulators of kinase activity correlated better with the mean binding affinity for both binding sites than with the affinity for either site alone. Two analogs added in combination were synergistic in kinase activation, particularly if one analog was selective for the slowly exchanging site and the other for the rapidly exchanging site. These observations are suggestive that cGMP binding at the rapidly exchanging site stimulates cGMP binding at the slowly exchanging site and that both sites are involved in the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W2033337283,"p-Chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (PCMS), a sulfhydryl inhibitor, prevented the mycelial-to-yeast transition of the dimorphic fungal pathogen, Histoplasma capsulatum. The effect of PCMS was specific for the mycelial-to-yeast transformation; it had no effect on growth of either the yeast or mycelial forms or on the yeast-to-mycelial transition. The failure of PCMS-treated mycelia to transform to yeast was permanent and irreversible. PCMS-treated mycelia could not infect mice but could stimulate resistance to infection by a pathogenic strain of Histoplasma capsulatum. These results suggest a new general strategy for vaccine development in diseases caused by dimorphic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1577386926,"A mutant cell line (designated M.9.1.1) requiring ethanolamine for growth was derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells using 5-bromodeoxyuridine enrichment. The ethanolamine requirement was readily replaced by 20 microM phosphatidylserine and 10 microM lysophosphatidylethanolamine. When M.9.1.1 cells were supplemented with phosphatidyl[3H]serine it was rapidly taken up, and subsequently decarboxylated to form phosphatidyl[3H]ethanolamine. The incorporation of [3H]serine into phosphatidylserine in the mutant cells was 57% of that in the parental cells. Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis from [3H]serine in the mutant cells was 35% of that in parental cells. When M.9.1.1 cells were deprived of ethanolamine for 48 h the level of phosphatidylserine decreased 34% and the level of phosphatidylethanolamine decreased 26% compared to parental cells. At the same time the rate of turnover of phosphatidylserine was reduced to half that found in parental cells. Examination of the enzymes of phosphatidylserine metabolism indicated defective phosphatidylserine synthase activity in the mutant. When exogenous phosphatidylcholine was used as the phospholipid substrate for the reaction the apparent kinetic constants were Vmax (mutant) = 5.7 pmol/min/mg protein and Vmax (parental) = 17.5 pmol/min/mg protein. Measurement of the back reaction (ATP-independent incorporation of choline into phospholipid) gave no detectable activity in the mutant cells. The data indicate that the phosphatidylcholine-dependent synthesis of phosphatidylserine is the primary lesion in M.9.1.1."
https://openalex.org/W1676815435,"The phosphorylation of receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I was studied by phosphoamino acid analysis and tryptic phosphopeptide maps in an attempt to determine if protein kinase C is involved in their phosphorylation in response to insulin and insulin-like growth factor I, respectively. Two cell lines were utilized, Hep G2 and IM-9 cells. sn-1,2-Dioctanoylglycerol and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), agents known to activate protein kinase C, stimulated the phosphorylation of the beta subunits of both receptors, as did their hormones. In unstimulated cells, phosphorylation of the insulin receptor occurred on seryl and to a lesser extent on threonyl residues. TPA stimulated seryl and threonyl phosphorylation that resulted in the appearance of four major phosphoserine-containing phosphopeptides which were not detected in the basal state and an increase in phosphorylation of a phosphothreonine-containing peptide which was present in the basal state. Insulin treatment resulted in the appearance of three major phosphotyrosine-containing tryptic peptides. In IM-9 cells, insulin also increased the phosphoserine and possibly the phosphothreonine content of the beta subunit. In both cells, the major phosphoserine-containing peptides that were stimulated by TPA were not detected following treatment with insulin. Very similar results, including similar peptide maps, were obtained for the insulin-like growth factor I receptor from cells treated with TPA and insulin-like growth factor I. Although not entirely conclusive, these results suggest that the insulin- and insulin-like growth factor I-stimulated phosphorylation of their receptors does not result from activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1539155976,"The normally quick response of platelets to alpha-thrombin is delayed under two conditions. After pretreatment of platelets with chymotrypsin or certain other proteases, aggregation and secretion induced by alpha-thrombin begins after a delay of 30 s or more compared to less than 5 s for control platelets, and control platelets are activated by gamma-thrombin with a similar delay (Tam, S. W., Fenton, J. W., II, and Detwiler, T. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6626-6632). Under these conditions, thrombin-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase was blocked. The impaired regulation of adenylate cyclase and delayed secretion had in common: (i) partial correction with high concentrations of thrombin; (ii) similar thrombin dose-response relationships; (iii) similar concentration dependence for chymotrypsin during pretreatment; and (iv) specificity for thrombin. Other parameters of thrombin-induced platelet activation were also analyzed under these conditions. Thrombin-induced hydrolysis of arachidonyl esters and synthesis of prostanoids were similar to regulation of adenylate cyclase; they were blocked, with partial correction at high concentrations of thrombin. In contrast, thrombin-induced synthesis of phosphatidic acid and phosphorylation of a 20- and a 40-kDa protein were similar to secretion; they occurred after a delay but to a normal extent. The thrombin-induced increase in cytosolic calcium ion activity was slightly slower in chymotrypsin-treated platelets or in response to gamma-thrombin, but it was complete prior to initiation of the delayed responses. It is concluded that platelets have at least two types of thrombin receptors or coupling mechanisms, one of which is sensitive to chymotrypsin, unresponsive to gamma-thrombin, and coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and activation of prostanoid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1607526803,"Ascorbate reversibly inhibits catalase, and this inhibition is enhanced and rendered irreversible by the prior addition of copper(II)-bishistidine. In the absence of copper, the inhibition was prevented and reversed by ethanol, but not by superoxide dismutase, benzoate, mannitol, thiourea, desferrioxamine, or DETAPAC. In the presence of the copper complex mannitol, benzoate, and superoxide dismutase still had no effect, but thiourea, desferrioxamine, DETAPAC, or additional histidine decreased the extent of inactivation to that seen in the absence of copper. In the presence of copper, ethanol protected at [ascorbate] less than 1 mM, but was ineffective at [ascorbate] greater than 2 mM, even in the absence of oxygen. Although in the absence of copper, complete removal of oxygen provided full protection against inactivation by ascorbate, this protection was not seen if the catalase was briefly preincubated with H2O2 prior to flushing with nitrogen, or if copper was present. In fact, if copper was present, inactivation was enhanced by the removal of oxygen. Increasing the concentration of oxygen from ambient to 100% slowed the inactivation, whether or not copper was present. It is concluded that the initial reversible inactivation involves reaction with H2O2 to form compound I, followed by one electron reduction of compound I to compound II. In the presence of added copper, the initial (reversible) inactivation allows H2O2 to accumulate sufficiently to permit irreversible inactivation. Since in the presence of copper oxygen is not required, and neither the reversible nor the irreversible inactivation was prevented by conventional scavengers of active forms of oxygen, the inactivation is likely mediated by semidehydroascorbate, and/or it may involve site-specific generation of the damaging intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1548708435,"A series of plasmids encoding various Klebsiella pneumoniae nif (nitrogen fixation) genes were constructed to determine which were required to produce active iron (Fe) protein in Escherichia coli, a species which does not normally fix nitrogen. The greatest success was achieved with binary plasmid systems that produced nifA regulatory protein under the control of a tac promoter on one plasmid, which then induced synthesis of nifH and nifM proteins from their native promoter sites on a second plasmid. nifH protein, the monomeric subunit of Fe protein, produced in the presence of nifM constituted nearly 10% of the whole cell protein and exhibited the corresponding amount of C2H2-reducing activity in nitrogenase assays conducted in vitro. nifH protein formed in the absence of nifM constituted 4.7% of the whole cell protein and exhibited no detectable activity in assays of whole cell extracts. The plasmid-encoded Fe protein was purified to homogeneity and was found to be indistinguishable from that isolated from derepressed wild type K. pneumoniae, having a similar specific activity, approximately 4 Fe/dimer of 68 kDa, and similar epr features. Although these experiments do not exclude the participation of other E. coli gene products in the maturation of nifH protein, they limit the nif-specific genes required for active Fe protein production to nifA, nifH, and nifM. Since nifA is thought to be the required activator protein involved in nif operon transcription, the simplest explanation for these observations is that nifH codes for the peptide of the Fe protein, while nifM acts to convert this nifH peptide to the functioning Fe protein of nitrogenase. In the absence of nifM, only an inactive nifH polypeptide is produced."
https://openalex.org/W1591221164,"Infusion of platelet-activating factor (alkyl acetylglycerophosphocholine (AGEPC] into isolated perfused rat livers caused a dose-dependent, transient increase in portal vein pressure, indicative of constriction of the hepatic vasculature. A close correlation was observed between the changes in portal pressure and concomitant transient increases in hepatic glucose output. The two processes displayed similar dose dependence and were attenuated to a similar extent by reducing the perfusate calcium concentration. Reducing the perfusate free calcium concentration to 1 nM by co-infusion of EGTA did not abolish completely the hepatic responses to AGEPC. Verapamil inhibited both the hemodynamic and glycogenolytic responses to AGEPC in a dose-dependent fashion; the IC50 was approximately 10 microM at an AGEPC concentration of 6.6 X 10(-11) M. Also, both responses displayed similar degrees of tachyphylaxis in response to repeated short infusions of AGEPC. Measurement of glycogen phosphorylase a in extracts from freeze-clamped livers demonstrated a rapid increase in phosphorylase a in response to infusion of AGEPC. A small but significant increase in whole tissue ADP was found in response to AGEPC (2 X 10(-8) M); cAMP levels were not changed by AGEPC infusion. It is concluded that glycogenolysis in the perfused liver in response to AGEPC may be a result of the hemodynamic effects of AGEPC, rather than a direct effect of the phospholipid mediator on the hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1606217207,"Plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas B10 produces its yellow-green, fluorescent siderophore (microbial iron transport agent) pseudobactin under iron-limiting conditions. A structural gene encoding the 85,000-Da putative outer membrane receptor protein for ferric pseudobactin was identified in a gene bank from Pseudomonas B10 prepared with the broad host-range conjugative cosmid cloning vector pLAFR1. Transposon Tn5 mutagenesis of recombinant plasmid pJLM300 localized the functional gene to a region of approximately 2.4 kilobases consistent with the apparent molecular weight of the receptor protein. Mobilization of pJLM300 into Pseudomonas A124 and A225, whose growth was inhibited by Pseudomonas B10 or pseudobactin, rendered these strains no longer susceptible to iron starvation by pseudobactin because they were now able to transport ferric pseudobactin. Pseudobactin biosynthetic genes flanked this receptor gene on both sides and were on separate operons. Transposon Tn5 insertion mutants of Pseudomonas B10 lacking this receptor protein were generated by a marker exchange technique and were defective in ferric pseudobactin transport. Such mutants could be complemented in trans by pJLM300. The production of pseudobactin, the receptor protein, and four other outer membrane proteins in Pseudomonas B10 was coordinately regulated by the level of intracellular iron."
https://openalex.org/W1485838626,"A cloned 13.3-kilobase (kb) region of rabbit genomic DNA contains a cluster of alpha-like globin genes arranged 5'-psi zeta-(3.6 kb)-alpha 1-(2.2 kb)-psi alpha-3'. Genomic blot hybridization data show that this is the major alpha-like globin gene cluster in rabbits, although a second alpha-globin gene (alpha 2) is also detected. Repetitive sequences from the C family of short repeats flank the psi zeta gene, and a new repetitive element, the F repeat is located 3' to psi alpha. The sequence was determined for a 4024-base pair (bp) segment that extends from 149 bp 5' to the cap site of alpha 1 to 207 bp 3' to psi alpha. Gene alpha 1 is functional and encodes one of the major allelic variants of rabbit alpha-globin. This gene has very short introns (77 bp in intron 1 and 83 bp in intron 2) and an unusual ATA box in the 5' flanking region (CTTAAA), which does function to promote transcription by RNA polymerase II in a cell-free system. Short (4 or 9 bp) G + C-rich repeats are interspersed throughout the flanking regions and the introns. Gene psi alpha cannot encode a globin polypeptide, and it is probably inactive. This is shown by the absence of a normal globin gene promoter, the replacement of the 5' untranslated sequence by tandem repeats of the sequence GCCCGCCGC, frameshift deletions in exon 2, and the modification of the polyadenylation signal to AGTAAA. The intergenic region between alpha 1 and psi alpha is very G + C rich (65.7% G + C) and contains many short, tandem repeats. Gene psi zeta hybridizes specifically to a human zeta-globin gene probe, but a partial sequence reveals frameshift mutations that probably make psi zeta a pseudogene. Mammalian alpha-globin gene clusters vary in the presence or absence of pseudogenes, and if present, the position of the pseudogene differs in various gene clusters. Among the mammalian alpha-like gene clusters so far analyzed, the rabbit gene cluster is unique in the absence of duplicated alpha-globin genes that are undergoing concerted evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1505665090,"The lysC gene encoding the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase III of Escherichia coli K12 has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence (449 amino acid residues) reveals that the entire sequence of aspartokinase III is homologous to the N-terminal part of the two iso- and bifunctional aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenases I and II of E. coli. An evolutionary pathway leading to the three molecular species present in the same organism is proposed, and the possible involvement of a highly conserved region in subunit interactions is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1532468762,"The effects of naturally occurring lipid amphiphiles on free radical-mediated peroxidative injury in isolated canine sarcolemma were studied. Highly enriched canine myocytic sarcolemmal membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 37 degrees C with or without different amphiphilic lipids before the addition of a free radical-generating system consisting of dihydroxyfumarate and Fe3+-ADP. Lipid peroxidation, assayed as malondialdehyde formation, was catalyzed linearly up to 40 min in the control samples. Pretreatment of the sarcolemma with palmitoyl-CoA, palmitoylcarnitine, or lysophosphatidylcholine accelerated the initial rates (20 min) of peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner (10-100 microM) and achieved maximal stimulation (240%, 160%, and 210%, respectively, of controls) at 50 microM concentrations of each of these amphiphiles. However, free fatty acids, CoA, and carnitine were without effect. These promoting effects of the amphiphiles persisted over a wide pH range (pH 6.0-7.8) and exhibited additive effects when lower levels of different amphiphiles were combined together. Associated with the accelerated rates of peroxidation produced by palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoylcarnitine were greater losses in the activity of sarcolemmal (Na,K)-ATPase. Since all three kinds of amphiphilic lipids accumulate during ischemia, this study suggests a novel mechanism of potentiation of sacolemmal membrane injury when free radicals are present."
https://openalex.org/W1550015947,"Uptake of 22Na+ and 45Ca2+ into everted membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli was measured with imposed transmembrane pH gradients, acid interior, as driving force. Vesicles loaded with 0.5 M KCl were diluted into 0.5 M choline chloride to create a potassium gradient. Addition of nigericin to produce K+/H+ exchange resulted in formation of a pH gradient. This imposed gradient was capable of driving 45Ca2+ accumulation. In another method vesicles loaded with 0.5 M NH4Cl were diluted into 0.5 M choline chloride, creating an ammonium diffusion potential. A gradient of H+ was produced by passive efflux of NH3. With an ammonium gradient as driving force, everted vesicles accumulated both 45Ca2+ and 22Na+. The data suggest that 22Na+ uptake was via the sodium/proton antiporter and 45Ca2+ via the calcium/proton antiporter. Uptake of both cations required alkaline pHout. A minimum pH gradient of 0.9 unit was needed for transport of either ion, suggesting gating of the antiporters. Octyl glucoside extracts of inner membrane were reconstituted with E. coli phospholipids in 0.5 M NH4Cl. NH4+-loaded proteoliposomes accumulated both 22Na+ and 45Ca2+, demonstrating that the sodium/proton and calcium/proton antiporters could be solubilized and reconstituted in a functional form."
https://openalex.org/W1614912103,"Cytochrome c-554 functions in the ammonia oxidizing system of Nitrosomonas europaea. We have investigated its molecular and ligand binding properties and studied the protein with optical, EPR, and Mossbauer spectroscopies in the pH range from 2 to 13. Amino acid, heme, and metal analyses show that the protein has Mr = 25,000 and that it contains four c-type hemes per molecule. Optical spectra reveal that the heme ligand structures are sensitive to the pH of the medium and that the hemes can bind small molecules such as CN-, CO, and NO under certain conditions. According to the Mossbauer and EPR studies of the ferric protein, the hemes are predominantly (75%) high spin at pH 2 and low spin (approximately equal to 100%) above pH 10. At neutral pH, Mossbauer data show that 75% of the heme is low spin and that the remainder is high spin. The EPR data, however, do not reveal any signals attributable to typical high spin or low spin species. Rather, a very complex and unusual spectrum with a main feature at g = 3.3 is observed at X-band, this feature shifts to approximately g = 3 at S-band. The EPR and Mossbauer data show clearly that the hemes are magnetically interacting, by dipolar and exchange interactions. At pH 2, the EPR spectra reveal resonances at g = 6 and 2. The Mossbauer spectra prove that all hemes are magnetically coupled at this pH. Coupling is also borne out by the observation of a half-field EPR resonance near g = 12."
https://openalex.org/W1555447892,"Abstract We examined the effect of histidine-specific reagents on the transport activity of the Na+-H+ exchanger in microvillus (brush-border) membrane vesicles isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. Rose bengal-catalyzed photo-oxidation caused irreversible inhibition of the rate of Na+-H+ exchange but also caused significant loss of vesicle integrity. Treatment of the membrane vesicles with diethylpyrocarbonate caused inactivation of Na+-H+ exchange that could not be attributed to vesicle disruption or collapse of transmembrane H+ gradients. Inactivation of Na+-H+ exchange by diethylpyrocarbonate followed pseudo-first order kinetics to below 10% residual activity, could be reversed by hydroxylamine, was reflected by a decreased Vmax with no change in the Km for Na+, was dependent on external pH but not internal pH, was blocked by amiloride, and was enhanced by Na+. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a diethylpyrocarbonate-sensitive imidazolium residue is the titratable group found in kinetic studies to bind H+ at the external transport site of the Na+-H+ exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1492293111,"A non-photosynthetic mutant (Ps-) of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata, designated R126, was analyzed for a defect in the cyclic electron transfer system. Compared to a Ps+ strain MR126, the mutant was shown to have a full complement of electron transfer components (reaction centers, ubiquinone-10, cytochromes b, c1, and c2, the Rieske 2-iron, 2-sulfur (Rieske FeS) center, and the antimycin-sensitive semiquinone). Functionally, mutant R126 failed to catalyze complete cytochrome c1 + c2 re-reduction or cytochrome b reduction following a short (10 microseconds) flash of actinic light. Evidence (from flash-induced carotenoid band shift) was characteristic of inhibition of electron transfer proximal to cytochrome c1 of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase. Three lines of evidence indicate that the lesion of R126 disrupts electron transfer from quinol to Rieske FeS: 1) the degree of cytochrome c1 + c2 re-reduction following a flash is indicative of electron transfer from Rieske FeS to cytochrome c1 + c2 without redox equilibration with an additional electron from a quinol; 2) inhibitors that act at the Qz site and raise the Rieske FeS midpoint redox potential (Em), namely 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole or 3-alkyl-2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone, have no effect on cytochrome c1 + c2 oxidation in R126; 3) the Rieske FeS center, although it exhibits normal redox behavior, is unable to report the redox state of the quinone pool, as metered by its EPR line shape properties. Flash-induced proton binding in R126 is indicative of normal functional primary (QA) and secondary (QB) electron acceptor activity of the photosynthetic reaction center. The Qc functional site of cytochrome bc1 is intact in R126 as measured by the existence of antimycin-sensitive, flash-induced cytochrome b reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1545665258,"The acidification activity of human neutrophils, known to occur extracellularly and intraphagolysosomally, was studied in intact and in fractionated cells. The subcellular location of the acidification activity was investigated by rate zonal sedimentation of post-nuclear supernatants from resting cells on continuous sucrose gradients. The acidification measurements indicated a dominance of activity in gelatinase-rich tertiary granules. On the other hand, ATPase activities were located in plasma membrane and in the membranes of the cytoplasmic granules (specific, azurophilic, and tertiary). All of these activities were diminished by the inhibitors dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonic acid; however, studies with other inhibitors, especially N-ethylmaleimide and duramycin, suggested ATPase enzymatic differences depending on location. The results taken together provide direct and strong indication of involvement of a proton pump ATPase in acidification inside neutrophils. Furthermore, the dominant location of acidification activity in tertiary granules that very readily degranulate presumably has significant implications for the importance of low pH in cidal events and the inflammatory process."
https://openalex.org/W1492177665,"A photoaffinity substrate analogue, 8-azido-ADP-[14C]glucose, reacts specifically and covalently with Escherichia coli ADP-glucose synthetase. The site(s) of reaction of 8-azido-ADP-[14C]glucose with the enzyme was identified by isolation of tryptic peptides containing the labeled analogue by use of high performance liquid chromatography technique and subsequent NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the purified radioactive peptides. One major binding region of the azido analogue is a peptide segment composed of residues 107-114 of the enzyme's polypeptide chain. Lys 108 and Arg 114 become trypsin-resistant sites when the enzyme is photoinactivated by 8-azido-ADP-[14C] glucose, suggesting that the analogue binds at or near the vicinity of these 2 basic amino acid residues. Conformational analysis of this peptide segment (residues 107-114) shows a strong probability of a reverse beta-turn secondary structure, suggesting that this peptide segment is on the enzyme surface. Two minor reaction regions of the enzyme with the analogue were also identified by chemical characterization. One region was composed of residues 162-207. Lys 194 was previously suggested as the activator-binding site by chemical modification studies with pyridoxal phosphate (Parsons, T. F., and Preiss, J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7638-7645). Another minor region where the analogue binds the tryptic peptide composed of residues 380-385 is near the COOH-terminal side of the enzyme. It is postulated that all these peptide segments are juxtaposed in tertiary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2128239468,"In the phosphoenzyme (EP) of the electric eel Na,K-ATPase, the sum of the ADP-sensitive EP and the K+-sensitive EP exceeds 150% of EP in the presence of 100 mM Na+. This unusual phenomenon can be explained by the formation of three phosphoenzymes: ADP-sensitive K+-insensitive (E1P), K+-sensitive ADP-insensitive (E2P), and ADP- and K+-sensitive (E*P) phosphoenzymes, as proposed by Norby et al. (Norby, J. G., Klodos, I., and Christiansen, N. O. (1983) J. Gen. Physiol. 82, 725-757). By applying a simple approximation method for the assay of E1P, E*P, and E2P, it was found that the phosphorylation of the enzyme was much faster than the conversion among each EP and the phosphoenzyme changed as E1NaATP----E1P----E*P----E2P. In the fragmental eel enzyme, the step of E*P to E2P was much slower than the step of E1P to E*P. In the steady state, the E1P was predominant above 400 mM Na+, whereas E*P and E2P were predominant between 60 and 300 mM Na+ and below 60 mM Na+, respectively. The characteristic difference of the eel enzyme from the beef brain enzyme and probably from the kidney enzyme seems to be that the dissociation constant of Na+ on the E1P-E*P equilibrium is higher than that on the E*P-E2P. The E*P and E1P both interacted with ADP to form ATP without formation of inorganic phosphate in the absence of free Mg2+. In the Na,K-ATPase proteoliposomes, the vesicle membrane interfered with the conversion of E1P to E2P, especially the change of E1P to E*P, and furthermore, the E1P content increased. This barrier effect was partially counteracted by monensin or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Oligomycin reacted with E1P and probably with E*P, therefore inhibiting their conversion to E2P and interaction with K+."
https://openalex.org/W1498895940,"Swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid which is a potent inhibitor of the Golgi enzyme, mannosidase II, leads to the production of incompletely processed glycoproteins lacking complex type oligosaccharides. This inhibitor has been used to examine the importance of terminal sugar groups in the biosynthesis and function of both the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor. IM-9 cells were metabolically labeled using [35S]methionine and the two receptors were independently immunoprecipitated using specific monoclonal antibodies. The incompletely processed receptors have slightly lower molecular weights and contain hybrid rather than complex type oligosaccharides as indicated by their sensitivity to endoglycosidase H and neuraminidase. Both receptors made in the presence of swainsonine are still autophosphorylated in the presence of the respective hormone. The insulin receptor made in the presence of the inhibitor can be affinity labeled at the cell surface using 125I-insulin and disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linking; there is also no significant difference in its affinity for insulin. These results suggest that for the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptors to be synthesized, processed, and function normally, they do not require all of the sugars which are normally added in the terminal stages of glycosylation."

https://openalex.org/W153068354,"The binding of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) to microsomal membrane preparations from the livers of rats fasted for 72 h or fed control or high carbohydrate diets was examined to determine whether alterations in nutrient intake could affect the EGF receptor system. Fasted rats had 40-50% less membrane binding than did control or carbohydrate-fed rats. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that the decrease in EGF binding in fasted rats was due to a decrease in receptor number with no change in receptor affinity. Cross-linking of 125I-EGF to EGF receptors with disuccinimidyl suberate revealed specific binding of a Mr 170,000 protein, which was diminished by approximately 75% in fasting, and a Mr = 150,000 protein, which accounted for 40-50% of the total labeling in the control and carbohydrate-fed rats and which was relatively unchanged by fasting. The sum of the labeling of the 2 bands was reduced by approximately 40% in fasting and is consistent with the reduction in EGF binding detected by Scatchard analysis. EGF stimulated a 1.5-3-fold increase in 32P incorporation into one major protein of 170 kDa in all 3 groups. Basal and EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation of 170 kDa, when normalized for protein, was 75% lower in membranes from fasted animals, compared to those from control or carbohydrate-fed rats. The comparable reduction of 125I-EGF binding to, and 32P incorporation into, the 170-kDa EGF receptor protein suggested that kinase activity/receptor was unaffected by fasting. Moreover, EGF receptor kinase activity in the 3 groups was comparable for an exogenous substrate, as judged by equal basal and EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Val5-angiotensin II, when normalized for total EGF-binding capacity. These results suggest that fasting regulates EGF receptor kinase activity primarily by regulation of the number of hepatic EGF receptors. The possibility exists that some in vivo effects of fasting may be mediated by a reduction in EGF receptor levels."
https://openalex.org/W2022023479,"Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) and Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MSV) are retroviruses carrying unrelated onc genes. However, both of these viruses are capable of stimulating the growth and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells; the target cells for both appear at the same time during fetal development and follow a similar pattern throughout ontogeny. In addition, the colonies induced by each virus are morphologically similar and synthesize the adult form of hemoglobin. However, A-MuLV-infected cells are Epo-independent, whereas Ha-MSV-infected cells are Epo-dependent. Superinfection of Ha-MSV-infected cells with A-MuLV overrides their Epo-dependency. Thus, the consequences of the infection are determined by the interaction of the different onc gene products with identical or similar erythroid cells."

Prostacyclin or prostaglandin E1 at higher concentrations increased the cyclic AMP level and inhibited the activation of factor X by platelets. Inhibition of platelet adenylate cyclase by 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine allowed the activation of the protease at higher concentrations of the autocoids. Prostaglandins A1, A2, B1, B2, E2, F2 alpha, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2, which do not affect platelet cyclic AMP level, did not stimulate the protease."

Kurstaki inhibits ion transport, (Na,K)-ATPase, and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity catalyzed by the Na+ pump. The Ki for inhibition of the K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity of purified dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase was approximately 0.37 microM. Delta endotoxin had a similar Ki for inhibition of (Na,K)-ATPase activity when assayed at low Na+ concentration (10 mM) but the inhibition was reversed when high concentrations of Na+ (100 mM NaCl) were added to the assay. Phosphorylation of the active site aspartyl residue with 32PO3-4 was also blocked by delta endotoxin. Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake into intact human red blood cells was not inhibited by externally added toxin; however, strophanthidin-inhibitable 22Na+ uptake into inside-out vesicles from red blood cells was completely blocked by delta endotoxin (Ki = 0.73 microM). These data suggest that delta endotoxin must enter the cell before it can inhibit the Na+ pump."
https://openalex.org/W1559147139,"The primary defect responsible for mucolipidosis III is a deficiency of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase activity (GlcNAc phosphotransferase). Genetic complementation analysis of cultured fibroblasts derived from 12 patients with mucolipidosis III identified complementation groups A, B, and C (Honey, N. K., Mueller, O. T., Little, L. E., Miller, A. L., and Shows, T. B. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 7420-7424). The GlcNAc phosphotransferase activity present in the cell lines comprising the complementation groups was characterized with respect to endogenous substrates and two exogenous acceptors, alpha-methyl-D-mannoside and high mannose glycopeptides. All group C cell lines and one group A cell line were found to have normal GlcNAc phosphotransferase activity levels at 37 degrees C when screened with these exogenous acceptors. The enzyme activity in group A cell lines was within normal range when assayed at 23 degrees C. Inhibition of the phosphorylation of alpha-methyl-D-mannoside in the presence of increasing amounts of endogenous substrate N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase B was demonstrated in normal cell lines at 23 and 37 degrees C and in group A cells at 23 degrees C. However, group C cell lines did not show any inhibition at either temperature. This suggests that the alteration of the GlcNAc phosphotransferase from individuals in group C affects the recognition site for the protein portion of lysosomal enzymes, whereas group A individuals have mutations which result in a temperature-sensitive enzyme."

Phosphorylation of polyphosphoinositides was not affected by 5-methyltryptamine. In membranes labeled in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP, 5-methyltryptamine stimulated a rapid breakdown of the [32P]polyphosphoinositides. These results indicate that in blowfly salivary gland homogenates, hormone stimulates breakdown of the newly synthesized polyphosphoinositides. In the presence of hormone, the rate of polyphosphoinositide synthesis does not compensate for the rate of polyphosphoinositide degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1548766708,"Rat adipocytes were incubated with [32P]phosphate to label glycogen synthase, which was rapidly immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts and cleaved using either CNBr or trypsin. All of the [32P]phosphate in synthase was recovered in two CNBr fragments, denoted CB-1 and CB-2. Isoproterenol (1 microM) rapidly decreased the synthase activity ratio (-glucose-6-P/+glucose-6-P) and stimulated the phosphorylation of both CB-1 and CB-2 by approximately 30%. Insulin opposed the decrease in activity ratio and blocked the stimulation of phosphorylation by isoproterenol. Incubating cells with insulin alone changed the 32P content of neither CB-1 nor CB-2. Trypsin fragments were separated by reverse phase liquid chromatography and divided into peak fractions, denoted F-I-F-VII in order of increasing hydrophobicity. F-V contained almost half of the [32P]phosphate and was phosphorylated when synthase was immunoprecipitated from unlabeled fat cells and incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and the cAMP-independent protein kinase, FA/GSK-3. That F-V also had the same retention time as the skeletal muscle synthase fragment containing sites 3(a + b + c) suggests that it contains sites 3. Muscle sites 1a, 5, 1b, and 2 eluted with F-I, F-II, F-VI, and F-VII, respectively. F-V was increased approximately 25% by isoproterenol, but the largest relative increases were observed in F-I (4-fold), F-III (4-fold), and F-VI (2-fold). These results indicate that beta-adrenergic receptor activation results in increased phosphorylation of multiple sites on glycogen synthase. Insulin plus glucose decreased the overall 32P content of synthase by approximately 30%, with the largest decrease (40%) occurring in F-V. Without glucose, insulin decreased the [32P]phosphate in F-V by 17%, an effect which was balanced by increases in F-I, F-II, and F-III so that no net change in the total 32P contents of the fractions was observed. Thus, activation of glycogen synthase by the glucose transport-independent pathway seems to involve a redistribution of phosphate in the synthase subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1595589038,"5'-Nucleotidase from chicken gizzard smooth muscle was purified to homogeneity and used as immunogen for generating monoclonal antibodies. From about 150 positive clones nine IgG producing hybridoma cell lines have been selected for further characterization and antibody preparation. The resulting antibodies bind 5'-nucleotidase from chicken smooth muscle, chicken skeletal muscle, and chicken heart muscle but not the enzyme from chicken liver or rat liver. It could clearly be demonstrated that the nine antibodies recognize different antigenic determinants. Four of these antibodies are strong inhibitors of the AMPase activity of 5'-nucleotidase. One antibody is a weak inhibitor and four other antibodies have no effect on its enzymic activity. One of the monoclonal antibodies was used for immunoaffinity purification of 5'-nucleotidase from chicken heart muscle and chicken skeletal muscle. Pure and active enzymes could be isolated from detergent extracts in one step with a 10 to 20-fold higher yield compared to classical purification procedures. The subcellular distribution of 5'-nucleotidase in chicken gizzard was investigated using indirect immunofluorescence. We found a staining of the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells by all of the nine antibodies with variations in the staining intensity."
