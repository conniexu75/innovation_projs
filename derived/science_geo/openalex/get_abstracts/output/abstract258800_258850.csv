https://openalex.org/W1971549481,"In Drosophila , repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) are produced in the germ line by a Dicer-independent pathway and function through the PIWI subfamily of Argonautes to ensure silencing of retrotransposons. We sequenced small RNAs associated with the PIWI subfamily member AGO3. Although other members of PIWI, Aubergine (Aub) and Piwi, associated with rasiRNAs derived mainly from the antisense strand of retrotransposons, AGO3-associated rasiRNAs arose mainly from the sense strand. Aub- and Piwi-associated rasiRNAs showed a strong preference for uracil at their 5′ ends, and AGO3-associated rasiRNAs showed a strong preference for adenine at nucleotide 10. Comparisons between AGO3- and Aub-associated rasiRNAs revealed pairs of rasiRNAs showing complementarities in their first 10 nucleotides. Aub and AGO3 exhibited Slicer activity in vitro. These data support a model in which formation of a 5′ terminus within rasiRNA precursors is guided by rasiRNAs originating from transcripts of the other strand in concert with the Slicer activity of PIWI."
https://openalex.org/W2009229545,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22-nucleotide RNAs that can pair to sites within messenger RNAs to specify posttranscriptional repression of these messages. Aberrant miRNA expression can contribute to tumorigenesis, but which of the many miRNA-target relationships are relevant to this process has been unclear. Here, we report that chromosomal translocations previously associated with human tumors disrupt repression of High Mobility Group A2 ( Hmga2 ) by let-7 miRNA. This disrupted repression promotes anchorage-independent growth, a characteristic of oncogenic transformation. Thus, losing miRNA-directed repression of an oncogene provides a mechanism for tumorigenesis, and disrupting a single miRNA-target interaction can produce an observable phenotype in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2022192230,"Primary transcripts of certain microRNA (miRNA) genes are subject to RNA editing that converts adenosine to inosine. However, the importance of miRNA editing remains largely undetermined. Here we report that tissue-specific adenosine-to-inosine editing of miR-376 cluster transcripts leads to predominant expression of edited miR-376 isoform RNAs. One highly edited site is positioned in the middle of the 5′-proximal half “seed” region critical for the hybridization of miRNAs to targets. We provide evidence that the edited miR-376 RNA silences specifically a different set of genes. Repression of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, a target of the edited miR-376 RNA and an enzyme involved in the uric-acid synthesis pathway, contributes to tight and tissue-specific regulation of uric-acid levels, revealing a previously unknown role for RNA editing in miRNA-mediated gene silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2071154937,"Differential DNA methylation is important for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Allele-specific methylation of the inactive X chromosome has been demonstrated at promoter CpG islands, but the overall pattern of methylation on the active X(Xa) and inactive X (Xi) chromosomes is unknown. We performed allele-specific analysis of more than 1000 informative loci along the human X chromosome. The Xa displays more than two times as much allele-specific methylation as Xi. This methylation is concentrated at gene bodies, affecting multiple neighboring CpGs. Before X inactivation, all of these Xa gene body–methylated sites are biallelically methylated. Thus, a bipartite methylation-demethylation program results in Xa-specific hypomethylation at gene promoters and hypermethylation at gene bodies. These results suggest a relationship between global methylation and expression potentiality."
https://openalex.org/W2002676132,"Histone methylation regulates chromatin structure and transcription. The recently identified histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is chemically restricted to demethylation of only mono- and di- but not trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). We show that the X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) gene SMCX (JARID1C), which encodes a JmjC-domain protein, reversed H3K4me3 to di- and mono- but not unmethylated products. Other SMCX family members, including SMCY, RBP2, and PLU-1, also demethylated H3K4me3. SMCX bound H3K9me3 via its N-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain) finger, which may help coordinate H3K4 demethylation and H3K9 methylation in transcriptional repression. Significantly, several XLMR-patient point mutations reduced SMCX demethylase activity and binding to H3K9me3 peptides, respectively. Importantly, studies in zebrafish and primary mammalian neurons demonstrated a role for SMCX in neuronal survival and dendritic development and a link to the demethylase activity. Our findings thus identify a family of H3K4me3 demethylases and uncover a critical link between histone modifications and XLMR. Histone methylation regulates chromatin structure and transcription.

Our findings thus identify a family of H3K4me3 demethylases and uncover a critical link between histone modifications and XLMR. Histone N-terminal tails are subject to a plethora of posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation. Each modification can affect chromatin architecture, but the total sum of these modifications may be the ultimate determinant of the chromatin state, which governs gene transcription (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Translating the histone code.Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7206) Google Scholar, Strahl and Allis, 2000Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). Methylation occurs on both lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues. Five K residues on the tails of histones H3 and H4 (H3K4, -9, -27, -36, and H4K20) as well as K79 located within the core of histone H3 have been shown to be sites for methylation (Margueron et al., 2005Margueron R.

Lysine methylation exists in three different states, including mono-, di-, or trimethylation, which may bring about additional regulatory complexity. Histone methylation has been linked to transcriptional activation and repression, as well as DNA-damage response (Sanders et al., 2004Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C.

It has also been implicated in heterochromatin formation, X inactivation, genomic imprinting, and silencing of homeotic genes, demonstrating an important role for histone methylation in multiple biological processes (Martin and Zhang, 2005Martin C. Zhang Y. The diverse functions of histone lysine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Until recently, histone methylation was considered enzymatically irreversible. However, the recent discovery of a large number of histone demethylases indicates that demethylases play a central role in the regulation of histone methylation dynamics (Cloos et al., 2006Cloos P.A.

H3K4 methylation is dynamically regulated by histone methylases and the recently identified demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which mediates demethylation of H3K4me1/2, but not H3K4me3, due to the inherent chemistry (Shi et al., 2004Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Histone demethylation mediated by the nuclear amine oxidase homolog LSD1.Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of H3K4me3 in active transcription, it is of significant interest to investigate whether there are demethylases that specifically reverse H3K4 trimethylation. We used a candidate approach (Whetstine et al., 2006Whetstine J.R. Nottke A. Lan F. Huarte M. Smolikov S. Chen Z. Spooner E. Li E. Zhang G. Colaiacovo M. Shi Y.

In this report, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence that SMCX (alias JARID1C) reverses both H3K4 tri- and dimethylation. SMCX contains the catalytic JmjC domain, JmjN, and a C5HC2 zinc finger, as well as two plant homeodomain (PHD) domains, a motif that binds methyl-lysine residues (Shi et al., 2006Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. et al.ING2 PHD domain links histone H3 lysine 4 methylation to active gene repression.Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, Wysocka et al., 2006Wysocka J.

Badenhorst P. et al.A PHD finger of NURF couples histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation with chromatin remodelling.Nature. 2006; 442: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Importantly, SMCX has recently been shown to be a causal gene for X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) (Jensen et al., 2005Jensen L.R. Amende M. Gurok U. Moser B. Gimmel V. Tzschach A. Janecke A.R. Tariverdian G. Chelly J. Fryns J.P. et al.Mutations in the JARID1C gene, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, cause X-linked mental retardation.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). XLMR is a heterogenous disease involving environmental, stochastic, and/or genetic factors. It affects 2 out of 1000 males, and the symptom ranges from mild to severe mental retardation (Ropers and Hamel, 2005Ropers H.H. Hamel B.C. X-linked mental retardation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Although systematic mutation screenings have identified many genes implicated in XLMR, SMCX appears to be one of the more frequently mutated genes in this disease (Tzschach et al., 2006Tzschach A. Lenzner S. Moser B. Reinhardt R. Chelly J. Fryns J.P. Kleefstra T. Raynaud M. Turner G. Ropers H.H. et al.Novel JARID1C/SMCX mutations in patients with X-linked mental retardation.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 389Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thirteen SMCX point mutations have been identified (Jensen et al., 2005Jensen L.R. Amende M. Gurok U. Moser B. Gimmel V. Tzschach A. Janecke A.R. Tariverdian G. Chelly J. Fryns J.P. et al.Mutations in the JARID1C gene, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, cause X-linked mental retardation.Am.

Mutat. 2006; 27: 389Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Most of these mutations are missense mutations, which are located near JmjN, JmjC, the C5HC2 finger, and the N-terminal PHD domain, but the molecular consequences of these mutations were unclear. SMCX is evolutionarily conserved, and in mammals, it is a member of a subfamily of four proteins, including SMCY (JARID1D), RBP2 (JARID1A), and PLU-1 (JARID1B) (Klose et al., 2006aKlose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. JmjC-domain-containing proteins and histone demethylation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The other family members are also associated with important biology and human diseases. For instance, SMCY was identified as a male-specific antigen (Agulnik et al., 1994Agulnik A.I. Mitchell M.J. Lerner J.L. Woods D.R. Bishop C.E. A mouse Y chromosome gene encoded by a region essential for spermatogenesis and expression of male-specific minor histocompatibility antigens.Hum. Mol.

Bishop C.E. et al.Human H-Y: a male-specific histocompatibility antigen derived from the SMCY protein.Science. 1995; 269: 1588-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), while RBP2 was isolated as a pRB binding protein (Defeo-Jones et al., 1991Defeo-Jones D. Haung P.S. Jones R.E. Haskell K.M. Vuocolo G.A. Hanobik M.G. Huber H.E. Oliff A. Cloning of cDNAs for cellular proteins that binds to the retinoblastoma gene product.Nature. 1991; 352: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and its inactivation was proposed to be important for pRB to promote differentiation (Benevolenskaya et al., 2005Benevolenskaya E.V. Murray H.L. Branton P. Young R.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Binding of pRB to the PHD protein RBP2 promotes cellular differentiation.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fission yeast S. pombe homolog of RBP2, Msc1, suggested a possible role for this protein in modulating cellular response to DNA damage (Ahmed et al., 2004Ahmed S. Palermo C. Wan S. Walworth N.C. A novel protein with similarities to Rb binding protein 2 compensates for loss of Chk1 function and affects histone modification in fission yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3660-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Plu-1, on the other hand, has a restricted expression pattern in the testis, ovary, and transiently in the mammary gland of the pregnant female (Barrett et al., 2002Barrett A. Madsen B. Copier J. Lu P.J. Cooper L. Scibetta A.G. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. PLU-1 nuclear protein, which is upregulated in breast cancer, shows restricted expression in normal human adult tissues: a new cancer/testis antigen?.Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 101: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be upregulated in breast and testis cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Lu et al., 1999Lu P.J. Sundquist K. Baeckstrom D. Poulsom R. Hanby A. Meier-Ewert S. Jones T. Mitchell M. Pitha-Rowe P. Freemont P. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. A novel gene (PLU-1) containing highly conserved putative DNA/chromatin binding motifs is specifically up-regulated in breast cancer.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15633-15645Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). PLU-1 has also been shown to interact with the DNA binding transcription factors BF-1 and PAX9 and possibly function as a transcriptional corepressor (Tan et al., 2003Tan K. Shaw A.L. Madsen B. Jensen K. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Freemont P.S. Human PLU-1 has transcriptional repression properties and interacts with the developmental transcription factors BF-1 and PAX9.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20507-20513Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a link between this family of proteins with multiple biological processes and human diseases. We show that SMCX is a H3K4 trimethyl-histone demethylase, catalyzing demethylation of H3K4me3 to H3K4me1, but having no effect on methylation at other lysine residues, including H3K9, -27, -36, and H4K20. Consistent with these observations, overexpression of SMCX resulted in a specific reduction of H3K4me3 in cultured cells. As expected, we found that the other human SMCX family members were also H3K4 demethylases. We show that one of the two PHD fingers of SMCX specifically bound H3K9me3, suggesting crosstalks between H3K4 and H3K9 methylation in transcriptional repression. Importantly, SMCX mutations associated with XLMR compromised the demethylase activity, as well as its ability to bind H3K9me3. These findings suggest that a reduction of SMCX demethylation function is detrimental and may be a common cause of XLMR associated with SMCX mutations. To gain insights into the biological context in which SMCX functions that may be relevant to understanding of its role in XLMR, we investigated SMCX in both zebrafish and mammalian neurons. In situ hybridization revealed a developmental expression profile of SMCX that is restricted to the zebrafish brain. Consistently, inhibition of smcx resulted in significant defects in neuronal development in zebrafish, including increased neuronal cell death. In addition, inhibition of Smcx in primary mammalian neurons impaired dendritic morphogenesis. Importantly, while an RNAi-resistant wild-type SMCX transgene restored dendritic growth in the background of smcx knockdown, transgenes carrying point mutations, including an XLMR-patient point mutation, that disrupt demethylase activity failed to effectively restore dendritic growth, thus linking the demethylase activity to SMCX regulation of dendritic development. Our findings thus define a family of enzymes that reverse H3K4 trimethylation and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie XLMR pathology. SMCX (JARID1C) belongs to a small family of evolutionarily conserved proteins, whose members include RBP2 (JARID1A), PLU-1 (JARID1B), and SMCY (JARID1D) (Figure S1). The SMCX family members contain the JmjC domain, which has been shown to be the catalytic moiety for multiple histone demethylases (Chen et al., 2006Chen Z. Zang J. Whetstine J. Hong X. Davrazou F.

Members of the SMCX family also contain the JmjN domain, which is conserved among a subset of JmjC-domain proteins and has recently been shown to be important for maintaining the structural integrity of the adjacent JmjC domain, and therefore is critical for catalysis (Chen et al., 2006Chen Z. Zang J. Whetstine J. Hong X. Davrazou F. Kutateladze T.G. Simpson M. Mao Q. Pan C.H.

SMCX family members also contain a C5HC2 zinc finger located C-terminal to the JmjC domain. Although its function is unclear, a C2HC4 zinc finger has been shown to be important for JHDM2A demethylase activity (Yamane et al., 2006Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H.

All four members contain the BRIGHT domain, which is an AT-rich domain interacting domain (ARID).

Phylogenic analysis shows that SMCX, SMCY, and RBP2 are more similar to one another than PLU-1 (Figure S1). Importantly, the amino acids within the JmjC domain that have been shown to be critical for cofactor binding and catalysis are conserved among all four SMCX family members (data not shown). To determine whether SMCX is a histone demethylase, we isolated a full-length SMCX cDNA from HeLa cells by RT-PCR, subcloned it into a Gateway entry vector, subsequently transferred it to a baculoviral expression vector, and purified recombinant protein to near homogeneity from insect Sf9 cells. We used a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric approach to screen for demethylation using a variety of histone peptides representing mono-, di-, and trimethylation for four lysines on H3 and one lysine residue on H4. As shown in Figure 1, SMCX mediated demethylation at H3K4, but not H3K9, K27, K36, or H4K20. SMCX appeared to specifically demethylate H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 but not H3K4me1 (Figure 1, shaded panels), suggesting that SMCX converts H3K4 from tri- to monomethylated state. Consistent with these observations, when bulk histones were used as substrates, western blot analysis also showed SMCX-mediated demethylation of both H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 but not mono-, di-, or trimethylated H3K9 and H3K27 (Figure 2A). JmjC-domain-mediated demethylation reactions require Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate as cofactors (Chen et al., 2006Chen Z. Zang J. Whetstine J. Hong X. Davrazou F. Kutateladze T.G. Simpson M. Mao Q.

As shown in Figure S2, omission of α-ketoglutarate, or addition of EDTA resulted in a significant inhibition of the demethylation reaction mediated by SMCX. Taken together, these findings show that SMCX mediates H3K4me3/2 demethylation using the same chemistry described for other JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylases.Figure 2Specific Demethylation of Methylated H3K4 on Native Histone by SMCX, SMCY, Plu-1, and RBP2Show full caption(A and B) Calf thymus histones (3 μg) were incubated with 3 μg of purified, full-length SMCX, SMCY, RBP2, and PLU-1, respectively, and subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies that specifically recognize methylated histones.

Heat-inactivated recombinant proteins were used as controls. Reduced signals were found only for H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 by SMCX and SMCY and for all three methylation states by Plu-1. Nonspecific signals were marked as asterisks. The finding that human SMCX is a histone demethylase prompted us to investigate whether the other three closely related family members, SMCY, RBP2, and PLU-1, were histone lysine demethylases as well. Full-length cDNAs for human SMCY and RBP2 and mouse Plu-1 were cloned into the baculoviral vector for expression in the Sf9 insect cells. Bulk histone proteins were incubated with purified RBP2, SMCY, and Plu-1, respectively. As shown in Figure 2B, while SMCY demethylated H3K4me3 and H3K4me2, PLU-1 mediated demethylation of all three methylation states of H3K4. RBP2 had barely detectable demethylase activity under the same assay condition (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained using mass spectrometry where clear albeit low demethylase activity was detected for SMCY and Plu-1, but RBP2 showed the lowest detectable activity (Figure S3). It is unclear whether low levels of activity were due to improper folding of the recombinant proteins or additional factors are needed for optimal demethylase activity. In summary, we have demonstrated that SMCX family members are histone demethylases that are mainly involved in demethylation of tri- and dimethylated H3K4. We next investigated whether SMCX overexpression would alter H3K4 tri- and dimethylation in vivo. SMCX was fused to the HA epitope (HA-SMCX) and transfected into U2OS cells. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were fixed and costained with antibodies recognizing the HA epitope and histone methylation at various lysine residues. As shown in Figure 3, the signals representing H3K4me3 and H3K4me2, but not H3K4me1, were significantly reduced in ∼70% of the transfected cells where SMCX was overexpressed (panels A–I; marked by arrows). Importantly, the point mutation H514A that abrogated the demethylase activity of SMCX eliminated the ability of HA-SMCX to reduce H3K4me2/3 in vivo (less than 5% of the transfected cells exhibited reduced signals) (Figure 3; panels J–R), suggesting"

We provide evidence for a physiological role of the miRNA-silencing machinery in controlling HIV-1 replication. Type III RNAses Dicer and Drosha, responsible for miRNA processing, inhibited virus replication both in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1–infected donors and in latently infected cells. In turn, HIV-1 actively suppressed the expression of the polycistronic miRNA cluster miR-17/92. This suppression was found to be required for efficient viral replication and was dependent on the histone acetyltransferase Tat cofactor PCAF. Our results highlight the involvement of the miRNA-silencing pathway in HIV-1 replication and latency."

However, the recent discovery of histone demethylases has challenged the stable nature of histone methylation. Here we demonstrate that the JARID1 proteins RBP2, PLU1, and SMCX are histone demethylases specific for di- and trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4). Consistent with a role for the JARID1 Drosophila homolog Lid in regulating expression of homeotic genes during development, we show that RBP2 is displaced from Hox genes during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation correlating with an increase of their H3K4me3 levels and expression. Furthermore, we show that mutation or RNAi depletion of the C. elegans JARID1 homolog rbr-2 leads to increased levels of H3K4me3 during larval development and defects in vulva formation. Taken together, these results suggest that H3K4me3/me2 demethylation regulated by the JARID1 family plays an important role during development."

Recent studies indicate that, analogous to other histone modifications, histone methylation is reversible. Retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2), a nuclear protein implicated in the regulation of transcription and differentiation by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, contains a JmjC domain recently defined as a histone demethylase signature motif. Here we report that RBP2 is a demethylase that specifically catalyzes demethylation on H3K4, whose methylation is normally associated with transcriptionally active genes. RBP2-/- mouse cells displayed enhanced transcription of certain cytokine genes, which, in the case of SDF1, was associated with increased H3K4 trimethylation. Furthermore, RBP2 specifically demethylated H3K4 in biochemical and cell-based assays. These studies provide mechanistic insights into transcriptional regulation by RBP2 and provide the first example of a mammalian enzyme capable of erasing trimethylated H3K4."

Detailed mapping analysis revealed that besides the JmjC domain, the BRIGHT and zinc-finger-like C5HC2 domains are required for maximum catalytic activity. Importantly, isolation of native JARID1d complexes from human cells revealed the association of the demethylase with a polycomb-like protein Ring6a/MBLR. Ring6a/MBLR not only directly interacts with JARID1d but also regulates its enzymatic activity. We show that JARID1d and Ring6a occupy human Engrailed 2 gene and regulate its expression and H3K4 methylation levels.

Of the known extrasolar planets, 14 exhibit transits in front of their parent stars as seen from Earth. For them, spectroscopy can probe the physical conditions of their atmospheres and in theory, subtracting the spectrum seen with the planet 'behind' its star from that seen when it is 'in front', should leave us with the actual spectrum of an extrasolar planet. Practice has now caught up with theory, and using the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared spectrum has been obtained for the transiting 'hot Jupiter' HD 209458b. It shows a peak centred near 9.65 µm, attributed to emission by silicate clouds, and a narrow, unidentified feature at 7.78 µm. A measurement of the infrared spectrum (7.5–13.2 micrometres) of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b reveals that there is a broad emission peak centred near 9.65 micrometres, which they attribute to emission by silicate clouds, and a narrow, unidentified feature at 7.78 micrometres.

Here we report a measurement of the infrared spectrum (7.5–13.2 µm) of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b. Our observations reveal a hot thermal continuum for the planetary spectrum, with an approximately constant ratio to the stellar flux over this wavelength range. Superposed on this continuum is a broad emission peak centred near 9.65 µm that we attribute to emission by silicate clouds. We also find a narrow, unidentified emission feature at 7.78 µm. Models of these ‘hot Jupiter’5 planets predict a flux peak6,7,8,9 near 10 µm, where thermal emission from the deep atmosphere emerges relatively unimpeded by water absorption, but models dominated by water fit the observed spectrum poorly."

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). The Smad pathway is a central mediator of TGF-β signaling (2Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The canonical Smad pathway is activated upon binding of TGF-β to the heteromeric serine-threonine kinase receptors, TGF-βRII and -RI (ALK5), which leads to phosphorylation of Smad2 and -3, oligomerization with Smad4, nuclear translocation, and activation of various transcription programs (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a more complex TGF-β signaling has recently been described in endothelial cells, in which TGF-β signals through two distinct type I receptors, ALK5 and ALK1, and their respective signal transducers: Smad2 and -3 for ALK5 and Smad1 and -5 for ALK1 (3Goumans M.J. Lebrin F. Valdimarsdottir G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for various modifications of basic TGF-β/Smad signaling, especially in pathological conditions such as cancer or fibrosis (2Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the canonical TGF-β/Smad pathway has been studied in detail, other modes of TGF-β signaling are still poorly understood. Because TGF-β is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, it has long been considered a primary mediator of organ fibrosis (4Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J.

Moreover, a specific role of Smad3 in fibrosis was demonstrated in mice lacking Smad3 (10Flanders K.C. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Smad3-null mice showed reduction of fibrosis in different organs, including lung, skin, liver, and kidney (10Flanders K.C. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, production of ECM was unaffected during cutaneous wound healing in Smad3-null mice, suggesting the existence of Smad3-independent mechanisms involved in physiologic tissue repair by dermal fibroblasts (11Ashcroft G.S.

Animal models, at best, represent only certain aspects of human fibrotic diseases, which are chronic and progressive and may take many years to develop. Despite numerous studies, the specific contribution of TGF-β signaling to the human fibrosis has not been fully elucidated and, in particular, the basis for the chronic nature of TGF-β signaling in fibrosis remains unknown. One of the characteristics of fibrotic lesions is the aberrant expression of TGF-β receptors. For example, an increased ratio of TGF-βRI to RII expression levels have been observed in liver fibrosis (12Roulot D. Sevcsik A.M. Coste T. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S.

Furthermore, constitutive nuclear localization of Smad2 unresponsive to the blockade of the endogenous TGF-β signaling has been shown in scleroderma fibroblasts and in activated hepatic stellate cells (17Mori Y.

In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that constitutively elevated expression levels of CCN2 (CTGF) in scleroderma fibroblasts is Smad2/3-independent (19Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, blockade of Smad signaling by a pharmacologic inhibitor of ALK5 kinase did not normalize elevated CCN2 levels in scleroderma fibroblasts (20Chen Y. Shi-Wen X.

Whereas collectively these findings suggest that overproduction of matrix in fibrosis may be, at least in part, due to the alternative activation of TGF-β signaling, the specific mechanisms involved in such activation are still poorly understood.

We found considerable overlap between the genes elevated in this experimental model and those previously reported to be overexpressed by lesional SSc fibroblasts and in scleroderma biopsies in vivo (21Pannu J. Gardner H. Shearstone J.R. Smith E. Trojanowska M. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 3011-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Gardner H. Shearstone J.R. Bandaru R. Crowell T. Lynes M. Trojanowska M. Pannu J. Smith E. Jablonska S. Blaszczyk M. Tan F.K. Mayes M.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 1961-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Among such genes were collagens type I, III, and V, fibronectin, proline 4-hydroxylase, CTGF, SPARC, IGFBP-3, and other matrix protein-related genes. Furthermore, collagen protein production in this model was resistant to the inhibition by ALK5 kinase inhibitors, suggesting that this in vitro experimental model reproduced to a large extent the fibrotic program characteristic of lesional SSc fibroblasts. The present study was undertaken to delineate the signaling molecules that mediate ECM up-regulation in response to the elevated TGF-βRI levels. The results of this study demonstrate that TGF-βRI-dependent induction of the fibrotic program does not involve Smad2/3 and is mediated by activation of ALK1/Smad1 and ERK1/2 pathways. Cell Culture—Upon informed consent and in compliance with the Institutional Review Board of Human Studies, skin biopsies were taken from the dorsal forearm of healthy donors. Dermal fibroblasts were obtained from the biopsies by enzymatically dissociating tissue specimens in 0.25% collagenase type I (Sigma) and 0.05% DNase (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 20% fetal bovine serum. Fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for all experiments. Before stimulation with cytokines and infection with adenoviruses, fibroblasts were incubated in serum-free medium (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 24 h. Adenoviral Constructs and siRNA Vectors—Replication-in-competent adenoviral vector expressing rat full-length ALK5/TGF-βRI (abbreviated as AdTGFβRI or AdRI) and control green fluorescent protein (AdGo) were generated as described earlier (14Pannu J. Gore-Hyer E. Yamanaka M. Smith E.A. Rubinchik S. Dong J.Y. Jablonska S. Blaszczyk M. Trojanowska M. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1566-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In experiments using AdTGF-βRI, dermal fibroblasts were transduced with 25–50 m.o.i. of the adenovirus. Multiplicity of infection is calculated as (total number of cells per well × desired m.o.i.) divided by the titer of the virus. AdALK5(3A) was previously described (23Itoh S. Thorikay M. Kowanetz M. Moustakas A. Itoh F. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3751-3761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Adenoviral Smad1 siRNA vector with the target sequence 5′-CCTGTCATTATTGCTTACT-3′ was prepared as follows. Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into MluI and XhoI sites of the pRNAT-H1.1 shuttle vector (Genescript). The shuttle vector with target siRNA sequence was linearized with PmeI and then electroporated into BJ5183-AD-1 (Stratagene) to generate recombinant Adenoeasy vector. The recombinant Adenoeasy plasmid after linearization with the PacI enzyme was transfected into QBI-293 cells using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) for generation of adenovirus. The shuttle vector plasmid and Adenoeasy vector plasmid were sequenced to confirm the cloning. The primary adenoviral stock was then amplified and concentrated by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. Typical viral titer was 1 × 1010 plaque forming units/ml. In addition, another adenoviral Smad1 siRNA targeted to the 5′-CACACACCTTGGTAACATA-3′ sequence of the Smad1 gene was also prepared as described above, to validate the effect of Smad1 suppression. The sequence of Scrambled siRNA used as a non-silencing control for this experiment is 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′ and was prepared in the same manner. Adenoviral vector expressing siRNA directed toward TGF-βRII were provided by Dr. Peter ten Dijke. siRNA directed against human Smad2 and Smad3 were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies, CO. The sequence of the sense oligo for siRNA directed against Smad2 is 5′-GUCCCAUGAAAAGACUUAATT-3′ and for Smad3 is 5′-GGAGAAAUGGUGCGAGAAGTT-3′. Western Blotting—Confluent healthy dermal fibroblasts were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). 40–50 μg of protein was separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), which was then blocked at room temperature using 3% milk/Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBST) for 1 h. The blots were probed overnight with a 1:1,000 dilution of appropriate primary antibody: goat anti-type I collagen antibody (Southern Biotechnology), rabbit anti-TGF-βRI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Smad2, Phospho- and total p44/42 MAPK antibody (all from Cell Signaling Technology), and Smad1 antibody (Abcam) in 3% milk/TBST. Phospho-Smad1 antibody was previously described (24Persson U. Izumi H. Souchelnytskyi S. Itoh S. Grimsby S. Engstrom U. Heldin C.H. Funa K. ten Dijke P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Following washes with TBST, blots were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. As a control for equal protein loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed for β-actin using a monoclonal antibody to β-actin (Sigma). Protein levels were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated using NIH Image densitometry software (National Institutes of Health). Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)—For IP, 400 μg of total cell protein were used. Adult dermal fibroblasts were grown to confluence after which they were made quiescent by treatment with DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were treated with increasing doses of either AdGFP or AdTGF-βRI. TGF-β (5 ng/ml) treatment for 30 min was used as a positive control for this experiment. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with protease inhibitors (Mixture Set III, Calbiochem). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Complex formation was performed overnight at 4 °C using 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal Smad3 or rabbit Sp1 antibody (sc-8332, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology) followed by precipitation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h in 4 °C. Negative controls were performed using normal rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in buffer A, eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and trans-blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-phosphoserine antibody (ab6639-100, Abcam) overnight, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and washing with Tween/Tris-buffered saline solution. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Total Smad3 protein was detected by Western blotting on the same membranes after stripping and re-probing the blot with mouse monoclonal anti-Smad1/2/3 (sc-7960, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and appropriate secondary antibody. For co-IP, 1000 μg of total cell protein was used. Confluent dishes of adult dermal fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β for 45 min where indicated. The cells were scraped and lysed in co-IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min and centrifuged to separate the cell debris. Protein concentration was determined as described above. Complex formation was performed overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal ALK5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and processed as described above. Western blot analysis was carried out with goat polyclonal ALK-1 antibody and subsequently with goal polyclonal ALK5 antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Northern Blotting—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 60-mm2 dishes, incubated in serum-free DMEM, and transduced with control AdGo or AdTGF-βRI. UO126 was added 24 h before harvesting the cells. 48 h later, total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting as previously described (25Ishikawa O. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). TGF-β (5 ng/ml) treatment for 24 h was used as a positive control. Filters were hybridized sequentially with radioactive probes for COL1A2, COL1A1, CTGF, and 18 S rRNA. The signal was quantified using NIH Image densitometry software (National Institutes of Health). Site-directed Mutagenesis and RT-PCR—Point mutations of the Sp1 site (proximal to the start site) in the CTGF promoter were introduced using the Exsite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the oligonucleotides used for mutation is: forward, 5′-GGCTGTCTCCTCTCAGCGGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTTTATACGCTCCGGGCGGCCGCGGC-3′. The mutation of the Smad binding site and the putative TGF-β response element (TβRE) was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The sequences of the oligonucleotide used to mutate the Smad binding site were: forward, 5′-CTGGAGTGTGCCAGCTTTTTTGGCTGGAGGAATGCTGAGTGTCAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTTGACACTCAGCATTCCTCCAGCCAAAAAAGCTGGCACACTCCAG-3′, and for TβRE are: forward 5′-TCAGACGGAGGAATGCTGAACATCCCGGAGCCAGGATCAATCGC-3′ and reverse-5′-GCGATTGATCCTGGCTCCGGGATGTTCAGCATTCCTCCGTCTGA-3′. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. RT-PCR for TGF-βRII mRNA levels was carried out as described earlier (14Pannu J. Gore-Hyer E. Yamanaka M. Smith E.A. Rubinchik S. Dong J.Y. Jablonska S. Blaszczyk M. Trojanowska M. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1566-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—For validation of genes at the mRNA level, total RNA was isolated from dermal fibroblasts using TriReagent (MRC Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction using random primers and Transcriptor First Strand synthesis kit (Roche Applied Sciences). qPCR was carried out using IQ SYBR Green mixture (Bio-Rad) on an iCycler PCR machine (Bio-Rad) using 1 μl of cDNA in triplicate with β-actin as the internal control. The primers are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Primers for qPCRGenePrimers (5′-3′)Smad1ForwardTGAACCATGGATTTGAGACAGTReverseCTGGCGGTGGTATTCTGCCollagen 1A1ForwardCCAGAAGAACTGGTACATCAGCAReverseCGCCATACTCGAACTGGGAATCollagen 1A2ForwardGATGTTGAACTTGTTGCTGAGGReverseTCTTTCCCCATTCATTTGTCTTCTGFForwardTTGCGAAGCTGACCTGGAAGAGAAReverseAGCTCGGTATGTCTTCATGCTGGTβ-ActinForwardAATGTCGCGGAGGACTTTGATTGCReverseAGGATGGCAAGGGACTTCCTGTAA Open table in a new tab Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Adult dermal fibroblasts were seeded on 6-well plates (105 cells/well) and transfected 24 h later. Transient transfections with the indicated reporter, expression, and control constructs were performed in duplicate using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activities in aliquots normalized for equal protein concentrations were determined 24 h after TGF-β1 stimulation using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Transfections were repeated at least four times using two different plasmid preparations. In some experiments dermal fibroblasts were first transduced with AdRI (m.o.i. 25) and 8 h later transfected with CTGF-Luc or pSBE4-luc promoter using FuGENE 6 reagent as described above. Cells were harvested 48 h later and luciferase activity was measured in aliquots normalized for equal protein concentrations. In some experiments dermal fibroblasts were first transduced with Ad siRNA directed against Smad1 for 24 h followed by transduction with AdRI (m.o.i. 25) for an additional 8 h. Cells were then transfected with CTGF-luc promoter using FuGENE 6 reagent as described above and collected 48 h later. Luciferase activity was determined as described above. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test analysis using GraphPad InStat statistics software (version 1.12) was performed to determine statistical significance. Values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. TGF-βRI-dependent Induction of Collagen Does Not Depend on Activation of Smad2/3 Signaling—We have previously established an experimental model of fibrosis using adenoviral-mediated TGF-βRI overexpression in human dermal fibroblasts (21Pannu J. Gardner H. Shearstone J.R. Smith E. Trojanowska M. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 3011-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To begin the investigation of the molecular mechanism underlying the profibrotic effects of TGF-βRI, the kinetics of the TGF-βRI protein expression levels after adenoviral transduction were determined. Confluent cells were transduced with the previously established optimal dose of AdTGF-βRI for 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h. The TGF-βRI protein levels were consistently elevated at 12 h, and reached plateau at 18 h post-transduction. There was no further increase in TGFβ-RI protein up to 72 h post-transduction (Fig. 1A). The collagen type I protein levels were similarly increased starting at 12–18 h post-transduction reaching steady-state expression levels at 24 h and remaining at this level for up to 72 h. Thus, under these experimental conditions, the steady-state TGF-βRI signaling activity is maintained for the duration of the experiment. We have previously shown that the endogenously produced TGF-β is required for the observed profibrotic response in this model (21Pannu J. Gardner H. Shearstone J.R. Smith E. Trojanowska M. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 3011-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Smad2 and -3 are the best characterized downstream effectors of TGF-β and are phosphorylated in response to phosphorylation/activation of TGF-βRI (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). To determine the signaling molecules that mediate ECM up-regulation in response to the elevated TGF-βRI levels, we examined the phosphorylation status of Smad2 and Smad3. In contrast to the potent, acute Smad2 phosphorylation observed in response to TGF-β (1 ng/ml) treatment for 45 min, no considerable Smad activation was seen in dermal fibroblasts that were transduced with the AdTGF-βRI at any of the time points examined (Fig. 1A). Likewise, Smad3 was not phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with our previous observation demonstrating that the specific TGF-βRI kinase inhibitors, SB431542 and SD-208 failed to inhibit stimulation of collagen in this experimental model (20Chen Y. Shi-Wen X. Eastwood M. Black C.M. Denton C.P. Leask A. Abraham D.J. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Pannu J. Gardner H. Shearstone J.R. Smith E. Trojanowska M. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 3011-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Together, these data support the conclusion that the observed effects of TGF-βRI overexpression may not involve activation of the Smad2/3 pathway. To directly test this possibility, we utilized the TGF-βRI mutant defective in Smad activation, ALK5(3A) (23Itoh S. Thorikay M. Kowanetz M. Moustakas A. Itoh F. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3751-3761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows the basal expression level of ALK5(3A) at increasing doses of virus. Collagen protein levels were analyzed in normal dermal fibroblasts transduced with increasing doses of AdALK5(3A). Overexpression of ALK5(3A) potently stimulated basal collagen type I protein levels at all doses tested, with m.o.i. 25–50 being the most effective. Together, these data support the conclusion that simulation of collagen type I production by overexpression of TGF-βRI may not involve activation of Smad2/3 pathway. The lack of involvement of the Smad2/3 pathway in profibrogenic effects of TGF-βRI was unexpected and, therefore, to exclude the possibility that low levels of Smad2/3 signaling were contributing to matrix gene expression in our model, additional experiments were carried out. First, we demonstrated that whereas the siRNA-mediated blockade of either Smad2 or -3 completely prevented TGF-β-induced collagen up-regulation, AdTGF-βRI dependent up-regulation of collagen remained unaffected by this treatment (supplemental materials Fig. S1). In addition, we utilized the pSBE4-luc promoter that consists of four tandem copies of Smad3 binding sites (26Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) and represents a very sensitive tool to measure activation of Smad3-dependent signaling. This promoter is highly responsive to TGF-β stimulation in control dermal fibroblasts, but there was no detectable activation of this promoter in cells transduced with AdTGF-βRI (supplemental materials Fig. S2). Together, these data indicate that stimulation of collagen type I production by overexpression of TGF-βRI does not require activation of the Smad2/3 pathway.

However, processing is incomplete in some tissues, leading to POMC precursor release from cells. This study examined POMC processing in human skin and the effect of POMC on the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC-1R) and melanocyte regulation. POMC was secreted by both human epidermal keratinocytes (from 5 healthy donors) and matched epidermal melanocytes in culture. Much lower levels of alpha-MSH were secreted and only by the keratinocytes. Neither cell type released ACTH. Cell extracts contained significantly more ACTH than POMC, and alpha-MSH was detected only in keratinocytes. Nevertheless, the POMC processing components, prohormone convertases 1, 2 and regulatory protein 7B2, were detected in melanocytes and keratinocytes. In contrast, hair follicle melanocytes secreted both POMC and alpha-MSH, and this was enhanced in response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) acting primarily through the CRH receptor 1. In cells stably transfected with the MC-1R, POMC stimulated cAMP, albeit with a lower potency than ACTH, alpha-MSH, and beta-MSH. POMC also increased melanogenesis and dendricity in human pigment cells. This release of POMC from skin cells and its functional activity at the MC-1R highlight the importance of POMC processing as a key regulatory event in the skin."
https://openalex.org/W1994009234,"Specialized lipid domains (rafts) that are generally enriched in sterols and sphingolipids, are most likely present in cell membranes of animals, plants and fungi. While cholesterol and ergosterol are predominant in vertebrates and fungi, plants possess complex sterol profiles, dominated by sitosterol and stigmasterol in Arabidopsis thaliana. Fully hydrated model membranes of composition approaching those found in rafts of mammals, fungi and plants were investigated by means of solid-state 2H-NMR, using deuterated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (2H(62)-DPPC). The dynamics of such membranes was determined through measuring of membrane ordering or disordering properties. The presence of the liquid-ordered, lo, phase, which may be an indicator of rigid sterol-sphingolipid domains, was detected in all binary or ternary mixtures of all sterols investigated. Of great interest, the dynamics of ternary mixtures mimicking rafts in plants (phytosterol/glucosylcerebroside/DPPC), showed a lesser temperature sensitivity to thermal shocks, on comparing to systems mimicking rafts in mammals and fungi. This effect was particularly marked with sitosterol. The presence of an ethyl group branched on the alkyl chain of sitosterol and stigmasterol is proposed as reinforcing the membrane cohesion by additional attractive van der Waals interactions with the alkyl chains of sphingolipids and phospholipids. As a side result, the elevated resolution of NMR spectra in the presence of sitosterol also suggests domains of smaller size than with other sterols. Finally, the role of phytosterols in maintaining plant membranes in a state of dynamics less sensitive to temperature shocks is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2136530078,"Cancer cell adhesion is traditionally viewed as random, occurring if the cell's receptors match the substrate. Cancer cells are subjected to pressure and shear during growth against a constraining stroma, surgical manipulation, and passage through the venous and lymphatic system. Cells shed into a cavity such as the abdomen postoperatively also experience increased pressure from postoperative edema. Increased extracellular pressure stimulates integrin-mediated cancer cell adhesion via FAK and Src. PI 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (LY294002 or wortmannin), Akt inhibitors, or Akt1 siRNA blocked adhesion stimulated by 15 mmHg pressure in SW620 or primary human malignant colonocytes. Pressure activated PI3K, tyrosine-phosphorylated and membrane-translocated the p85 subunit, and phosphorylated Akt. PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) prevented pressure-stimulated Akt Ser473 and FAK Tyr397, but not FAK576 or Src416 phosphorylation. PP2 inhibited PI3K activity and Akt phosphorylation. FAK siRNA did not affect pressure-induced PI3K activation but blocked Akt phosphorylation. Pressure also stimulated FAK or FAKY397F mutant translocation to the membrane. Akt inhibitor IV blocked pressure-induced Akt and FAK translocation. Pressure activated Src- and PI3K-dependently induced p85 interaction with FAK, and FAK with beta1 integrin. These results delineate a novel force-activated inside-out Src/PI3K/FAK/Akt pathway by which cancer cells regulate their own adhesion. These signals may be potential targets for inhibition of metastatic adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2035045924,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the homeostatic antiinflammatory axis centered on annexin 1 (AnxA1) in cerebral microvascular dysfunction and tissue injury associated with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and reperfusion. Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the mouse cerebral microcirculation: AnxA1 null mice exhibited more white blood cell adhesion in cerebral venules than their wild-type counterparts, and this was accompanied by a larger cerebral infarct vol and worse neurological score. All parameters were rescued by delivery of human recombinant AnxA1. To further explore these findings using pharmacological tools, the effect of a short AnxA1 peptidomimetic was tested. When given during the reperfusion phase, peptide Ac2-26 produced similar cerebroprotection, which was associated with a marked attenuation of cell adhesion and markers of inflammation as measured in tissue homogenates. The pharmacological effects of peptide Ac2-26 occurred via receptors of the formyl-peptide receptor (FPR) family, most likely FPR-rs2, as deduced by displacement assays with transfected cells and in vivo experiments with transgenic mice and receptor antagonists. Our findings indicate that the endogenous antiinflammatory circuit centered on AnxA1 produces significant cerebral protection, and that these properties might have therapeutic potential for stroke treatment."

Its anomalies have long been attributed to a merger between two massive stars that occurred some 20,000 years before the explosion, but so far there has been no conclusive proof that this merger took place. Here, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the mass ejection associated with such a merger and the subsequent evolution of the ejecta, and we show that this accurately reproduces the properties of the triple-ring nebula surrounding the supernova."

Until now, only initial and final proteinases in the pathways have been conclusively identified. Four such proteinases have been purified from the larval hemolymph of Manduca sexta: hemolymph proteinase 14 (HP14), which autoactivates in the presence of microbial surface components, and three prophenoloxidase-activating proteinases (PAP1–3). In this study, we have used two complementary approaches to identify a serine proteinase that activates proPAP3. Partial purification from hemolymph of an activator of proPAP3 resulted in an active fraction with two abundant polypeptides of ∼32 and ∼37 kDa. Labeling of these polypeptides with a serine proteinase inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, indicated that they were active serine proteinases. N-terminal sequencing revealed that both were cleaved forms of the previously identified hemolymph serine proteinase, HP21. Surprisingly, cleavage of proHP21 had occurred not at the predicted activation site but more N-terminal to it. In vitro reactions carried out with purified HP14 (which activates proHP21), proHP21, proPAP3, and site-directed mutant forms of the latter two proteinases confirmed that HP21 activates proPAP3 by limited proteolysis.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28097-28104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). HP14 is a complex, multidomain serine proteinase that associates with peptidoglycan or β-1,3-glucan found on the surface of bacteria and fungi, respectively (3Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9271-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At least in some cases, the association is mediated by a pathogen recognition protein; for example, HP14 combines with a β-1,3-glucan recognition protein (βGRP2) to bind to β-1,3-glucan (4Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9271-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Upon binding to these microbial polysaccharides, HP14 undergoes autoactivation, presumably via an initial conformational change that enables one molecule of HP14 to cleave a second molecule at its activation site (GTEL*VLGG). Key residues in the putative substrate binding pocket of HP14 (Gly585, Ala616, and Thr630) are consistent with cleavage after a bulky, hydrophobic residue such as leucine (3Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cleaved form of HP14 can initiate activation of proPO in hemolymph (3Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9271-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All known proPO-activating proteinases have a C-terminal catalytic domain and one or two N-terminal clip domains (5Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12220-12225Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The function of the clip domain is unknown, but it is assumed to be regulatory (22Piao S. Song Y.-L.

Active B. mori PPAE is competent to activate proPO by cleavage after an activation site arginine (9Satoh D. Horri A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast, H. diomphalia PPAF-I and the M. sexta PAPs require the presence of one or more cofactors to fully activate proPO (16Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J.

Biol. 2003; 33: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The H. diomphalia cofactor (PPAF-II) and the M. sexta cofactors (SPH1 and SPH2) are serine proteinase homologs (proteins with high sequence similarity to serine proteinases but lacking the active site serine) that need to be cleaved to be functional. The proteinase activator of PPAF-II has been identified (19Kim M.S. Baek M.J. Lee M.H. Park J.W. Lee S.Y. Soderhall K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39999-40004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while the activator of the M. sexta SPHs is still unknown. H. diomphalia proPO is activated in two steps: PPAF-I cleaves proPO to generate a 76-kDa form, then PPAF-II (activated by PPAF-III) cleaves the 76-kDa form to generate an active, 60-kDa form of PO (16Lee S.Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39999-40004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). M. sexta proPO is activated by a single cleavage event that requires an active PAP and the presence of active SPHs (20Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Gupta S. Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The significance of the differences between these three mechanisms of activation is unknown. As part of our long term goal of understanding immune related proteinase cascades, our objective for this study was to identify an activator of proPAP3 in M. sexta plasma. ProPAP3 is a constitutively expressed and secreted proteinase zymogen with two clip domains (7Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Zhu Y. Kanost M. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Zou Z. Jiang H. Insect Mol. Biol. 2005; 14: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is activated when it is cleaved after the P1 lysine within its activation site (VGNK*IIGG) (7Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Zhu Y. Kanost M. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); however, the proteinase that carries out this activation step has been unknown. PAP3 hydrolyzes IEAR-p-nitroanilide (IEAR-pNA) and other artificial substrates with a P1 arginine. We took two complementary approaches to identify an activator of proPAP3. First, we assayed fractions from chromatographic separations of hemolymph proteins or their ability to activate proPAP3. By this method, we identified hemolymph proteinase 21 (HP21) as a candidate activator of proPAP3. HP21 is a previously discovered serine proteinase with an N-terminal clip domain (24Jiang H. Wang Y. Gu Y. Guo X. Zou Z. Scholz F. Trenczek T.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our second approach was to perform in vitro reactions with purified proteins and thereby establish directly that HP21 is capable of activating proPAP3. This work was made possible by the finding, reported separately, that HP14 can activate proHP21. 3Y. Wang and H. Jiang, submitted manuscript. Partial Purification of an Activator of proPAP3 from M. sexta Hemolymph—Hemolymph was collected from bar stage prepupae into saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C as described previously (6Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3552-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Ammonium sulfate was adjusted to 50% saturation, and samples were frozen at –80 °C until 290 ml of hemolymph had been collected. All subsequent purification steps were done at 4 °C. Proteins that were precipitated at 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet (containing 5.6 g of protein) was dissolved in 140 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 6.8, 0.001% phenylthiourea, 10 mm diethyldithiocarbamic acid. This fraction did not activate proPAP3; therefore, curdlan (an insoluble β-1,3-glucan) was added to elicit activity. (The ability of curdlan to elicit activation of proPAP3 in prepupal hemolymph was reported previously (7Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Zhu Y. Kanost M. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). ProPAP3 activation was detected using amidase and immunoblot assays described below.) The fraction was incubated with 0.36 g of curdlan for 10 min on ice with gentle shaking and the curdlan was removed by centrifugation. Further ammonium sulfate fractionation was done, and the pelleted 10–30% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction (620 mg) was dissolved in 119 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Proteins were applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (2.5 cm i.d. × 4 cm), and bound proteins (104 mg) were eluted with 0.5 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside and dialyzed twice against 3.5 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8. This fraction was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (1.5 cm i.d. × 7.5 cm), and proteins were eluted with 100–500 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Approximately 40% of the protein but about two-thirds of the activity was in the fraction that did not bind to Q-Sepharose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8. This fraction (42 mg) was concentrated 20-fold using MacroSep 10 kDa MWCO units. Forty percent of the concentrated protein fraction was dialyzed against 2 liters of 20 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 6.8. This fraction was applied to a CM Sepharose column (1 cm i.d. × 5.6 cm), and proteins were eluted with 10–700 mm NaCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. Sixty-five percent of the protein and all of the activity was in the flow-through fraction. An equal volume of 100 mm NaCl was added to the unbound protein fraction and loaded on a prepacked ceramic hydroxyapatite type II (Bio-Rad) column (1 ml). Proteins were eluted with 10–400 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8. Approximately 15% of the protein and 80% of the activity were present in the unbound fractions, which were dialyzed twice against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Proteins were loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (1 cm i.d. × 4.5 cm), the column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Activity was detected in the flow-through fraction and in fractions that eluted at 20–120 mm NaCl. The unbound protein fraction was chosen for further biochemical characterization, because its activity was relatively high and it contained just three polypeptides detectable by silver staining. This fraction was concentrated using MacroSep and NanoSep 10-kDa MWCO units, and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8, using the NanoSep units. This active fraction contained 0.1 mg of protein at 0.5 mg/ml. Amidase Assays—IEAR-pNA is an artificial substrate of proPAP3 (7Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Zhu Y. Kanost M. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and so can be used to detect PAP3 activity. Assays were done by mixing column fractions or in vitro reactions with 50 μm IEAR-pNA in reaction buffer (typically 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) and recording the absorbance at 405 nm every 30 s for 20 min. The reaction rate was calculated from the slope of the initial, linear portion of each curve generated. One unit of activity was defined as a change in A405 of 0.001 per min. Immunoblot Assay of proPAP3 Activation—Aliquots of column fractions were mixed with 70 ng of recombinant proPAP3 and incubated at room temperature for 10–30 min. The reaction volume was typically 15 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose, and detection with antiserum to proPAP3 (7Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Zhu Y. Kanost M. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Activity was assessed by the presence of specific PAP3 cleavage products (the ∼40-kDa catalytic domain and the ∼20-kDa dual clip domain). The effect of proteinase inhibitors on proPAP3 activation was determined by incubating 400 ng of active fraction with inhibitor for 20 min at room temperature and then adding 70 ng of proPAP3 and assaying for activity by immunoblot analysis as described above. Inhibitors tested included 1 mm and 10 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm (4-amidino-phenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF), which were diluted from concentrated stocks immediately before use with 0.1 m MOPS, pH 6.9. Diisopropyl Fluorophosphate Labeling of Serine Proteinases—22 μg of the hemolymph fraction containing a partially purified activator of proPAP3 (described above) was incubated with 0.01 mm [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate ([3H]DFP) for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled proteins were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography (26Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Masses were estimated by comparison with 14C-labeled standards. X-ray film exposure to the treated, dried gel was for 5 weeks at –70 °C. N-terminal Protein Sequencing—Proteins in 7.5 μg of the active fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Polypeptides were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and two major bands (∼32 kDa and ∼37 kDa) were excised for further analysis. N-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosciences 494 cLc sequencer by the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University. Purification of HP14 from M. sexta Hemolymph—ProHP14 was purified from immune induced larval hemolymph as described previously (4Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9271-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, purification included ammonium sulfate fractionation and several chromatography steps (hydroxyapatite, Sephacryl S100, concanavalin-A Sepharose, and dextran sulfate-Sepharose). During initial purification trials, we discovered that proHP14 became activated upon binding to Macro-Prep High Q beads (Bio-Rad); therefore, we were able to purify active HP14 by binding purified proHP14 to a High Q column in 20 mm bis-Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 6.8 and eluting with a linear salt gradient (10–1000 mm NaCl). From 55 ml of hemolymph, we purified 60 μg of active HP14. HP14 activity was verified by three methods: ability of the purified HP14 to initiate activation of proPO and to complex with recombinant serpin-1I in vitro, 4M. J. Gorman and M. R. Kanost, unpublished observations. and the ability to activate proHP21 (see “Results”). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Five proteins were expressed using a baculovirus expression system (Bac-toBac, Invitrogen). A cDNA containing the full coding region of proHP21 was cloned into pFH6 (pFastBac1 modified to encode a C-terminal hexahistidine tag) (27Ji C. Wang Y. Ross J. Jiang H. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 29: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and a cDNA containing the full coding region of proPAP3 was cloned into pFastBac1. Mutations were introduced into these cDNAs with the QuikChange Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The proHP21[Ser→ Ala] mutation was made by changing the codon for the active site serine (Ser344) from AGC to GCC, and the proHP21[Leu→ Lys] mutation by changing the codon for the P1 leucine (Leu151) from CTT to AAG. The proPAP3[Ser→ Ala] mutation was generated by changing the codon for the active site serine (Ser358) from TCT to GCT. DNA sequencing confirmed that the mutant cDNA sequences were correct. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated for each of the five cDNAs. Plaque assays were used to determine titers of amplified virus stocks. For expression, typically, 1 liter of Sf9 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml serum-free medium [Sf-900 II SFM]) was infected with baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and cells were incubated at 27 °C with shaking for 48 h. Cells were removed by two centrifugation steps (500 × g for 10 min). Purification of proHP21 and its two mutant variants began with binding proteins in the culture medium to concanavalin-A-Sepharose followed by eluting with 0.5 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (4 °C). Eluted proteins were dialzyed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (4 °C) and loaded on a High Q column (Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (20–1000 mm NaCl). Fractions containing the proHP21 variant were pooled and then separated by Sephacryl S100HR chromatography using 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8 at 1.85 ml/min. In the next step, nickel affinity chromatography took advantage of the C-terminal His tag on these recombinant proteinases. Proteins were bound to nickle-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8. The final purification step was a second fractionation with a High Q column, this time using a shallow elution gradient (60 ml, 20–400 mm NaCl). At each step, fractions containing proHP21 were detected by immunoblot analysis. The purified proHP21 variants were stored at –80 °C. The first step for purifying proPAP3 and proPAP3[Ser→ Ala] was binding and eluting from concanavalin A-Sepharose. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7 (4 °C) followed by purification by Q-Sepharose chromatography. Proteins were eluted from the Q column with a 300 ml linear gradient from 0–50 mm NaCl. These two steps were adequate for purifying proPAP3, but an additional step was used for proPAP3[Ser→ Ala]. Q-Sepharose fractions containing proPAP3[Ser→ Ala] were pooled, concentrated with Centriplus 10-kDa MWCO units, dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and fractionated by ceramic hydroxy-apatite II (Bio-Rad) chromatography. Fractions containing pure proPAP3[Ser→ Ala] were pooled, and the sample buffer was exchanged by dialysis to 20 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm NaCl, pH 8.5 (4 °C). The purified proPAP3 variants were concentrated and stored at –80 °C in small aliquots. For all proteins, purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by a sensitive silver staining method (SilverXpress kit, Invitrogen). In Vitro Proteinase Reactions—The proteinase stocks used for in vitro reactions were HP14 (40 ng/μl in 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, ∼175 mm NaCl, pH 6.8), proHP21 variant (14 ng/μlin20 mm Tris-HCl, ∼100 mm NaCl, pH 8), proPAP3 (130 ng/μlin20 mm Tris-HCl, ∼40 mm NaCl, pH 8.5 [4 °C]), and proPAP3[Ser→ Ala] (45 ng/μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm NaCl, pH 8.5 [4 °C]). Sodium chloride concentrations of the first three buffers listed are estimations based on the predicted salt concentrations of the ion exchange column fractions containing the purified enzymes. Proteinases were mixed in various combinations. Amounts added were 80 ng of HP14, 70 ng of proHP21 variant, and 90 ng of proPAP3 variant, or an equal volume of the appropriate buffer was substituted. The reaction volume was 30 μl, of which 13 μl was the buffer 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.002% Tween-20, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. We partially purified an activator of proPAP3 from Manduca prepupal hemolymph. Details of the purification are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The active fraction contained 0.1 mg of protein and included six polypeptides detectable by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1A). Incubation of 250 ng of active fraction with 70 ng of proPAP3 for 10 min resulted in complete cleavage of proPAP3 into its ∼40-kDa catalytic domain and ∼20-kDa dual clip domain (Fig. 1B). Activity of the cleaved form of PAP3 was verified by an amidase assay that used IEAR-pNA as the substrate (Fig. 1C). DFP, an irreversible and nonspecific serine proteinase inhibitor, was used to determine which of the proteins in the active fraction might be active serine proteinases. The active fraction was incubated with [3H]DFP for 30 min, and labeled proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. A long (5 week) exposure was required to detect labeled polypeptides. Of these weakly labeled proteins, two (of ∼32 kDa and ∼37 kDa) were most prominent (Fig. 2A). Partial inhibition of the fraction's activity by 10 mm DFP suggested that one of these two proteins may be an activator of proPAP3 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2A serine proteinase inhibitor labels polypeptides in the active fraction and partially inhibits activity. A, polypeptides in the active fraction were labeled with [3H]DFP. 22.5 μg of active fraction was incubated with 0.01 mm [3H]DFP for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled proteins were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography. Arrows point to the same bands as those in Fig. 1A. (Note that the molecular mass standards are different than those used for all other experiments, and the apparent masses were slightly different than those of the standards shown in the other figures.) B, effects of serine proteinase inhibitors on proPAP3 activation were determined by immunoblot analysis. For each reaction, 400 ng of the active fraction was incubated with inhibitor for 20 min at room temperature, 70 ng of proPAP3 was added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and the reactions were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using PAP3 antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) N-terminal sequences of the two polypeptides matched residues in the previously identified Manduca serine proteinase, proHP21 (Fig. 3A). The ∼32-kDa band had a strong primary sequence that exactly matched 10 of 11 residues in proHP21. One of the 11 residues (presumably an arginine) could not be identified. The ∼37-kDa band was a mixture, but 9 of the identified residues matched those of proHP21. A cysteine within this region of proHP21 was not detected. The predicted masses of the truncated HP21 polypeptides (29.6 kDa and 34.3 kDa) are close to those estimated by SDS-PAGE (32 and 37 kDa). As expected, the two polypeptides reacted with antiserum against proHP21 (Fig. 3B). Column fractions from some of the purification steps were assayed for the presence of HP21. Each fraction that contained the ∼32-kDa and/or ∼37-kDa form of HP21 had activator of proPAP3 activity; however, some fractions were active but did not contain detectable HP21.4 Taken together, these results suggested that HP21 is an activator of proPAP3 and that at least one other activator is present in hemolymph. A surprising discovery was that the truncated forms of HP21 were cleaved not at the predicted activation site but more N-terminal to it (Fig. 3A). This finding suggested that atypical forms of HP21 (that have been cleaved at sites other than the predicted cleavage site) may have some proteinase activity. In addition, these results might explain the relatively weak DFP labeling and low DFP sensitivity of the active fraction if the atypical forms of HP21 are less than fully active. Data from two other studies strengthen the model of HP21 as a proPAP3 activator. We have recently demonstrated that HP21 forms a stable complex with serpin-4, a serine proteinase inhibitor that does not inhibit PAP3 or other PAPs but does inhibit proPO activat"
https://openalex.org/W1897299346,"An XRCC4-like factor, called XLF or Cernunnos, was recently identified as another important factor in the non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) process. NHEJ is the major pathway for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. The similarity in the putative secondary structures of XLF and XRCC4 as well as the association of XLF with XRCC4·DNA ligase IV in vivo suggested a role in the final ligation step of NHEJ. Here, we find that purified XLF directly interacts with purified XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex and stimulates the ligase complex in a direct assay for ligation activity. Purified XLF has DNA binding activity, but this binding is dependent on DNA length in a manner most consistent with orientation of the C-terminal α helices parallel to the DNA helix. To better understand the function of XLF, we purified an XLF mutant (R57G), which was identified in patients with NHEJ deficiency and severe combined immunodeficiency. Surprisingly, the mutant protein retained its ability to stimulate XRCC4·DNA ligase IV but failed to translocate to the nucleus, and this appears to be the basis for the NHEJ defect in this patient. An XRCC4-like factor, called XLF or Cernunnos, was recently identified as another important factor in the non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) process. NHEJ is the major pathway for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. The similarity in the putative secondary structures of XLF and XRCC4 as well as the association of XLF with XRCC4·DNA ligase IV in vivo suggested a role in the final ligation step of NHEJ. Here, we find that purified XLF directly interacts with purified XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex and stimulates the ligase complex in a direct assay for ligation activity.

Many pathologic double-strand DNA breaks arise when ionizing radiation passes near DNA or when replication forks encounter a nick. Physiologic double-strand breaks are generated in lymphocytes during V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination (1Lieber M.R. Yu K. Raghavan S.C.

Many pathologic double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and physiologic DSBs are repaired by the nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) 3The abbreviations used are: NHEJ, non-homologous DNA end joining; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency; nt, nucleotide(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ab, antibody. pathway. Given this, it is not surprising that individuals born with defects in NHEJ are sensitive to ionizing radiation and have severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (for review, see Ref. 3Schwarz K.

Many factors involved in NHEJ have been identified based on analysis of human and mouse SCID (4Moshous D. Callebaut I. Chasseval R.d. Corneo B. Cavazzana-Calvo M. Diest F.L. Tezcan I. Sanal O.

The proteins involved in NHEJ include Ku70, Ku80, DNA-PKcs, Artemis, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, and most recently, XLF (or Cernunnos) (for review, see Ref. 1Lieber M.R. Yu K. Raghavan S.C. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1234-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)). NHEJ is thought to begin with Ku binding to the two newly created DNA ends at the double-strand break. Ku improves the affinity of a nuclease complex (Artemis·DNA-PKcs), a ligase complex (XRCC4·DNA ligase IV), and POL X polymerases (pol μ and pol λ). XLF (or Cernunnos) is the most recent factor, and it is suspected to be part of the ligase complex (5Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A. Mornon J.P. Revy P. Villartay J.P. d. J. Biol.

We find that XLF does not form a stable complex with DNA ligase IV in the absence of XRCC4 but does interact with the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex. We find that XLF binds to DNA but with unusually long length requirements that are most consistent with a requirement that the C-terminal α helices run parallel to the DNA helix. Finally, XLF stimulates the ligation activity of XRCC4·DNA ligase IV in intramolecular and intermolecular direct ligation assays. Analysis of one point mutant from an XLF mutant SCID patient demonstrates that disruption of nuclear import may be the primary basis of the defect. Oligonucleotide Substrate—The ligation substrate used was generated by annealing 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide YM-216 (95 nt) with YM-194 (18 nt) and YM-219 (22 nt). This generates a substrate that is single-stranded except for the 18 and 22 nt at the ends of the 95-nt oligonucleotide. The single-strand portion consists entirely of Ts (sequences of oligos were described previously (9Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.-L. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol.

The 95-nt single-strand DNA probe used in the supplementary material was YM-218, consisting of mostly Ts with occasional Cs (9Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.-L.

Construction of GST-XLF and XLF-Myc-His-Expressing Plasmids—Full-length human XLF cDNA was amplified by recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, catalog #600154) using a human thymus matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech, catalog #HL4057AH) as the template (primers are available upon request). A GST-XLF-expressing plasmid was constructed by cloning into the pEBG vector after BamHI/NotI digest. An XLF-Myc-His-expressing plasmid was generated by ligating into the pcDNA6/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen, catalog #V221–20) after KpnI/NotI digest. The integrity of the inserts was checked by sequencing. The point mutant XLF (R57G) was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, catalog #200516). Subsequently, the R57G cDNA open reading frame was confirmed by sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmids expressing ligase IV-Myc and XRCC4-HA, pUG19, and pUG23, were described previously (10Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Pure XRCC4·DNA ligase IV protein complex was purified from insect cells as described (9Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B.

GST-XLF- and XLF-Myc-His-expressing plasmids pEBG-huXLF, pcDNA6/huXLF-Myc-His, and pcDNA6/XLF1 (for the expression of R57G mutant) were transfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. For the purification of bead-bound XLF-Myc-His, transfected cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT with protease inhibitors) and cleared by centrifugation. Cleared cell lysate was incubated with anti-Myc antibody (clone 1–9) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C and washed with high salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 700 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) thoroughly. The XLF bound protein G beads were finally washed with storage buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm DTT) and frozen at –80 °C (supplemental Fig. 1). For the purification of soluble XLF-Myc-His, the 293T cells were lysed in Ni-NTA buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and 20 mm imidazole with protease inhibitors. Cleared cell lysate was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and washed with the same buffer. Ni-NTA-agarose-bound proteins were eluted with Ni-NTA buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. XLF-Myc-His-containing fractions were then pooled together, dialyzed against Mono Q buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT), and fractioned by ion-exchange column Mono Q 5/50GL (Amersham Biosciences). XLF-Myc-His eluted at ∼180 mm KCl (supplemental Fig. 2). For the purification of GST-XLF, cells were lysed in glutathione agarose buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors. Cleared cell lysate was incubated with glutathione (GSH)-agarose (Sigma). After washing, proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm GSH). Eluted protein fractions were dialyzed against storage buffer and frozen at –80 °C (supplemental Fig. 3). XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex was purified as described (11NickMcElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In Vitro Immunobead Pulldown Assay—Purified DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 protein complex was incubated with purified bead-bound XLF-Myc-His in the buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 10% glycerol) with 75 mm KCl for 45 min at room temperature. As a control, DNA ligase IV·XRCC4 was incubated with equal amounts of anti-Myc protein G-Sepharose. Then the beads were washed 3 times with buffer A with 150 mm KCl and fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-His antibody (Ab) for DNA ligase IV and anti-XRCC4 Ab for XRCC4. The amount of bound protein was quantified with Quantity One software. Co-immunoprecipitation of XLF with DNA Ligase IV from Transfected 293T Cells—GST-XLF- and DNA ligase IV-Myc-His-expressing plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc Ab and protein G-Sepharose as described in the purification of bead-bound XLF-Myc-His. The beads were then washed four times with the lysis buffer (salt concentration as indicated under “Results”). Cell lysate and bound and unbound (sup) proteins were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot with anti-Myc Ab for DNA ligase IV and anti-GST Ab for XLF. Immunoprecipitation of XRCC4 from XLF-transfected 293T Cells—Wild type or mutant XLF-Myc-His-expressing plasmid was transfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described in the above paragraph. Bead-bound proteins were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot with anti-Myc Ab for XLF and anti-XRCC4 Ab for XRCC4. Immunostaining of XLF-transfected 293T Cells—Wild type or mutant XLF-Myc-His-expressing 293T cells were fixed in 1.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) permeabilized in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A (1× PBS with 0.25% gelatin and 0.01% saponin). Intracellular XLF was revealed by anti-Myc mAb and goat-anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate as green. The nucleus DNA was stained with piperidine iodide as red. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The gel shift assay and the 60-bp DNA probe were described previously (9Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.-L. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The 83-bp DNA probe was generated by annealing 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide HL-62 and HL-110. The 90-bp DNA probe was annealed from HL-111 and HL-112. The 212-bp DNA probe was a purified PCR fragment from plasmid pEF-BOS. In Vitro Double-strand DNA Ligation Assay—The DNA oligonucleotides were gel-purified, and only the long oligonucleotide in each substrate was end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled long oligonucleotide was annealed to the two specified short oligonucleotides in equimolar ratios. 0.5 pmol of the substrate was incubated with XRCC4·DNA ligase IV (in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG), 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)) or T4 DNA ligase (in 66 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, (20 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm ATP, 10% PEG, and 0.05 mg/ml BSA) with or without XLF for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions with preincubation were assembled without substrate on ice, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and chilled on ice for 3 min before the substrate was added to initiate the ligation. The ligation products were then resolved by 5% denaturing PAGE. The gel image was obtained with Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Ligation products were quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Direct Interaction between XLF and XRCC4·DNA Ligase IV—XLF was previously shown to co-precipitate with XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV from crude extracts (5Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A. Mornon J.P. Revy P. Villartay J.P. d. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13857-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear if the association between XLF and XRCC4·DNA ligase IV is direct, as opposed to being mediated by other proteins. XLF-Myc-His was purified from 293T cells bound to anti-Myc protein G-Sepharose (supplemental Fig. 1) and incubated with equal amounts of XRCC4·DNA ligase IV-His complex purified from insect cells (Fig. 1A). After incubation, the beads were washed 3 times in buffer containing 150 mm KCl and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE. XRCC4·DNA ligase IV was detected via Western blot, with anti-His Ab for DNA ligase IV-His and anti-XRCC4 Ab. XRCC4·DNA ligase IV associated with XLF (Fig. 1A), whereas the anti-Myc protein G-Sepharose only showed a low level of nonspecific binding to the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex. Therefore, purified XLF directly interacts with purified XRCC4·DNA ligase IV. Interaction between XLF and XRCC4·DNA Ligase IV Is Largely Mediated by XRCC4—There is significant similarity in the putative secondary structure of XLF and XRCC4 (5Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A.

Like XRCC4, XLF also can form homomultimers (5Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A. Mornon J.P. Revy P. Villartay J.P. d. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13857-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P.

Doherty A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36952-36959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether XLF homodimer can bind DNA ligase IV without XRCC4 (5Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A. Mornon J.P. Revy P. Villartay J.P. d. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13857-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We co-transfected DNA ligase IV-Myc and GST-XLF into 293T cells. Ligase IV was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc protein G-Sepharose using 0.3 m NaCl and 0.5 m KCl for incubation and washing, respectively. Associated proteins were detected by Western blotting. Although the beads pulled down most of the ligase IV from the cell lysate, XLF could not be detected in the bound fraction (Fig. 1B). Low salt conditions (0.15 m NaCl) were also tested, but only ligase IV-independent association of GST-XLF to the immunobeads was observed (supplemental Fig. 4A, left panel). As a control, XRCC4-HA and GST-XLF were co-expressed in 293T cells, and XRCC4 was pulled down by anti-HA immunobeads using 0.15 m NaCl (supplemental Fig. 4A, right panel). Co-precipitation of XLF with XRCC4 suggests that the interaction between XLF and ligase IV, if any, is unstable and much weaker than the XRCC4·XLF interaction. Similar results were obtained using cell lysates from insect cells that overexpress DNA ligase IV, XLF, and XRCC4 (supplemental Fig. 4). Given that the interaction between XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV is extremely strong, XLF is probably recruited to the complex by XRCC4. XLF Stimulates Ligation by XRCC4·DNA Ligase IV—Cell lysates from XLF-deficient cell lines have been shown to be unable to carry out NHEJ in vitro (6Buck D. Malivert L. deChasseval R. Barraud A. Fondaneche M.-C. Xanal O. Plebani A. Stephan J.-L. Hufnagel M. LeDiest F. Fischer A. Durrandy A. Villartay J.-P. d. Revy P.

Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Because XLF interacts with XRCC4·DNA ligase IV directly, it is possible that XLF has an important role in the ligation of double-strand DNA breaks by the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex. XLF-Myc-His was purified using Ni-NTA followed by Mono Q (supplemental Fig. 2). Using the soluble XLF-Myc-His protein, we tested the effect of XLF in the ligation reactions by XRCC4·DNA ligase IV. The DNA substrate consists of a 95-nt oligonucleotide paired with two short oligonucleotides of 22 and 18 nt positioned near the termini (Fig. 2A). Hence, the substrate consists of a molecule that has two duplex DNA ends tethered by a region of single-stranded DNA. The open double-stranded DNA ends have 4-nt 3′ overhangs that are fully compatible. The DNA substrate can self-anneal and be ligated into a circular monomer (intramolecular ligation) or multiple substrate molecules can anneal with each other (at their ends) and be ligated as multimers. After ligation at 37 °C, the products were resolved on 5% denaturing PAGE as a direct readout.FIGURE 2XLF stimulates DNA ligation by DNA ligase IV·XRCC4. A, diagram of the substrate configurations used in the ligation assay. B, soluble XLF increases intermolecular DNA ligation by DNA ligase IV-XRCC4. 100 nm soluble XLF-Myc-His was added to the ligation reactions containing 66 nm DNA ligase IV·XRCC4. The reactions were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min before the addition of substrates. The intermolecular ligation products (dimer and trimer) were quantified relative to the ligation by DNA ligase IV·XRCC4 alone in lane 1. C, XLF does not alter the time course of ligation by DNA ligase IV·XRCC4. The reactions containing 10 nm DNA ligase IV·XRCC4 alone (left panel) or with 25 nm soluble XLF (right panel) were assembled on ice, and the substrates were added last on ice. The first aliquots (ice) were taken out immediately and mixed with reaction stop dye. The remaining portion of each reaction was incubated at 37 °C, and additional aliquots were taken at times indicated under the gel. D, GST-XLF increases intermolecular DNA ligation by DNA ligase IV-XRCC4. For lanes 2 and 3, 30 and 100 nm GST-XLF were added to ligation reactions by 10 nm DNA ligase IV·XRCC4 and preincubated at room temperature for 15 min, and the ligation reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate. 100 nm GST-XLF alone showed no ligation of the substrates. The dimer products were quantified, and GST-XLF stimulated ligation 6.9–11-fold as shown below the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Soluble XLF improved intermolecular ligation, indicated by multimer formation. Using an equimolar amount of DNA ligase IV and DNA, the addition of a 2-fold molar amount of XLF increased the multimer ligation about 4-fold (Fig. 2B), similar to the extent of increase of ligation by XRCC4 observed previously (10Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The increase in intermolecular ligation raised the possibility that XLF may bind DNA and facilitate the synapsis between different DNA molecules. To assess any effect of the affinity tag on the recombinant protein, we purified XLF using the GST tag on the N terminus (supplemental Fig. 3) and tested the GST-XLF protein in the same ligation reactions. Similar to the soluble XLF-Myc-His, GST-XLF increased the dimer ligation 7- and 11-fold at 3- and 10-fold ratios of GST-XLF to XRCC4·DNA ligase IV (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 versus 2 and 3). Bead-bound XLF-Myc-His was also tested in the ligation. Stimulation was observed at a lower concentration of XRCC4·DNA ligase IV, 8 nm, which is ⅙ that of the DNA substrate. Intramolecular ligation was improved 2.3- and 5.2-fold by the addition of 16 and 40 nm XLF, respectively (supplemental Fig. 5A). As a control, anti-Myc protein G-Sepharose was added to the ligation reaction, and this did not alter the ligation activity (supplemental Fig. 5B, lane 1 versus 3), whereas XLF-Myc-His protein G-Sepharose increased the ligation 8-fold (supplemental Fig. 5B, lane 1 versus 2). The level of intermolecular ligation (multimer formation) appeared unaffected by the addition of XLF. Because the XLF protein used here was purified as bead-bound protein, the XLF·XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex formed is also bound to the beads. This may influence productive interaction of this ligation complex with multiple DNA substrates for intermolecular ligation. One possible reason for the increase in ligation could simply be that XLF can stabilize DNA end annealing. To test this possibility we replaced XRCC4·DNA ligase IV with the T4 DNA ligase. At the same concentration of XRCC4·DNA ligase IV, T4 DNA ligase showed higher ligation activity (supplemental Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 4). The addition of XLF did not affect ligation activity (supplemental Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3 versus 4). Even lower concentrations of T4 DNA ligase were used, and XLF still had no effect (data not shown). Therefore, the stimulation of ligation by XLF is specific to the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex. Enhanced Ligation Is Not Due to Stimulated Charging of the DNA Ligase IV—A ligation reaction involves three steps. In the first step the ligase reacts with ATP to form the covalent enzyme-AMP-charged form of the ligase (14Tomkinson A.E. Vijayakumar S. Pascal J.M. Ellenberger T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the second step this charged ligase transfers the AMP to the 5′ phosphate group of the DNA 5′ end to form a phosphoanhydride. This activates the 5′ phosphate of one DNA strand by providing a good potential leaving group (AMP). In the third step the 3′ hydroxyl of the other DNA strand attacks the phosphoanhydride to displace the AMP, thereby forming a 3′,5′-phosphodiester bond. It is possible that the XLF could affect the recharging of the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV and thereby facilitate turnover of the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV. To assess this we examined the time course of the ligation reactions. The reactions were assembled on ice, and the substrate was added last. Then the first aliquots (ice) were immediately taken out and mixed with reaction stop dye. The ligation reactions started rapidly even on ice (Fig. 2C, lane 1 and 4). The remainder of the reaction occurred at 37 °C, and aliquots were taken out at the time points indicated. As expected, soluble XLF improved intermolecular ligation (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6 versus lanes 1–3). The level of ligation reached a plateau at 5 min and remained stable for 1 h (data for 20, 40, and 60 min not shown) despite an ample amount of unligated substrate. The ligase may conduct only one round of ligation. The addition of XLF did not change the time course of the reaction. The apparent reduction in circular monomer formation in the reactions with XLF may be due to depletion of ligase because of multimer ligation. We also tested XLF for any effect on the charging of XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex. Purified (precharged) XRCC4·DNA ligase IV was treated with NaPPi (to strip the AMP from the ligase) and then incubated with [α-32P]ATP. The addition of XLF did not alter the extent of charging of XRCC4·DNA ligase IV (supplemental Fig. 7) or ligase IV alone (data not shown). Given that XLF did not help recovery of the XRCC4·DNA ligase IV during the reaction, possibly XRCC4·DNA ligase IV cannot recharge after one round of ligation even though it is able to recharge after being stripped with NaPPi. Alternatively, it may have recharged but lost its ligation capability. XLF Binding to DNA Is Length-dependent—The enhancement of ligation raised the possibility that XLF may bind DNA. We tested the affinity of XLF for DNA using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The first probe that we used was a 60-bp fragment with 2- and 4-nt overhangs at the ends (Fig. 3A). XLF did not show any binding to this DNA. In other studies, 38- and 50-bp fragments were also not bound by XLF (data not shown). XLF is homologous to XRCC4 (5Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A.

Ghirlando R. Gellert M. Yang W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5962-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and by homology, XLF is presumed to have such an α-helical C-terminal region as well. XRCC4 is known to bind 200 bp but not 100 bp of DNA (17Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We reasoned that XLF might function similarly, and hence, we tested 83-, 90-, and 212-bp fragments (Fig. 3, B and C). We find that XLF binds to all of these lengths of DNA. To compare equivalent amounts of XLF per unit length of DNA, we also calculate the ratio of XLF to DNA in terms of molecules of XLF/10 bp of DNA. At 0.5 molecules of XLF/10 bp of DNA, XLF binds to all of the longer fragments. However, at this same concentration and even higher concentrations, XLF does not bind to the 60-bp DNA. Hence, like XRCC4, the binding of XLF is length-dependent. The shorter α-helical C-terminal region of XLF (relative to XRCC4) means that the minimum size for binding is smaller (83 bp for XLF versus more than 100 bp for XRCC4) (Fig. 3 and Ref. 17Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An XLF Mutant (R57G) Is Still Active for Ligation Stimulation but Fails to Translocate from the Cytoplasm to the Nucleus—Various mutations in the XLF gene have been shown to cause NHEJ defects and SCID in patients. One recently described patient is homozygous for a single point mutation, R57G (6Buck D. Malivert L. deChasseval R. Barraud A. Fondaneche M.-C. Xanal O. Plebani A. Stephan J.-L. Hufnagel M. LeDiest F. Fischer A. Durrandy A. Villartay J.-P. d. Revy P. Cell. 2006; 124: 287-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To better understand the structure and function of XLF, we purified the mutant XLF R57G-Myc-His in a form where it is bound to the anti-Myc protein G-Sepharose. We tested the bound XLF (R57G) for an effect on XRCC4·DNA ligase IV ligation activity. Surprisingly, the purified mutant protein showed even greater stimulation of the ligase activity in vitro than the wild type XLF (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 4). The patient with the R57G mutation in the XLF protein had an NHEJ defect. The discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro activity of mutant XLF led us to test the ability of XLF to interact with XRCC4·DNA ligase IV in vivo. The mutant XLF-Myc was expressed in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc protein G-Sepharose, and Western-blotted with anti-XRCC4 antibody to detect the endogenous XRCC4. The interaction between mutant XLF (R57G) and XRCC4 was much weaker than the wild type (WT) XLF, although the level of expression was very similar (Fig. 4B). We also examined the intracellular localization of the mutant XLF using immunostaining. Wild type XLF was shown to localize to the nucleus like XRCC4·DNA ligase IV, and overexpression of the wild type XLF did not alter its nuclear localization (Fig. 4C, upper panels). In striking contrast, the mutant XLF localized to the perinuclear regions of the cytoplasm as very bright densities (possibly aggregates) and was only present at a very low level in the nucleus (Fig. 4C, lower panels). The cytoplasmic location of the XLF (R57G) explains why it fails to interact with the nuclear XRCC4·DNA ligase IV and, hence, fails to stimulate ligation. In the predicted secondary structure of XLF, Arg-57 is in the N-terminal globular head domain, whereas the putative nuclear localization signal is located in the C-terminal α-helical tail. The amino acid sequence around Arg-57 does not resemble a typical nuclear localization signal. Therefore, the R57G mutation is more likely to alter XLF conformation and thereby affect nuclear import. Several aspects of XLF function have been elucidated by these studies. First, XLF improves the intermolecular ligation activity of XRCC4·DNA ligase IV by between 8- and 11-fold in direct assays of ligation. The bead-bound XLF stimulated intramolecular, but not intermolecular ligation, whereas the soluble XLF stimulated both but primarily intermolecular ligation. Among the possible explanations of this, the antibody binding to the XLF may suppress the XLF·XRCC4·DNA ligase IV complex from colliding with second DNA end. This may then favor an intramolecular ligation event. In contrast, the unconstrained soluble XLF may more freely bind two ends. Second, a point mutant (R57G) form of XLF that results in SCID in humans retains its stimulatory effect on XRCC4·DNA ligase IV. However, this point mutation, which is almost certainly located in the presumed globular head domain of XLF, causes accumulation of XLF in the perinuclear cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus where XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV are located. The SCID defect corresponding to R57G may relate to its aberrant accumulation in the cytosol as an apparent aggregate. The bead-bound XLF point mutant interacted less well with endogenous XRCC4 in crude extracts (Fig. 4B), but the purified mutant XLF stimulated XRCC4·ligase IV ligation activity extremely well. This may relate to the efficiency of the mutant XLF to reconfigure appropriately with the XRCC4·ligase IV complexes or with XRCC4 homodimers. Such reconfiguration on DNA ligation substrates (in the activity assays) may differ from reconfiguration without exogenous DNA (in the pulldown assays). Third, XLF binds to DNA. The small size of XLF (33 kDa) means that 60 bp should be severalfold more than adequate to bind XLF if the binding occurred simply at the globular head domain region (16Junop M.S. Modesti M. Guarne A. Ghirlando R. Gellert M. Yang W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5962-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The fact that 38, 50, and 60 bp are insufficient but that 83, 90, 212 bp are sufficient for XLF binding to DNA means that there is a minimum length requirement somewhere between 60 and 83 bp. As mentioned earlier, this is reminiscent of the requirement of >100 bp of DNA for the binding of the somewhat larger protein, XRCC4, which has a longer α-helical C-terminal region (17Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This suggests that the α-helical C-terminal region of XLF and XRCC4, which both includes many basic amino acids, aligns parallel to the DNA helix. Otherwise, the minimum DNA length might be expected to be <15 bp if the globular head domain alone were sufficient for DNA binding. An orientation with the C-terminal helices parallel to the DNA lends itself to many interesting hypotheses regarding the role of XLF and XRCC4. It is known that DNA ligase IV is able to ligate blunt and sticky end configurations without XRCC4 and XLF, but that XRCC4 improves the efficiency of this ligation (10Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Perhaps XRCC4 and XLF improve the association of the ligase with DNA ends in vivo but in a less essential way in vitro. Previous work raises the possibility of a trimeric interaction of XLF, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV (5Callebaut I. Malivert L. Fischer A. Mornon J.P. Revy P. Villartay J.P. d. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13857-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Ahnesorg P. Smith P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Earlier biochemical work on DNA ligase IV suggests that it exists within human cells predominantly in association with smaller molecular mass proteins and that the total molecular mass of the complex is ∼175 kDa in 1 m NaCl (18Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This is consistent with (XRCC4)2·ligase IV or XLF·XRCC4·ligase IV configurations. Admittedly, the XLF association with XRCC4·DNA ligase IV may be less stable and less abundant. Hence, XLF may not be present in the predominant species of ligase IV within such analyses. Our findings that XLF association with XRCC4·ligase IV is sensitive to 650 mm KCl also raises this possibility (data not shown). Our activity stimulation studies are done under physiologic salt conditions. The stimulation of XRCC4·ligase IV by XLF occurs even when XLF is bound to beads. However, this stimulation by immobilized XLF requires a preincubation between the XLF and the XRCC4·ligase IV (the DNA was not present). This suggests a reconfiguration between the immobilized XLF and the XRCC4·ligase IV. The pulldown of XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV by XLF under physiological conditions suggests that both XRCC4 and ligase IV are present in complexes with the XLF (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the XLF is immobilized at its C terminus. Hence, the C terminus mobility cannot be critical for this association with XRCC4·ligase IV and cannot be important for the XLF stimulation of XRCC4·ligase IV activity. Within a putative complex containing all three proteins, the interactions between XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV and between XLF and XRCC4 appear to be the stronger ones based on the studies here (supplemental Fig. 9). The strength of the XRCC4 interaction with DNA ligase IV may determine the relative ratio of the (XRCC4)2·DNA ligase IV species to a putative XLF·XRCC4·DNA ligase IV species or a higher order species containing the three proteins. The weak interaction of XLF with DNA ligase IV raises questions of the stability of complexes containing only DNA ligase IV and XLF. In the final stages of preparing this manuscript, another group reported that XLF can stimulate ligation and can bind DNA (13Hentges P. Ahnesorg P. Pritcher R.S. Bruce C.K. Kysela B. Green A.J.

Dev. 2004; 121: 417-426PubMed Google Scholar), and (f) that Na/K-ATPase also regulates the formation and function of trophectoderm tight junctions (17Violette M.I. Madan P. Watson A.J. Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 406-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the Na/K-ATPase contributes directly to the mechanism that regulates fluid movement across the trophectoderm resulting in the formation of the fluid-filled blastocoelic cavity. Our most recent efforts have initiated studies to investigate the individual roles of each Na/K-ATPase subunit during preimplantation development (16Barcroft L.C. Moseley A.E. Lingrel J.B. Watson A.J. Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 417-426PubMed Google Scholar) and to explore whether the Na+ pump also regulates tight junction formation and function during blastocyst formation (17Violette M.I. Madan P. Watson A.J. Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 406-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Much to our initial surprise we discovered that it was possible to collect quite normal-looking day 3.5 post-human chorionic gonadotropin-injected Na/K-ATPase α1 null blastocysts from the reproductive tracts of heterozygous mice (16Barcroft L.C. Moseley A.E. Lingrel J.B. Watson A.J. Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 417-426PubMed Google Scholar). However, these α1 null embryos struggle to attach and form trophoblast outgrowths in culture and do not form fully expanded blastocysts if collected and placed into culture at the eight-cell stage for determination of their developmental potential (16Barcroft L.C. Moseley A.E. Lingrel J.B. Watson A.J. Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 417-426PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have concluded that the α1 subunit of the Na/K-ATPase is required for normal development and initiation of pregnancy and that limited compensation perhaps by an alternative Na/K-ATPase α subunit isoform is able to allow for short term development of α1 null embryos to the blastocyst stage in vivo. In the continuation of our pursuit of an understanding of the roles of each Na/K-ATPase subunit during preimplantation development, we have conducted the present study to characterize the consequences to early development and blastocyst and tight junction formation after the selective down-regulation of the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit by employing microinjection of 1 cell mouse zygotes with small interfering RNA (siRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; KSOM, potassium simplex optimized medium; KSOMaa, KSOM amino acids; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. oligos. Our results demonstrate that the β1 subunit of the Na/K-ATPase is required for blastocyst formation and that this subunit is required to maintain a normal Na/K-ATPase distribution and localization of tight junction-associated polypeptides during preimplantation development. Super-ovulation and Embryo Collection—Female CD-1 mice (Charles River, Saint-Constant, Quebec, Canada) 4-5 weeks of age were injected with 10 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (Intervet, Whitby, Canada) followed by 10 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Intervet) 48 h later and just before mating with CD-1 males. Successful mating was determined the next morning by the presence of a vaginal plug and was considered day 0.5 of development. One-cell stage embryos were flushed from oviducts of female mice using flushing medium I (1.71 mm calcium lactate, 0.25 mm sodium pyruvate, 3 mg/ml human chorionic gonadotropin, and 10× Leibovitz-modified Hanks' balanced salt solution, all diluted with water to 1×) (45Spindle A. In Vitro. 1980; 16: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) containing hyaluronidase (1 mg/ml, Sigma). The embryos were washed 3× in potassium simplex optimized medium (KSOM) media (46Summers M.C. Bhatnagar P.R. Lawitts J.A. Biggers J.D. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) under paraffin oil in sterile culture dishes and subsequently cultured in KSOM medium plus amino acids (KSOMaa) (46Summers M.C. Bhatnagar P.R. Lawitts J.A. Biggers J.D. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) under a 5% CO2 in air atmosphere at 37 °C until transferred into experimental treatment groups as defined below. All medium components were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. KSOMaa medium was made fresh before each collection and was sterile-filtered. The osmolarity of the medium was tested each time it was prepared and ranged between 288-298 milliosmolal. All experiments described in this study maintained a treatment drop volume-to-embryo ratio of 1 embryo/μl of KSOMaa culture medium. Animal care and handling was according to the guidelines of the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee. Microinjection of siRNAs—Microinjection was performed under an inverted microscope using a mechanical micromanipulator (Leica) attached to Picoinjector PLI-100 (Harvard Apparatus, Saint-Laurent, Quebec, CA). Each injection delivered 10 pl of 20 μm siRNA duplexes into the cytoplasm of 1-cell-stage embryos. Microinjection of embryos was performed according to a standard procedure. One-cell embryos were placed in KSOMaa medium under light mineral oil. A holding pipette (Conception Technologies, San Diego, CA) was used to keep the one-cell embryos stationary during manipulation. An injection pipette (Conception Technologies) loaded with double-stranded (ds)R NA solution was inserted into the cytoplasm of each zygote followed by the microinjection of ∼10 pl of dsRNA. After microinjection, embryos were cultured in KSOMaa medium as described above for up to 4 days to allow for an assessment of developmental capacity to the blastocyst stage. About 300 embryos were used for each experimental replicate, and in total a set of three replicates were conducted. RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription (RT), and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from murine embryos (pools of 20 embryos/stage at 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages) using the phenol chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63171) Google Scholar). The total RNA extracts were digested with deoxyribo-nuclease-1 to eliminate possible contamination from genomic DNA. The RT reactions were conducted using oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) as previously described (19Barcroft L.C. Hay-Schmidt A. Caveney A. Gilfoyle E. Overstrom E.W.

Briefly, samples were incubated for 90 min at 42 °C in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) followed by heating the samples to 95 °C for 5 min for termination of reaction. PCR was conducted using a previously described protocol (21Madan P. Calder M.D. Watson A.J. Reproduction. 2005; 130: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, two embryo equivalents for each stage of development under investigation were used per PCR reaction, which was repeated a minimum of three times from pools of three different developmental series of embryos. The conditions for each PCR reaction are given in Table 1. PCR products were resolved on 2.0% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide (Invitrogen). To confirm the specificity of each PCR product, representative amplicons were extracted from the gels and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) and submitted for nucleotide sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada). The nucleotide sequence was subsequently compared with sequences available in GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data base, and in all cases the specificity of each PCR product was confirmed. There was 98% sequence identity to mouse Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit sequence.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequences for polymerase chain reaction amplification reactionsGene productPrimerPrimer sequenceSizebpNa/K-ATPase β1 subunit (5Betts D.H.

Immunofluorescence was detected using laser scanning confocal microscopy as described (19Barcroft L.C. Hay-Schmidt A. Caveney A. Gilfoyle E. Overstrom E.W. Hyttel P. Watson A.J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 114: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos at timed stages of development (1-cell zygotes, 2-, 4-, and 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages) were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. These fixed embryos were washed in 1× PBS and either processed immediately for immuno-staining or stored at 4 °C in PBS for a maximum of 4 weeks. For immunostaining, fixed embryos were permeabilized and blocked in 1× PBS + 5% donkey serum + 0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Embryos were washed in 1× PBS and incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:100 in 1× PBS +1% donkey serum + 0.005% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature followed by additional washes totaling 1 h at 37 °C. Primary antibodies were labeled by incubation for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) diluted 1:200. Embryos were then treated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (5 μg/ml; 1:20) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 mg/ml; 1:2000) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 2 washes for 2 h each at 37 °C. Embryos were mounted in Fluoro-Guard Antifade Mounting Reagent (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Fluorescence patterns were examined using a Zeiss LSM 410 (laser scanning microscope) with an inverted Axiovert 100 microscope under 20-40× magnification. The images were then captured and stored as TIFF files by the Zeiss LSM software package. Primary antibodies for Na/K-ATPase α and β subunits and Z0-1 were obtained from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA. Primary antibody for occludin was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA. siRNA Oligo Preparation—Double-stranded siRNA oligos were designed using BLOCK-iT™ RNAi Designer software (Invitrogen). Stealth siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides against the β1 subunit of Na/K-ATPase (GenBank™ accession number NM_009721) were synthesized by Invitrogen. The sequences were as follows: (i) sense 5′-CCC AAG AAU GAA UCC UUG GAG ACU U-3′, antisense 5′-AAG UCU CCA AGG AUU CAU UCU UGG G-3′; (ii) control sense 5′-CCC AAG AGU CUA UUC AGG AGA ACU U-3′, antisense 5′-AAG UUC UCC UGA AUA GAC UCU UGG G-3′. The duplex oligoribonucleotides were re-suspended in diethyl pyro-carbonate-treated water to make a 20 μm solution and stored at -20 °C until further use. Reversal of Developmental Blockade by Aggregation Chimeras—Embryos from the three treatment groups (β1 subunit siRNA-microinjected, random sequence siRNA-injected control, and non-injected control) were collected at the non-compacted eight-cell stage. These embryos were treated with acid Tyrode solution (pH 2.5) to remove zona pellucida. Denuded eight-cell embryos were washed three times in fresh KSOMaa drops and aggregated together for chimera production. The β1 subunit siRNA-microinjected embryos were either paired with self-like (A:A) or with uninjected controls (A:C) or random sequence siRNA-injected controls (A:B). In addition, injected controls were also paired together (B:B) to serve as an additional control. In total, 76 chimeras were produced from 152 embryos over 3 replicates. Development of each aggregation chimera combination to the blastocyst stage was assessed. In addition, chimeras from each group were processed for immunofluorescence localization of Na/K-ATPase β subunit polypeptides as described. Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Statistical differences between time points were assessed by analysis of variance. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Significant differences between the means were determined using the least significant difference test. To investigate the consequences of Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit down-regulation on preimplantation development, we employed microinjection of β1 siRNAs into one-cell zygotes. Our control groups consisted of non-injected zygotes and those injected with a random sequence siRNA. In total, more than 300 zygotes were placed into each treatment group for evaluation of developmental outcomes. The experiment was repeated three times using zygotes collected from different mouse populations each time. The morphology of zygotes in each group 4 days after injection is displayed in Fig. 1A. Zygotes injected with the Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNA developed through to the morula stage (Fig. 1, Aa and B). In contrast, zygotes injected with control siRNA or non-injected controls displayed a high frequency of development through to the blastocyst stage after injection (Fig. 1, A, b and c). In both injected groups we observed a nearly equal number of zygotes that did not develop, likely due to damage caused by the microinjection procedure (Fig. 1, Aa and b). When the data were plotted and analyzed, we clearly observed that injection with the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit siRNA resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of zygotes that completed development to the blastocyst stage (Fig. 1B). Control-injected and control non-injected zygotes displayed a comparable blastocyst developmental frequency (Fig. 1B). The majority of β1 siRNA-injected zygotes attained and then remained at the morula stage 4 days after injection (Fig. 1B). Attempts to provide morulae in the Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNA treatment with additional time to progress beyond the morula stage by extending their culture interval for an additional 24 h did not increase the development of embryos in this group to the blastocyst stage (data not shown). To ensure that the Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNAs we employed were effective at down-regulating Na/K-ATPase β1 gene expression during early development, we applied RT-PCR methods to detect Na/K-ATPase β1 mRNAs and also whole mount immunofluorescence methods to map out Na/K-ATPase β1 protein distribution. It was readily possible to detect transcripts encoding the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit in control-injected and non-injected control groups as indicated by the appearance of an expected size RT-PCR product in samples from both groups (Fig. 1C). In contrast it was not possible to detect the Na/K-ATPase β1 RT-PCR product in samples prepared from Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNA-injected zygotes (Fig. 1C). To ensure that Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNA prepared samples still retained intact RNA, we employed RT-PCR to amplify transcripts encoding β-actin. In all samples from all treatment groups it was readily possible to detect the expected size β-actin cDNA product. The application of whole-mount immunofluorescence methods employing a Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit-specific antiserum revealed a complete absence of detectable Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit protein in β1 siRNA-injected zygotes (Fig. 2, a-c). In contrast, the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit was detected in both control-injected and non-injected controls beginning at the 8-16-cell stage and also in both morulae and blastocyst stages as reported earlier (Fig. 2, e-h; Ref. 7MacPhee D.J. Jones D.H. Barr K.J. Betts D.H. Watson A.J. Kidder G.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In control blastocysts the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit immunofluorescence maintained the expected polarized distribution in the trophectoderm and an apolar distribution in the inner cell mass (Fig. 2h). When we examined the few blastocysts that formed in the Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNA-injected treatment group, no organized Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit protein distribution could be detected (Fig. 2d); instead, a few small indistinct patches of green fluorescence were observed in these embryos (Fig. 2d). In total, these outcomes demonstrate that the Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNA we employed in this study effectively down-regulated Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit expression for at least 5 days during mouse preimplantation development. We investigated the reversibility of the developmental blockade displayed by β1 subunit siRNA-microinjected embryos by aggregating together eight-cell embryos from all three treatment groups to measure chimera formation and progression to the blastocyst stage. The β1 subunit siRNA-microinjected embryos (Fig. 3A, A:A) did not progress to the blastocyst stage. In contrast, β1 subunit siRNA-microinjected embryos, which were paired with either random sequence siRNA-microinjected (A:B), uninjected controls (A:C), or even injected controls paired together (B:B) all displayed a normal progression to the blastocyst stage (Fig. 3B). In addition localization of Na/K-ATPase β subunit polypeptides in these chimeras by the application of immunofluorescence methods confirmed the complete absence of β subunit immunofluorescence in A:A (β subunit siRNA-injected) pairs (Fig. 4a), normal β subunit immunofluorescence in B:B pairs (Fig. 4e), and reduced but obvious β subunit immunofluorescence in A:B pairs (Fig. 4i). We would conclude that development of the A:B and A:C chimeras to the blastocyst stage (Fig. 3) was achieved by expression of Na/K-ATPase β subunits by cells derived from the B or C embryo. This experiment, therefore, supports our initial conclusion that Na/K-ATPase β subunit expression is required for progression to the blastocyst stage.FIGURE 4Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit protein levels after chimera production. The distribution of Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit polypeptides was assessed between chimeric embryos produced by pairing either β1 subunit deficient eight-cell embryos together (A:A) or to siRNA random sequence-injected controls (A:B) or pairing random sequence siRNA-injected controls together (B:B). Green, red, and blue colors in each representative photomicrograph indicate positive staining for the respective primary antibody (panels a, e, and i), F-actin (rhodamine phalloidin) (b, f, and j), and nuclei (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (c, g, and k), respectively. Panels d, h, and l show a composite image of all three channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These studies clearly indicated that down-regulation of Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit expression resulted in a blockade of blastocyst formation. To begin to define the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit role in mediating blastocyst formation, we investigated the effects of β1 subunit down-regulation on the distribution of Na/K-ATPase α1 polypeptides and tight junction-associated polypeptides, occludin and ZO-1, since these polypeptides are among the best characterized markers of trophectoderm differentiation and blastocyst formation. We confined our analysis to morula stage embryos since it was not possible to generate blastocysts after microinjection of Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit siRNAs. In control-injected and also control non-injected morulae we observed normal patterns of Na/K-ATPase α and ZO-1 and occludin protein distribution (Fig. 5, b, d, and f). For Na/K-ATPase α1 protein, the fluorescence extended in an apolar fashion surrounding each morula blastomere (Fig. 5b). Like-wise both ZO-1 and occludin fluorescence maintained a tight cortical pattern surrounding the apical regions of each blastomere (Fig. 5, d and f). In complete contrast, Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNA-injected morulae displayed a very aberrant Na/K-ATPase α1 fluorescence pattern in which the fluorescence became “discontinuous” around each cell periphery, consisting more of a general cytoplasmic distribution rather than a cortical distribution (Fig. 5a). The impact on ZO-1 and occludin protein distribution was even more dramatic, and the fluorescence pattern for both of these tight junction-associated proteins became very diffuse and cytoplasmic in nature (Fig. 5, c and e). Injection of Na/K-ATPase β1 siRNAs resulted in a complete loss of the tight “continuous” cortical distribution that is so typical for both ZO-1 and occludin protein distributions in developing epithelia such as the trophectoderm. Our results demonstrate that the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit protein is required for blastocyst formation. In addition, our results indicate that the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit oversees the proper localization of Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit to the cortical membrane regions of each blastomere and also the proper distribution and assembly of tight junction-associated polypeptides (ZO-1 and occludin) to the apical membrane regions between differentiating trophectoderm cells. Interestingly, our results do not, however, indicate that the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit is required to support early development to the morula (16-32 cells) stage of mouse development. We conclude that the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit is instrumental in coordinating the proper insertion of Na/K-ATPase α/β subunits to appropriate membrane domains and also the formation and establishment of trophectoderm tight junctions. Thus, the Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit is an important mediator of cell polarity, trophectoderm differentiation, and blastocyst formation during mouse preimplantation development. The Na/K-ATPase β subunit has been generally prescribed to serve two primary roles including 1) a chaperone role that directs the insertion of the α subunit and functional enzyme unit to the appropriate membrane domain (22Geering K.

We explored activation by exposure to tobacco smoke of two genes, beta-catenin and COX-2, that play key roles in inflammation and vascular remodeling events. Using both in vivo and in vitro smoke exposure, we determined that tobacco smoke (TS) induced nuclear beta-catenin accumulation and COX-2 expression and activity and moreover interacted with IL-1beta to enhance these effects. Exposure of cardiac endothelial cells to tobacco smoke plus IL-1beta (TS/IL-1beta) enhanced permeability of endothelial monolayers and disrupted membrane VE-cadherin/beta-catenin complexes, decreased beta-catenin phosphorylation, and increased phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, Akt, and EGFR. Transfection of endothelial cells with beta-catenin-directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed TS/IL-1beta-mediated effects on COX-2 modulation. Inhibitors of EGFR and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase also abolished both the TS/IL-1beta-mediated modulation of the Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway and enhancement of COX-2 expression. Moreover, increased levels of Akt and GSK-3beta phosphorylation, nuclear beta-catenin accumulation, COX-2 expression, and IL-1beta were observed in cardiovascular tissue of ApoE-/- mice exposed to cigarette smoke daily for 2 wk. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which cigarette smoking can induce proinflammatory and proatherosclerotic effects in vascular tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1991646855,"Mammalian DNA polymerase (Pol) δ is essential for DNA replication. It consists of four subunits, p125, p50, p68, and p12. We report the discovery that the p12 subunit is rapidly degraded in cultured human cells by DNA damage or replication stress brought about by treatments with UV, methyl methanesulfonate, hydroxyurea, and aphidicolin. The degradation of p12 is due to an accelerated rate of proteolysis that is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin. UV treatment converts Pol δ in vivo to the three-subunit form lacking p12. This was demonstrated by its isolation using immunoaffinity chromatography. The three-subunit enzyme retains activity on poly(dA)/oligo(dT) templates but is impaired in its ability to extend singly primed M13 templates, clearly indicating that its in vivo functions are likely to be compromised. This transformation of Pol δ by modification of its quaternary structure is reversible in vitro by the addition of the p12 subunit and could represent a novel in vivo mechanism for the modulation of Pol δ function. UV and hydroxyurea-triggered p12 degradation is blocked in ATR–/– cells but not in ATM–/– cells, thereby demonstrating that p12 degradation is regulated by ATR, the apical kinase that regulates the damage response in S-phase.

The current model for DNA synthesis at the replication fork is that Pol α/primase synthesizes RNA primers plus short stretches of DNA. These are then elongated to Okazaki fragments of ∼200 nucleotides by Pol δ on the lagging strand of the replication fork (1Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2827-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Garg P. Burgers P.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Leading strand synthesis requires highly processive synthesis and was originally thought to require Pol δ, since the latter was able to perform the replication of the SV40 genome in an in vitro system (10Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).

However, it is the C-terminal checkpoint domain and not the N-terminal catalytic domain that is essential (i.e. Pol ϵ activity per se is dispensable, and it has been suggested that Pol δ activity may be able to replace Pol ϵ activity) (11Feng W.

In mammalian cells, it has been found that although Pol δ alone can replicate SV40 DNA replication, both Pol δ and Pol ϵ are involved in cellular DNA replication (13Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y.

Localization and cross-linking studies suggest that Pol δ and Pol ϵ may function independently of each other and that their involvement in chromosomal replication might be temporally different during S-phase progression (14Fuss J.

Their respective roles in leading and lagging strand synthesis are still uncertain, although it has been proposed that Pol δ and Pol ϵ function specifically at the lagging and leading strands of the replication fork, respectively (2Garg P. Burgers P.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).

In this study, we show that DNA damage triggers the rapid degradation of p12, with the concomitant in vivo conversion of Pol δ to a trimer with altered properties. This observation is of significance, since this may impact the cellular functioning of Pol δ. In addition, we show that p12 depletion by UV and hydroxyurea (HU) are dependent on the ATR kinase that regulates the DNA damage response in the S-phase but not on ATM.

The stalling of replication forks by these treatments leads to the generation of aberrant DNA structures containing single-stranded DNA arising from replication fork collapse, inappropriate homologous recombination (26Andreassen R.R. Ho G.P. D'Andrea A.D. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), or the uncoupling of the replication helicase from Pol α (27Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 119: 1040-1052Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). ATR/Chk1 is then activated by its recruitment to RPA-single-stranded DNA, leading to the down-regulation of the Cdc25 phosphatases and the cyclin E/A-cyclin-dependent kinases, so that the entry from G1 to S-phase is inhibited (21Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 22Zou L. Elledge S.J.

ATR/Chk1 also slows S-phase progression by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, largely by inhibition of the initiation of replication origins via Cdc45, which is required for loading of replication polymerases to the prereplication complex (1Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2827-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Machida Y.J. Hamlin J.L. Dutta A. Cell. 2005; 123: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Our findings that p12 is down-regulated by DNA damage with the concomitant conversion of Pol δ to a trimeric form and that this is under the control of the ATR signaling pathway support the view that the degradation of p12 is a novel cellular response to DNA damage. Cell Culture—HeLa, HEK293T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human lung carcinoma H1299 and A549 cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; GM00637 cells (ATM+/+) and GM09607 (ATM–/–) cells were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository and grown in EEMEM (minimum essential medium (Eagle) in Earle balanced salt solution with a 2× concentration of essential and nonessential amino acids and vitamins with 2 mml-glutamine) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; HCT116 and ATRflox/– cells (ATCC) were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. One of the ATR alleles in the ATRflox/– cell line is disrupted so that the ATRflox/– cell line is ATR+/–. The second allele of ATR has had one of its exons placed between two lox sites and can be disrupted by infection with adenovirus expressing the CRE recombinase to generate the ATR–/– phenotype (21Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in growth medium containing 50 multiplicities of infection of Cre-expressing adenovirus (Ad-CMV-Cre; Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA) for 48 h and then treated with UV. H38-5 and ts20TGR mouse cells derived from BALB/c 3T3 A31 were obtained from Dr. Harvey Ozer; ts20TGR has a temperature-sensitive E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and H38-5 is the corrected cell line (29Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 35 °C and shifted to the restrictive temperature of 39 °C for 16–20 h before treatment with UV. Genotoxic and Inhibitor Treatments—Asynchronous cell cultures were grown to ∼80% confluence. For UV treatment, the culture medium was removed from the cells and irradiated using a UVLMS-38EL series 3 UV lamp (UV-C, 254 nm). Calibration of the UV source was performed with a UV radiometer (UVP, Inc.). Fresh medium was added after treatment, and the dishes were returned to the incubator. Cells were analyzed at different time periods after UV treatment. HU (0.5 m) was added directly to the culture medium to give final concentrations of 2–8 mm, and the cells were analyzed at different time periods of incubation. Aphidicolin (Sigma) was dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO and added to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 120 nm. MMS, dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO (Sigma), was added to the culture medium, and cells were exposed for the stated time periods, following which the cells were transferred to fresh medium and analyzed at different times after treatment. Caffeine (Sigma), MG132, lactacystin (Calbiochem), and UCN-01 (kindly provided by Sally Hausman, NCI, National Institutes of Health) were dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO and added to the culture medium 30 min before genotoxic treatments. Antibodies—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against His-p12 was generated. This antibody was affinity-purified using immobilized p12 and was used for all of the studies reported unless otherwise stated. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against a p12 peptide (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y. Rahmeh A. Trusa S. Zhang S. Gao Y. Lee E.Y.C. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14748-14755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was also tested and gave similar results to the polyclonal antibody in that p12 depletion was observed after UV treatment. The latter finding makes it unlikely that the loss of p12 observed by Western blotting is an artifact due to a masking of a p12 epitope. Antibodies against the p125, p50, and p68 subunits of Pol δ were obtained as previously described (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y. Rahmeh A. Trusa S. Zhang S. Gao Y. Lee E.Y.C. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

(Santa Cruz, CA), and Chk1-pS345 antibody was obtained from Cell Signal Technology, Inc. Antibody against β-actin was obtained from Sigma. Western Blotting—Cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm) for 5 min and lysed by the addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The suspended cells were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Control experiments confirmed that all of the Pol δ subunits were released into the supernatant. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, following which the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Protein loading was maintained at 60 μg/lane. Western blotting was performed with antibodies against p12, p125, p50, and p68 as previously described (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y. Rahmeh A. Trusa S. Zhang S. Gao Y. Lee E.Y.C. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

Cells from 80 plates (2 × 108 cells) were used. Half of the plates were treated with UVC (20 J/m2) and harvested 4 h later; the other half was harvested with no treatment. The pelleted cells were lysed in 20 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) and disrupted by passage through a French press. The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was diluted to 40 ml with lysis buffer. The protein content was determined, and equal amounts of total protein were used for the following chromatography. Two columns of identical size, each containing 5 ml of anti-p125-agarose beads (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y. Rahmeh A. Trusa S. Zhang S. Gao Y. Lee E.Y.C. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

The columns were run at the same time under the same conditions. The columns were washed with 10 column volumes of 0.1 m NaCl in TGEE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) and then eluted with 30% ethylene glycol, 0.4 m NaCl in TGEE buffer. Fractions of 0.3 ml each were collected. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C. Assays of the column fractions for Pol δ activity as well as other analyses were performed in parallel with minimum delay. Western blots of any given protein from the two columns were developed in the same solutions and visualized on the same x-ray film to provide comparable staining. Recombinant Pol δ and the trimer lacking p12 were produced by expression in Sf9 cells and were purified to near homogeneity by methods previously described (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y. Rahmeh A. Trusa S.

Assay for Pol δ Activity—The standard assay for Pol δ activity was performed using poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as described previously (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y. Rahmeh A. Trusa S. Zhang S. Gao Y. Lee E.Y.C.

Standard reactions for the poly(dA)/oligo(dT) assay contained 0.25 OD units/ml poly(dA)4000/oligo(dT)50 (Supertechs, Bethesda, MD), 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 100 cpm/ pmol [3H]TTP, and ∼0.2 units of Pol δ in the absence or presence of 100 ng of PCNA in a total volume of 30 μl. One unit of Pol δ activity catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP/h at 37 °C. Assays using singly primed M13 DNA as the template were performed as previously described (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y.

M13mp18 DNA (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was primed with a 20-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA-CC-3′) complementary to nucleotides 6262–6243. The standard reaction contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 50 mm NaCl, 250 μm each of dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 25 μm dATP, 3 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, 100 ng of primed M13 template, 80 ng of RFC, 200 ng of RPA, and variable amounts of PCNA in a 30-μl reaction volume. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and were terminated by the addition of 20 mm EDTA. The reaction products were run on 1.5% alkaline agarose gels at 50 V for 2.5 h. The gels were visualized with a PhosphorImager. Reconstitution of Pol δ from Pol δ3-p12 with Recombinant p12—Pol δ3-p12 was preincubated with recombinant p12 or His-tagged p12 at a final concentration of 3.3 or 6.6 μg/ml at 4 °C for 1 h before assay for Pol δ activity. Recombinant p12 was expressed as glutathione S-transferase-tagged p12 in the pGEX5X-3 vector (GE Healthcare), and purified on glutathione-Sepharose. p12 was then released by proteolysis with factor Xa, and the glutathione S-transferase was removed with glutathione-Sepharose. His-tagged p12 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads as previously described (18Li H. Xie B. Zhou Y. Rahmeh A. Trusa S. Zhang S. Gao Y.

In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—The human p12 coding region was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/HisMaxC (Invitrogen) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites; the resultant plasmid expressed N-terminal His-tagged p12. The human ubiquitin coding region with a FLAG tag at the N terminus was cloned as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment into pcDNA3 (Amersham Biosciences). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with His-p12 together with FLAG-tagged ubiquitin using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, treatment with MG132 was carried out at a final concentration of 10 μm for 2 h prior to treatment with UVC (10 J/m2), followed by further incubation for 1 h before harvesting. Transfected cells in a 10-cm dish were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested directly into 1 ml of lysis buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaHPO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and sonicated. Protein concentration was measured with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). One mg of total protein extract was incubated with 80 μl of a 50% slurry of nickel-agarose beads (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads; Qiagen) for 1.5 h in a rotator at 4 °C. The beads were washed 10 times, twice with 1 ml of each of the following buffers to minimize deubiquitination (32Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

After these washes, bound proteins were eluted with 20 μl of 6× SDS sample loading buffer (Amersham Biosciences) mixed with 80 μl of 250 mm imidazole, 10 mm DTT. Proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and p12 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-p12 monoclonal antibody (Abnova Taiwan Corp., Taipei, Taiwan); the blots were then stripped and reblotted with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2; Sigma). For these experiments, 6% gels were used over a bottom layer of 12% polyacrylamide in order to retain the p12 while allowing the separation of the high molecular weight polyubiquitinated products. The p12 Subunit of Pol δ Is Depleted by UV Treatment of Cells—Exposure of cultured human cells to UV results in a rapid and specific depletion of the p12 subunit of Pol δ. p12 levels were depleted below detection levels by 6 h after exposure of HeLa cells to 10–40 J/m2 UVC and recovered by 24 h (Fig. 1A). The other three subunits of Pol δ, and PCNA were relatively unaffected (Fig. 1A). At lower UV doses, between 1 and 10 J/m2 (Fig. 1B), p12 levels were reduced to near completion by 5, 4, and 10 J/m2 UV in HeLa, HEK293T, and HCT116 cells, respectively, 4 h after treatment. p12 depletion was time-dependent, requiring 1 h for HeLa cells and 4 h for HCT116 cells after treatment with 10 J/m2 UV (Fig. 1C). Because ATR/Chk1 signaling is activated by UV damage (21Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 22Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a Western blot for Chk1-pS345 was also performed (33Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). We noted that HCT116 cells were more resistant than HeLa cells or HEK293T cells to p12 depletion by UV (Fig. 1, B and C). HCT116 cells differ in that they are p53-competent, whereas the other two are not. We tested the idea that this difference is due to p53 status in two human lung cell lines, H1299 (p53 null) and A549 (p53 wild type). p12 in the H1299 cell line was largely depleted at a UV dose of 1 J/m2 but required 20 J/m2 in A549 cells (Fig. 1D). Similar observations were made with other p53 competent cells (not shown). The reason for the slower rate of p12 degradation is unknown but could reflect the ability of p53 to stabilize stalled replication forks and inhibit the generation of aberrant DNA structures (34Gatz S.A. Wiesmuller L. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 35Sengupta S. Harris C.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). p12 Is Degraded by Treatment of Cells with MMS, HU, or Aphidicolin—Next, it was determined if the degradation of p12 occurs after other genotoxic treatments that are known to trigger the intra-S-phase checkpoint via ATR/Chk1 activation. p12 was degraded after MMS treatment in HeLa and HEK293T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), with concomitant phosphorylation of Chk1-Ser-345. p12 degradation after MMS treatment was time-dependent (Fig. 2B), and depletion was reached by 2 h in HeLa and by 30 min in HEK293T cells. HCT116 cells were much more resistant, and depletion was only observed after 9 h. The sensitivity of H1299 (p53 null) and A549 (p53 wild type) cells to MMS was examined. p12 was depleted by MMS in H1299 (p53 null) cells by 1 h after treatment but was only partially degraded after 12 h in A549 (p53 wild type) cells (Fig. 2C), similar to what was observed for UV treatment (Fig. 1D). Hydroxyurea (2 mm) caused the degradation of p12 in HeLa and HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A), but much more slowly by comparison with UV, nearing completion after 20 h. The depletion of p12 was correlated with the phosphorylation of Chk1"
https://openalex.org/W1964032340,"Members of the evolutionarily conserved Mastermind (MAM) protein family, including the three related mammalian Mastermind-like (MAML) proteins MAML1–3, function as crucial coactivators of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation. Given the recent evidence of cross-talk between the p53 and Notch signal transduction pathways, we have investigated whether MAML1 may also be a transcriptional coactivator of p53. Indeed, we show here that MAML1 is able to interact with p53. We show that MAML1-p53 interaction involves the N-terminal region of MAML1 and the DNA-binding domain of p53, and we use a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to show that MAML1 is part of the activator complex that binds to native p53-response elements within the promoter of the p53 target genes. Overexpression of wild-type MAML1 as well as a mutant, defective in Notch signaling, enhanced the p53-dependent gene induction in mammalian cells, whereas MAML1 knockdown reduced the p53-dependent gene expression. MAML1 increases the half-life of p53 protein and enhances its phosphorylation/acetylation upon DNA damage of cells. Finally, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the single Caenorhabditis elegans MAML homolog, Lag-3, led to substantial abrogation of p53-mediated germ-cell apoptotic response to DNA damage and markedly reduced the expression of Ced-13 and Egl-1, downstream pro-apoptotic targets of the C. elegans p53 homolog Cep-1. Thus, we present evidence for a novel coactivator function of MAML1 for p53, independent of its function as a coactivator of Notch signaling pathway.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a crucial role in coordinating cellular responses to genotoxic and other stresses, hence its designation as the “guardian of the genome” (1Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). At a biochemical level, p53 protein functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator to coordinate the expression of a variety of cell cycle, apoptosis, and senescence-associated genes during cellular stress (2Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar, 3Dimri G.P. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 505-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The p53-regulated genes determine the alternative cellular fates upon DNA damage and other stress stimuli. A key mechanism to tightly control p53-dependent transcriptional responses is the strict control of p53 protein levels and its activity by post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, and methylation (4Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 5Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In addition to modifications that result in an increase in p53 levels and activation of its specific DNA binding, recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to target gene promoter-associated p53 plays an essential role in p53-mediated transcriptional responses (6Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Lill N.L.

Coactivators typically facilitate transcription by bridging transcription factors to basal transcription machinery as well as to chromatin-modifying complexes, in particular the histone acetyltransferase machinery (8Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Indeed, coactivators with histone acetyltransferase activity, such as p300, CBP, 6The abbreviations used are: CBP, CREB-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RNAi, RNA interference; cRNA, control RNAi; Gy, gray; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; siRNA, short interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription. and PCAF, have been demonstrated to interact with and regulate p53-dependent transcription (7Lill N.L.

Recent studies have identified additional p53 coactivators, such as ADA3, that stabilize p53 and apparently recruit the ADA complex-associated histone acetyltransferase activities of GCN5 and PCAF (6Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Wang T.

In turn, well documented p53 coactivators, such as p300/CBP, also interact and functionally regulate other transcription factors. For example, p300 plays an important role in regulating Notch-dependent transcriptional activation (11Wallberg A.E. Pedersen K. Lendahl U. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Miele L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Given the fundamental importance of elucidating biochemical mechanisms of p53-mediated transcriptional responses, the potential role of novel coactivators of p53 is of substantial interest. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of MAML1 as a p53 coactivator. MAML1 is a member of the Drosophila Mastermind-like (MAML) gene family (MAML1–3) that functions as coactivators for Notch-dependent transcription (13Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although mammals express three distinct MAML genes (MAMl1–3) (14Lin S.E. Oyama T. Nagase T. Harigaya K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50612-50620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Wu L. Sun T. Kobayashi K. Gao P. Griffin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7688-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), a single gene is found in Drosophila (mastermind) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Lag-3/Sel-8), the latter coding for two alternatively spliced transcripts (16Petcherski A.G. Kimble J. Nature. 2000; 405: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Doyle T.G. Wen C. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7877-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The role of mastermind and MAML proteins in canonical Notch signaling has been documented in substantial detail. Interaction of a Notch ligand (of which there are five in mammals, including Jagged-1, Jagged-2, and Delta-1/2/3) with a Notch receptor (four in mammals, Notch 1–4) leads to a 2-step proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors, first by an ADAM protease and subsequently by γ-secretase (12Miele L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The latter cleaves within the transmembrane region, thereby releasing the active intracellular domain of Notch (ICN). The ICN then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the CSL (CBF1/RBP-Jκ in mammals, Su(H) in Drosophila, and Lag-1 in C. elegans) family of DNA-binding transcription factors (18Fryer C.J. Lamar E. Turbachova I. Kintner C. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). MAML proteins form a ternary complex with CBF1-ICN (19Wilson J.J. Kovall R.A. Cell. 2006; 124: 985-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) via a direct interaction and play a critical role in transcriptional activation of Notch targets by recruiting p300/CBP, which in turn mediates chromatin remodeling via histone acetylation (11Wallberg A.E. Pedersen K. Lendahl U. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A number of observations suggested the possibility that MAML1 may function as a p53 coactivator. Although MAML proteins have been considered Notch-specific coactivators, recent mouse knock-out data demonstrated that MAML1 also functions as a coactivator of muscle differentiation-related transcription factor MEF2 independent of Notch; in fact, Notch and MEF2 function antagonistically in myoblast differentiation, yet MAML1 can play a coactivator role for both pathways (20Wu L. Griffin J.D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Shen H. McElhinny A.S. Cao Y. Gao P. Liu J. Bronson R. Griffin J.D. Wu L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 675-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observations that MAML1 recruits p300 to Notch and that p300 is a known p53 coactivator (8Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 18Fryer C.J. Lamar E. Turbachova I. Kintner C. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that MAML1 may also function as a p53 coactivator. Importantly, recent findings have suggested a cross-talk between Notch and p53, as activation of Notch signaling was shown to inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis (22Nair P. Somasundaram K. Krishna S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7106-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Yang X. Klein R. Tian X. Cheng H.T. Kopan R. Shen J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Notch activation in neural progenitor cells led to elevated levels of p53 and its targets, and p53-deficient cells showed a suppression of Notch-mediated apoptosis (23Yang X. Klein R. Tian X. Cheng H.T. Kopan R. Shen J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Finally, similar to ADA3 (6Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), MAML1 was identified as a human papilloma virus E6-binding protein 7L. Wu and J. D. Griffin, manuscript in preparation., 8I. Bhat, L. Delmolino, Y. Zhang, Y. Zhao, Q. Gao, D. E. Wazer, H. Band, and V. Band, manuscript in preparation.; given the ability of ADA3 to function as a p53 coactivator, we considered the possibility that MAML1 may also play such a role aside from its known function as a Notch coactivator. Here, we demonstrate that MAML1 interacts with p53 in vitro and in vivo, associates with p53 transcriptional complexes bound to native p53-reponsive promoters, and upon overexpression markedly enhances p53-mediated gene transcription as well as biological function. Overexpression of p53 inhibits MAM-induced CBF-luciferase activity, suggesting that p53 and CBF may compete for MAML1 under certain conditions. Complementary in vivo studies utilizing RNAi-mediated knockdown demonstrate that Lag-3, the sole MamL ortholog in C. elegans, demonstrates an important role in a p53 (Cep-1 in C. elegans)-mediated pathway that leads to apoptosis in the germ line (24Gumienny T.L. Lambie E. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Hengartner M.O. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel and evolutionarily conserved role for the Notch coactivator MAML1 (and Lag-3) in p53-mediated transactivation and biological function. Cells and Media—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). MCF-7, U2OS, and Saos2 cell lines were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. 76N-derived immortal mammary epithelial cell lines 76N-TERT (p53-positive) and 76R-30 (p53-negative) were grown in DFCI medium (25Band V. Zajchowski D. Kulesa V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged full-length MAML1 (FLAG-MAML1) and truncated mutants 1–302 (FLAG-MAML1-(1–302)) been described earlier (13Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). FLAG-MAML-(742–1016) was derived by subcloning MAML1 sequences encoding amino acids 742–1016 from a pGAD10 construct isolated in a yeast two-hybrid interaction with HPV16 E6. 8I. Bhat, L. Delmolino, Y. Zhang, Y. Zhao, Q. Gao, D. E. Wazer, H. Band, and V. Band, manuscript in preparation. FLAG-MAML1 was further subcloned into pEF-HisB vector (Invitrogen) for mammalian expression using BamHI and DraI and into pet14b vector for bacterial expression using a BamHI site. Retroviral constructs of MAML1 and its mutant 742–1016 were derived by subcloning the corresponding fragments from PEF-His constructs into the pMSCVpuro vector (Invitrogen). GST-MAM-CT was constructed by cloning the 742–1016 fragment from the original pGAD10 clone into pGEX-4T1 vector (Roche Applied Science). Wild-type p53 and its truncation mutants were derived by subcloning cDNA inserts from pCMV-p53 (obtained from Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins Medical Center) into PCR3.1 plasmid. Additional truncation mutants of p53 containing residues 1–101, 102–292, and 292–393 were generated by the PCR cloning using the primer sets caagaattcatggaggagccgcagtcagatcctagcgtc and cggctcgagtcatttctgggaagggacagaagatgac, cgagaattcatgacctaccagggcagctacggtttc and cggctgcaggcggccgctcatttcttgcggagattctcttcctc, and cgagaattcatgggggagcctcaccacgagctgcc and cggctcgagtcagtctgagtcaggcccttctgtcttgaac, respectively. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing the p53-responsive elements of Bax, Gadd45, and p21 were obtained from Dr. Carol Prives (Columbia University, New York) and the pG13 reporter originally obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore), was provided by Dr. Wafik El-Deiry (University of Pennsylvania). In Vitro Binding Assays—35S-Labeled p53 or its truncation mutants were generated using [35S]methionine and the TnT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). In vitro translated proteins were treated with 1 unit of DNase I for 30 min prior to the binding reaction. One μg each of GST or GST-MAML1, noncovalently bound to glutathione beads in 500 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), were incubated with the in vitro translated proteins for 1 h at 4 °C and washed five times with lysis buffer. The 35S-labeled p53 or its truncation mutants bound to GST fusion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Binding reactions using cell lysates were carried out with 1 μg of His-MAML1 immobilized on His-bind resin (Novagen), or His-Bind resin alone, in 200 μl of binding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm imidazole) for 5 min at 4 °C and washed six times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography or analyzed by immunoblotting followed by ECL (reagents from Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Association between MAML1 and p53—For coimmunoprecipitation analyses, 5 × 105 U2OS cells expressing endogenous wild-type p53 were transfected with 5 μg of FLAG-MAML1 or vector, using the FuGENE 6 reagent, according to the supplier's instructions (Roche Applied Science). 48 h later, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and 1-mg aliquots of cell lysate protein were pre-cleared with protein G-agarose, subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-p53 antibody (ab-1, Oncogene Research), and immunoblotted for MAML1 using an anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) followed by ECL detection. For His tag pulldown analyses, 5 × 105 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of His-MAML1 and 1 μg of FLAG-p53 using the calcium phosphate method. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and 400 μg of protein was incubated with His-Bind resin (Novagen) for 5 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed six times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-His (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies to detect p53 and MAML1, respectively. To demonstrate the interaction of endogenous p53 with MAML1, U2OS cells were treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma) or an equal volume of 70% methanol (as control) for 4 h, and the cells were lysed in NETN buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 100 mm NaCl; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein-G beads, and immunoprecipitation from aliquots was carried out with a mixture of six anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (p53 (DO-1), p53 (pAb1801), p53 (pAb 240) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; p53 (polyclonal antibody 421) from Calbiochem; p53 (pAb122) from NeoMarkers, or normal mouse IgG (negative control)). p53-associated MamL1 was analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-MamL1 monoclonal antibody and visualized using ECL. Transactivation Assays—For the p53-mediated transactivation, 5 × 105 Saos2 (a p53-negative osteosarcoma cell line) or MCF-7 cells per 100-mm dish or 2 × 105 per 60-mm dish were transfected with the indicated luciferase reporters, MAML1, p53, as indicated in figure legends. Each dish also received 20 ng of SV40-Renilla luciferase reporter (pRL-SV40) to normalize for differences in transfection. Total DNA was kept constant by addition of vector DNA. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later, using a dual-luciferase kit (Promega, WI). For the ICN-mediated transactivation, 1 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate were transfected with various constructs (100 ng of CBF1 reporter, 10 ng each of ICN1 and SV40 Renilla reporter, and different doses of p53 and MamL1, as indicated in the figures legends) using the FuGENE 6 reagent. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay to Detect the Native p21, Bax, and GADD45 Promoters-bound MamL1 and p53—Subconfluent MCF-7, a wild-type p53-containing cell line, was used for ChIP analysis. The native protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked by treatment with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The ChIP assay was carried out as reported earlier (26Christova R. Oelgeschlager T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal aliquots of isolated chromatin were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-p53 (DO1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) anti-MamL1 (13Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), anti-polymerase II, or IgG monoclonal antibodies. DNA associated with immunoprecipitates was used as a template for PCR to amplify different p53 target promoters containing the p53-binding site. The primers used were as follows: p21, 5′ primer 5′-TCCATCCCTATGCTGCCTGCT and 3′ primer 5′-CAAGGATCCTGCTGGCAGATC; GADD45, 5′ primer 5′-GGATCTGTGGTAGGTGAGGGTCAGG and 3′ primer 5′-GGAATTAGTCACGGGAGGCAGTGCAG; and Bax, 5′ primer 5′-GATTGGGCCACTGCACTCCAG and 3′ primer 5′-TGACTAAAAACTGAGTGG. As a specificity control, the GAPDH promoter was amplified from the same templates using the following primers: 5′ primer 5′-AAAAGCGGGGAGAAAGTAGG and 3′ primer 5′-CTAGCCTCCCGGGTTTCTCT. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against p53 (DO1), p21, and GFP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-acetylated p53 antibody was obtained from Upstate (Temecula, CA); anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma; β-actin antibodies were from Abcam Inc.(Cambridge, MA), and anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-15) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston). Transient Transfection and Western Blotting—For transfection experiments, Saos-2 cells were plated in100-mm dishes and transfected with the indicated expression constructs (see figure legends) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed 40 h post-transfection in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science, and equivalent amounts of whole cell extracts were processed for SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed with 200 ng of total RNA using the following primers: (a) p53, forward primer 5′-CAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTATGTCGAAAAGTGTTTCTGTCATC-3′;(b) p21, forward primer 5′-GTGAGCGATGGAACTTCGACTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATC-3′;(c) GAPDH forward primer 5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′;(d) MamL1 forward primer 5′-CAGCATCAGTTGCTTTTGGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGCTCTGAGGCATGTTTTG-3′. The RT-PCR products were visualized under UV light after running on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. Analysis of the p53 Protein Turnover—100-mm dishes of Saos-2 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing p53 alone or in combination with MamL1. At 16 h post-transfection cells were trypsinized, and equal numbers of cells were replated on five 6-well plates. After 16 h, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the medium, and cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Total cell extracts were prepared, and equivalent amounts were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometry analysis was carried out on scanned images using Scion Image for Windows software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Apoptosis Assay (FACS Analysis of Pre-G1 Cells)—76NTERT cells (containing wild-type p53) and 76R30 cells (containing mutant p53) were infected with retroviruses expressing full-length MAM and various fragments of MAML1 for 48 h and selected in 100 μg/ml G418 for 48 h. The cells were then plated into 100-mm dishes for Western blotting and in 6-well plates for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. 48 h later cells were treated with adriamycin (0.25 μg/ml) for 18 h. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, and ice-cold 100% ethanol was gently added to make the final ethanol concentration to 50%. The cell solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The cells were spun down and resuspended in 0.5 ml of RNase solution (40 μg/ml), and the tubes were vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 0.5 ml of diluted propidium iodide solution (final concentration 0.1 mg/ml) was added to each tube, and the samples were analyzed for the pre-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Construction of RNAi against p53 and MAML1—To construct a retrovirus-based vector expressing MamL1 RNAi, we used Oligoengine software and used the sequence gaggaatcttgacagcgcc (336–354) for MAML1 RNAi 1 and sequence gcagcctttgagcaagaac (913–931) for MamL1 RNAi 2 to synthesize complementary strands of a 64-bp oligonucleotide with BglII cohesive site at the 5′ end and HindIII cohesive site at the 3′ end. Cloning was done into the retroviral vector pSuper Retro-Neo (pSRNeo) from Oligoengine (Seattle, WA). RNAi against p53 was designed according to the literature (27Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) and cloned into pSRNeo BglII and HindIII sites. Duplex RNAi oligonucleotides were also utilized in our experiments. The RNA oligonucleotides used to generate 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes were synthesized through Dharmacon, corresponding to the human MAML1 sequences in open reading frame siRNA 1 (nucleotides 336–354) (5′-GAGGAATCTTGACAGCGCC-3′), siRNA 2 (nucleotides 913–931) (5′-GCAGCCTTTGAGCAAGAAC), and control siRNA (5′-CCAAGATCATCACCGCCTG-3′). C. elegans Strains and Culture Conditions—C. elegans worms were cultured at 22 °C, unless otherwise indicated, under standard growth conditions (28Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains used in this study were Bristol strain N2 (wild-type) and dpy-20 (el282); grls50 expresses a GFP-tagged Lag-3 and was kindly provided by Iva Greenwald (see Ref. 17Doyle T.G. Wen C. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7877-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). C. elegans Feeding RNAi—The RNAi construct used to target Lag-3 was constructed by cloning into the BamHI and HindIII sites of plasmid L4440(2xT7) PCR amplified Lag-3 cDNA. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA from N2 worms using One-step PCR (Invitrogen) and the following primers. The forward primer sequence was 5′-CGCGGATCCATGAAACCGTCGACA and the reverse primer was 5′-CGGGGTACCTCAATTGATATTAGC. Feeding RNAi experiments were performed under the same conditions as those described by Timmons et al. (29Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Following overnight egg laying at 22 °C by gravid hermaphrodites, the plates were kept at 15 °C. C. elegans Germ Line Apoptosis Assay—Germ line apoptosis assays were performed similarly to previously described experiments (24Gumienny T.L. Lambie E. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Hengartner M.O. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, synchronized L4 stage worms fed with the indicated RNAi plasmid transformed bacteria were either left untreated or were subjected to 120 Gy of γ-irradiation using a 137Cs source. Following irradiation, the animals were maintained at 22 °C for 21 h at which time the worms were collected for staining with 33 μm SYTO 12 (Invitrogen) for 2 h. The worms were then washed with M9 (22 mm KH2PO4, 42 mm Na2HPO4, 85.5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4) buffer and then transferred to seeded plates to allow for clearing of SYTO 12-stained bacteria from the guts of the worms for 45 min. The worms were then mounted onto coverslips with agar pads to be observed with both Normarski optics and fluorescence microscopy. SYTO 12-stained cells were counted and averaged from about 15–25 animals per condition. Real Time RT PCR—Worms were treated with γ-irradiation as indicated above. Twenty four hours after irradiation, adult worms were picked from the plates, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). Real time PCR was performed using custom TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) directed against Ced-13, Egl-1, and C. elegans actin as an internal control. The assays were performed using Mx3000P QPCR machine (Stratagene, TX). Expression of Ced-13 and egl-1 was normalized to actin expression, and fold induction was calculated. p53 and MAML1 Interact in Vitro—Given the apparent cross-talk between Notch and p53 and the regulation of multiple transcription factors by coactivators, we assessed if Notch coactivator MAML1 interacts with p53. To assess the interaction of p53 with MAML1 in vitro, 35S-labeled p53 protein was translated in vitro using TnT system (Promega) and incubated with bacterially expressed GST alone (a negative control) or GST fusion proteins of full-length MAML1, MAML1 fragments, and the tetramerization domain of p53 (a positive control). Although GST alone did not show any interaction with p53 (Fig. 1, lane 2), a clear interaction was observed with full-length MAML1 (lane 3). Furthermore, although no binding was observed with the MAML1 fragments 302–806 or 742–1016, the N-terminal fragment of MAML1 (MAML1-(1–302)) showed a clear binding to the in vitro translated p53 protein (Fig. 1A). The bottom panels of Fig. 1A show that comparable amounts of GST or the fusion proteins were used in the binding reactions. These results demonstrated that MAML1 specifically interacts with"
https://openalex.org/W2065473937,"By using a combination of radio frequency time-of-arrival and interferometer measurements, we observed a sequence of lightning and electrical activity during one of Mount St. Augustine's eruptions. The observations indicate that the electrical activity had two modes or phases. First, there was an explosive phase in which the ejecta from the explosion appeared to be highly charged upon exiting the volcano, resulting in numerous apparently disorganized discharges and some simple lightning. The net charge exiting the volcano appears to have been positive. The second phase, which followed the most energetic explosion, produced conventional-type discharges that occurred within plume. Although the plume cloud was undoubtedly charged as a result of the explosion itself, the fact that the lightning onset was delayed and continued after and well downwind of the eruption indicates that in situ charging of some kind was occurring, presumably similar in some respects to that which occurs in normal thunderstorms."
https://openalex.org/W2108565140,"Pathogens cause damage, and their elimination requires activation of the costly immune response. A highly economic defense strategy should thus be the behavioral avoidance of pathogens, as manifested in humans by all aspects of hygiene or revulsion at pathogen-rich material. Despite its potential importance, behavioral defenses have as yet received only little attention in biomedical research--in stark contrast to the physiological immune system. In the present study, the genetics of such behavioral defenses are elucidated in a simple model organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show for the first time that mutations in the insulin-like receptor (ILR) pathway lead to two distinct behavioral responses against pathogenic strains of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (BT), including the physical evasion of pathogens and their reduced oral uptake. Since this pathway also contributes to nematode stress resistance, the results surprisingly reveal a genetic link between physiological and behavioral defenses. Considering that many signaling pathways have conserved their functions across evolution, including the ILR pathway, this signaling cascade may represent an interesting candidate regulator for behavioral defenses in more complex organisms, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W1999706471,"We previously reported that overexpression of cell division autoantigen 1 (CDA1) in HeLa cells arrests cell growth and inhibits DNA synthesis at S-phase (1). Here we show that CDA1-induced arrest of cell growth is accompanied by increases in protein and mRNA levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor protein, p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup> (p21). Both p21 induction and cell growth arrest are reversed when CDA1 expression is inhibited. CDA1 also increases p53 protein, but not its mRNA, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase regulating p53 degradation, is inactivated by CDA1, suggesting that p53 protein accumulation is due to decreased protein degradation. Knockdown of p53, using siRNA targeting two sites of p53 mRNA, abrogates transcriptional induction of p21 by CDA1. Deletion of the p53 responsive element in the distal region of p21 promoter attenuates promoter activity in response to CDA1. DNA damage caused by camptothecin treatment increases mRNA and protein levels of CDA1, accompanied by induction of p53. The DNA damage-induced p53 induction is markedly attenuated by CDA1 knockdown. CDA1 induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2(p44/42), an activity blocked by PD98059 and U0126, inhibitors of the upstream kinase MEK1/2. The MEK inhibitors also block induction of p21 mRNA and abrogate p21 promoter activity stimulated by CDA1. Cell cycle kinases, Cdk1, -2, -4, and -6 are inhibited by CDA1 overexpression. We conclude that CDA1 induces p53- and MEK/ERK1/2 MAPK-dependent expression of p21 by acting through the p53 responsive element in the p21 promoter and that this contributes to its antiproliferative activity."
https://openalex.org/W2035326552,"Spinal muscular atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease accompanied by a loss of motoneurons. Either mutations or deletions in the survival of motoneuron (SMN) gene are responsible for this defect. SMN is an assembly protein for RNA-protein complexes in the nucleus and is also found in axons of neurons. However, it is unclear which dysfunctions of SMN are important for disease progression. In this study we analyzed the contributions of different SMN regions for localization and neuronal differentiation associated with outgrowth of neurites. Suppression of endogenous SMN protein levels significantly decreased the growth of neurites. Down-regulation of the interacting protein gemin2 had the opposite effect. Surprisingly, selective overexpression of the SMN C-terminal domain promoted neurite outgrowth similar to full-length protein and could rescue the SMN knock-down effects. The knock-down led to a significant change in the G-/F-actin ratio, indicating a role for SMN in actin dynamics. Therefore, our data suggest a functional role for SMN in microfilament metabolism in axons of motoneurons."

In stark contrast to developments in synchrotron and laser science, the past 40 years have seen only a factor of 10 increase in neutron source brightness. With the advent of thermonuclear ignition in the laboratory, coupled to innovative approaches in how this may be achieved, we calculate that a neutron source three orders of magnitude more powerful than any existing facility can be envisaged on a 20- to 30-year time scale. Such a leap in source power would transform neutron scattering science."

https://openalex.org/W2034486659,"Nod1 is an intracellular protein that is involved in recognition of bacterial molecules and whose genetic variation has been linked to several inflammatory diseases. Previous studies suggested that the recognition core of Nod1 stimulatory molecules is γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP), but the identity of the major Nod1 stimulatory molecule produced by bacteria remains unknown. Here we show that bacteria produce lipophilic molecules capable of stimulating Nod1. Analysis of synthetic compounds revealed stereoselectivity of the DAP residue and that conjugation of lipophilic acyl residues specifically enhances the Nod1 stimulatory activity of the core iE-DAP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that lipophilic molecules induce and/or enhance the secretion of innate immune mediators from primary mouse mesothelial cells and human monocytic MonoMac6 cells, and this effect is mediated through Nod1. These results provide insight into the mechanism of immune recognition via Nod1, which might be useful in the design and testing of novel immunoregulators.

Bacterial cells were precipitated at 2,600 × g for 30 min and suspended in water. After precipitation by centrifugation, bacteria were resuspended in water and killed by heating at 98 °C for 30 min. Water-soluble and -insoluble fractions of bacterial extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The water-insoluble fraction was further washed with water five times by repeating suspension and centrifugation of the pellet and resuspended in water. The hydrophobic molecules in the water-insoluble fractions were extracted with water/methanol/chloroform (1:3:2 v/v) followed by removal of bacterial components by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm 10 min at 4 °C. After the supernatant was dried, the pellet was resuspended in water and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with water twice, resuspended with water/methanol/chloroform (1:3:2 v/v), and dried.

All fractions were stored at –20 °C until Nod1 and Nod2 stimulatory activity bioassay.Synthesis of Four Stereoisomeric DAPs—The synthetic process of stereoisomeric iE-DAPs is summarized in Fig. 1. Four γ-d-Glu-DAP (iE-DAP) stereoisomers, iE-(2R,6R)-DAP (1a), iE-(2R,6S)-DAP (1b), iE-(2S,6R)-DAP (1c), and iE-(2S,6S)-DAP (1d) were synthesized without enzymatic process. The DAP residue in compound 1c has the natural (2S,6R) configuration (l-configuration at C-2 and d-configuration at C-6). Dibenzyl N2-benzyloxycarbonyl-N6-t-butoxycarbonyl-2,6-diaminopimelate 3 was synthesized from a meso and racemic mixture of DAP 2 to be subjected to the chiral HPLC separation (Fig. 1). We obtained the four isomers, fr.1 (19 min)-3a, fr.2 (34 min)-3b, fr.3 (47 min)-3c, and fr4. (52 min)-3d, with chiral HPLC separation (column: CHIRALPAK AD-H (Daicel Chemical Industries. Ltd.), 0.46 cmϕ × 25 cm; mobile phase, n-hexane/2-propanol = 7/3; flow rate, 1 ml/min; detection, 254 nm). The observed optical rotation of the isomers (fr.1(3a), (α)21D =+2.7 (c 1.0, CHCl3), fr.2(3b), (α)21D =+0.78 (c 1.0, CHCl3), fr.3(3c), (α)21D =–0.80 (c 1.0, CHCl3), fr.4(3d), (α)21D =–3.2 (c 0.6, CHCl3)) showed the fr.1 and fr.4 and fr. 2 and fr.3 were pairs of enantiomers. All obtained isomers 3a–d were subjected to deprotection with 6 n HCl at reflux for 5 h. The optical rotation of 4a (α)23D =–24 (c 1.1, H2O) showed that DAP 4a derived from 3a was (2R,6R)-form (literature (α)25D =–20 (c 1.0, H2 O)).11 Its antipode 4c derived from 3d was the (2S,6S)-form, whereas DAP 4b derived from 3b and 3c was the meso-form. The configurations of 3b(fr.2) and 3c (fr.3) were determined by derivatization to the known compound dimethyl (2R,6S)-N6-benzyloxycarbonyl-2-t-butoxycarbonyl DAP 5 ((α)D = +5.45 (c 0.5, CHCl3)) (23Gao Y. Lane-Bell P. Vederas J.C. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 2133-2143Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The optical rotations showed that configuration of 5b derived from 3b was (2R,6S) and that of 5c derived from 3c was (2S,6R).Synthesis of the Acylated iE-DAP Library—Acyl groups were introduced to the glutamic acid residue of iE-DAP. Carpryloyl (C8), myristoyl (C14), pentadecanoyl (C15), palmitoyl (C16), stearoyl (C18), 4-propylbenzoyl, 4-cyclohexylbenzoyl, 4-fluorobenzoyl, tetrahydropyranoyl, and 3-(4-aminocyclohexyl)-propionyl groups were used (Table 1). As depicted in Fig. 2, we used 2-chlorotrityl resin for the solid phase synthesis. Selective monoalkylation of dibenzyl-2,6-diaminopimelate 8 with 2-chlorotrityl resin 9 was effected by the use of an excess amount of 8 (2 eq of loading capacity of the resin) in the presence of triethylamine in CH2Cl2. Fmoc-d-Glu-OBn 11 was subsequently introduced to the remaining free amino group using diisopropylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBt) in N,N-dimethyl formamide to give compound 12. Deprotection of the Fmoc group with piperidine occurred, and acyl groups were then introduced to the amino group of the glutamic acid residue using the acid chloride 13a ∼ j and triethylamine in CH2Cl2 to give the corresponding acylated compound 14a ∼ j as shown in Fig. 2. The obtained compounds were cleaved from the resin with 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in CH2Cl2, and the liberated amino group was protected with the t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group using (Boc)2OinCH2Cl2 for purification to give 16a ∼ j. The compounds 16a ∼ j were hydrogenolyzed with H2 by using Pd(OH)2 in acetic acid to remove benzyl groups. In this reaction, the terminal phenyl group of biphenyl (16j), furanyl group (16h), and 4-nitrostylyl group (16j) were also reduced. Subsequent acidic cleavage of the t-butoxycarbonyl group with trifluoroacetic acid gave a series of N-acyl-iE-DAP derivatives 18a ∼ j.TABLE 1Structures and yields of acyl iE-DAP compounds Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Scheme for introduction of various acyl residues to iE-DAP molecules.

This suggests that the solubility of the bacterial molecule(s) might be important for its ability to stimulate Nod1 and Nod2. To test this possibility, we determined the ability of water-soluble and -insoluble fractions isolated from E. coli K-12 to stimulate Nod1 and Nod2 using the HEK293T bioassay developed in our previous studies (8Chamaillard M.

Surprisingly, we found that the water-insoluble fraction also possessed Nod1 and Nod2 stimulatory activity (Fig. 3A). However, the stimulatory activity of the insoluble fraction was methanolsoluble and could be distinguished from that present in macromolecular PGN (Fig. 3B). The latter observation suggested that membrane-bound molecules possess the ability to stimulate Nod1 and Nod2. During PGN synthesis, GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide, an intermediate component, is transferred from the cytosol to periplasmic space through a lipid I/II translocation system (21Breukink E. van Heusden H.E.

Therefore, we tested the ability of Lipid I and II preparations to stimulate Nod1 and Nod2. As shown in Fig. 3C, we found that meso-DAP-type Lipid II stimulated Nod1 and Nod2, whereas Lys-type Lipid I stimulated Nod2 but not Nod1. The iE-DAP dependence of Nod1 stimulatory activity in Lipid I is consistent with the previous finding that Nod1 recognizes iE-DAP. l-Lys-type Lipid II, which is synthesized from Lipid I and GlcNAc-UDP and contains a GlcNAc residue, lacked the ability to stimulate Nod2 (Fig. 3C). This observation suggests that PGN-related molecules present in the periplasmic space and at the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane do not stimulate Nod2, which is consistent with the fact that the major Nod2 stimulatory activity is present in bacterial cell extracts but not in the supernatant of bacterial cultures (18Hasegawa M.

The level of NF-κB-dependent transcription activity in the presence of receptor-specific stimulation without second ligands is given as 1.

Statins are inhibitors of HMG CoA (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductases and cholesterol synthesis, which block the expression of several inflammatory proteins independent of their capacity to lower endogenous cholesterol. In the present study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin and mevastatin on COX-2 induction in human monocytic cell line U937 and analyzed the underlying mechanisms. Pretreatment of U937 cells with simvastatin or mevastatin for 24 h resulted in a significant reduction in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent induction of prostaglandin E2, thromboxane A2 synthesis, and COX-2 expression. Mevalonate, the direct metabolite of HMG CoA reductase, and farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, intermediates of the mevalonate pathway, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of statins on COX-2. An inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferases, GGTI-286 mimicked the effect of statins on COX-2 expression. Cytonecrotic factor-1 increased LPS-dependent expression of COX-2. Treatment of cells with NSC 23766, an inhibitor of Rac, which we demonstrated to block Rac 2 activation, resulted in an inhibition of the LPS-dependent expression of COX-2. Whereas no effect was obtained with RhoA/C blocker, C3 exoenzyme. Gel retardation experiments and NFkappaB-p65 transcription factor assay showed that simvastatin and NSC 23766 decrease significantly NF-kappaB complex formation. In macrophages, the antiinflammatory effects of statins are mediated in part through the inhibition of COX-2 and prostanoids. Rac GTPase protein is identified as one of the targets of statins in this regulation."

This activity is strictly dependent on the presence of estrogen receptor α (ERα). However the precise molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still unclear. IGF-I treatment induces phosphorylation of the AF1 domain of ERα and activation of estrogen regulated genes. These genes are characterized by important differences in promoter architecture and response element composition. We show that promoter structure is crucial for IGF-I-induced transcription activation. We demonstrate that on a complex promoter such as the pS2/TFF1 promoter, which contains binding sites for ERα and for the activating protein-1 (AP1) complex, transcriptional activation by IGF-I requires both ERα and the AP1 complex. IGF-I is unable to stimulate transcription of an estrogen-regulated gene under the control of a minimal promoter containing only a binding site for ERα. We propose a molecular mechanism with stepwise assembly of the AP1 complex and ERα during transcription activation of pS2/TFF1 by IGF-I. IGF-I stimulation induces rapid phosphorylation and an increase in protein levels of the AP1 complex.

Once present on the promoter of estrogen responsive genes, ER recruits an array of transcriptional cofactors (coactivators and corepressors) that bind to the receptor and interact with other transcription factors, including components of the general transcription machinery. Some of these cofactors possess chromatin-remodeling activities or histone modifying activities or recruit additional proteins to the complex to mediate transcription (for review, see Ref. 8McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). ERα may also modulate transcription without receptor-DNA interaction by functional interference with other transcription factors such as activating protein-1 (AP1) (for review, see Refs. 9Schule R.

Ziff E. Nature. 1988; 336: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), predominantly consists of various combinations of Jun (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, FosB) proteins. This complex can result from many different combinations of heterodimers and homodimers, and the combination determines the genes that are regulated by AP1 (14Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 15Vogt P.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The AP1 complex formed of heterodimers or homodimers of Jun and Fos proteins has DNA binding activity via the TPA-responsive elements (TREs).Furthermore transcriptional activity of the AP1 complex is post-translationally regulated by several kinases. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylate c-Fos on threonines 325 and 331. These phosphorylations regulate the transforming activity of c-Fos (16Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases on residues serine 63 (17Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar) and 73 potentiates its ability to activate transcription either as a homodimer (18Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M.

Then the IGF-I receptor is able to bind signaling adaptor proteins like insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and Shc, linking the receptor to downstream signaling pathways like the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein pathways (for review, see Ref. 20Surmacz E. Guvakova M.A. Nolan M.K. Nicosia R.F. Sciacca L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Growth factors such as IGF-I are able to elicit estrogenic responses in target tissues in the absence of estradiol, and they cooperate with the hormone in its presence (21Cavailles V. Garcia M. Rochefort H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that estradiol, anti-estrogens, and growth factors induce a rapid hyperphosphorylation of ERα on serine 118, located at the N terminus within transcriptional activation function AF-1 (2Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is essential for activation of ERα bound or not to its ligand (24Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, this phosphorylation is not sufficient to elicit estrogenic responses in the absence of hormone, and there may be other ERα domains or partners that fulfill additional requirements for growth factor signaling through ERα (22Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Supporting this, MCF7 breast cancer cells with a constitutively active MEK1 show increased interaction between ERα and its coactivators (SRC2 and SRC3) and hormone hypersensitivity (25Atanaskova N. Keshamouni V.G. Krueger J.S. Schwartz J.A. Miller F. Reddy K.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4000-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is activated by IGF-I, has been shown to phosphorylate ERα on serine 167 within 1 h after treatment with growth factors. Active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase increases the transcription-stimulating activity of both the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of ERα, whereas active protein kinase B (PKB), a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, only increases the activity of AF-1, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase utilizes PKB-dependent and -independent pathways in activating ERα. In addition, LY294002, a specific inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway, reduced phosphorylation of ERα in vivo (26Campbell R.A. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Patel N.M. Constantinidou D. Ali S. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9817-9824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar).The goal of the present study was to better understand the cross-talk between the IGF-I and estradiol pathways at the molecular level. We studied the pS2/TFF1 gene whose regulation serves as a paradigm for estrogen regulation of gene expression in breast cancer cells. The pS2/TFF1 gene has a composite promoter with an ERE (located between –405 and –393) and a TRE (AP1 response element, located between –338 and –332), and it has been reported that its activation can be achieved by estradiol or IGF-I (27Chalbos D. Philips A. Galtier F. Rochefort H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that both estradiol and IGF-I treatments induce a rapid chromatin remodeling of the pS2/TFF1 promoter in a region encompassing the ERE and the TRE (28Giamarchi C. Solanas M. Chailleux C. Augereau P. Vignon F. Rochefort H. Richard-Foy H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The role of the AP1 element in the response of pS2/TFF1 to estradiol has been analyzed in detail by others in a cell line derived from the HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell line, re-expressing ERα. They demonstrate that the ERE is essential for the response of pS2/TFF1 to estrogens and that the TRE is involved in both estrogen and phorbol-ester responses (29Barkhem T. Haldosen L.A. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1273-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Here we demonstrate that activation of ERα induced by IGF-I is not sufficient to allow activation of a minimal estrogen-regulated promoter containing only an ERE sequence. We show that in response to IGF-I treatment, the AP1 complex is phosphorylated and rapidly recruited to the pS2/TFF1 promoter, whereas recruitment of ERα is delayed. On the pS2/TFF1 promoter, ERα and the AP1 complex cooperate during IGF-I-induced activation of the transcription, but have different functions. The AP1 complex is implicated in chromatin remodeling by recruiting chromatin-remodeling factors such as Brg1, whereas ERα is involved in later stages of transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Estradiol was purchased from Sigma.

After the addition of hormone or growth factor, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cross-linked with 1.5% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected into 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. Cells were washed sequentially with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5), and buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). Cells were then resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated three times for 15 s with a Branson Sonifier 250 (duty cycle 50%, output control 5) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and diluted in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) followed by immuno-clearing with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20 μl of preimmune serum, and protein A-Sepharose (45 μl of 50% slurry in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies. After immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added, and the incubation was continued for another 1 h. Precipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl; except for Brg1, where SDS was removed from the buffer), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed 3 times with Tris-EDTA buffer and extracted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 30 min at 65 °C. Eluates were heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. After cross-link reversion, ⅓ of the DNA fragments were purified with a GenElute PCR clean-up kit (Sigma), and 1/20 of the purified DNA was quantified by quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCR were performed on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using the oligonucleotides PS2 CH1 (5′-GGCCATCTCTCACTATGAATCACTTCTGC-3′) and PS2 CH2 (5′-GGCAGGCTCTGTTTGCTTAAAGAGCG-3′) to amplify the pS2/TFF1 promoter fragment. Amplification conditions were 3 min at 95 °C followed by 50 cycles (20 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 62.5 °C, 20 s 72 °C). For the purification of the inputs, 20 μl of extract was removed and heated overnight at 65 °C, DNA was then purified as for immunoprecipitates, and 1/20 of the DNA was quantified by quantitative PCR.Co-immunoprecipitations—For co-immunoprecipitations of cross-linked protein complexes, 1 × 106 cells were submitted to immunoprecipitation as in the ChIP procedure, except that after immuno-recovery proteins were eluted by the addition of 30 μl of H2O and 10 μl of 4× electrophoresis loading buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 20% glycerol, 8 mm EDTA, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.016% bromphenol blue). The totality of the immunoprecipitated material was electrophoresed on SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting.For co-immunoprecipitations of native protein complexes, 1 × 106 MCF7 cells, grown for 3 days in steroid-free medium, were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, anti-protease from Roche Applied Science (1 mini-tablet/10 ml)), phosphatase inhibitors from Sigma (P2850), and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 × g, the lysate was adjusted to 1 ml with 500 μl of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 μm CaCl2, 1 μl of DNase I). A total of 40 μl (v/v) of protein A/protein G beads were added, and the lysate was incubated for 45 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, 30 μl was withdrawn for input assays, and the remaining material was incubated with 1 μg of anti-c-Jun for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. A total of 20 μl (v/v) protein A/protein G beads were added again, and the incubation was continued for 2 more hours. Beads were washed 3 times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), and proteins were eluted by the addition of 20 μl of H2O and 10 μl of 4× electrophoresis loading buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 20% glycerol, 8 mm EDTA, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.016% bromphenol blue). The totality of the immunoprecipitated material was electrophoresed on SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting.RT-PCR Experiments—Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold 1× PBS, RNA was then purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was eluted in 100 μl of RNase-free water, and 1/20 was submitted to quantitative RT-PCR (Platinum RT-PCR thermoscript one step, Invitrogen) with the following primers: pS2/TFF1, 5′-GTACACGGAGGCCCAGACAGAGACGTG(FAM)AC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGGCGTGACACCAGGAAA-3′ (reverse); actin, 5′-CACAATAGTCCTCGGCCACATTG(FAM)G (reverse) and 5′-GGTGACAGCAGTCGGTTGGA-3′ (forward); GAPDH, 5′-GACCATTGCTGGGGCTGGTGGTC(FAM)C-3′ (reverse) and 5′-ACAGCAACAGGGTGGTGGAC-3′(forward). Amplification conditions were 30 min at 45 °C and 3 min at 95 °C followed by 50 cycles (20 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, 20 s 72 °C).Cell Electroporation and RNA Interference—Five million cells were electroporated by siRNA to a final concentration of 20 μm. Cells were electroporated on a gene pulser Xcell (BioRad) at 250 V and 960 microfarads in 0.4-mm cuvettes. After electroporation, cells were plated and grown for 2 days in media without phenol red, without gentamycin, and without serum. Cells were treated or not with 5 nm IGF-I for 1 day.siRNA-directed against c-Jun, c-Fos, and ERα were purchased from Dharmacon (siRNA, c-Jun M-003268–02, c-Fos M-003265–01, and ERα M-003401–02). Scramble siRNA, which does not recognize any human mRNA, was purchased from Eurogentec (CAUGUCAUGUGUCACAUCUdTdT) and used as a negative control.RESULTSIGF-I-induced Activation of the pS2/TFF1 Gene Requires Both ERα and the AP1 Complex—IGF-I is an activator of estrogen-regulated genes in breast cancer cells (21Cavailles V. Garcia M. Rochefort H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It promotes chromatin remodeling at the promoter of the estrogen-regulated gene pS2/TFF1 (28Giamarchi C. Solanas M. Chailleux C. Augereau P. Vignon F. Rochefort H. Richard-Foy H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, its mechanism of action is not elucidated, and it is not known whether the architecture of the promoter is important for this activation. This gene has a complex promoter that contains one binding site for the ERE and one binding site for the AP1 complex (TRE) (Fig. 1A). We first determined the importance of these two transcription factors in IGF-I-induced activation of the pS2/TFF1 gene. As previously described (21Cavailles V. Garcia M. Rochefort H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in MCF7 cells, IGF-I alone induced transcriptional activation of the estrogen-regulated gene pS2/TFF1 (Fig. 1B). To assess the importance of ERα in this activation, we treated cells both with IGF-I and the pure antiestrogen Fulvestrant (ICI 182 780). When bound to Fulvestrant, ERα is rapidly degraded in the nucleus (35McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Callige M. Kieffer I. Richard-Foy H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4349-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and consequently never binds DNA (37Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Here we found that Fulvestrant blocked the IGF-I-induced transcription of pS2/TFF1 (Fig. 1B) confirming that ERα is necessary for IGF-I-induced transcription of this promoter (27Chalbos D. Philips A. Galtier F. Rochefort H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To go further in the role of ERα in IGF-I mediated activation of the pS2/TFF1 gene, we knocked down ERα using siRNAs directed against ERα mRNA. MCF7 cells were then stimulated by IGF-I or not for 24 h, and RNA was purified. The specificity of siRNA depletion was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 1C) and showed that siRNA directed against ERα mRNA caused a specific and dramatic decrease in ERα protein levels compared with scramble siRNA. The administration of ERα siRNA to MCF7 cells abolished the IGF-I-mediated activation of the pS2/TFF1 gene compared with cells electroporated by scramble siRNA (Fig. 1D). This result reinforces the results obtained with Fulvestrant and demonstrates that ERα is required for IGF-I-mediated activation of the pS2/TFF1 gene.To evaluate the importance of c-Jun and c-Fos for the pS2/TFF1 activation mediated by IGF-I, we knocked down the two proteins using siRNAs directed against c-Jun or c-Fos mRNA. They were administrated to MCF7 cells separately or in combination. Cells were then stimulated or not by IGF-I, and RNA was purified. The effect of siRNA depletion of c-Jun and c-Fos was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2A). SiRNA directed against c-Fos was able to specifically lower c-Fos protein levels, whereas siRNA directed against c-Jun lowered both c-Jun and c-Fos protein levels. Lowering the protein level of a transcription factor involved in the formation of heterodimers often induces a decrease in partner protein levels. Moreover in the case of the AP1 complex, c-Jun is able to homodimerize, preventing its degradation when c-Fos protein levels are lowered. c-Jun and c-Fos siRNA have a clear effect on pS2/TFF1 activation mediated by IGF-I (Fig. 2B), dramatically impairing its activation compared with cells electroporated with the scramble siRNA. Treatment of cells with both siRNAs also abolished IGF-I-mediated activation of the pS2/TFF1 gene. These results demonstrate that both ERα c-Jun and c-Fos are essential for IGF-I action and that in the cell the absence of one these proteins cannot be compensated by the presence of other members of their respective families.FIGURE 2Both c-Jun and c-Fos are necessary for IGF-I-induced pS2/TFF1 transcription activation. MCF7 cells were electroporated with the indicated siRNA, incubated for 48 h in phenol red-free and serum-free media, and treated 24 h or not by IGF-I. A, cells were lysed, and 100 μg of total cell extract was blotted with anti-c-Jun, anti-c-Fos, or anti-GAPDH antibodies. B, RNA was purified from the cells, and pS2/TFF1 mRNA levels were quantified by real time RT-PCR. Results are expressed as induction of RNA relative to the untreated cells. ++ represents a 20 μm final concentration of siRNA, and + represents a 10 μm concentration of siRNA. Results were normalized to actin mRNA expression levels.

To better understand the role of each of the two promoter elements (ERE and TRE) in this transcriptional activation, we used the MELN cell line that has been derived from MCF-7 cells and engineered to express the reporter gene luciferase under the control of a synthetic promoter containing only an ERE upstream of a minimal β-globin promoter (Fig. 3A). These cells were untreated or treated with estradiol and IGF-I alone or in combination, and induction of luciferase, GAPDH mRNA, and pS2/TFF1 mRNA were measured. Fig. 3B shows a robust induction of luciferase activity by estradiol, whereas IGF-I had no effect. The increase in GAPDH gene expression (a gene known to be induced by IGF-I (38Alexander M.C.

Here we report the development of an ES cell-based monitoring system for osteogenic differentiation, the identification of a potent combination of osteogenic genes using such a system, and an evaluation of its therapeutic potentials. ES cells were isolated from mice carrying a transgene expressing GFP driven by the 2.3 kb fragment of rat type I collagen alpha1 promoter. Using these cells engineered to fluoresce on osteogenic differentiation, we screened cDNA libraries and combinations of major osteogenesis-related genes. Among them, the combination of constitutively active activin receptor-like kinase 6 (caALK6) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was the minimal unit that induced fluorescence. The combination efficiently induced osteogenic differentiation in various cell types, including terminally differentiated nonosteogenic cells. The cooperative action of the combination occurred through protein stabilization of core binding factor beta (Cbfb), induction of Runx2-Cbfb complex formation, and its DNA binding. Furthermore, transplantation of a monolayer sheet of fibroblasts transduced with the combination achieved bone regeneration within 4 wk in mouse calvarial bone defects. Thus, we successfully identified the potent combination of genes for bone regeneration, which helped broaden cell sources."
https://openalex.org/W1965584194,"SspB is a dimeric adaptor protein that increases the rate at which ssrA-tagged substrates are degraded by tethering them to the ClpXP protease. Each SspB subunit consists of a folded domain that forms the dimer interface and a flexible C-terminal tail. Ternary delivery complexes are stabilized by three sets of tethering interactions. The C-terminal XB peptide of each SspB subunit binds ClpX, the body of SspB binds one part of the ssrA-tag sequence, and ClpX binds another part of the tag. To test the functional importance of these tethering interactions, we engineered monomeric SspB variants and dimeric variants with different length linkers between the SspB body and the XB peptide and employed substrates with degradation tags that bind ClpX weakly and/or contain extensions between the binding sites for SspB and ClpX. We find that monomeric SspB variants can enhance ClpXP degradation of a subset of substrates, that doubling the number of tethering interactions stimulates degradation via changes in Km and Vmax, and that major alterations in the length of the 48-residue SspB linker cause only small changes in the efficiency of substrate delivery. These results indicate that the properties of the degradation tag and the number of SspB·ClpX tethering interactions are the major factors that determine the extent to which the substrate and ClpX are engaged in ternary delivery complexes.

These substrates initially bind to a hexa-meric ring of ClpX, in which each subunit consists of a AAA+ ATPase domain and an N-terminal domain. Repetitive cycles of ATP hydrolysis in the ClpX ring then drive conformational changes that unfold the native substrate and translocate the unfolded polypeptide through a central pore and into the degradation chamber of ClpP, an associated double-ring peptidase (3Sauer R.T.

Proteins containing an ssrA tag are recognized and degraded by ClpXP alone, but degradation at low substrate concentrations occurs more rapidly in the presence of SspB (9Levchenko I. Seidel M.

Recent studies establish that proteins with modified ssrA tags ending in the sequence DAS instead of LAA are poor substrates for ClpXP unless SspB is present (17McGinness K.E. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 701-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In delivery complexes, ClpX and SspB can simultaneously contact the ssrA tag of a protein substrate (Ref. 14Bolon D.N. Grant R.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol.

Indeed, SspB lacking its tethering tails inhibits degradation, and extended tags containing extra residues between the sites that bind SspB and ClpX improve adaptor-mediated substrate degradation (10Wah D.A.

Although, these static interactions are critical for substrate delivery, dynamic interactions mediated by unstructured portions of SspB play an equally important role. For example, both flexible C-terminal tails of an SspB dimer normally tether the adaptor to ClpX. This bivalent interaction is functionally important, as a dimer with one full-length subunit and one subunit missing its C-terminal tail binds ClpX weakly and fails to enhance ClpXP degradation of ssrA-tagged proteins (11Bolon D.N. Wah D.A. Hersch G.L. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Monovalent tethering of SspB to ClpX via a single tail may result in binding that is too weak to overcome the proposed clash during substrate delivery, but other explanations for the importance of bivalency are also possible. For example, SspB variants with just one C-terminal tail might dissociate too quickly from ClpX to allow substrate delivery, or bivalent tethering might be required for proper orientation of the substrate for handoff to the enzyme. In SspB orthologs, the unstructured linkers that connect the substrate binding domain to the XB motif vary in length from 20 to 55 residues and show little sequence conservation. Although this distribution of natural linker lengths suggests significant tolerance, it is unclear if very short SspB linkers would still permit effective bivalent tethering or if longer linkers would keep the substrate and ClpX sufficiently close to allow efficient delivery. Here, we use mutant SspB adaptors and substrates bearing ssrA-like degradation tags with different properties to explore the importance of the number and type of tethering interactions in adaptor-mediated substrate delivery to ClpXP. We find that monomeric variants of SspB can enhance ClpXP degradation but only for substrates bearing extended degradation tags and with reduced efficiency compared with dimeric SspB. The efficiency of substrate delivery by dimeric SspB varies only modestly as a function of linker length, and SspB variants with almost no linker or with double-length linkers still function as efficient adaptors. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of substrate delivery by SspB and for general models of adaptor function are discussed. Construction of Mutant Variants—Variants of the ssrA tag and SspB used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1. Plasmids encoding GFP 5The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). bearing LAA (wild-type ssrA), LAA+4, DAS, or DAS+4 tags at their C terminus were generated by PCR amplification/mutagenesis of a gene encoding GFP-His6-ssrA (14Bolon D.N. Grant R.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) followed by ligation into pET11d. Monomeric SspB was generated by introducing eight different mutations (see below) into a plasmid-borne gene for E. coli SspB. Another monomeric SspB with an N-terminal His10 tag was constructed in pET24d for biophysical studies. The two-tailed SspB monomer was assembled in a modular fashion to contain the N-terminal sequence (M)GDDRGGRPALRVVK (the XB motif is in bold) followed by the sequence for residues 113-154 of E. coli SspB, a His6 tag, and the sequence for residues 1-165 of monomeric SspB. To facilitate construction, an NdeI site was present between the coding sequences for the His6 tag and monomeric SspB, and residues 112-113 of monomeric SspB were mutated from Asp-Thr to Gly-Ser to introduce a BamHI site. Individual DNA fragments were amplified by PCR and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and the final construct was ligated between the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET24d. The N-tailed SspB dimer was generated by digesting the pET24d plasmid encoding the two-tailed SspB monomer with NdeI and BamHI and inserting an NdeI-BamHI fragment encoding residues 1-112 of dimeric SspB followed by a stop codon. SspB tail-length variants were initially made as part of another study and were constructed in a background consisting of residues 1-106 of Hemophilus influenzae SspB Y44C followed by residues 108-165 of E. coli SspB (14Bolon D.N. Grant R.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The substrate binding domains of H. influenzae and E. coli SspB have similar sequences and the same three-dimensional fold (12Levchenko I. Grant R.A. Wah D.A. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 12: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, a hybrid consisting of the H. influenzae substrate binding domain and the unstructured E. coli tail is fully active (11Bolon D.N. Wah D.A. Hersch G.L. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Y44C mutation allows cross-linking of ssrA peptides to SspB but does not alter adaptor activity significantly (14Bolon D.N. Grant R.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Importantly, all activities of tail-length variants were compared with those of the otherwise isogenic parental molecule (designated SspBLL48, where 48 is the length of the unstructured linker region). Tail-length variants were generated by mutagenesis of the pET21b derivative encoding SspBLL48. Variants with shorter tails were generated by PCR amplification of the SspBLL48 plasmid with phosphorylated primers designed to delete the codons for residues 134-155 (SspBLL25) or residues 113-155 (SspBLL5) of the E. coli tail followed by ligation. To generate a variant with the longer tail of SspBLL91, a SacII site was introduced by silent mutation of the codons for residues 153 and 154 in the parent plasmid, the resulting plasmid was digested with SacII and HindIII, and a SacII-HindIII PCR fragment encoding residues 113-165 of the E. coli SspB tail was inserted by ligation. Plasmids encoding E. coli ClpX, E. coli ClpP-His6, and a His6-tagged variant of chimeric SspB with the H. influenzae substrate binding domain and the E. coli tail have been described (11Bolon D.N.

Plasmids encoding E. coli SspB and His6-tagged E. coli SspB were similar to those encoding the chimeric variants except for the source of the coding sequences. Protein Production—All GFP variants and untagged monomeric SspB were expressed in E. coli BB101 cells, a derivative of strain X90 (F′lacIq lac′ pro′/ara Δ(lac-pro) nalA argE(am) rif r thi-1) harboring the slyD::kan mutation and the λDE3 prophage (22Chivers P.T.

Radiolabeled GFP-DAS and GFP-DAS+4 were purified after growth in media containing [35S]Met as described (5Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y.N. Sauer R.T.

His10-monomeric-SspB was expressed in E. coli BLR cells (Novagen). For purification of all dimeric SspB variants except the N-tailed dimer, untagged proteins were coexpressed in BLR cells with a His6-tagged dimerization partner (E. coli His6-SspB for E. coli SspB variants; the H. influenzae-E. coli His6-SspB hybrid for linker-length variants) to facilitate purification. Heterodimers containing tagged and untagged subunits were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity, and the untagged proteins were eluted under denaturing conditions and refolded (14Bolon D.N. Grant R.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GFP variants, N-tailed SspB dimer, two-tailed SspB monomer, and His10-monomeric-SspB were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity. Untagged monomeric SspB was purified using a protocol similar to that described for wild-type SspB (9Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A.

Mayo S.L. Science. 1997; 278: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). In the design, these dimer-interface positions were restricted to Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, His, Lys, Ser, Thr, and Arg. Basic residues at position 8 and acidic residues at positions 19 and 22 were excluded to prevent unfavorable helical-dipole interactions (25Marshall S.A. Morgan C.S. Mayo S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ORBIT protein design program was used to optimize amino acid identity and geometry using an energy function based on the DREIDING force field that included a van der Waal's potential (atomic radii scaled by 0.9), a coulombic electrostatic potential with a dielectric constant of 7R, a geometric hydrogen-bond potential, and a statistical term to account for β propensity at position 101 (24Dahiyat B.I.

Mayo S.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The final design left Thr-101 unchanged and included eight mutations (L6R, R9E, Y12Q, L13K, A16E, F17K, W20E, D23K), which were introduced into the E. coli SspB coding sequence as described above. For denaturation studies, 3 μm His10-monomeric-SspB (in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6) was incubated with different concentrations of guanidine-HCl at 25 °C for 1 h or more before measuring the circular dichroism ellipticity at 222 nm. Analytical ultracentrifugation (Beckman XLA instrument; Ti-60 rotor; 20 °C; 16,000 rpm; 24 h equilibration) was performed using 80 μm His10-monomeric-SspB in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 150 mm potassium chloride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Binding of E. coli SspB and His10-monomeric-SspB to a fluorescein-labeled ssrA peptide was performed as described (14Bolon D.N. Grant R.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ClpXP Degradation—A series of increasing concentrations of GFP-ssrA and GFP-LAA+4 were degraded at 30 °C using 100 nm ClpX6 and 300 nm ClpP14 in PD buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.032% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) with an ATP regeneration system containing 4 mm ATP, 16 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.32 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase. When SspB or variants were present, the adaptor concentration in subunit equivalents was equal to the substrate concentration. The GFP substrate with or without SspB was incubated for 2 min at 30 °C as were ClpXP and the remaining reaction components. These mixtures were combined (60 μl total), and degradation rates were measured as a loss of GFP fluorescence. A series of increasing concentrations of 35S-labeled GFP-DAS and GFP-DAS+4 was degraded in a similar manner in a 100-μl reaction volume, and initial degradation rates were determined by the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides (20Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For all substrates, initial rates of degradation were plotted versus substrate concentration and fitted to the Hill equation (see “Results”). Competition for ClpX Binding—A fluorescein-SspB-ssrA molecule was assembled as described (29Hersch G.L. Burton R.E. Bolon D.N. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2005; 121: 1017-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by cross-linking an ssrA peptide with the A2C mutation to an SspB subunit containing the Y44C mutation in a chimeric H. influenzae-E. coli variant that forms an obligate heterodimer (11Bolon D.N. Wah D.A. Hersch G.L. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Binding of fluorescein-SspB-ssrA (250 nm) to ClpX (200 nm) at 30 °C was assayed in PD buffer plus 4 mm ATPγS with varying concentrations of each SspB variant as competitors. Fluorescence anisotropy values were measured for 2 min and averaged. SspB and Substrate Variants—To probe the mechanism by which SspB delivers ssrA-tagged proteins to ClpXP, we generated and purified monomeric and dimeric SspB mutants containing variations in the number, position, and/or length of the flexible SspB tails that allow tethering to ClpX. These SspB variants are shown schematically in Fig. 1B. For ClpXP degradation studies, we used GFP substrates bearing either a wild-type or mutant ssrA tag (Fig. 1C). In one variant, the C-terminal LAA of the wild-type ssrA tag was replaced with DAS. Extended tags with four residues inserted between the tag segment that binds SspB and the three C-terminal residues were also used (LAA+4 or DAS+4). DAS-tagged substrates are useful probes of SspB function because their degradation by ClpXP is almost completely SspB-dependent (17McGinness K.E. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 701-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In previous studies substrates bearing extended tags were found to be degraded more efficiently than the corresponding shorter-tag substrates when ClpXP and SspB were present (17McGinness K.E. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 701-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Hersch G.L. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12136-12141Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine kinetic parameters, rates of ClpXP degradation were determined at a series of substrate concentrations. For some substrates and SspB variants, the change in the degradation rate as a function of concentration showed positive cooperativity, suggesting that ternary adaptor-substrate-enzyme complexes assembled at concentrations where binary complexes were not significantly populated. To model this behavior, data were fit to a form of the Hill equation (rate = Vmax/(1 + (Km/[substrate])n)), where Vmax is the maximal velocity, Km is the substrate concentration required to achieve half-maximal velocity, and n is the Hill coefficient. Monomeric SspB Enhances Degradation of Substrates with Extended Tags—To create a monomeric variant of E. coli SspB, we mutated hydrophobic residues that normally form the dimer interface to charged and polar residues. The purified protein sedimented as a monomer in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (Fig. 2A), displayed cooperative guanidine-HCl denaturation (Fig. 2B), and bound to an ssrA peptide with a KD of 7 μm (Fig. 2C). Another variant contained monomeric SspB preceded by a flexible region of polypeptide with a second XB motif near the N terminus (Fig. 1B). We refer to this mutant, which contains N-terminal and C-terminal tails that allow tethering to ClpX, as the two-tailed monomer. A third mutant, called the N-tailed dimer, consisted of dimeric SspB with the N-terminal tail used in the two-tailed monomer but with no C-terminal tail (Fig. 1B). The ability of monomeric SspB to enhance ClpXP proteolysis depended on the nature of the degradation tag present on the GFP-reporter substrate. For example, monomeric SspB caused no significant change in ClpXP degradation of GFP-ssrA but increased the rate at which GFP-LAA+4 was degraded (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the monomeric adaptor failed to enhance degradation of GFP-DAS but stimulated degradation of GFP-DAS+4 (Fig. 3B). Thus, monomeric SspB enhanced degradation of substrates with extended tags but failed to stimulate degradation of substrates with normal-length tags. Monomeric SspB had different effects on the kinetics of ClpXP degradation of the two extended-tag substrates. For GFP-LAA+4, a good intrinsic substrate (18Hersch G.L. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12136-12141Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), monomeric SspB caused little change in Vmax and affected degradation principally by decreasing Km severalfold (Fig. 3C; Table 1). For GFP-DAS+4, a poor intrinsic ClpXP substrate (17McGinness K.E. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 701-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), monomeric SspB increased Vmax at least 2-fold and also decreased Km more than 10-fold (Fig. 3D; Table 1).

The latter validated previous mutagenesis studies performed on GDNF ligands and GFRα receptors (24Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Johnson E.M. Milbrandt J. J. Biol.

In addition, a model of the extracellular region of RET based on four consecutive cadherin-like domains has been reported (27Anders J. Kjær S. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35808-35817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but crystal structure data are still missing. The extracellular region of NCAM is composed of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and two fibronectin-like domains, and the crystal structure of the first three Ig domains has been reported (28Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J. Kiselyov V.V. Poulsen F.M. Larsen I.K. Welte W. Berezin V. Bock E. Kasper C. Structure. 2003; 11: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that NCAM, unlike RET, can interact directly with GDNF but that high affinity binding and downstream signaling requires co-expression with the GDNF co-receptor GFRα1 (12Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear whether the ability of NCAM to bind GDNF is related to its adhesive properties or mediated by a distinct and specific protein-protein interaction interface. In this study, we set out to delineate GDNF binding determinants in NCAM and characterize their requirement for NCAM-mediated cell adhesion. Domain boundaries in the rat NCAM140 cDNA (Entrez ID X06564) (29Small S.J. Shull G.E. Santoni M.J. Akeson R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2335-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were defined based on the exon-intron structure of the chicken Ncam gene (Entrez ID AH005321) (30Owens G.C. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The boundaries used for generation of Ncam deletion constructs were as follows (numbering refers to the mature protein, excluding the 19-residue signal peptide): domain 1, Leu1-Gln97; domain 2, Lys98-Val191; domain 3, Pro192-Ala288; domain 4, Lys289-Tyr396; domain 5, Ala397-Asp490; domain 6, Thr491-Arg591; domain 7, Glu592-Ala692. N-terminal deletion constructs were made by PCR, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), with a sense primer corresponding to the beginning of the first domain after the deletion and an antisense primer corresponding to the end of the full-length rat NCAM140 cDNA. The sense and antisense primers contained SfiI and NotI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR fragments were digested with SfiI and NotI (New England Biolabs) and ligated into a SfiI/NotI-digested pSecTag 2A Hygro vector (Invitrogen) modified with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag insertion between the secretion tag and the SfiI site. C-terminal deletions (from the C-terminal end of the extracellular region) were made by fusing two PCR fragments. One fragment was made using the full-length sense primer and the antisense primer corresponding to the end of the most C-terminal domain to be present in the final construct (e.g. the end of domain 3 in the Δ4–7 construct). The other fragment was made using a sense primer corresponding to the first extracellular juxtamembrane residues following domain 7, together with the full-length antisense primer. The full-length sense and antisense primers contained SfiI and NotI restriction sites, respectively. The two fragments were digested with SfiI or NotI, respectively, and ligated into the SfiI/NotI-digested vector. The ligation site between the two fragments was kept blunt-ended to avoid the introduction of any additional amino acids. Single domain deletions were made similarly to the C-terminal deletions, the difference being that the second fragment was different for all constructs, beginning with the domain immediately 3′ of the one to be deleted (e.g. for the Δ3 construct, the second fragment begins with domain 4). Single domains were made in the same way as the N-terminal-truncated constructs but with the appropriate C-terminal deletion construct as a template (e.g. Δ5–7 for the “domain 4 only” construct). As pSecTag already contains an efficient signal sequence, the endogenous NCAM signal sequence was excluded from all constructs. The quadruple mutant constructs were made with the “QuikChange Multi” mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using three primers simultaneously: one targeting both E236A and D242A, another for D250A, and a third for E272A. COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm plates were transfected with 15 μg of the appropriate DNA constructs with 2 μgof polyethyleneimine/μg of DNA. Two days after transfection, the plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with I125-labeled GDNF at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in binding buffer (PBS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml d-glucose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After cross-linking for 45 min with EDAC/NHS-S (Pierce), plates were quenched with 50 mm glycine and washed three times with PBS. To normalize GDNF binding to the levels of expression of different constructs at the cell surface, we performed selective immunoprecipitation of cell surface molecules in living cells. Following chemical cross-linking of I125-GDNF, cell monolayers were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-HA antibodies (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science) in binding buffer for 1 h. The plates were then washed six times with PBS and lysed with 0.75 ml of lysis buffer (PBS, 60 mm octyl-β-glucoside, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), and cells were collected with a cell lifter. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with shaking, lysates were spun for 10 min at 10,000 × g, gamma-bind protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cleared lysates, and the samples were incubated for 1 h with shaking. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times, run on 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Autoradiographs were scanned in a STORM 840 phosphorimager, and the membranes were subsequently immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies, developed with Enhanced Chemifluorescence (GE Healthcare), and scanned in a STORM 840. Quantifications were made using ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare). Jurkat cells were transfected in 12-well plates with NCAM constructs together with either green fluorescent protein or Ds-Red-encoding plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in 2 ml of complete medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. On the following day, 100 μl each of green fluorescent protein- and Ds-Red-transfected cells were combined and mixed with 100 μl of serum-free medium in 48-well plates. After 48 h of incubation, green cells, red cells, and cell aggregates were quantified under green and red fluorescence illumination on a motorized Axiovert 200 microscope controlled by OpenLab software (Improvision). Cell adhesion was expressed as the percentage of green cells present in clusters that also contained red cells. Docking—Structures used in molecular simulations were taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with codes 1QZ1 for domains 1–3 of NCAM (28Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J.

Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Domain 3 of NCAM was docked to GDNF using Molsoft ICM-Pro 3.2 (Molsoft LLC, La Jolla, CA) with soft potentials, where van der Waals forces have a cut-off value to allow for side chain movements. The resulting complex was subsequently refined by energy minimizations to remove clashes. Multiple docking calculations were started from 27 evenly distributed positions around GDNF. No limitations, constraints, or biases were invoked on where the two proteins should dock. All dockings consistently yielded the same binding conformation, with the best binding energy of -64.2 kcal/mol. For comparison, NCAM domains 1 and 2 were also docked to GDNF. Docking of domain 1 got significantly worse binding energy (5.2 kcal/mol reduction) compared with domain 3 and was therefore classified as a non-binder. On the other hand, docking of domain 2 resulted in a smaller difference (1.9 kcal/mol reduction) in binding energy compared with domain 3. However, this interaction would cause major clashes between GDNF and the remainder of the NCAM molecule, as the C-terminal end of NCAM domain 2 would directly extend right through the middle of the GDNF dimer. Thus, the docking calculations clearly showed that the best binding was to domain 3, in agreement with our experimental results. We also made a docking calculation of the NCAM domain 3 with the four mutated residues changed to alanines, resulting in a decrease of binding energy of 4.7 kcal/mol. In this analysis, the ranking is important, because the calculated binding energies are only relative. The ranking clearly shows much better binding of domain 3 compared with the mutated domain 3 or domain 1. The coordinates of the docking of NCAM domain 3 and GDNF can be found as a PDB file in the supplemental material available on-line. Complex Formation—GFRα1 has been shown to bind to the distal poles of the GDNF dimer (25Eketjäll S. Fainzilber M. Murray-Rust J. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5901-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a homologous complex between GFRα3 and Artemin has been solved recently (23Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (PDB code 2GH0). This complex was used to guide the superposition of GFRα1 onto the GDNF·NCAM complex in order to get a first approximation of the possible architecture of a tripartite complex. The GFRα3 structure (with 44% residue identity to GFRα1) was used as a template for calculating a homology model of GFRα1 using ICM-Pro. The structures of GDNF and Artemin monomers are very similar (root mean square deviation 2.4 Å for the core region, 37% sequence identity) and therefore easily superimposable. However, at the intersubunit interface there are slightly different bending angles. The positioning of GFRα1 in relation to GDNF was obtained by first superimposing the GFRα3·Artemin complex individually onto each GDNF subunit; thereafter, the GFRα1 was superimposed onto GFRα3. In the resulting complex we have not optimized the interface between GFRα1 and GDNF because we only use it as a general estimation of the complex architecture, i.e. to judge whether our model of the NCAM-GDNF interaction is compatible with a tripartite complex. GDNF binding sites in NCAM were investigated by assessing the binding activities of a large collection of NCAM deletion mutants. Four series of NCAM constructs were made carrying (i) progressively larger deletions from the N terminus, (ii) progressively larger deletions from the C-terminal end of the extracellular region, (iii) single domains deleted, or (iv) single domains on their own, all containing the native transmembrane and intracellular domains of the p140NCAM isoform (Fig. 1, A–D). As each domain of the NCAM extracellular region is encoded by two consecutive exons in the Ncam gene (30Owens G.C. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we used the exon-intron structure to define domain boundaries (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Following equilibrium binding of 125I-GDNF and chemical cross-linking, NCAM molecules present at the cell surface were selectively immunoprecipitated from their N-terminal HA tag, fractionated by SDS/PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography and HA immunoblotting. Analysis of the N-terminal deletion series revealed a major reduction in GDNF binding after deletion of the third Ig domain (Fig. 1A). The importance of this domain for GDNF binding was also apparent from the binding activities of the C-terminal deletion series, in which only constructs containing this domain were capable of binding ligand (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, constructs lacking Ig domains 4 or 5 (i.e. Δ5–7 and Δ4–7) displayed increased GDNF binding compared with the full-length molecule (Fig. 1B). The bulk of glycosylation sites are present in these domains (31Albach C. Damoc E. Denzinger T. Schachner M. Przybylski M. Schmitz B. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2004; 378: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Liedtke S. Geyer H. Wuhrer M. Geyer R. Frank G. Gerardy-Schahn R. Zahringer U. Schachner M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that NCAM glycosylation negatively affects GDNF binding. The requirement of individual domains for ligand binding was further investigated by deleting single domains from the NCAM molecule. Only deletion of the third domain affected the ability of NCAM to bind GDNF, indicating its requirement for ligand binding (Fig. 1C). Deletion of either domains 4 or 5 again increased GDNF binding, indicating a negative effect of these heavily glycosylated domains on ligand interaction. Finally, the sufficiency of individual NCAM domains for GDNF binding was assessed using constructs carrying single domains as the sole extracellular region of the molecule (Fig. 1D). Domain 3 was found to bind GDNF very well on its own, whereas other domains bound weakly or not at all. Together, the results from our deletion analyses show that the third Ig domain of NCAM is both necessary and sufficient for GDNF binding and therefore represents the principal ligand binding determinant in this receptor. Using the crystal structures of GDNF (21Eigenbrot C. Gerber N. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and NCAM domain 3 (28Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J. Kiselyov V.V. Poulsen F.M. Larsen I.K. Welte W. Berezin V. Bock E. Kasper C. Structure. 2003; 11: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we modeled the interaction between the two molecules with the molecular modeling program ICM-Pro 3.2. An unbiased docking calculation was obtained by starting from 27 different, evenly distributed positions around the GDNF molecule, thus sampling all possible interaction sites. Six of these yielded the highest ranking docking conformations, as judged by their calculated binding energies, all of which placed NCAM domain 3 on the cleft between the two protomers of the GDNF dimer (Fig. 2A), and involved identical residues in the contact of the two molecules. The interface is dominated by electrostatic interactions, with four residue pairs having distances between 2.9 and 3.5 Å, Arg40, Lys82, and Arg131 from the first GDNF protomer and Lys126 from the second, pairing with Asp250, Glu272, Asp242, and Glu236, respectively, from NCAM domain 3 (Fig. 2B). Mutation of these four acidic residues in the ligand binding interface of NCAM domain 3 to alanine abolished the ability of this domain to bind GDNF in cross-linking assays (Fig. 2C). When introduced in the full-length NCAM molecule, the quadruple mutation (qm) reduced GDNF binding to background levels, phenocopying the effects of deletion of domain 3 (Fig. 2C). In addition to bringing experimental support to our model of the GDNF·NCAM complex, these results identify four specific residues within the 665-residue-long NCAM extracellular domain that are specifically required for its ability to interact with GDNF. Most models of NCAM homophilic interaction agree on the requirement of domain 3 for efficient NCAM-mediated cell adhesion (28Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J. Kiselyov V.V. Poulsen F.M. Larsen I.K. Welte W. Berezin V. Bock E. Kasper C. Structure. 2003; 11: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Atkins A.R. Gallin W.J. Owens G.C. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49633-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Perrin-Tricaud C. Rutishauser U.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41037-41046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of mutations that disrupt GDNF binding on the ability of NCAM to mediate homophilic cell-cell interactions. Cells grown in suspension were transfected with different NCAM constructs along with expression plasmids for either green or red fluorescent proteins and tested for their ability to form mixed aggregates containing green and red cells. Whereas full-length NCAM readily induced the formation of cell aggregates in this assay, deletion of domain 3 diminished the ability of the molecule to promote cell adhesion by ∼50% (Fig. 3). Domain 3 on its own displayed no adhesive properties in this assay (data not shown). In contrast, the quadruple point mutant of NCAM retained wild type levels of cell adhesion (Fig. 2D), indicating that the four residues that are critical for GDNF binding are not involved in NCAM homophilic interactions. More generally, this result demonstrates that the two NCAM activities can be genetically dissociated and provides the opportunity to test their in vivo relevance through, for example, the generation of mice carrying the Ncamqm allele. Because of the 2-fold symmetry of the GDNF dimer, we asked whether the GDNF·NCAM interface we identified may allow the formation of NCAM dimers bound to the same GDNF molecule. Two NCAM molecules (i.e. domains 1–3) could be arranged around a GDNF dimer, each binding to symmetrically related interfaces on opposite sides (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this configuration was almost identical to the one previously proposed for cis-interacting NCAM dimers based on the crystal structure of domains 1–3 (28Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J. Kiselyov V.V. Poulsen F.M. Larsen I.K. Welte W. Berezin V. Bock E. Kasper C. Structure. 2003; 11: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (compare with Fig. 2A from Ref. 28Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J. Kiselyov V.V. Poulsen F.M. Larsen I.K. Welte W. Berezin V. Bock E. Kasper C. Structure. 2003; 11: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may represent a bona fide conformation for GDNF binding. We then asked whether our model of the GDNF·NCAM complex was compatible with the association of GFRα1 to GDNF. Previous structure-function studies have localized the GFRα1 binding site to the two poles of the elongated GDNF dimer (25Eketjäll S. Fainzilber M. Murray-Rust J. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5901-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), away from the NCAM binding interface, a notion that has recently been confirmed by the crystal structure of the GDNF homolog Artemin in complex with the ligand binding domain of its cognate GFRα3 receptor (23Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using the coordinates of that complex, we modeled the interaction between GDNF and the ligand binding fragment of GFRα1. Based on this model, two GFRα1 molecules, one at each end of the GDNF dimer, could be positioned onto the GDNF·NCAM model to form a 2:2:2 complex containing the three proteins (Fig. 4, A and B). Although GFRα1 and NCAM are known to interact with each other (12Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), no such interaction can be observed in the model, suggesting that it may be mediated by other domains in the NCAM molecule. It should be noted that this model would place the C termini of the GDNF binding domains of GFRα1 and NCAM in opposite directions, leaving open the possible orientation of this complex relative to the plasma membrane. Importantly, however, the topologies of full-length GFRα1 and NCAM are unlikely to be straight rods perpendicular to the plasma membrane. Thus, although it has been suggested that the C terminus of the ligand binding domain of GFRα3 points toward the membrane (23Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), both N and C termini in this domain are on the same side of the structure, where an additional 150-residue-long N-terminal domain still needs to be accommodated. In the case of NCAM, earlier electron microscopy studies have indicated a heavily kinked conformation of its extracellular domain (36Becker J.W. Erickson H.P. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Hall A.K. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To obtain evidence for the existence of a tripartite complex between GDNF, NCAM, and GFRα1, we performed chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies in cells transfected with expression constructs carrying HA-tagged NCAM and Myc-tagged GFRα1. Following 125I-GDNF binding and cross-linking, several complexes could be recovered after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies (thus containing NCAM) that could be visualized by autoradiography (thus containing GDNF) and that also reacted with anti-Myc antibodies (thus containing GFRα1) (Fig. 5). For example, a complex containing one molecule each of GDNF, NCAM, and GFRα1 (labeled 1N/1α1 in Fig. 5) could be specifically detected after NCAM immunoprecipitation and only in cells that received both NCAM and GFRα1 (Fig. 5). Moreover, complexes corresponding to the size of the tripartite 2:2:2 complex modeled in Fig. 4, A and B, could also be detected (Fig. 5, 2N/2α1). Because of multiple NCAM cis and trans interactions, this complex run at the same molecular weight as that of three NCAM molecules cross-linked together (Fig. 5, 3N). In conclusion, we have identified a localized and specific binding determinant in NCAM that is crucial for its interaction with GDNF, dispelling a role for the adhesive or otherwise “sticky” properties of NCAM in GDNF binding. We have also demonstrated that ligand binding and cell adhesion can be genetically dissociated and provided the first insights into the molecular architecture of a multicomponent GDNF receptor.

The WRN protein localizes to nucleoli and the nucleoplasm of transcriptionally active cells (1Balajee A.S. Machwe A. May A. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Martin G.M. Nehlin J.O. Brosh R. Orren D.K. Bohr V.A.

The yeast WRN homologue, SGS1, also participates in DNA replication and RNA pol I-dependent transcription (4Lee S.K. Johnson R.E. Yu S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S.

In the present study, we have investigated whether WRN contributes to HIV-1 LTR transactivation and retroviral replication. The HIV-1 LTR contains upstream enhancer elements (e.g. NF-κB and SP1) that synergize with the transactivator protein, Tat, bound to TAR-RNA, to promote retroviral gene expression in HIV-1-infected tissues, macrophages/monocytes, and CD4+ T-lymphocytes (6Harrich D.

To induce high level HIV-1 replication and the production of infectious viral particles, HIV-1-infected H9HIV-1IIIB lymphocytes were stimulated with 50 units/ml recombinant human interleukin-2 (hIL-2; Invitrogen) and phytohemagglutinin (10 ng/ml, Sigma) for 72–96 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 7 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and layered upon a 70% sucrose, Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, cushion.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—3 × 106 HeLa cells or WRN-/- WS fibroblasts were co-transfected with an episomal HIV-1 LTR-luciferase (pCV745) plasmid and RSV-HIV-1 Tat using Superfect reagent (Qiagen). CMV-WRNK577M was co-transfected in certain experiments to inhibit the endogenous WRN helicase (41Moser M.J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Jacob J.E. Bennett S.E. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J.

Immunostaining and Laser Confocal Microscopy—Co-localization between HIV-1 Tat and WRN proteins was visualized by performing immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy on post-mortem central nervous system tissue samples (thalamus and basal ganglia) from five donor NeuroAIDS patients (7674, 7996, 11406, 13689, and 14433) with primary HIV-1 encephalopathies and one uninfected control brain (30206). Nonspecific antigens were blocked by incubating slides in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then immunostained using rabbit polyclonal anti-HIV-1 Tat (Advanced Bioscience Laboratories) and goat polyclonal anti-WRN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies diluted 1:2000 in BLOTTO buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Samples were washed 2 times for 10 min with BLOTTO buffer and then incubated with rhodamine red-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Laser confocal microscopy and three-dimensional Z-stack composite images were generated using a Nikon TE2000-U inverted microscope/C1 confocal system equipped with dual helium-neon lasers. HIV-1 p24Gag protein expression was visualized in PHA/hIL-2-stimulated HIV-1-infected H9HIV-1IIIB lymphocytes by immunostaining with a mouse monoclonal anti-HIV-1 p24Gag primary antibody (Advanced Bioscience Laboratories) and rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories). WS Fibroblasts, lacking a functional wrn gene, are impaired for HIV-1 LTR transactivation. To determine whether WRN contributes to HIV-1 LTR transactivation, immortalized human WRN-/- WS fibroblasts derived from a Werner syndrome patient (41Moser M.J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Jacob J.E. Bennett S.E. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells were co-transfected with an HIV-1 LTR-luciferase (firefly) reporter plasmid in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of HIV-1 Tat or a transcriptionally inactive Tat mutant, TatK28A/K50A (20Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 21Wong K.

A tk-Renilla luciferase construct was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiencies or differences in general transcriptional levels (1Balajee A.S. Machwe A. May A. Gray M.D. Oshima J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2655-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) between WRN-/- WS fibroblasts and HeLa, which contain endogenous WRN. Significant basal HIV-1 LTR-dependent transcription was measured in HeLa cells, whereas WRN-/- WS fibroblasts exhibited reduced LTR-dependent transcription (Fig. 1B). Tat activated the HIV-1 LTR approximately 20-fold in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, human WRN-/- WS fibroblasts were severely impaired for Tat-activated HIV-1 LTR-dependent transcription (Fig. 1B). Results from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1B. The WRN helicase has been shown to exist in multimeric protein complexes (43Huang S. Beresten S. Li B. Oshima J. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and the dominant-negative helicase-minus mutant, WRNK577M, interferes with endogenous WRN functions (42Bai Y. Murnane J.P. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we co-transfected HeLa cells with CMV-WRNK577M, together with HIV-1 LTR-luciferase and RSV-HIV-1 Tat, to determine whether trans inhibition of WRN might block Tat-dependent LTR transactivation. Results in Fig. 1B demonstrate that increasing CMV-WRNK577M inhibited Tat-dependent HIV-1 LTR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. We next co-transfected immortalized human WRN-/- WS fibroblasts with HIV-1 LTR-luciferase and RSV-HIV-1 Tat in the presence of increasing CMV-wild type-WRN or a pcDNA3.1-GFP control. As the WRN-/- WS fibroblasts express a proteolytically unstable, truncated WRN mutant protein, it was necessary to treat cultures with a cell-permeable 20 S proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (10 μm), to stabilize the ectopically expressed wild type WRN (Myc-tagged) protein. CMV-wild type-WRN alone weakly transactivated the HIV-1 LTR (approximately 5-fold) in the absence of Tat (Fig. 1C). Increasing CMV-wild type-WRN significantly restored Tat-dependent LTR transactivation (Fig. 1C). The expression of HIV-1 Tat and WRN (Myc-tagged) proteins was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these findings indicate that WRN helicase functions are essential for HIV-1 transcription and retroviral replication. The WRN helicase cooperates with Tat to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR. We next tested the effects of overexpressing wild type WRN upon basal and Tat-activated HIV-1 LTR-dependent transcription by co-transfecting HuT-78 lymphocytes and HeLa cells with HIV-1 LTR-luciferase and RSV-HIV-1 Tat in the absence or presence of CMV-wild type-WRN, CMV-WRNK577M, or CβS vector control. Tat transactivated the HIV-1 LTR approximately 70-fold in HuT-78 cells (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of wild type WRN alone transactivated the HIV-1 LTR approximately 14-fold (Fig. 2A). Increasing amounts of CMV-wild type-WRN also resulted in higher Tat-dependent LTR transactivation (compare 70-fold for Tat alone to 217-fold for wild type WRN + Tat). By contrast, the helicase-minus WRNK577M mutant inhibited Tat-dependent LTR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. The CβS control did not affect Tat-dependent LTR transactivation (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). CMV-wild type-WRN alone transactivated the HIV-1 LTR approximately 6-fold, whereas the WRNK577M mutant repressed basal LTR-dependent transcription (Fig. 2B). Increasing amounts of CMV-wild type-WRN resulted in increased Tat-dependent LTR transactivation (compare 37-fold for Tat alone to 72-fold for wild type WRN + Tat). The helicase-minus WRNK577M mutant markedly inhibited Tat-dependent LTR transactivation (from 37- to approximately 3-fold). The CβS vector did not affect Tat-dependent LTR transactivation (Fig. 2B). Neither overexpression of wild type WRN nor WRNK577M altered HIV-1 Tat protein expression (Fig. 2C). Another related DNA helicase, BLM-associated with Bloom syndrome (44Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D.

We then investigated whether the effects of WRN upon HIV-1 transcription require the TAR element and Tat/TAR-RNA interactions. Tat binds to a uracil-containing trinucleotide bulge within TAR-RNA and stimulates transcriptional elongation by recruiting cellular factors (e.g. P-TEFb) to the HIV-1 LTR (see diagram, Fig. 2E) (30Bres V.
