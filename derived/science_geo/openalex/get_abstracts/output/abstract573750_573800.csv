https://openalex.org/W2552041992,"Despite the accepted health benefits of consuming dietary fiber, little is known about the mechanisms by which fiber deprivation impacts the gut microbiota and alters disease risk. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model, in which animals were colonized with a synthetic human gut microbiota composed of fully sequenced commensal bacteria, we elucidated the functional interactions between dietary fiber, the gut microbiota, and the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a primary defense against enteric pathogens. We show that during chronic or intermittent dietary fiber deficiency, the gut microbiota resorts to host-secreted mucus glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier. Dietary fiber deprivation, together with a fiber-deprived, mucus-eroding microbiota, promotes greater epithelial access and lethal colitis by the mucosal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Our work reveals intricate pathways linking diet, the gut microbiome, and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which could be exploited to improve health using dietary therapeutics."

We performed a genome-wide association analysis in the UK Biobank and INTERVAL studies, testing 29.5 million genetic variants for association with 36 red cell, white cell, and platelet properties in 173,480 European-ancestry participants. This effort yielded hundreds of low frequency (<5%) and rare (<1%) variants with a strong impact on blood cell phenotypes. Our data highlight general properties of the allelic architecture of complex traits, including the proportion of the heritable component of each blood trait explained by the polygenic signal across different genome regulatory domains. Finally, through Mendelian randomization, we provide evidence of shared genetic pathways linking blood cell indices with complex pathologies, including autoimmune diseases, schizophrenia, and coronary heart disease and evidence suggesting previously reported population associations between blood cell indices and cardiovascular disease may be non-causal.

Modern genetic analysis has transformed our understanding of the contribution of inherited variation to complex human disease. Over the last decade, the widespread application of large-scale genome-wide association studies based on sparse genotyping arrays has led to a dramatic increase in the number of known disease-associated genetic variants (Hindorff et al., 2009Hindorff L.A. Sethupathy P. Junkins H.A. Ramos E.M. Mehta J.P. Collins F.S. Manolio T.A. Potential etiologic and functional implications of genome-wide association loci for human diseases and traits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9362-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (3052) Google Scholar). The development of clinically useful applications of these discoveries, such as disease prediction algorithms, identification of etiological mechanisms (Ferreira et al., 2013Ferreira R.C.

Inhibition of PCSK9 as a novel strategy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.Drug News Perspect. 2008; 21: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) has lagged behind. This is due partly to the characteristics of the disease-associated variants, which are predominantly common (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≥5%), which tend to be associated with small differences in disease risk and which often lie in regulatory regions of the genome, hindering the identification of causal alleles, genes, and disease mechanisms. Examples of low-frequency (MAF = 1%–5%) and rare variant (MAF <1%) associations are beginning to emerge from the application of massively parallel whole genome and exome sequencing to human populations (Polfus et al., 2016Polfus L.M. Khajuria R.K. Schick U.M. Pankratz N. Pazoki R. Brody J.A. Chen M.-H. Auer P.L. Floyd J.S. Huang J. et al.Whole-exome sequencing identifies loci associated with blood cell traits and reveals a role for alternative GFI1B splice variants in human hematopoiesis.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 99: 481-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Associated rare variants tend to be easier to link to genes as they map predominantly in or near coding regions and have fewer correlated variants. Furthermore, they can have larger phenotypic effect sizes and are more likely to act through interpretable mechanisms such as disruption of protein function. These features also enhance their clinical and scientific usefulness. For instance, rare loss of function alleles can be used to assess the likely consequences of modulating a pathway pharmacologically to prevent disease (Plenge et al., 2013Plenge R.M. Scolnick E.M. Altshuler D. Validating therapeutic targets through human genetics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). However, very large studies are required for power to detect rare variant associations and consequently the sequencing approach is still relatively limited by cost. Genotype imputation of large population cohorts (i.e., the systematic genome-wide statistical inference of unmeasured genotypes using exogenous reference panels of sequenced individuals) (Howie et al., 2011Howie B. Marchini J. Stephens M. Genotype imputation with thousands of genomes.G3 (Bethesda). 2011; 1: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) is fast becoming a viable strategy to explore rare and low-frequency variant associations. Increasingly large whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reference panels are being created. Larger panels include rare alleles from more variants and better capture the between-variant correlation structure of study populations (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015Auton A.

Here, we exploit the recent improvements in the quality of imputation to carry out association analyses of rare and low-frequency genetic variants with 36 different blood cell indices. Blood cells make essential contributions to oxygen transport, hemostasis, and innate and acquired immune responses (Jenne et al., 2013Jenne C.N. Urrutia R. Kubes P.

Profumo E. Riganò R. Crosstalk between red blood cells and the immune system and its impact on atherosclerosis.BioMed Res. Int. 2015; 2015: 616834Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of blood cell formation, and of their physiological and functional properties, have been associated with predisposition to cancer and with many severe congenital disorders including anemias, bleeding, and thrombotic disorders and immunodeficiencies (Routes et al., 2014Routes J.

Furthermore, variations in the properties of many blood-cell subtypes have been associated with a wide variety of systemic diseases. However, the causal relationships between blood indices and disease risks are unclear and this hinders their potential value for informing new treatments. We report over 2,500 variants independently associated with variation in the 36 indices. We examine the genetic architecture of the associated variants and use them to reveal causal relationships with autoimmune, cardiovascular, and psychiatric diseases. Overall, this study expands the repertoire of genes and regulatory mechanisms governing hematopoietic development in humans and opens potential avenues for targeting key pathways involved in abnormal or dysregulated hematopoiesis. To identify genetic variants associated with 36 blood cell indices with increased resolution and statistical power, we studied a total of 173,480 European ancestry individuals from three large-scale UK studies—INTERVAL (Moore et al., 2014Moore C.

We tested univariate associations of 36 indices with 29.5 million imputed variants passing quality control filters (MAF >0.01%, Figure S3) and used stepwise multiple regression to identify a parsimonious subset of genetic variants explaining the genome-wide significant (p value < 8.31 × 10−9) associations for each trait (Xu et al., 2014Xu C. Tachmazidou I. Walter K. Ciampi A. Zeggini E. Greenwood C.M. UK10K ConsortiumEstimating genome-wide significance for whole-genome sequencing studies.Genet. Epidemiol. 2014; 38: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (STAR Methods). We identified 6,736 conditionally independent index-variant associations and clustered these variants into 2,706 high linkage disequilibrium (LD) groups each represented by a sentinel variant (between-sentinel pairwise LD r2 < 0.8) (Figure 2; Tables S3 and S4). We confirmed the accurate imputation of variants at the rare end of the allelic spectrum by genotype comparisons with high read-depth (>50×) whole exome sequencing data from overlapping individuals, which showed 92.95% concordance and 94.97% precision for rare alleles (STAR Methods). Of the sentinel variants, 283 were correlated (r2 ≥ 0.8) with previously reported variants (Table S5), validating most blood trait associations reported in populations of European ancestry (Gieger et al., 2011Gieger C.

Sentinel variants are colored green if their associations (or associations with their proxies) have been previously reported and are colored red otherwise. See also Table S3. The sentinel variants included an unprecedented number of low-frequency (n = 210) and rare (n = 130) alleles (Figure 3A). The genetic associations were almost completely cell-type-specific (Figure 3B), with 900 sentinels (33%) associated exclusively with red blood cell traits, 1,040 (38%) exclusively with white cell traits, and 570 (21%) exclusively with platelet traits. Only five common variants (at ZFP36L2/THADA, SH2B3, HBS1L, PRTFDC1, and GCKR) were associated with traits across all six trait classes defined in Table S1. To evaluate the representation of classes of genetic variants across the allele frequency spectrum, we annotated variants with their most severe consequence on GENCODE transcripts using VEP (McLaren et al., 2016McLaren W. Gil L. Hunt S.E. Riat H.S. Ritchie G.R.S. Thormann A. Flicek P. Cunningham F. The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 122Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar). Variants predicted to have severe consequences (missense, frameshift, stop gained, start lost variants; Table S4) were highly enriched in the rare and low-frequency ranges, consistent with observations from large-scale sequencing projects (UK10K Consortium et al., 2015Walter K. Min J.L. Huang J. Crooks L. Memari Y. McCarthy S. Perry J.R. Xu C. Futema M. et al.UK10K ConsortiumThe UK10K project identifies rare variants in health and disease.Nature. 2015; 526: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and negative selection against variants affecting protein function (Figure 3C). Phenotypic effect sizes (the absolute additive change in trait mean measured in SD per allele) decreased with decreasing severity of the variant consequence (p = 2.2 × 10−16, Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend in absolute value of effect size with VEP impact; Figure 3D). For instance, missense changes were overrepresented in the rare frequency range (p = 9.8 × 10−29, Pearson’s χ2 test) and displayed larger absolute effect sizes compared to non-missense variants (median 0.063 SD versus 0.035 SD, p = 2.5 × 10−16, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test). There were also significant differences in median phenotypic effect sizes between variants mapping to five distinct regulatory states inferred from genome segmentations based on six histone marks in matched cells. Variants mapping to enhancer and promoter regions had larger median effect sizes than those mapping to other regulatory classes (Figure 3E).

https://openalex.org/W2553838260,"Long-range interactions between regulatory elements and gene promoters play key roles in transcriptional regulation. The vast majority of interactions are uncharted, constituting a major missing link in understanding genome control. Here, we use promoter capture Hi-C to identify interacting regions of 31,253 promoters in 17 human primary hematopoietic cell types. We show that promoter interactions are highly cell type specific and enriched for links between active promoters and epigenetically marked enhancers. Promoter interactomes reflect lineage relationships of the hematopoietic tree, consistent with dynamic remodeling of nuclear architecture during differentiation. Interacting regions are enriched in genetic variants linked with altered expression of genes they contact, highlighting their functional role. We exploit this rich resource to connect non-coding disease variants to putative target promoters, prioritizing thousands of disease-candidate genes and implicating disease pathways. Our results demonstrate the power of primary cell promoter interactomes to reveal insights into genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying common diseases."

We carried out high-resolution genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling in three major human immune cell types (CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ neutrophils, and naive CD4+ T cells) from up to 197 individuals. We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci. This expansive, high-resolution atlas of multi-omics changes yields insights into cell-type-specific correlation between diverse genomic inputs, more generalizable correlations between these inputs, and defines molecular events that may underpin complex disease risk.

We carried out high-resolution genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling in three major human immune cell types (CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ neutrophils, and naive CD4+ T cells) from up to 197 individuals. We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci. This expansive, high-resolution atlas of multi-omics changes yields insights into cell-type-specific correlation between diverse genomic inputs, more generalizable correlations between these inputs, and defines molecular events that may underpin complex disease risk. Many human complex diseases are characterized by dysregulation of immune and inflammatory activity. However, the repertoire of immune genes and cell subsets implicated in the pathogenesis of individual disease can vary dramatically. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed to expanding catalogs of implicated genes and pathways for many complex human diseases (Hindorff et al., 2009Hindorff L.A. Sethupathy P. Junkins H.A. Ramos E.M. Mehta J.P. Collins F.S. Manolio T.A. Potential etiologic and functional implications of genome-wide association loci for human diseases and traits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9362-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar) and are beginning to shed light on shared and unique etiological and pathological components of disease (Farh et al., 2015Farh K.K.

A key challenge is that these disease variants map predominantly to noncoding regions of the human genome, where they are predicted to alter regulatory function (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.Nature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3614) Google Scholar). Linking susceptibility variants to their respective causative genes and cell-specific regulatory elements thus remains a main priority in order to realize the potential of association studies to advance understanding of disease biology and etiology, leading to therapeutic advances. Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies testing for associations between genetic variants and intermediate phenotypes, in particular gene expression levels, provide powerful approaches to annotate the putative consequence of disease associations (Montgomery and Dermitzakis, 2011Montgomery S.B. Dermitzakis E.T. From expression QTLs to personalized transcriptomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The biological resolution of this approach can be further increased using two main strategies. First, genetic effects on gene expression have been shown to be often context-specific (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z.

Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.Nature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3614) Google Scholar) and thus are better captured in studies probing multiple primary cell types or experimental conditions (Bentham et al., 2015Bentham J. Morris D.L. Cunninghame Graham D.S. Pinder C.L. Tombleson P. Behrens T.W. Martín J. Fairfax B.P. Knight J.C.

Second, extending these analyses beyond gene expression to other molecular phenotypes such as variable histone modification or methylation status can greatly enhance the functional and mechanistic interpretation of genetic associations (Allum et al., 2015Allum F. Shao X. Guénard F. Simon M.M. Busche S. Caron M. Lambourne J. Lessard J. Tandre K.

Commun. 2015; 6: 7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent studies in cell line models have demonstrated the occurrence of a high degree of local coordination between transcriptional and epigenetic states and suggested that a fraction of disease-associated genetic variants may alter expression levels through changes in chromatin state (Grubert et al., 2015Grubert F. Zaugg J.B. Kasowski M. Ursu O. Spacek D.V. Martin A.R. Greenside P. Srivas R. Phanstiel D.H.

Extending these integrated investigations to primary human cells in disease-relevant contexts is the necessary next step to unravel the cell- and context-specific regulatory effects of complex disease variants. Here, we report an integrated analysis of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic datasets in the three major cells of the human immune system, namely CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ neutrophils, and CD4+ naive T cells. Monocytes contribute to maintenance of the resident macrophage pool under steady-state conditions and migrate to sites of infection in the tissues and divide/differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells to elicit an immune response. Neutrophil granulocytes (neutrophils) are primary blood cells of the innate immune and inflammatory response system that form a first line of organismal response to bacterial and fungal infection, migrating within minutes to sites of infection, attracted by local tissue factors and resident macrophages during the acute phase of inflammation. Finally, CD4+ naive T cells are part of the adaptive immune response system, representing mature helper T cells that have not yet encountered their cognate antigen. We generated high-resolution whole-genome sequence, transcriptome, DNA methylation, and histone modification datasets in up to 197 individuals selected from a population-based sample and applied variance decomposition, QTL, and allelic imbalance analyses to investigate genetic and epigenetic influences to transcription and RNA splicing in the three primary immune cells. We demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs with 345 unique genetic variants predisposing to seven human autoimmune diseases, involving all data layers. Overall, the data and results deepen our understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of the transcriptional machinery in three primary cells of the immune system and inform the formulation and testing of functional hypotheses for human complex disease. As part of the BLUEPRINT epigenome project, we recruited an initial set of 200 blood donors from a local blood donor population, ascertained to be free of disease and representative of the United Kingdom (UK) population at large (54% females, mean age 55 years) (Figure 1; Table S1). We used a multi-step purification strategy (Figure S1) to isolate, for each donor, cell subsets corresponding to classical monocytes (CD14+CD16−) and neutrophils (CD66b+CD16+). Subsequently, through a collaboration with Epigenome Mapping Centre at McGill University, we were able to extend the study to a third cell type (“phenotypically naive” CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, henceforth referred to as CD4+ T cells or T cells for simplicity) for 169 out of the 200 donors.Figure S1Sample Collection, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Morphological assessment of purified cell preparations.

For each individual, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (mean read depth, approximately 7×) (Figure S2; Table S1) and probed the transcriptional profiles (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq] at ∼80 million reads per sample) (Figure S3), genome-wide DNA methylation (Illumina 450K arrays) (Figure S2), and two histone modification marks for active and poised enhancers and active promoters (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChiP-seq] at ≥30 million reads per sample) (Figure S4). Molecular assays for monocytes and neutrophils were distributed across four laboratories, and assays on T cells were done at McGill (Figure S1). We carefully assessed and adjusted for possible sequencing artifacts that may arise due to differences in protocols between centers, applying stringent quality filters where needed. We confirmed that our approach avoided significant effects by profiling a subset of the same individuals across each respective center (“cross-over experiments”) (Figures S1, S2, S3, and S4; Table S2). Overall, the project generated 116,310 million QC-pass reads across all datasets, with 80% of donors passing ten or more assays and 56 donors having complete data across all cell types and molecular assays (Table S1).Figure S3RNA-Seq Distribution and Batch Correction, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) PCA before and after batch correction using ComBat in gene level.

Matched genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression profiles from multiple donors in this study provides a unique opportunity to characterize the relationship between hierarchies of gene regulation and how these regulatory links ultimately affect human phenotypic variation. Detailed understanding of this relationship is necessary for the correct interpretation of the contribution of epigenetic variation to organismal traits and disease. We first sought to quantify the relative impact of genetic and epigenetic factors to transcriptional variance. Associations between epigenetic and RNA traits may arise from two potential causes: (1) local epigenetic changes that correlate with RNA level but themselves are due to DNA sequence variation (Figure 2A), and (2) epigenetic changes that are correlated with RNA level and not associated with cis genetic variation. To quantify the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to transcriptional variance, we fit variance decomposition models (Lippert et al., 2014Lippert C. Casale F.P. Rakitsch B. Stegle O. LIMIX: genetic analysis of multiple traits.bioRxiv. 2014; https://doi.org/10.1101/003905Crossref Google Scholar, Casale et al., 2015Casale F.P. Rakitsch B. Lippert C. Stegle O.

DNA methylation and histone modifications explained lower proportion of transcriptome variance in models where epigenetic elements were adjusted for proximal genetic effects compared to the corresponding unadjusted models in all cell types (Figures 2B, S5A, and S5B), suggesting that genetic effects are the main determinant of transcriptome variance.Figure S5Variance Decomposition Analyses, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Figures showing analogous results as those presented in Figure 2B; however, for neutrophils and naive CD4+ T cells.(C–F) Variance partitioning results obtained from the joint model across all four molecular layers in monocytes.

(K) Comparison of the proportion of variance explained by different molecular layers across cell types when either considering a 100Kb or a 1Mb cis window (see the STAR Methods). We next fit a joint model that considers all four molecular layers (genetic, methylation, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac). Globally, the proportion of expression variance explained by epigenetic effects (average 3.2% for H3K4me1, 3.1% for H3K27ac, and 1.9% for methylation in monocytes) was small compared to genetic effects (average 13.9% in monocytes) (Figures S5C–S5F). Estimates of the overall contribution of DNA methylation is conservative in this analysis, because methylation sites are incompletely ascertained in the Illumina 450k array (representing ∼2% of all annotated CpGs, for 99% of RefSeq genes at mainly promoters and genic enhancers). When testing for significance of the variance components in this model, we identified 2,451, 2,213, and 441 genes with significant epigenetic component (false discovery rate [FDR] <5%) in monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells, respectively, of which 1,092, 940, and 258 genes had no significant genetic effect (Figures 2C–2E, S5G, and S5H; FDR <5%). These results indicate that some local epigenetic associations with RNA cannot be explained by shared genetic effects due to common variants. These genes were implicated in key functions in innate and acquired immunity and inflammation. As examples, genes of the inflammasome pathway were strongly enriched in neutrophils (p = 2 × 10−6; Table S3). Inflammasomes are innate immune system complexes that regulate the activation of caspase-1 and the proinflammatory IL-1 family of cytokines. This process is induced by detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) culminating in the induction of inflammation in response to infectious microbes and molecules derived from host damage. Inflammasomes have also been implicated in a range of inflammatory processes and disorders. In monocytes, we detected epigenetic influences for genes within a number of key signaling pathways involved in the immune cell function, including the Tec kinase and eicosanoid signaling pathway, the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), CXCL8, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) signaling pathways (Melcher et al., 2008Melcher M. Unger B. Schmidt U. Rajantie I.A. Alitalo K. Ellmeier W. Essential roles for the Tec family kinases Tec and Btk in M-CSF receptor signaling pathways that regulate macrophage survival.J.

Allergy Immunol. 2004; 134: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Table S3). These findings suggest that function related to pathogen response may be primed and controlled at least in part through epigenetic rather than genetic mechanisms. Finally, estimated variance components of individual genes were correlated across cell types, most significantly for genetic factors, but also for pure epigenetic variance contributions (Figure S5I). The large prevalence of epigenome-transcriptome associations that can be attributed to shared genetic effects may have important implications for interpretation of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). To explore this possibility, we next considered gene expression measured from RNA sequencing experiments as a proxy for organismal and disease phenotype. We then carried out a conventional EWAS analysis testing for association between epigenetic traits (within 1 Mb of the gene) and gene expression without accounting for cis-"
https://openalex.org/W2556702335,"Innate immune memory is the phenomenon whereby innate immune cells such as monocytes or macrophages undergo functional reprogramming after exposure to microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We apply an integrated epigenomic approach to characterize the molecular events involved in LPS-induced tolerance in a time-dependent manner. Mechanistically, LPS-treated monocytes fail to accumulate active histone marks at promoter and enhancers of genes in the lipid metabolism and phagocytic pathways. Transcriptional inactivity in response to a second LPS exposure in tolerized macrophages is accompanied by failure to deposit active histone marks at promoters of tolerized genes. In contrast, β-glucan partially reverses the LPS-induced tolerance in vitro. Importantly, ex vivo β-glucan treatment of monocytes from volunteers with experimental endotoxemia re-instates their capacity for cytokine production. Tolerance is reversed at the level of distal element histone modification and transcriptional reactivation of otherwise unresponsive genes. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2549513265,"The association of histone modification changes with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not been systematically examined. We conducted a histone acetylome-wide association study (HAWAS) by performing H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on 257 postmortem samples from ASD and matched control brains. Despite etiological heterogeneity, ≥68% of syndromic and idiopathic ASD cases shared a common acetylome signature at >5,000 cis-regulatory elements in prefrontal and temporal cortex. Similarly, multiple genes associated with rare genetic mutations in ASD showed common “epimutations.” Acetylome aberrations in ASD were not attributable to genetic differentiation at cis-SNPs and highlighted genes involved in synaptic transmission, ion transport, epilepsy, behavioral abnormality, chemokinesis, histone deacetylation, and immunity. By correlating histone acetylation with genotype, we discovered >2,000 histone acetylation quantitative trait loci (haQTLs) in human brain regions, including four candidate causal variants for psychiatric diseases. Due to the relative stability of histone modifications postmortem, we anticipate that the HAWAS approach will be applicable to multiple diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2555009198,"Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are implicated in tumor neovascularization, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance. To illuminate mechanisms governing these hallmark features, we developed a de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model derived from immortalized human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) to enable precise system-level comparisons of pre-malignant and oncogene-induced malignant states of NSCs. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence. Thus, the PAX6/DLX5-WNT5A axis governs the diffuse spread of glioma cells throughout the brain parenchyma, contributing to the lethality of GBM."

The resulting dataset identified characteristic differences between HSCs derived from fetal liver, cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. We also observed lineage-specific DNA methylation between myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, characterized immature multi-lymphoid progenitors, and detected progressive DNA methylation differences in maturing megakaryocytes. We linked these patterns to gene expression, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility, and we used machine learning to derive a model of human hematopoietic differentiation directly from DNA methylation data. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and provide a framework for studying blood-linked diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2550080559,"Aged skin heals wounds poorly, increasing susceptibility to infections. Restoring homeostasis after wounding requires the coordinated actions of epidermal and immune cells. Here we find that both intrinsic defects and communication with immune cells are impaired in aged keratinocytes, diminishing their efficiency in restoring the skin barrier after wounding. At the wound-edge, aged keratinocytes display reduced proliferation and migration. They also exhibit a dampened ability to transcriptionally activate epithelial-immune crosstalk regulators, including a failure to properly activate/maintain dendritic epithelial T cells (DETCs), which promote re-epithelialization following injury. Probing mechanism, we find that aged keratinocytes near the wound edge don't efficiently upregulate Skints or activate STAT3. Notably, when epidermal Stat3, Skints, or DETCs are silenced in young skin, re-epithelialization following wounding is perturbed. These findings underscore epithelial-immune crosstalk perturbations in general, and Skints in particular, as critical mediators in the age-related decline in wound-repair."

We present structures of the mammalian ribosome engaged with decoding factor⋅GTPase complexes representing intermediates of translation elongation (aminoacyl-tRNA⋅eEF1A), termination (eRF1⋅eRF3), and ribosome rescue (Pelota⋅Hbs1l). Comparative analyses reveal that each decoding factor exploits the plasticity of the ribosomal decoding center to differentially remodel ribosomal proteins and rRNA. This leads to varying degrees of large-scale ribosome movements and implies distinct mechanisms for communicating information from the decoding center to each GTPase. Additional structural snapshots of the translation termination pathway reveal the conformational changes that choreograph the accommodation of decoding factors into the peptidyl transferase center. Our results provide a structural framework for how different states of the mammalian ribosome are selectively recognized by the appropriate decoding factor⋅GTPase complex to ensure translational fidelity. In eukaryotes, accurate protein synthesis relies on a family of translational GTPases that pair with specific decoding factors to decipher the mRNA code on ribosomes. We present structures of the mammalian ribosome engaged with decoding factor⋅GTPase complexes representing intermediates of translation elongation (aminoacyl-tRNA⋅eEF1A), termination (eRF1⋅eRF3), and ribosome rescue (Pelota⋅Hbs1l). Comparative analyses reveal that each decoding factor exploits the plasticity of the ribosomal decoding center to differentially remodel ribosomal proteins and rRNA. This leads to varying degrees of large-scale ribosome movements and implies distinct mechanisms for communicating information from the decoding center to each GTPase. Additional structural snapshots of the translation termination pathway reveal the conformational changes that choreograph the accommodation of decoding factors into the peptidyl transferase center. Our results provide a structural framework for how different states of the mammalian ribosome are selectively recognized by the appropriate decoding factor⋅GTPase complex to ensure translational fidelity. Successful protein synthesis by ribosomes requires amino acids to be incorporated correctly during polypeptide elongation, translation to terminate at precise points, and quality control pathways to be engaged when translation is interrupted (Dever and Green, 2012Dever T.E. Green R. The elongation, termination, and recycling phases of translation in eukaryotes.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a013706Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, each of these events is mediated by specific factors (collectively termed as decoding factors in this study) that are delivered to the A site of the ribosome by a specialized member of a subfamily of translational GTPases. Members of this GTPase subfamily are structurally homologous but have non-redundant functions (Dever and Green, 2012Dever T.E. Green R. The elongation, termination, and recycling phases of translation in eukaryotes.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a013706Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar): eEF1A delivers aminoacyl (aa)-tRNAs to sense codons; eRF3 delivers eRF1 to stop codons; and Hbs1l delivers Pelota (Dom34 in yeast) to stalled ribosomes. After delivery, the specificity of each decoding factor is inspected at the ribosomal decoding center before being accepted into the catalytic peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the ribosome. Acceptance of each decoding factor by the ribosome has distinct and irreversible consequences: amino acid addition by aa-tRNA, translation termination by eRF1, and the initiation of mRNA and protein quality-control pathways by Pelota. Therefore, accurate decoding of the transcriptome and maintenance of protein homeostasis relies on decoding factor⋅GTPase complexes recognizing the appropriate ribosome-mRNA complex. Our mechanistic understanding of decoding derives primarily from functional and structural studies of sense codon recognition by aa-tRNAs and the bacterial eEF1A homolog, EF-Tu (Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013Voorhees R.M. Ramakrishnan V. Structural basis of the translational elongation cycle.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The accuracy of accepting the correct aa-tRNA is enhanced by a two-step mechanism that exploits the interactions at the decoding center twice. GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu irreversibly separates an initial selection step from a secondary kinetic proofreading step (Blanchard et al., 2004Blanchard S.C. Gonzalez R.L. Kim H.D. Chu S. Puglisi J.D. tRNA selection and kinetic proofreading in translation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). During initial selection, aa-tRNA in complex with EF-Tu⋅GTP samples ribosomes in a configuration in which the aminoacyl group of the aa-tRNA is held by EF-Tu to prevent premature engagement with the PTC (Schmeing et al., 2009Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C. Gao Y.-G.G. Murphy 4th, F.V. Weir J.R. Ramakrishnan V. The crystal structure of the ribosome bound to EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA.Science. 2009; 326: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cognate interactions between aa-tRNA and mRNA at the ribosomal decoding center are communicated to EF-Tu to activate GTP hydrolysis (Pape et al., 1998Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V.

Ramakrishnan V. Selection of tRNA by the ribosome requires a transition from an open to a closed form.Cell. 2002; 111: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), which ultimately leads to the dissociation of EF-Tu⋅GDP from the ribosomal complex (Schmeing et al., 2009Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C. Gao Y.-G.G. Murphy 4th, F.V. Weir J.R. Ramakrishnan V. The crystal structure of the ribosome bound to EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA.Science. 2009; 326: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This frees the aa-tRNA to “accommodate” into the ribosomal PTC, a rate-limiting step that relies on the stability of the codon-anticodon interactions at the ribosomal decoding center (Pape et al., 1998Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Complete kinetic mechanism of elongation factor Tu-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the E. coli ribosome.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Important differences from the paradigm established by aa-tRNA⋅EF-Tu probably exist for eukaryotic decoding factor⋅translational GTPase complexes to account for higher translation accuracy (Kramer et al., 2010Kramer E.B.

Biochemical studies and moderate-resolution structures of several eukaryotic decoding complexes have revealed insights into conserved and distinct features of eukaryotic decoding complexes (Becker et al., 2011Becker T.

However, the molecular interactions that accompany initial selection, communicate information from the decoding center to each GTPase, and mediate decoding factor accommodation in each case remain incompletely understood. Using high-resolution electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), we analyze the molecular basis of specificity at the decoding center for each mammalian decoding factor⋅translational GTPase complex, compare potential GTPase activation mechanisms, and describe the conformational changes governing the accommodation of decoding factors. These results provide new insights into how these related complexes are able to make discriminatory interactions to recognize the appropriate ribosome-mRNA substrates to maintain overall translational fidelity. Translational decoding complexes (here defined as the elongation complex, 80S⋅aa-tRNA⋅eEF1A; the termination complex, 80S⋅eRF1⋅eRF3; and the rescue complex, 80S⋅Pelota⋅Hbs1l) are transient states that either rapidly dissociate or progress to an accommodated state upon codon recognition. We therefore developed methods to trap or assemble these complexes (Figure S1 and STAR Methods). To prepare the elongation complex, ongoing in vitro translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysate of an N-terminally tagged protein were inhibited by the elongation inhibitor didemnin B (Rinehart et al., 1981Rinehart Jr., K.L. Gloer J.B. Hughes Jr., R.G. Renis H.E. McGovren J.P. Swynenberg E.B. Stringfellow D.A. Kuentzel S.L. Li L.H. Didemnins: Antiviral and antitumor depsipeptides from a caribbean tunicate.Science. 1981; 212: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and the ribosome-nascent chains (RNCs) were affinity purified via the partially synthesized nascent polypeptide. To generate the termination complex, we programmed and affinity purified RNCs with a UGA stop codon in the A site that were reconstituted with eRF1, eRF3, and the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMPPCP. Rescue complexes were prepared similarly to produce RNCs containing an empty A site (generated with a truncated mRNA), or an A site occupied by either a stop codon or an AAA codon within a polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail, that were reconstituted with Pelota, Hbs1l, and GMPPCP. The structure of each complex was solved by cryo-EM to between 3.3 and 3.8 Å resolution (Figure S2; Tables S1 and S2).Figure S2Quality of Cryo-EM Maps and Models, Related to Figure 1Show full captionThe EM map for each isolated RNC complex is shown colored according to individual factors (top row) or by local resolution (second row).

Each complex represents an unrotated ribosome containing canonical P- and E-site tRNAs (Figures 1, 2, 3, and S2). The GTPase (G) domain and domains 2 and 3 of each GTPase (Figure S3A) were well resolved, while the highly divergent N-terminal extensions of Hbs1l and eRF3 were not visualized, presumably due to their flexibility. Each decoding factor (Figure S3B) assumes a pre-accommodated conformation: the tRNA acceptor arm or the homologous M-C domains of eRF1 or Pelota interacts with the GTPase, and the tRNA anticodon stem loop or structurally distinct N domain of eRF1 or Pelota occupies the decoding center (Figures 1, 2, and 3).Figure 2Structure of the Mammalian Termination ComplexShow full caption(A) Overview of the termination complex assembled with eRF1 (purple) and eRF3 (orange).(B) Decoding center of the termination complex.(C) EM map density (contoured at 6σ) and model showing interactions of the mRNA containing the UGA stop codon (slate) with rRNA elements of the decoding center (yellow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Structure of the Mammalian Rescue ComplexShow full caption(A) Overview of the rescue complex assembled with Pelota (pink) and Hbs1l (brown).(B) Decoding center of the rescue complex.(C) Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the β3′-β4′ loop of Pelota (pink) and 18S rRNA nucleotides (yellow).(D and E) Density corresponding to mRNA in the (D) termination or (E) rescue complexes both assembled on the same (NC-stop) mRNA stalled with the UGA stop codon in the A site.

The locations of the loop harboring the catalytic GGQ motif (blue) and the minidomain (mini) in eRF1 are indicated. As the ribosomes in the elongation complex (Figure 1A) are stalled at different codons by didemnin B, the density for the mRNA, aa-tRNAs, and the nascent chain are averages of the species captured. Despite this, the density at the decoding center is well defined, revealing that decoding in eukaryotes shares many features with that in bacteria (Ogle et al., 2001Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Recognition of cognate transfer RNA by the 30S ribosomal subunit.Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In particular, the decoding nucleotides A1824 and A1825 (A1492 and A1493 in bacteria) are flipped out of helix 44 (h44) of 18S rRNA. Together with G626 (G530 in bacteria) in the anti-conformation, these bases inspect the geometry of the minor groove of the codon-anticodon helix (Figure 1B) and help stabilize the A-site tRNA via hydrogen bonding. These interactions monitor Watson-Crick base-pairing at the first two codon positions (+1 and +2) while providing tolerance at the +3 wobble position. As in bacteria (Ogle et al., 2001Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Recognition of cognate transfer RNA by the 30S ribosomal subunit.Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), the ribosomal protein uS12 projects a loop into the decoding center (Figures 1C and S4A). Gln61 (Lys44 in E. coli) at the apex of the loop indirectly hydrogen bonds with A1824 in its flipped-out position and with the +2 nucleotide. Pro62 adopts a conserved cis-peptide conformation (Noeske et al., 2015Noeske J. Wasserman M.R. Terry D.S. Altman R.B. Blanchard S.C. Cate J.H.D. High-resolution structure of the Escherichia coli ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) that allows its backbone carbonyl to form a water- or metal-mediated hydrogen bond with the +3 nucleotide (Figures 1C and S4A). Additional hydrogen bonds may be introduced by environmental condition-dependent hydroxylation of Pro62 (Loenarz et al., 2014Loenarz C. Sekirnik R. Thalhammer A. Ge W. Spivakovsky E. Mackeen M.M. McDonough M.A. Cockman M.E. Kessler B.M. Ratcliffe P.J. et al.Hydroxylation of the eukaryotic ribosomal decoding center affects translational accuracy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 4019-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Noeske et al., 2015Noeske J. Wasserman M.R. Terry D.S. Altman R.B. Blanchard S.C. Cate J.H.D. High-resolution structure of the Escherichia coli ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Notably, these hydrogen bonds are only with the mRNA backbone, allowing for wobble base-pairing at the +3 position. Relative to bacterial decoding, the eukaryotic-specific ribosomal protein eS30 may enhance the stability of a correct codon-anticodon interaction. In the presence of a cognate aa-tRNA, the N terminus of eS30 becomes ordered, allowing a conserved histidine (His76) to reach into a groove between the phosphate backbone of the anticodon +1 position and the two flipped-out decoding bases to form potentially stabilizing contacts (Figures 1B and 1D). Because this groove depends on the flipped nucleotides that accompany canonical codon-anticodon base-pairing, this interaction may preferentially stabilize cognate tRNAs to enhance discrimination. The A- and P-site tRNAs also appear to stabilize 15 residues at the C terminus of uS19 that interacts with the phosphate backbone of the P-site tRNA and may make electrostatic interactions with the A-site tRNA (Figure 1E). Similar tRNA-dependent transitions in ribosomal proteins are observed in bacteria, with the C terminus of uS13 instead of uS19 threading between the anticodon stem loops of the A- and P-site tRNAs in bacteria (Jenner et al., 2010Jenner L.B. Demeshkina N. Yusupova G. Yusupov M. Structural aspects of messenger RNA reading frame maintenance by the ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Deletion of the uS13 C terminus in bacteria is associated with a reduced rate of translation and less efficient tRNA selection (Faxén et al., 1994Faxén M. Walles-Granberg A. Isaksson L.A. Antisuppression by a mutation in rpsM(S13) giving a shortened ribosomal protein S13.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, the contacts formed by uS19, and especially by eS30, which is dependent on a cognate aa-tRNA, could increase the stability of aa-tRNAs during initial selection and accommodation, thereby reducing erroneous ejection of cognate aa-tRNAs during kinetic proofreading. Unlike translation elongation, the factors and mechanisms mediating translation termination are not conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Dever and Green, 2012Dever T.E. Green R. The elongation, termination, and recycling phases of translation in eukaryotes.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a013706Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This includes the mechanism of stop codon recognition, as well as the role of termination-associated GTPases. Recent cryo-EM structures have revealed how accommodated eRF1 interacts with stop codons (Brown et al., 2015bBrown A. Shao S. Murray J. Hegde R.S. Ramakrishnan V.

Beckmann R. Structure of a human translation termination complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 8615-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of stop codon recognition during the initial eRF1⋅eRF3 interaction with 80S ribosomes was unclear, as earlier structures had only visualized this complex at moderate resolution (Taylor et al., 2012Taylor D. Unbehaun A. Li W. Das S. Lei J. Liao H.Y. Grassucci R.A. Pestova T.V. Frank J. Cryo-EM structure of the mammalian eukaryotic release factor eRF1-eRF3-associated termination complex.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 2015; 57: 422-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To address this problem, programmed RNCs with a UGA stop codon in the A site were used to isolate three intermediate states along the canonical termination pathway: (1) delivery of eRF1 to the stop codon by eRF3; (2) accommodated eRF1; and (3) accommodated eRF1 after ABCE1 recruitment (Figures 2A, S1, S2, and S4B–S4D) (Brown et al., 2015bBrown A. Shao S. Murray J. Hegde R.S. Ramakrishnan V. Structural basis for stop codon recognition in eukaryotes.Nature. 2015; 524: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The structures show that the stop codon maintains the same compacted geometry and interactions with the eRF1 N domain (Brown et al., 2015bBrown A. Shao S. Murray J. Hegde R.S. Ramakrishnan V. Structural basis for stop codon recognition in eukaryotes.Nature. 2015; 524: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Matheisl et al., 2015Matheisl S. Berninghausen O. Becker T. Beckmann R. Structure of a human translation termination complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 8615-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) throughout the termination pathway (Figures 2B and S4B–S4D), despite large rearrangements of the M and C domains of eRF1 (see below). In this configuration, the +2 and +3 stop codon bases stack with a flipped-out A1825, and the base following the stop codon (+4) stacks with G626 in the anti-conformation (Figures 2B, 2C, and S4E) (Brown et al., 2015bBrown A.

Beckmann R. Structure of a human translation termination complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 8615-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Improved density for the mRNA further reveals that the +5 base can stack with nucleotide C1698 of 18S rRNA, which protrudes into the mRNA channel (Figures 2B and 2C). The increased stability imparted by this additional stacking interaction explains why a +5 purine can increase the effectiveness of a “weak” stop codon with a +4 pyrimidine (McCaughan et al., 1995McCaughan K.K. Brown C.M. Dalphin M.E. Berry M.J. Tate W.P. Translational termination efficiency in mammals is influenced by the base following the stop codon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5431-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pelota has been reported to bind stalled ribosomes with an empty A site as well as those with an mRNA-occupied A site without sequence preference (Shoemaker et al., 2010Shoemaker C.J. Eyler D.E. Green R. Dom34:Hbs1 promotes subunit dissociation and peptidyl-tRNA drop-off to initiate no-go decay.Science. 2010; 330: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To determine the basis for this sequence-independent engagement by the rescue complex, we utilized our reconstitution method to assemble 80S⋅Pelota⋅Hbs1l complexes with an A site that lacked mRNA (assembled on a truncated mRNA), or that contained either the UGA stop codon or the AAA sense codon (due to translation stalling within a poly(A) tail) (Figures 3A, S1, and S2). The complex assembled on a truncated mRNA shows that the β3′-β4′ loop of Pelota extends from the N domain to protrude into the empty mRNA channel, following the path normally taken by mRNA (Figures 3B and S4F). A similar path is taken by the shorter β3′-β4′ loop of yeast Dom34 as observed at moderate resolution (Becker et al., 2011Becker T. Armache J.-P. Jarasch A. Anger A.M. Villa E. Sieber H. Motaal B.A. Mielke T. Berninghausen O. Beckmann R. Structure of the no-go mRNA decay complex Dom34-Hbs1 bound to a stalled 80S ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the higher-resolution information in our map allows the details of this interaction to be analyzed. The highly conserved residue (Arg45) at the top of the β3′-β4′ loop appears to play an anchoring role in the complex. Arg45 can hydrogen bond with His100, which is part of a conserved (Y/F/H)HT sequence on β6′ that int"
https://openalex.org/W2556871197,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a polyspecific ATP-dependent transporter linked to multidrug resistance in cancer; it plays important roles in determining the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. Understanding the structural basis of P-gp, substrate polyspecificity has been hampered by its intrinsic flexibility, which is facilitated by a 75-residue linker that connects the two halves of P-gp. Here we constructed a mutant murine P-gp with a shortened linker to facilitate structural determination. Despite dramatic reduction in rhodamine 123 and calcein-AM transport, the linker-shortened mutant P-gp possesses basal ATPase activity and binds ATP only in its N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain. Nine independently determined structures of wild type, the linker mutant, and a methylated P-gp at up to 3.3 A resolution display significant movements of individual transmembrane domain helices, which correlated with the opening and closing motion of the two halves of P-gp. The open-and-close motion alters the surface topology of P-gp within the drug-binding pocket, providing a mechanistic explanation for the polyspecificity of P-gp in substrate interactions."

Further, single-cell transplant data have been coupled with single-cell gene expression analysis on different cells to resolve subpopulations with corresponding gene expression and repopulation potential (Wilson et al., 2015Wilson N.K.

Overlaying in vivo functional behavior of endogenous HSC clones with their gene expression and epigenetic characteristics represents a key unresolved challenge. The coupling of function with gene expression and chromatin state at clonal resolution is important for defining what governs stem cells; particularly for defining if HSC function is bounded by cell-autonomous epigenetic constraints. To test whether divergent HSC behaviors could be defined at a clonal level under homeostatic conditions and whether these behaviors were epigenetically determined, we created a multi-fluorescent mouse model that enables both molecular profiling and functional tracking of live cells in vivo. We took advantage of the fluorescent tagging system first developed for clonal lineage tracking in the nervous system to generate a transgenic animal bearing fluorescence protein encoding genes that could be recombined to provide a range of distinct colors (Livet et al., 2007Livet J. Weissman T.A. Kang H. Draft R.W. Lu J. Bennis R.A. Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Transgenic strategies for combinatorial expression of fluorescent proteins in the nervous system.Nature. 2007; 450: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). We created a new mouse strain (termed “HUe”) in which the fluorescent tags were driven by a ubiquitously expressed chicken actin promoter with intervening stop sequences flanked by LoxP sites followed by a fluorescent cassette containing GFP, EYFP, tDimer2, and Cerulean intercalated by multiple LoxP pairs (Figure 1A) to enable Cre-induced stochastic recombination and expression. The design is very similar to the independently created “Confetti” mouse (Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G. Sato T. van Es J.H. van den Born M. Kroon-Veenboer C. Barker N. Klein A.M. van Rheenen J. Simons B.D. Clevers H. Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.Cell. 2010; 143: 134-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) with the distinction that the HUe mouse has ∼20 tandemly integrated cassettes enabling a wider range (theoretically >103) of possible colors generated by random combinations, in analogy to the color range generated by a television screen using three basic color hues (red, blue, green). We crossed HUe with various promoter-driven Cres to demonstrate marking in mesenchymal or hematopoietic tissue (Figures 1C–1F). To examine the efficiency of HUe in marking hematopoietic cells, we crossed the HUe mouse with the interferon-inducible Mx1-Cre strain (Kühn et al., 1995Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) (herein Mx1-Cre;HUe). We did not observe background fluorescence in the absence of Cre including in transplantation-mediated stress settings (data not shown). We activated endogenous hematopoietic cell labeling by administering polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIpC) into Mx1-Cre;HUe mice and evaluated mice after an interval (>30 days) when the effects of interferon induction have been long shown to subside (Essers et al., 2009Essers M.A. Offner S. Blanco-Bose W.E. Waibler Z. Kalinke U. Duchosal M.A. Trumpp A. IFNalpha activates dormant haematopoietic stem cells in vivo.Nature. 2009; 458: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Intra-vital imaging in live animals showed labeling of cells in the calvarial bone marrow (Figure 1E). These cells can be harvested from the bone marrow, stained with hematopoietic cell surface markers (Table S1), isolated by flow cytometry, and re-visualized by fluorescent microscopy (Figures 1F and 1G). We confirmed HUe fluorescence fidelity upon 12 days of cell division and differentiation by single cell colony assay in vitro (Figure S1A) and transplantation in vivo (Figures S1B and S1C). Clusters of cells exhibiting distinct color signatures were apparent in the setting of Mx1-Cre-activated HUe mice (Figure 1G). To evaluate whether such clusters represented cell clones, we transplanted single LT-HSCs of distinct colors into 214 lethally irradiated recipients to define the boundaries of clonal populations by flow cytometry (Figure S1C). At 30 weeks post-transplant, the fluorescent positive population in blood and bone marrow was evaluated. We then used similar gates to isolate cells from the bone marrow of activated Mx1-Cre;HUe mice. Single clusters of cells with immunophenotypic signature of granulocyte monocyte progenitor (GMP) were sorted and transplanted into sublethally irradiated mice. Spleens were harvested at day 11 and DNA fingerprinting performed (Figure S2), demonstrating clonal signatures distinctive for each cluster. Clusters of cells with the same color, therefore, likely represent clonal descendants. However, overlapping boundaries can hamper our ability to distinguish individual clones. To minimize that issue, our analyses only involved animals with up to 15 color clones and used statistical treatment that did not require explicit partitioning of clones (Figure S3).Figure S3Quantification of Hematopoietic Clonal Changes under Homeostatic Conditions—Mouse #8, 5 to 10 Months Old, Related to Figures 2, 4, 5, and 7Show full caption(A) A Mx1-Cre;HUe mouse was induced for endogenous HUe fluorescence with pIpC at one month old.

We used Mx1-Cre;HUe mice to examine the clonal dynamics of native hematopoiesis. Sixteen Mx1-Cre;HUe mice were injected with pIpC to induce endogenous labeling of hematopoietic cells. Bone marrow aspirates were collected at 2, 3, 5, and 10 months of age and subjected to flow cytometry to quantify the total number of existing HUe fluorescent clones and the size of each clone (Figure 2; “Statistical Analysis” in the STAR Methods). Results revealed that the hematopoietic tissue is composed of both persistent and fluctuating clones. We identified 5–11 clones per mouse with >15 cells throughout the 10-month chase period in a total of 16 animals (Figure 2). The clones had uneven, near-exponential distribution in size, with 1-4 large clones accounting for 80% of all cells in each animal (Figure S4A). Although clonal changes between month 2 and 3 were more pronounced, clonal dynamics were relatively consistent from month 3 to month 10 (Figures 2 and S4B). All animals showed one to four clones that was found at month 2 and persisted until month 10. Among the clones that persisted, some were stable in size, while others fluctuated over time. Ten out of 16 mice had one to three clones identified at month 2 but disappeared at month 10. Twelve animals showed emergence of one to two new clones during the chase period, and sometimes these new clones became the dominant clones at later time points. Overall, our results show that native murine hematopoiesis is composed of a few major labeled clones that persist and others that expand, disappear, or newly emerge. A major advantage of the HUe model is that we can measure and characterize the behavior of endogenous HSC in vivo, then selectively isolate live HSCs based on fluorescent tagging, transplant them into new hosts, and study their long-term behavior in competition or under varying stress conditions. This cannot be achieved by DNA barcoding or transposon insertion analyses because these methods require the destruction of cells. Transplanting equal aliquots of randomly fluorescent-tagged donor HSCs into 20–40 C57BL/6J recipients resulted in an unanticipated consistency of clonal behavior in recipients (p < 10−16) (Figures 3A, S4C,and S5A–S5C). That is, the individual clones in the recipients behaved after transplant as they had as endogenous HSC in the donor in terms of cell proliferation (defined by clone size) and lineage commitment. Each color-defined clone behaved similarly in different recipients, consistently exhibiting cell activation, proliferation, and lineage differentiation characteristics distinct from the other clones. The individual HUe fluorescent profiles of different cell types (Figure 3A, e.g., B cells from recipient 1) collected from multiple recipients were analyzed using unbiased hierarchical clustering. Clustering of the HUe fluorescent profiles grouped the same cell types together even though they were from different recipients (Figure 3B). This demonstrates that the extent and consistency of clone-specific biases was sufficiently large to distinguish different hematopoietic cell types in recipient mice solely based on their clonal composition, as measured by the fluorescent distribution of each cell type. We termed the group of transplanted recipients a “recipient cohort.” The consistency of behavior in a recipient cohort was striking and suggests cell autonomy governs the in vivo behavior of HSCs. Using recipient cohorts, we could then test how individual HSC clones respond to a particular stress or perturbation. We divided a recipient cohort into sub-cohorts that received either saline control or inflammatory stress (0.3 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide [LPS], intraperitoneal) (Figure 4A) Similarly, another recipient cohort was divided into sub-cohorts that received either no treatment or genotoxic stress (4.5 Gy total body irradiation) (Figure 4B). Stressed and non-stressed sub-cohorts were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Notably, while individual clones behaved differently (decreased or increased in clone size) in response to stress, consistency of response for a given clone was again observed in all recipients (Figures 4C and 4D). For example, while both HSCs and progenitors responded to LPS, there was a significant reduction in the size of myeloid lineage clones at 12 hr immediately following LPS stress (Figure 4E) but an overall increase in the number of clones (Figure S5D, p < 0.036), consistent across the treated recipient cohort (Figure 4C, p < 0.001). In contrast to LPS, irradiation reduced overall hematopoietic clonal complexity (Figure S5E) and caused expansion of the remaining clones, most notable at day 44 post-radiation when the hematopoietic system had returned to homeostasis (Figure 4F). Again, we observed statistically significant consistency of clonal response at all levels of the hematopoietic hierarchy across all recipient cohorts subjected to irradiation (Figure 4D, p < 0.001).Figure S5Hematopoietic Functional Heterogeneity Is Preserved across All Mice in Any Given HUe Recipient Cohort, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) Individual hematopoietic cell populations show significant clonal consistency across members within a HUe recipient cohort.

In contrast, IR treatment shows reduction of cluster numbers (p value 0.071). To explore the molecular mechanisms that underpin the remarkably consistent behavior observed in HSC clones, we examined epigenetic and transcriptional states of select clones in parallel with flow cytometric analysis of the functional output of these clones in terms of clonal expansion and lineage outcome. LT-HSCs (LineageLoSca+cKit+CD48−CD150+) belonging to two clones (“Cohort1.Y” and “Cohort1.R”) were picked, and their DNA methylation and transcriptome states were assessed using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) assays, respectively (Figure 5A). Analysis of clonal contributions to different lineages (Figure 5B) indicated that the exemplar Cohort1.R clone exhibited higher proliferation rates (i.e., contributes higher than expected fraction of cells to the multipotent progenitor [MPP] compartment) (Figure 5C) and biased toward myeloid differentiation (Figure 5D). By contrast, the “Cohort1.Y” clone showed lower proliferation rates and exhibited strong bias toward lymphoid production (i.e., contributed to the common lymphoid progenitor [CLP] but not common myeloid progenitor [CMP] compartment) (Figures 5C and 5D). Comparing the DNA methylation patterns of the HSCs from the two isolated clones, we found that while both clones were in the epigenetic state of non-differentiated HSCs (Figure 6A), the Cohort1.R clone showed significantly higher DNA methylation at HSC-specific enhancers and promoters and lower transcriptional expression magnitude of such genes (Figure 6B). Consistently, the Cohort1.R clone showed higher expression of genes associated with HSC proliferation (Kittler et al., 2007Kittler R. Pelletier L. Heninger A.K. Slabicki M. Theis M. Miroslaw L.

https://openalex.org/W2551596589,"Models of cortical dynamics often assume a homogeneous connectivity structure. However, we show that heterogeneous input connectivity can prevent the dynamic balance between excitation and inhibition, a hallmark of cortical dynamics, and yield unrealistically sparse and temporally regular firing. Anatomically based estimates of the connectivity of layer 4 (L4) rat barrel cortex and numerical simulations of this circuit indicate that the local network possesses substantial heterogeneity in input connectivity, sufficient to disrupt excitation-inhibition balance. We show that homeostatic plasticity in inhibitory synapses can align the functional connectivity to compensate for structural heterogeneity. Alternatively, spike-frequency adaptation can give rise to a novel state in which local firing rates adjust dynamically so that adaptation currents and synaptic inputs are balanced. This theory is supported by simulations of L4 barrel cortex during spontaneous and stimulus-evoked conditions. Our study shows how synaptic and cellular mechanisms yield fluctuation-driven dynamics despite structural heterogeneity in cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2551595439,"Little is known about how animals integrate multiple sensory inputs in natural environments to balance avoidance of danger with approach to things of value. Furthermore, the mechanistic link between internal physiological state and threat-reward decision making remains poorly understood. Here we confronted C. elegans worms with the decision whether to cross a hyperosmotic barrier presenting the threat of desiccation to reach a source of food odor. We identified a specific interneuron that controls this decision via top-down extrasynaptic aminergic potentiation of the primary osmosensory neurons to increase their sensitivity to the barrier. We also establish that food deprivation increases the worm's willingness to cross the dangerous barrier by suppressing this pathway. These studies reveal a potentially general neural circuit architecture for internal state control of threat-reward decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2554866352,"Current theories posit that memories encoded during experiences are subsequently consolidated into longer-term storage. Hippocampal sharp-wave-ripple (SWR) events have been linked to this consolidation process during sleep, but SWRs also occur during awake immobility, where their role remains unclear. We report that awake SWR rates at the reward site are inversely related to the prevalence of vicarious trial and error (VTE) behaviors, thought to be involved in deliberation processes. SWR rates were diminished immediately after VTE behaviors and an increase in the rate of SWR events at the reward site predicted a decrease in subsequent VTE behaviors at the choice point. Furthermore, SWR disruptions increased VTE behaviors. These results suggest an inverse relationship between SWRs and VTE behaviors and suggest that awake SWRs and associated planning and memory consolidation mechanisms are engaged specifically in the context of higher levels of behavioral certainty."

Locomotion is a universal and robust animal behavior to efficiently translocate from one place to another. In quadrupedal animals, whole-body stabilization in concert with the precise timing and sequence of limb movements is a prerequisite to ensure smooth locomotion at different speeds. Even in bipedal species like humans, efficient walking depends on the leg and arm coordination aligned with body stabilization and has been hypothesized to use evolutionarily conserved pathways (Dietz, 2002Dietz V.

To understand how locomotor reliability is regulated in limbed animals, it is critical to identify and understand the function of neuronal circuit elements central to the coordination of the different aspects of locomotion. Quadrupedal locomotion requires continuous postural adjustments involving the finely tuned coordination of trunk and limb muscle contraction patterns (Ceccato et al., 2009Ceccato J.C. de Sèze M.

Acting within this background of body stabilization, translocation to propel the body forward depends on coordinated limb movements that can roughly be divided into three behavioral subroutines. First, within a single limb, patterns of complex muscle synergies are activated sequentially contributing to stance and swing as two main locomotor phases (Brown, 1911Brown T.G.

Second, in most quadrupedal species including rodents, pairs of fore- or hindlimbs on opposite sides of one girdle exhibit left-right alternation and, at high speed, shift to gaits with more synchronous movement patterns (Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015Bellardita C.

Third, fore- and hindlimbs are diagonally coupled during locomotion dominated by left-right alternation, and these patterns are adjusted with different gaits (Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015Bellardita C.

Spinal cord transection experiments were helpful to begin to dissect which parts of the nervous system support locomotion by coordinating movement of distributed body parts. Cats with thoracic spinal cord transection still produce hindlimb stepping with patterned extensor-flexor muscle contractions and left-right limb alternation on a weight-supported treadmill (Forssberg et al., 1980aForssberg H.

Nystel J. Stepping by chronic spinal cats.Exp. Brain Res. 1980; 40: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, cats with high cervical transection carry out episodes of coordinated quadrupedal locomotion upon systemic application of locomotion-promoting drugs to mimic activity of severed supraspinal centers (Miller and van der Meché, 1976Miller S. van der Meché F.G. Coordinated stepping of all four limbs in the high spinal cat.Brain Res. 1976; 109: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Together, these experiments have put forward the idea that spinal neurons linking cervical and lumbar segments might play a role in regulating quadrupedal locomotion, but genetic identity, diversification, and function of involved neurons in intact animals are currently unknown. Many studies demonstrate that neuronal subpopulations contributing to local spinal circuits exhibit distinct roles in locomotion based on progenitor domain origin marked by differential transcription factor expression during development (Alaynick et al., 2011Alaynick W.A.

For example, whereas V1 and V2b interneurons are important for the regulation of extension-flexion (Britz et al., 2015Britz O. Zhang J. Grossmann K.S. Dyck J. Kim J.C. Dymecki S. Gosgnach S.

In contrast, genetic identity and possible neuronal diversity of long-distance spinal projection neurons communicating between local circuits at cervical and lumbar spinal levels remain obscure. Nevertheless, anatomical tracing studies show that bidirectional axonal projections between cervical and lumbar spinal segments exist in several species including humans (Dutton et al., 2006Dutton R.C.

Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings identified a diversity of response properties and supraspinal input pathways in these neurons (Alstermark et al., 1987bAlstermark B. Lundberg A. Pinter M.

Remmel R.S. Responses of long descending propriospinal neurons to natural and electrical types of stimuli in cat.Brain Res. 1980; 196: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that the overall population encompasses functional subtypes. Here we studied long-distance projection neurons coupling cervical and lumbar segments of the mouse spinal cord to reveal their genetic identity and behavioral function in locomotion. We found that descending projection neurons diversify into excitatory and inhibitory subsets with mirrored synaptic terminations to contra- and ipsilateral lumbar spinal segments. Within the excitatory cohort, developmental stratification by progenitor domain origin distinguishes contra- and ipsilaterally projecting populations, providing evidence for the existence of genetically tractable subgroups of long-distance spinal projection neurons. Using intersectional viral approaches to assess the function of cervico-lumbar projection neurons, we define their importance in regulating reliability of quadrupedal locomotion, including postural stability, speed control, and interlimb coordination. To visualize long-distance axonal projection patterns and synaptic arborizations of spinal neurons, we first carried out unilateral injections into cervical mouse spinal cords (Figure 1A). Since neurons expressing excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters (NTs) are functionally opposing, we studied these populations separately, using different NT::Cre mice. We injected double-inverted-orientation-LoxP-flanked AAVs (AAV-flex-Tag) conditionally expressing a cytosolic marker protein (AAV-flex-Tomato) and/or synaptically-tagged proteins (AAV-flex-SynTag) into spinal cords of vGlut2Cre (excitatory) or vGATCre (inhibitory) mice (Vong et al., 2011Vong L. Ye C. Yang Z. Choi B. Chua Jr., S. Lowell B.B. Leptin action on GABAergic neurons prevents obesity and reduces inhibitory tone to POMC neurons.Neuron. 2011; 71: 142-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), leading to high-level marker protein expression within 2 weeks. We first focused on axonal trajectories of descending cervical projection neurons (Figures 1A–1E; injection center at segmental levels C4–C7). Axons across multiple spinal segments project in white matter tracts surrounding the spinal gray matter (Figures 1D and 1E). We found that both vGlut2ON and vGATON cervical neurons extend axons to lumbar levels, but they differ with respect to two important properties. First, descending axons of excitatory vGlut2ON cervical neurons persist to lumbar levels to a higher degree than axons of inhibitory vGATON neurons (Figure 1B), ultimately resulting in significantly more lumbar descending axons for excitatory vGlut2ON than inhibitory vGATON cervical neurons (Figure 1C). And second, while significantly more axons derived from excitatory vGlut2ON cervical neurons cross the midline to descend contralaterally, inhibitory vGATON neurons display the opposite bias with a dominance of ipsilaterally descending axons (Figures 1D and 1E). To determine the spatial distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts of cervico-lumbar projection neurons in the lumbar spinal cord, we reconstructed AAV-derived SynTag protein accumulations in lumbar synaptic terminals (Figures 1F–1I). Synapses of both neuronal populations were strongly biased to ventral over dorsal spinal territory and occupied mostly laminae in which motor-related interneurons and motor neurons reside (Figures 1H and 1I). When we quantified synapse position with respect to injection laterality, we found that the relative contributions of the two populations to ipsi- and contralateral spinal cord were mirrored. Whereas excitatory vGlut2ON cervical projection neurons terminated preferentially contralaterally, inhibitory vGATON counterparts exhibited a bias toward the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord (Figures 1H and 1I). Together, these findings show that the cervical spinal cord contains both excitatory and inhibitory neurons with projections to lumbar spinal neurons located in motor-related laminae. However, there was a preference for excitatory over inhibitory cervical neurons to establish these long-range connections, and excitatory neurons preferentially contacted contralateral lumbar targets, whereas inhibitory counterparts had the opposite bias. Since communication between cervical and lumbar spinal cord is expected to be bidirectional, we next assessed whether and how lumbar spinal neurons interact synaptically with cervical neurons. We carried out unilateral injections of AAV-flex viruses expressing axonal and synaptic marker proteins into lumbar spinal segments (L2–L5) of vGlut2Cre and vGATCre mice (Figure S1A). We found that excitatory vGlut2ON lumbar neurons project to cervical segments. These neurons exhibited similar persistence of long-distance projections and contralateral distribution bias of synaptic terminals to the ventral spinal cord as descending cervico-lumbar counterparts (Figures S1B and S1C). In contrast, lumbar inhibitory vGATON neurons only very sparsely projected to the cervical spinal cord, and synaptic terminals derived from these neurons were confined mostly to ventral motor neurons at C7/8, innervating the cutaneous maximus muscle (Figure S1E) (Vrieseling and Arber, 2006Vrieseling E.

Target-induced transcriptional control of dendritic patterning and connectivity in motor neurons by the ETS gene Pea3.Cell. 2006; 127: 1439-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Together, our findings reveal that cervical and lumbar spinal segments are bidirectionally coupled by distinct neuronal subpopulations identified by NT identity and projection laterality. We focused our subsequent analyses mostly on the elucidation of identity and function of cervico-lumbar projection neurons, due to their predicted involvement in transmitting supraspinal commands to lumbar circuits (Alstermark et al., 1987bAlstermark B. Lundberg A. Pinter M. Sasaki S.

To map the precise location of cervico-lumbar projection neurons and their cellular identity, we carried out retrograde tracing experiments from the lumbar spinal cord. We labeled cervico-lumbar projection neurons by bilateral injection of Rabies viruses expressing fluorescent proteins (Rab-FP) into the lumbar spinal cord (Figure 2A), an established method for efficient retrograde neuronal targeting (Wickersham et al., 2007aWickersham I.R. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. Callaway E.M. Retrograde neuronal tracing with a deletion-mutant rabies virus.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The majority of Rab-FP-marked cervico-lumbar projection neurons resided lateral and slightly ventral to the central canal in Rexed’s laminae VII/VIII, with a second smaller cluster in the dorsal spinal cord (Figures 2B–2D). Comparable distribution patterns were also observed by injection of retrograde CAV-Cre into lumbar spinal segments of mice with Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reporter protein (Figure S2A), or when combined with cervical injections of AAV-flex-Tomato into wild-type mice (Figure 2F). These patterns are reminiscent of the ones described before in other species using conventional tracers (Dutton et al., 2006Dutton R.C. Carstens M.I. Antognini J.F. Carstens E.

Neurol. 1979; 188: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To assess relative abundance and positioning of cervico-lumbar projection neurons with different NTs, we injected AAV-flex-TVA in the cervical spinal cord of vGlut2Cre and vGATCre mice, followed by lumbar axonal infection with EnvA-coated Rab-FP to specifically target neurons with lumbar projections (Figure 2G). In agreement with our anterograde tracing experiments, we found that excitatory cervico-lumbar projection neurons were targeted more efficiently than the inhibitory population. In addition, there was a bias for differential cell body distribution between these two populations with inhibitory neurons located closer to the central canal (Figure 2G). Since this strategy results in much lower tracing efficiency than straight Rab-FP injections and cannot be used for quantitative purposes, we carried out Rab-FP injections into lumbar spinal cords of GlyT2GFP mice (Zeilhofer et al., 2005Zeilhofer H.U. Studler B. Arabadzisz D. Schweizer C. Ahmadi S. Layh B. Bösl M.R. Fritschy J.M. Glycinergic neurons expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein in bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 482: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We found that only ∼20% of Rab-FP marked cervico-lumbar projection neurons are glycinergic and that many of these resided in spinal territory around the central canal, compared to the broader distribution pattern of the remaining non-glycinergic cervico-lumbar projection neurons (Figures 2I and 2J). As a complementary approach and to determine whether cervico-lumbar projection neurons connect to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons at lumbar levels, we used retrograde viral transfer initiated from lumbar segments with monosynaptic restriction (Figure S2B). Reconstructions of cervical spinal cords showed that cervico-lumbar neurons connect to neuronal subtypes of both NT phenotypes in the lumbar spinal cord. Together, these experiments establish the preferential excitatory nature of cervico-lumbar projection neurons. The position of the larger number of cervico-lumbar projection neurons makes it likely that the developmental origin of this overall population includes progenitor cells of ventral origin or neurons migrating ventrally after generation. We therefore used genetic strategies to try to target these neurons based on developmental origin by probing relevant candidate transgenic mouse lines intersectionally with viral injections. To gain genetic access to spinal neurons derived from individual transcriptionally defined progenitor domains, we surveyed transgenic mouse lines expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of progenitor-domain specific transcription factors (Figures 3A and 3B ; PD::Cre). Since most developmentally expressed spinal transcription factors are no longer expressed by postnatal stages, we crossed PD::Cre mouse strains to mice conditionally expressing FLP-recombinase and a nuclear LacZ marker gene upon Cre recombination (Taulox-STOP-lox-FLPo-INLA) (Pivetta et al., 2014Pivetta C. Esposito M.S. Sigrist M. Arber S. Motor-circuit communication matrix from spinal cord to brainstem neurons revealed by developmental origin.Cell. 2014; 156: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We injected FLP-dependent AAVs into cervical spinal cords of mice derived from these intersectional crosses to probe connectivity of marked progenitor domain-tagged cervical neurons to the lumbar spinal cord (Figure 3B). We probed five PD::Cre mouse strains for their capability to mark cervico-lumbar projection neurons in this assay. While all five experimental configurations resulted in efficient marking of cervical spinal neurons at the segments of injection (data not shown), only a constellation with V0-Dbx1 (Dbx1::CreERT2) or V2-Shox2 (Shox2::Cre)—but not with V1 (En1::Cre), V3 (Sim1::Cre), or dI3 (Isl1::Cre)—alleles resulted in labeling of cervical neurons with axonal projections to the lumbar spinal cord (Figures 3C and S3). V0-Dbx1 and V2-Shox2 populations were entirely distinct with respect to their projection and arborization patterns. Axon reconstructions in the white matter showed that lumbar spinal cord-reaching axons of V0-Dbx1 cervico-lumbar projection neurons project almost exclusively contralaterally, whereas V2-Shox2-derived counterparts are restricted to the ipsilateral side (Figure 3D). Moreover, also synaptic reconstructions at lumbar levels revealed an almost exclusive unilaterally restricted pattern on sides opposite to injection for V0-Dbx1 and V2-Shox2 populations, respectively (Figures 3E–3H). The laminar distribution of synapses of both populations was very similar, with a peak of synaptic density in the ventral spinal cord to areas with motor-related interneurons and motor neurons (Figures 3G and 3H). When we assayed the identity of lumbar projection neurons with axons targeting cervical spinal levels, we found that the same two progenitor domains contributed to this group of neurons (Figures S1F and S1G). Synaptic distribution patterns were also reminiscent of the cervico-lumbar projection neuron counterparts, with V0-Dbx1-derived neurons targeting contra- and V2-Shox2-derived neurons targeting ipsilateral spinal territory (Figures S1F and S1G). Since neurons originating from a single spinal progenitor domain can give rise to distinct neuronal subpopulations (Alaynick et al., 2011Alaynick W.A. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L.

https://openalex.org/W2552848269,"Mammalian tissues calcify with age and injury. Analogous to bone formation, osteogenic cells are thought to be recruited to the affected tissue and induce mineralization. In the heart, calcification of cardiac muscle leads to conduction system disturbances and is one of the most common pathologies underlying heart blocks. However the cell identity and mechanisms contributing to pathological heart muscle calcification remain unknown. Using lineage tracing, murine models of heart calcification and in vivo transplantation assays, we show that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) adopt an osteoblast cell-like fate and contribute directly to heart muscle calcification. Small-molecule inhibition of ENPP1, an enzyme that is induced upon injury and regulates bone mineralization, significantly attenuated cardiac calcification. Inhibitors of bone mineralization completely prevented ectopic cardiac calcification and improved post injury heart function. Taken together, these findings highlight the plasticity of fibroblasts in contributing to ectopic calcification and identify pharmacological targets for therapeutic development."

The model reproduces a range of experimental observations and shows that the newly discovered feedback projection from external globus pallidus to striatum is crucial for inhibitory control. Moreover, stopping process is enhanced by the cortico-subcortical reverberatory dynamics underlying persistent activity, establishing interdependence between working memory and inhibitory control. Surprisingly, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) can be adjusted by weights of certain connections but is insensitive to other connections in this complex circuit, suggesting novel circuit-based intervention for inhibitory control deficits associated with mental illness. Our model provides a unified framework for inhibitory control, decision making, and working memory."
https://openalex.org/W2551675827,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with physiological abnormalities, including abnormal redox and mitochondrial metabolism. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from some children with ASD exhibit increased oxidative stress, decreased glutathione redox capacity, and highly active mitochondria with increased vulnerability to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because unaffected siblings (Sibs) of individuals with ASD share some redox abnormalities, we sought to determine whether LCLs from Sibs share ASD-associated mitochondrial abnormalities. We evaluated mitochondrial bioenergetics in 10 sets of LCLs from children with ASD, Sibs, and unrelated/unaffected controls (Cons) after acute increases in ROS. Additionally, intracellular glutathione and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) gene expressions were quantified. Compared to Sib LCLs, ASD LCLs exhibited significantly higher ATP-linked respiration, higher maximal and reserve respiratory capacity, and greater glycolysis and glycolytic reserve. ASD LCLs exhibited a significantly greater change in these parameters, with acute increases in ROS compared to both Sib and Con LCLs. Compared to Con, both ASD and Sib LCLs exhibited significantly higher proton leak respiration. Consistent with this, intracellular glutathione redox capacity was decreased and UCP2 gene expression was increased in both ASD and Sib compared to Con LCLs. These data indicate that mitochondrial respiratory function, not abnormal redox homeostasis, distinguishes ASD from unaffected LCLs.-Rose, S., Bennuri, S. C., Wynne, R., Melnyk, S., James, S.

Protection of Telomere 1 (POT1) is an essential component of the shelterin complex and functions to maintain chromosome stability by repressing the activation of aberrant DNA damage and repair responses at telomeres. Sporadic and familial mutations in the oligosaccharide-oligonucleotide (OB) folds of POT1 have been identified in many human cancers, but the mechanism underlying how hPOT1 mutations initiate tumorigenesis has remained unclear. Here we show that the human POT1's OB-folds are essential for the protection of newly replicated telomeres. Oncogenic mutations in hPOT1 OB-fold fail to bind to single-stranded telomeric DNA, eliciting a DNA damage response at telomeres that promote inappropriate chromosome fusions via the mutagenic alternative non-homologous end joining (A-NHEJ) pathway. hPOT1 mutations also result in telomere elongation and the formation of transplantable hematopoietic malignancies. Strikingly, conditional deletion of both mPot1a and p53 in mouse mammary epithelium resulted in development of highly invasive breast carcinomas and the formation of whole chromosomes containing massive arrays of telomeric fusions indicative of multiple breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Our results reveal that hPOT1 OB-folds are required to protect and prevent newly replicated telomeres from engaging in A-NHEJ mediated fusions that would otherwise promote genome instability to fuel tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2549705216,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has poor prognosis and rapid recurrence because of widespread dissemination of peritoneal metastases at diagnosis. Multiple pathways contribute to the aggressiveness of ovarian cancer, including hypoxic signaling mechanisms. In this study, we have determined that the hypoxia-inducible histone demethylase KDM4B is expressed in ∼60% of EOC tumors assayed, including primary and matched metastatic tumors. Expression of KDM4B in tumors is positively correlated with expression of the tumor hypoxia marker CA-IX, and is robustly induced in EOC cell lines exposed to hypoxia. KDM4B regulates expression of metastatic genes and pathways, and loss of KDM4B increases H3K9 trimethylation at the promoters of target genes like LOXL2, LCN2 and PDGFB. Suppressing KDM4B inhibits ovarian cancer cell invasion, migration and spheroid formation in vitro. KDM4B also regulates seeding and growth of peritoneal tumors in vivo, where its expression corresponds to hypoxic regions. This is the first demonstration that a Jumonji-domain histone demethylase regulates cellular processes required for peritoneal dissemination of cancer cells, one of the predominant factors affecting prognosis of EOC. The pathways regulated by KDM4B may present novel opportunities to develop combinatorial therapies to improve existing therapies for EOC patients."

https://openalex.org/W2555414214,"In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Wwox-knockout mice. Human and mouse cells deficient for Wwox also exhibit significantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deficient cells exhibited significantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox deficiency significantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent survival differences, we found that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deficient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunofluorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker function for WWOX, in which Brca1-Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufficient cells. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates DSB repair, enhancing efficiency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2551089624,"Nitric oxide (NO) is integral to macrophage cytotoxicity against tumors due to its ability to induce iron release from cancer cells. However, the mechanism for how activated macrophages protect themselves from endogenous NO remains unknown. We previously demonstrated by using tumor cells that glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) sequesters NO as dinitrosyl-dithiol iron complexes (DNICs) and inhibits NO-mediated iron release from cells via the transporter multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1). These prior studies also showed that MRP1 and GSTP1 protect tumor cells against NO cytotoxicity, which parallels their roles in defending cancer cells from cytotoxic drugs. Considering this, and because GSTP1 and MRP1 are up-regulated during macrophage activation, this investigation examined whether this NO storage/transport system protects macrophages against endogenous NO cytotoxicity in two well characterized macrophage cell types (J774 and RAW 264.7). MRP1 expression markedly increased upon macrophage activation, and the role of MRP1 in NO-induced 59Fe release was demonstrated by Mrp1 siRNA and the MRP1 inhibitor, MK571, which inhibited NO-mediated iron efflux. Furthermore, Mrp1 silencing increased DNIC accumulation in macrophages, indicating a role for MRP1 in transporting DNICs out of cells. In addition, macrophage 59Fe release was enhanced by silencing Gstp1, suggesting GSTP1 was responsible for DNIC binding/storage. Viability studies demonstrated that GSTP1 and MRP1 protect activated macrophages from NO cytotoxicity. This was confirmed by silencing nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which decreased MRP1 and GSTP1 expression, concomitant with reduced 59Fe release and macrophage survival. Together, these results demonstrate a mechanism by which macrophages protect themselves against NO cytotoxicity."

This tethering activity of ISW1 requires chromatin binding and is independent of nucleosome sliding activity or changes in RNA polymerase II processivity. Combination of in vivo UV-crosslinking and genome-wide RNA immunoprecipitation assays show that Isw1 and its cofactors interact directly with premature mRNPs.

Here, we report a role for HGF-induced intracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) generation catalyzed by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), S1P transporter, spinster homolog 2 (Spns2), and S1P receptor, S1P1, in lamellipodia formation and perhaps motility of HLMVECs.

Emerging evidence suggests that formation of protruding structures, termed lamellipodia, generated at the leading edge of migrating ECs in response to a variety of growth factors, are primarily involved in cell motility (3.Krause M.

The driving force for EC motility is fueled by continuous growth of actin filaments and rearrangement of the actin binding protein cortactin in the lamellipodia.

During our investigation into mechanism(s) of EC lamellipodia formation, we observed that down-regulation of sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1 or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter, Spns2, partially abrogated HGF-induced lamellipodia formation. Further, inhibiting c-Met tyrosine kinase with SU11274 attenuated intracellular S1P levels in lung ECs. These results suggested a cross-talk and potential interaction between HGF/c-Met and SphK/S1P/S1P receptor (S1PR) signaling axis in lamellipodia formation and EC motility; however, the mechanism(s) of regulation of HGF-mediated lamellipodia formation and EC migration by SphK/S1P/S1PR signaling axis is unclear. Here, we determined the role of SphK1, Spns2, and S1PR in HGF-induced lamellipodia formation in lung ECs. Our results demonstrated that HGF/c-Met signaling stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which in turn phosphorylated SphK1. Both ERK1/2 and SphK1, but not SphK2, were localized in lamellipodia. Further, HGF stimulation of lung ECs increased intracellular S1P levels via activation of SphK1 and blocking SphK1 or Spns2 abrogated HGF-induced lamellipodia formation. Additionally, knocking down of S1P1, but not S1P2 or S1P3, with siRNA attenuated HGF-induced lamellipodia formation. Collectively, these results identify cross-talk between HGF/c-Met and SphK1/Spns2/S1P signaling as a novel pathway of lamellipodia formation and perhaps EC motility.

We therefore determined the role of HGF/c-Met signaling axis in SphK-mediated S1P generation in lamellipodia formation and EC motility. HLMVECs expressed both the isoforms of SphK, SphK1 and SphK2; however, stimulation with HGF (20 ng/ml) resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of SphK1 (Ser225) with no detectable phosphorylation of SphK2 (Thr578) (Fig. 1, A and B). The HGF-induced activation of SphK1 resulted in enhanced accumulation of intracellular S1P levels, which was blocked by PF-543 (1 μm), a potent and specific inhibitor of SphK1 (14.Schnute M.E.

HGF enhanced intracellular S1P generation as early as 2 min post-challenge and peaked at 10 min followed by a gradual decline in accumulation (Fig. 1C). Further, cell lysates from HGF-stimulated HLMVECs exhibited enhanced SphK1 activity compared with control cells in vitro, which was blocked by the SphK1 inhibitor PF-543 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that phosphorylation and activation of SphK1 by HGF enhances accumulation of S1P in HLMVECs.

Therefore, we hypothesized that HGF-induced lamellipodia formation, in part, is dependent on SphK1 activation and its redistribution to lamellipodia and co-localization with actin and cortactin cytoskeleton at cell periphery. Cells challenged with vehicle revealed diffused SphK1, actin, and cortactin staining; however, HGF stimulated F-actin (red) and SphK1 (green) (Fig. 2, A and B) and cortactin (green) and SphK1 (red) (Fig. 2, C and D) redistribution and co-localization (merge, yellow) to cell periphery. A similar co-localization of p-SphK1 (Ser225) with actin and cortactin in lamellipodia after HGF treatment was observed in HLMVECs (Fig. 3, A–D). These results suggest that HGF-induced phosphorylation of SphK1 may play a role in lamellipodia formation in human lung ECs.FIGURE 3.HGF stimulates SphK1 phosphorylation and accumulation at lamellipodia. HLMVECs grown on slide chambers were treated with HGF (20 ng/ml) or PBS for 30 min and probed with anti-actin, anti-p-SphK1(ser225), and anti-cortactin antibodies, and lamellipodia was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy with 60× oil objective.

As a result of inhibition of SphK1, S1P generation induced by HGF was significantly attenuated by SU11274 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation by SU11274 attenuated phospho-SphK1 (green) co-localization with actin (red) in lamellipodia (merge, yellow) (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results establish a key role for HGF/c-Met signaling in SphK1 phosphorylation and co-localization with actin in lamellipodia of HLMVECs. Having established that SphK1/p-SphK1 is localized in lamellipodia in response to HGF treatment, we sought to determine whether SphK1 activity and/or protein expression is required for lamellipodia formation. Intrinsic SphK1 activity in HLMVECs was inhibited by PF-543, a specific inhibitor of SphK1, or SphK1 expression was down-regulated by siRNA transfection. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), pretreatment of HLMVECs with PF-543 (1 μm) for 1 h significantly attenuated HGF-induced lamellipodia formation as indicated by co-localization of actin (red) and cortactin (green) in the cell periphery (merge, yellow) by immunofluorescent staining. Similarly, knockdown of SphK1, but not SphK2, using specific siRNA significantly attenuated HGF-induced co-localization of actin (red) and cortactin (green) in lamellipodia (Fig. 5, C and D). Knockdown of SphK1 and SphK2 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, intrinsic SphK1 activity was inhibited by transfection of cells with catalytically inactive FLAG-tagged adenoviral SphK1 plasmid. In control cells, there was no difference between transfected and non-transfected cells in terms of cortactin localization; however, cells transfected with SphK1 mutant adenovirus did not show cortactin localization in lamellipodia after stimulation with HGF (data not shown). These results show a potential role for SphK1 activity and protein expression in HGF-induced lamellipodia formation in lung ECs. ERK1/2 has been shown to be phosphorylated in response to growth factors and localized to lamellipodial protrusion and adhesions (16.Mendoza M.C. Er E.E. Zhang W. Ballif B.A. Elliott H.L. Danuser G. Blenis J. ERK-MAPK drives lamellipodia protrusion by activating the WAVE2 regulatory complex.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Also, there is evidence that ERK1/2 mediates phosphorylation of SphK1 at Ser225 and other Ser/Thr residues in mammalian cells in response to external stimuli (17.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Activation of sphingosine kinase 1 by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of ERK1/2 and PI3K in SphK1 phosphorylation and lamellipodia formation, we used PD98059, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, and LY294002, a PI3K specific inhibitor. PD98059 significantly attenuated HGF-induced co-localization of p-SphK1 (green) with cortactin (red) in lamellipodia (merge, yellow) and redistribution of p-SphK1 in cell periphery (Fig. 6, A and B), as well as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SphK1 (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining showed enhanced co-localization of phospho-SphK1 with phospho-ERK1/2 at lamellipodia in response to HGF stimulation (Fig. 7, A and B). However, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no effect on HGF-induced SphK1 or ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7, E and F). These results indicate that ERK1/2, but not PI3K, mediates phosphorylation of SphK1 and its localization in lamellipodia.FIGURE 7.HGF stimulates co-localization of p-SphK1 and p-ERK in lamellipodia and SphK1 phosphorylation is mediated by ERK and not PI3K in HLMVECs. A, HLMVECs grown on slide chambers to ∼90% confluence were treated with HGF (20 ng/ml, 30 min) or PBS and probed with anti-p-SphK1 (Ser225) and anti-p-Erk (Thr/Ser204) antibodies, and lamellipodia formation was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy with 60× oil objective. Co-localization of phospho-SphK1 and phospho-ERK was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Co-localization of phospho-SphK1 (red) and phospho-ERK (green) in lamellipodia (merge, yellow) was visualized by immunofluorescent staining. Shown are representative images from three independent experiments. Insets depict enhanced co-localization of p-SphK1 and p-Erk in lamellipodia. B, the co-localization of phospho-SphK1 and phospho-ERK in lamellipodia was quantified from A using ImageJ software and expressed as relative pixel intensity. At least 20 cells were analyzed for each condition. C, HLMVECs grown to ∼90% confluence in 35-mm dishes were pretreated with PD98059 (1 μm, 30 min) followed by HGF (20 ng/ml, 30 min) treatment. The cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-SphK1, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-SphK1 antibodies.

As shown in Fig. 8 (A and B), vehicle-treated HLMVECs revealed a diffused cytosolic distribution of Spns2 (green) and HGF treatment induced redistribution of Spns2 to cell periphery and co-localization with actin (red) in lamellipodia (merge, yellow). To determine the role of Spns2 in lamellipodia formation and cell motility, Spns2 was down-regulated (>80%) by Spns2 specific siRNA for 72 h prior to HGF stimulation (Fig. 8E). Down-regulation of Spns2 with siRNA significantly inhibited HGF-induced lamellipodia formation, as determined by actin (red) and cortactin (green) co-localization in cell periphery (Fig. 8, C and D). We next investigated whether HGF-induced S1P generated inside the cell signals via inside-out mechanism using a specific anti-S1P antibody (18.Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I. Usatyuk P. Kalari S. Zhao Y. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Sabbadini R.A. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. Intracellular S1P generation is essential for S1P-induced motility of human lung endothelial cells: role of sphingosine kinase 1 and S1P lyase.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e16571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Exogenous addition of anti-S1P monoclonal antibody (150 μg/ml) to the medium blocked HGF-induced lamellipodia formation compared with control HLMVECs treated with IgG (150 μg/ml) (Fig. 8, F and G). Intracellular S1P levels in scrambled RNA- and Spns2 siRNA-transfected cells did not show significant difference in the absence of HGF; however, a statistically significant increase in intracellular S1P levels was observed between scrambled RNA-transfected and Spns2 siRNA-transfected cells after HGF treatment (Fig. 9A), indicating that HGF-induced intracellular S1P could not be effectively transported outside. No difference in S1P levels was seen in the medium in cells treated with scrambled or Spns2 siRNA in the absence or presence of HGF (data not shown). To investigate the role of Spns2 in cell motility, wound healing assay was performed with scrambled and Spns2 siRNA-transfected HLMVECs. As shown in Fig. 9 (B and C), HGF enhanced the process of wound closure compared with control cells, and knockdown of Spns2 significantly attenuated HGF-mediated wound healing. These results show an essential role of Spns2 in HGF-induced lamellipodia formation and cell motility in human lung ECs. S1P, generated in cells by SphK1/2, can signal intracellularly or extracellularly (inside-out mechanism) by ligation to cell surface G protein-coupled S1P1–5. Human lung ECs exhibit high expression of S1P1 and S1P3 (19.Waeber C. Blondeau N. Salomone S. Vascular sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P1 and S1P3 receptors.Drug News Perspect. 2004; 17: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To further characterize the type of S1P receptor(s) involved in HGF-mediated lamellipodia formation, S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 were down-regulated by specific siRNA, and knockdown of these receptors was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 10C). As expected, HGF stimulated redistribution of actin (red) and cortactin (green) to cell periphery and enhanced co-localization of actin and cortactin in lamellipodia (merge, yellow) (Fig. 10A). Furthermore, HGF-induced lamellipodia was inhibited in cells transfected with S1P1, but not S1P2 or S1P3, siRNA (Fig. 10B). These results suggest a role for S1P1 in mediating HGF-induced lamellipodia formation in human lung ECs. Given our results indicating that both Spns2 and SphK1 are localized in lamellipodia in response to HGF, we next investigated potential association between SphK1, S1P1, and Spns2 before and after HGF stimulation. HLMVECs were infected with control adenovirus or FLAG-tagged SphK1 adenovirus prior to HGF stimulation, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for co-immunoprecipitation of Spns2, S1P1, or FLAG tag. As shown in Fig. 11A, HGF challenge enhanced SphK1 interaction with S1P1 and Spns2 compared with vehicle treated cells. Similarly, HGF challenge increased co-immunoprecipitation of Spns2 and p-SphK1 in S1P1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 11C) and S1P1 and p-SphK1 in Spns2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 11E). A similar increase in co-localization of SphK1 with Spns2 and SphK1 with S1P1 in lamellipodia was observed by immunofluorescence after HGF stimulation of HLMVECs (Fig. 11, G and I). These data suggest that Spns2, SphK1, and S1P1 may be part of a protein platform in lamellipodia of human lung"
https://openalex.org/W2556808082,"Allosteric modulators of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are thought to act on elements of the pathways that couple agonist binding to channel gating. Using α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the α4β2-selective positive modulators 17β-estradiol (βEST) and desformylflustrabromine (dFBr), we have identified pathways that link the binding sites for these modulators to the Cys loop, a region that is critical for channel gating in all pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Previous studies have shown that the binding site for potentiating βEST is in the C-terminal (post-M4) region of the α4 subunit. Here, using homology modeling in combination with mutagenesis and electrophysiology, we identified the binding site for potentiating dFBr on the top half of a cavity between the third (M3) and fourth transmembrane (M4) α-helices of the α4 subunit. We found that the binding sites for βEST and dFBr communicate with the Cys loop, through interactions between the last residue of post-M4 and Phe170 of the conserved FPF sequence of the Cys loop, and that these interactions affect potentiating efficacy. In addition, interactions between a residue in M3 (Tyr309) and Phe167, a residue adjacent to the Cys loop FPF motif, also affect dFBr potentiating efficacy. Thus, the Cys loop acts as a key control element in the allosteric transduction pathway for potentiating βEST and dFBr. Overall, we propose that positive allosteric modulators that bind the M3-M4 cavity or post-M4 region increase the efficacy of channel gating through interactions with the Cys loop."

The p53 family member, p63, is critical for mammary gland development and contains transactivation domain isoforms, which have tumor-suppressive activities, and the ΔN isoforms, which act as oncogenes. In the clinic, p63 is often used as a diagnostic marker, and further analysis of the function of TAp63 in the mammary gland is critical for improved diagnosis and patient care. Loss of TAp63 in mice leads to the formation of aggressive metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma at 9–16 months of age. Here we show that TAp63 is crucial for the transition of mammary cancer cells to TICs. When TAp63 is lost, MECs express embryonic and MaSC signatures and activate the Hippo pathway. These data indicate a crucial role for TAp63 in mammary TICs and provide a mechanism for its role as a tumor- and metastasis-suppressor in breast cancer."

A previous study demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline induces Gαi/o activation, which leads to GDNF expression in astrocytes. However, the specific target expressed in astrocytes that mediates antidepressant-evoked Gαi/o activation has yet to be identified. Thus, the current study explored the possibility that antidepressant-induced Gαi/o activation depends on lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1), a Gαi/o-coupled receptor. GDNF mRNA expression was examined using real-time PCR and Gαi/o activation was examined using the cell-based receptor assay system CellKeyTM in rat C6 astroglial cells and rat primary cultured astrocytes. LPAR1 antagonists blocked GDNF mRNA expression and Gαi/o activation evoked by various classes of antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, mianserin, and fluoxetine). In addition, deletion of LPAR1 by RNAi suppressed amitriptyline-evoked GDNF mRNA expression. Treatment of astroglial cells with the endogenous LPAR agonist LPA increased GDNF mRNA expression through LPAR1, whereas treatment of primary cultured neurons with LPA failed to affect GDNF mRNA expression. Astrocytic GDNF expression evoked by either amitriptyline or LPA utilized, in part, transactivation of fibroblast growth factor receptor and a subsequent ERK cascade.

OSCN− is generated by the catalysis of peroxidases using thiocyanate transported via several anion transporters, including pendrin/SLC26A4 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated by Duox1 and Duox2. We previously demonstrated that expression of pendrin, peroxidases, and Duox1/Duox2 is up-regulated in bronchial asthma patients and/or asthma model mice and that these molecules are important in accelerating airway inflammation. However, it remained unclear how activating these molecules would lead to airway inflammation. In this study, we examined whether OSCN− produced via the pendrin/peroxidase/Duox pathway causes inflammation via airway epithelial cells. In an in vitro OSCN− production system, OSCN−, but not H2O2, activated NF-κB, a transcription factor critical for inflammatory responses, in the airway epithelial cells. OSCN− was sensed by protein kinase A (PKA) followed by formation of the dimerization of PKA. The dimerized PKA, the active form, was critical in activating NF-κB. Detoxifying H2O2, mainly by catalase, enabled the dominant abilities of OSCN− to dimerize PKA and activate NF-κB, compared with untreated H2O2. Furthermore, OSCN− in high doses caused necrosis of the cells, inducing release of IL-33, a trigger to initiate type 2 inflammation.

However, due to the numerous subjective symptoms, it is understandable why little association has been found between the signs and symptoms. Although psychological influences on the subjective symptoms have been reported, little is known about the influence of personality traits. The present study analyzed the relationship between the signs/symptoms of DED and the personality traits of patients using a cross-sectional design. We examined 56 DED patients (mean age; 62.4 ± 12.9, range 34-85 years) visiting the outpatient clinic of the Department of Ophthalmology at the Nippon Medical School Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Objective signs evaluated included the Schirmer I test, tear breakup time (BUT), fluorescein and lissamine green staining, and tear osmolality. Subjective symptoms were assessed by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Dry Eye-Related Quality-of-Life Score (DEQS) questionnaires. For personality traits, the Big Five personality traits model analysis was used. Correlations between the objective signs, subjective symptoms, and personality traits were analyzed. A significant correlation was found between the neuroticism in the Big Five Personality Inventory and the symptoms assessed by the DEQS (r = -0.35, p < 0.01), and the OSDI (r = -0.28, p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation observed between the signs and the symptoms, or between the signs and any personality traits. The results of our current study suggest that the personality of the patient, which appears to be the basis of various psychological factors, can have some impact on the subjective symptoms. This may be one of the reasons why there has been little association noted between the signs and symptoms of DED."

However, the role of Scx in fracture healing has not yet been explored. This study was conducted to identify the role of Scx in cortical bone development and fracture healing. Scx green fluorescent protein-labeled (ScxGFP) reporter and Scx-knockout (Scx-mutant) mice were used to assess bone morphometry and the effects of fracture healing on Scx localization and gene expression, as well as callus healing response. Botulinum toxin (BTX) was used to investigate muscle unloading effects on callus shape. Scx-mutant long bones had structural and mechanical defects. Scx gene expression was elevated and bmp4 was decreased at 24 h after fracture. ScxGFP+ cells were localized throughout the healing callus after fracture. Scx-mutant mice demonstrated disrupted callus healing and asymmetry. Asymmetry of Scx-mutant callus was not due to muscle unloading. Wild-type littermates (age matched) served as controls. This is the first study to explore the role of Scx in cortical bone mechanics and fracture healing. Deletion of Scx during development led to altered long bone properties and callus healing.

In this study, we find that adipogenesis is impaired in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably transfected with Siah2 shRNA and that overexpression of Siah2 in non-precursor fibroblasts promotes adipogenesis. In the 3T3-L1 model, loss of Siah2 is associated with sustained β-catenin expression post-induction, but depletion of β-catenin only partially restores PPARγ expression and adipocyte formation. Using wild-type and Siah2−/− adipose tissue and adipose stromal vascular cells, we observe that Siah2 influences the expression of several factors that control adipogenesis, including Wnt pathway genes, β-catenin, Zfp432, and Bmp-4.

High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are grouped into various subclasses composed of multiple proteins and lipids, and their transformation is altered in CKD. We investigated the roles of lipoprotein subclasses in CKD progression, and atherosclerosis, and the relationships with Klotho and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23.Seventy-one CKD patients were enrolled in this prospective cohort study in Japan. The proportions of cholesterol level to total cholesterol level (cholesterol proportion) and lipoprotein particle numbers in 20 lipoprotein fractions were measured by a newly developed high-performance gel permeation chromatography.Diabetic nephropathy was observed in 23.9% of the patients. The mean age was 75.0 years and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 17.2 ml/min./1.73m2. The lipoprotein particle numbers in small HDLs were higher in Stage 4 group than in Stage 5 group (p = 0.002). Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics showed that the cholesterol proportions in very small HDLs were associated with eGFR change rate [F19 β = -17.63, p = 0.036] and ABI [F19 β = 0.047, p = 0.047] in Stage 4 group, and that serum soluble α-Klotho level was associated with the lipoprotein particle numbers in very small HDLs [F19 β = 0.00026, p = 0.012; F20 β = 0.00041, p = 0.036] in Stage 5 group.This study showed that HDL subclasses are associated with CKD progression, ABI, and Klotho level in CKD-stage-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2556132953,"The trehalose biosynthetic pathway is of great interest for the development of novel therapeutics because trehalose is an essential disaccharide in many pathogens but is neither required nor synthesized in mammalian hosts. As such, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), a key enzyme in trehalose biosynthesis, is likely an attractive target for novel chemotherapeutics. Based on a survey of genomes from a panel of parasitic nematodes and bacterial organisms and by way of a structure-based amino acid sequence alignment, we derive the topological structure of monoenzyme TPPs and classify them into 3 groups. Comparison of the functional roles of amino acid residues located in the active site for TPPs belonging to different groups reveal nuanced variations. Because current literature on this enzyme family shows a tendency to infer functional roles for individual amino acid residues, we investigated the roles of the strictly conserved aspartate tetrad in TPPs of the nematode Brugia malayi by using a conservative mutation approach. In contrast to aspartate-213, the residue inferred to carry out the nucleophilic attack on the substrate, we found that aspartate-215 and aspartate-428 of BmTPP are involved in the chemistry steps of enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate. Therefore, we suggest that homology-based inference of functionally important amino acids by sequence comparison for monoenzyme TPPs should only be carried out for each of the 3 groups.-Cross, M., Lepage, R., Rajan, S., Biberacher, S., Young, N.

https://openalex.org/W2557141455,"Transcription factor FoxO1 is a key regulator of the insulin-signaling pathway, and is reported to play important roles in pancreatic β cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and stress resistance. The multifunctional nature of FoxO1 is due to its regulation of various downstream targets. Previous studies in our lab identified potential FoxO1 target genes using the ChIP-DSL technique and one of those genes, Pdcd2l, was selected for further study. We found that the expression of Pdcd2l was increased with palmitate treatment; the luciferase assay result revealed that enhanced Pdcd2l promoter activity was responsible for the elevation of Pdcd2l expression. ChIP-PCR was performed to confirm the combination of FoxO1 to Pdcd2l promoter, result showing that FoxO1 could bind to Pdcd2l promoter and this binding was further enhanced after palmitate treatment. Overexpression of FoxO1 significantly induced Pdcd2l promoter activity, leading to increased mRNA level; consistently, interference of FoxO1 abolished the increment of Pdcd2l gene expression triggered by palmitate treatment. In addition, overexpression of Pdcd2l could further increase the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by palmitate incubation, whilst interference of Pdcd2l partially reversed the palmitate-induced apoptosis together with activated Caspase-3, indicating that the latter may play a part in this process. Therefore, in this study, we confirmed the binding of FoxO1 to the Pdcd2l gene promoter and studied the role of Pdcd2l in β cells for the first time. Our results suggested that FoxO1 may exert its activity partially through the regulation of Pdcd2l in palmitate-induced β cell apoptosis and could help to clarify the molecular mechanisms of β cell failure in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2550044896,"Objectives Estimate the effect of statin prescription on mortality in the population of England and Wales with no previous history of cardiovascular disease. Methods Primary care records from The Health Improvement Network 1987–2011 were used. Four cohorts of participants aged 60, 65, 70, or 75 years at baseline included 118,700, 199,574, 247,149, and 194,085 participants; and 1.4, 1.9, 1.8, and 1.1 million person-years of data, respectively. The exposure was any statin prescription at any time before the participant reached the baseline age (60, 65, 70 or 75) and the outcome was all-cause mortality at any age above the baseline age. The hazard of mortality associated with statin prescription was calculated by Cox’s proportional hazard regressions, adjusted for sex, year of birth, socioeconomic status, diabetes, antihypertensive medication, hypercholesterolaemia, body mass index, smoking status, and general practice. Participants were grouped by QRISK2 baseline risk of a first cardiovascular event in the next ten years of <10%, 10–19%, or ≥20%. Results There was no reduction in all-cause mortality for statin prescription initiated in participants with a QRISK2 score <10% at any baseline age, or in participants aged 60 at baseline in any risk group. Mortality was lower in participants with a QRISK2 score ≥20% if statin prescription had been initiated by age 65 (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.86 (0.79–0.94)), 70 (HR 0.83 (0.79–0.88)), or 75 (HR 0.82 (0.79–0.86)). Mortality reduction was uncertain with a QRISK2 score of 10–19%: the HR was 1.00 (0.91–1.11) for statin prescription by age 65, 0.89 (0.81–0.99) by age 70, or 0.79 (0.52–1.19) by age 75. Conclusions The current internationally recommended thresholds for statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in routine practice may be too low and may lead to overtreatment of younger people and those at low risk."
https://openalex.org/W2552219139,"In neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), alpha-synuclein (α-syn) accumulates to induce cell death and/or form a cytoplasmic inclusion called Lewy body (LB). This α-syn-related pathology is termed synucleinopathy. It remains unclear how α-syn accumulation expands during the progress of synucleinopathy in the human brain. In our study, we investigated the patterns of distribution and propagation of forebrain neurons expressing α-syn in aged macaques. It was found that the occurrence of α-syn-positive neurons proceeded topologically based on the midbrain dopamine pathways arising from the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area where they were primarily observed. In the nigrostriatal or mesolimbic dopamine pathway, the age-dependent increase in α-syn-positive neurons was evident in the striatum or the nucleus accumbens, respectively. Concerning the nigrostriatal pathway, a mediolateral or rostrocaudal gradient was seen in the substantia nigra or the striatum, respectively, and a compensatory increase in dopamine transporter occurred in the striatum regardless of the decreased dopamine level. In the mesocortical dopamine pathway, α-syn-positive neurons appeared in the prefrontal and then motor areas of the frontal lobe. Given that neither LB formation nor clinical phenotype manifestation was detected in any of the monkeys examined in the present study, aged macaques may be useful as a potential presymptomatic model for PD and LB-related neuropsychiatric disorders."

GPCRs form a seven-transmembrane (TM) helical bundle wherein the individual helices are connected by three extracellular and intracellular loops. The helix bundle is attached to an extracellular N-terminal domain of highly variable size and structure, and an intracellular and mostly flexible C terminus that often contains an eighth helix (2.Kobilka B.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) postulates that secondary structures form when the peptide chain partitions into the membrane-water interface. However, proteins destined for membrane insertion are generally subjected to the concerted action of translating ribosomes in the cytoplasm and translocon complexes located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes or in the plasma membrane of bacteria (12.White S.H. von Heijne G. How translocons select transmembrane helices.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 23-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To traffic proteins to membranes in most cells the signal-recognition particle targets the nascent chains emerging from the ribosome tunnel to the translocon complex (13.Martínez-Gil L. Saurí A.

In this co-translational insertion/folding process, segments of sufficient hydrophobicity are laterally gated from the translocon into the membrane interior. A remarkable agreement has been observed between the purely biophysical Wimley-White scale (17.Wimley W.C. White S.H. Experimentally determined hydrophobicity scale for proteins at membrane interfaces.Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar) and the biological translocon scale from the von Heijne group (18.Hessa T. Meindl-Beinker N.M. Bernsel A. Kim H. Sato Y.

This agreement suggests that formation of the TM helices and their insertion into the membrane are largely governed by thermodynamic factors that are related to the amino acid sequence of the GPCRs (12.White S.H. von Heijne G.

Translocons, thermodynamics, and the folding of membrane proteins.FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Folding of polytopic membrane proteins is the result of a series of events that include helix insertion into the hydrophobic core and sequestering of loop sequences into cytosolic or extracellular space (11.Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Helical membrane protein folding, stability, and evolution.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 21.Whitley P. Mingarro I. Stitching proteins into membranes, not sew simple.Biol. Chem. 2014; 395: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The timing of the chain insertion and the localization of TM helices would be expected to be a consequence of the amino acid sequence and the interaction of the growing polypeptide chain with the membrane. Recently, however, the first evidence was obtained that helices might change their location during synthesis of later portions of the polypeptide chain (22.Bowie J.U.

An apparent conceptual problem with the sequential, hydrophobicity-based, folding model is that TM helices of some membrane proteins are only marginally hydrophobic. Helix-bundle membrane proteins display a large number of inter-helical contacts that are often formed between polar or even charged residues (25.Bañó-Polo M. Martínez-Gil L. Wallner B. Nieva J.L.

We noticed that some TM segments of GPCRs that are under study in our lab do not display favorable energies for full membrane insertion (29.Marino J. Geertsma E.R. Zerbe O. Topogenesis of heterologously expressed fragments of the human Y4 GPCR.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 30.Shao X. Zou C. Naider F. Zerbe O.

J. 2012; 103: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), an observation not unlike that reported for individual TMs of bacteriorhodopsin (31.Kahn T.W. Engelman D.M. Bacteriorhodopsin can be refolded from two independently stable transmembrane helices and the complementary five-helix fragment.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6144-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is therefore highly questionable whether in the absence of other interacting helices these “hydrophilic” TM segments would still fully insert into the membrane. To answer whether insertion occurs, topology-mapping methods that use terminally fused reporter moieties have been developed by the von Heijne group (32.Drew D. Sjöstrand D. Nilsson J. Urbig T. Chin C.N. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Rapid topology mapping of Escherichia coli inner-membrane proteins by prediction and PhoA/GFP fusion analysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2690-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although they very successfully allow the rapid attainment of a quantitative picture of the location of the TM termini, they unfortunately do not provide any detailed structural information on the TM segments or on protein-membrane interactions. To address some of these issues we have developed a systematic approach to investigate conformational preferences of N-terminal fragments of the Ste2p receptor, a yeast GPCR, using solution NMR methods. Considering that proteins are synthesized starting with the N terminus of the polypeptide chain, TM1 is expected to be the first segment that is inserted into the hydrophobic core, followed by TM2 and so on (21.Whitley P. Mingarro I. Stitching proteins into membranes, not sew simple.Biol. Chem. 2014; 395: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore report on studies of polypeptides corresponding to the overlapping fragments TM1, TM1–TM2 (TM12), and TM1–TM2–TM3 (TM123) (supplemental Fig. S1). TM1, TM2, and TM7 form a distinct subcore in the fully assembled helix bundle, and, based on analysis of published GPCR structures, often more contacts exist between TM7 and TM1 and TM2 than between TM3 and TM2 (4.Venkatakrishnan A.J. Deupi X. Lebon G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Babu M.M. Molecular signatures of G-protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2013; 494: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have also examined a chimeric three TM helix construct, TM1–TM2–TM7 (TM127). In this construct the N-terminal end of TM7 is linked to TM2 using portions of IL1 (intracellular loop 1) and EL3 (extracellular loop 3, supplemental Fig. S1). NMR is being used to determine conformational preferences of these Ste2p fragments and their overall topology in detergent micelles. As the size of these polypeptides has increased from 60–80 (TM12) to 160–180 (3-TM constructs) residues, the NMR assignments became more challenging. We, therefore, have probed whether chemical shift assignments, which are more easily obtained for smaller fragments, can be transferred to these larger fragments. To ensure that no significant artifacts are introduced by conducting NMR studies in micelles, which do not represent true bilayers, we have also investigated TM127 incorporated into nanodiscs with different lipid compositions. Finally, we have monitored insertion of all these constructs into ER-derived membranes using an established insertion-glycosylation assay to obtain data on their integration into true biological membranes. Our data indicate that TM insertion is indeed context-dependent. The Ste2p fragments TM1 (Gly31-Thr78), TM12 (Gly31-Thr110), TM123 (Gly31-Arg161), and TM127 (Gly31-Thr114, Thr274-Leu340) were expressed as C-terminal fusions to the hydrophobic TrpΔLE sequence (33.Miozzari G.F. Yanofsky C. Translation of the leader region of the Escherichia coli tryptophan operon.J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all fragments cysteine and methionine residues were replaced by amino acids with similar properties (Ser for Cys; Ile, Leu, and Val for Met residues) to retain feasibility of chemical cleavage and preserve functionality of the receptor as reported before (34.Cohen L.S. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biosynthesis of peptide fragments of eukaryotic GPCRs in Escherichia coli by directing expression into inclusion bodies.J. Pept.

Biol. 2002; 317: 765-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several Escherichia coli expression strains (BL21(DE3), BL21-AI, BL21(DE3) pLysS, BL21(DE3) STAR pLysS, BL21 Rosetta pLysS, C41, and C43) were screened for expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 70% TFA and, following chemical cleavage of the fusion proteins with CNBr, polypeptides of interest were purified using RP-HPLC. This resulted in expression yields of about 15 and 5 mg of purified protein per liter of 15N,13C-labeled and 15N,13C,2H-labeled M9 culture, respectively, for TM1 (using the strain BL21-AI), 11 and 5 mg/liters for TM123 (BL21-AI) (36.Caroccia K.E. Estephan R. Cohen L.S. Arshava B. Hauser M. Zerbe O. Becker J.M. Naider F. Expression and biophysical analysis of a triple-transmembrane domain-containing fragment from a yeast G protein-coupled receptor.Biopolymers. 2011; 96: 757-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and 15 and 5 mg/liters for TM127 (BL21(DE3)STARpLysS). Expression details of TM12 have been reported previously (37.Neumoin A. Cohen L.S. Arshava B. Tantry S. Becker J.M. Zerbe O. Naider F.

To obtain additional long-range distance restraints for TM127, the single cysteine mutants S47C, S75C, and S104C containing the full N terminus (Ser2-Thr114, Thr274-Leu340), and an N-terminal His10 tag separated by a cloning insertion coding for a C3 site (His10-Leu-Glu-Val-Leu-Phe-Gln-Gly-Pro-Ser2 … ) were expressed. After RP-HPLC purification, 40 mg of the mutant proteins per liter of 15N-M9 medium culture were obtained. These sulfhydryl-containing mutants were successfully coupled to MTSL maleimide. For NMR measurements, samples were measured in 150 mm 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (LPPG)/dodecyl-phosphocholine (DPC) (4:1 mol/mol) micelles as the membrane mimetic, using 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.4. These conditions were similar to those previously used in our investigation of TM12 (37.Neumoin A. Cohen L.S. Arshava B. Tantry S. Becker J.M. Zerbe O. Naider F. Structure of a double transmembrane fragment of a G-protein-coupled receptor in micelles.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 3187-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The NMR samples of TM1, TM123, and TM127 all exhibit homogeneous line widths and good signal dispersion considering their highly α-helical nature (see Fig. 1 and supplemental Figs. S3–S6). Almost complete backbone assignment and partial side chain assignment could be achieved for every fragment (see below) using three-dimensional triple resonance as well as HCCH and 13C-resolved NOESY spectra. For TM1, 97% of the backbone and 66% of the side chain assignments were achieved. The assignments for TM12 as well as details of its structure calculation have been published previously (37.Neumoin A. Cohen L.S. Arshava B. Tantry S. Becker J.M. Zerbe O. Naider F. Structure of a double transmembrane fragment of a G-protein-coupled receptor in micelles.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 3187-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Samples containing TM123 exhibited a strong tendency to form soluble aggregates. The rate of aggregate formation depended on the detergent and the deuteration scheme; the TM123 sample with reverse ILV methyl labeling (completely perdeuterated protein with only the methyl groups of Ile, Leu, and Val residues protonated) aggregated completely within hours in deuterated detergents. Non-deuterated samples of the same polypeptide aggregated after several days. Aggregation was judged by the NMR line width and confirmed by size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments (supplemental Fig. S2). Despite these challenges about 95% of the backbone resonances of TM123 could be assigned, the only missing residues being the two N-terminal amino acids, as well as two prolines (Pro79 and Pro117) and two residues at the beginning of TM2 (Asn84 and Gln85). Due to the high redundancy of certain amino acids and the resulting spectral overlap, as well as broad lines in the proton-carbon correlation spectra (HCCH-TOCSY and 13C-resolved NOESY) only 55% of side chains could be assigned. In contrast to TM123, TM127 did not aggregate in the micellar environment (supplemental Fig. S2) and it was possible to assign 93% of the backbone resonances and significantly more of the side chain resonances (63%) than for TM123. The two N-terminal amino acids and a region in the center of TM7 containing the Leu-Pro-Leu (residues 289–291) sequence were missing resulting in the slightly lower fraction of assigned backbone resonances despite the higher quality of the TM127 spectra compared with those of TM123. We suspect that conformational exchange in TM7 broadens these latter signals beyond detection. Selective reverse methyl labeling of Ile, Leu, and Val allowed us to assign most of the methyl groups but many of the remaining side chain atoms could not be uniquely assigned. As is often the case with membrane proteins, only a small number of these assignments yielded unambiguous NOE restraints. TM12 and TM127 or TM123 constitute two pairs of polypeptides in which nearly 80 residues are identical (those from TM12). We used these pairs to determine whether assignments on shorter fragments of GPCRs could be used to facilitate the assignments of the longer fragments. To transfer assignments, we compared corresponding strips in the three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY spectra of TM12 (37.Neumoin A. Cohen L.S. Arshava B. Tantry S. Becker J.M. Zerbe O. Naider F. Structure of a double transmembrane fragment of a G-protein-coupled receptor in micelles.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 3187-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with those of TM123 and TM127 for residues from TM1 and TM2. The rationale behind this approach is that the amide protons of a given residue will be close to protons from its own side chain or from neighboring residues, but will likely not be close to side chain protons from other helices that form tertiary contacts. In fact, it is very rare to observe inter-chain NOEs for HN interactions with side chain protons of even closely packed helices because these are almost always more than 5 Å apart. Starting with cross-peaks in the TM123 or TM127, 15N,1H correlation spectra that were in the vicinity of an assigned peak in the TM12 correct assignment was derived from a peak pattern match of strips in the three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY spectrum. When using 15N,1H-HSQC and three-dimensional 15N-NOESY spectra were recorded at 900 MHz, 70 (93%) of the 75 strips of TM12 could be matched correctly for TM127. Similarly, 68 (90%) of the 75 strips of TM12 were successfully matched for the TM123 fragment. Details on this assignment procedure will be reported elsewhere. 4M. Poms, S. Jurt, P. Güntert, and O. Zerbe, unpublished data. Usually, structure calculations of helical membrane proteins suffer from an insufficient number of long-range restraints, partially due to the fact that complete side chain assignments are difficult to obtain. More importantly, suboptimal packing of helices in the not fully formed helix bundle, the fact that detergents are not a perfect mimic for biological membranes, and the inherent flexibility of membrane proteins result in exchange broadening that tends to damp out the weak but structurally important long-range NOEs. To compensate for the low number of NOE restraints, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs), and chemical shift-derived restraints were used. We have also probed access to a water-soluble spin label to reveal which residues are solvent exposed. All these data were used to obtain restraints for the final structure calculation and to orient the fragments in the micelles. To judge how well primary NMR data were represented by the ensemble, back-prediction of the raw data from conformers of the NMR ensemble was carried out. Based on TALOS-N (38.Shen Y. Bax A. Protein backbone and sidechain torsion angles predicted from NMR chemical shifts using artificial neural networks.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 56: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), backbone chemical shift data were used to predict the propensity of regions of Ste2p to form helices (Fig. 2). In general, all putative helices seem to be in the regions that are predicted by hydropathy algorithms. However, in the single TM fragment TM1 is clearly destabilized in the center of the helix around a GXXXG (GVRSG, residues 56–60) motif. In contrast this same region is significantly rigidified upon packing against TM2 in TM12. Accordingly the largest chemical shift differences between TM1 and TM2 for the overlapping segment are observed for the GVRSG residues (supplemental Fig. S8). The rigidification of the GVRSG region in TM1 is also observed in TM123 and TM127. Despite this rigidification there is a small but reproducible destabilization of the TM1 helices in the GVRSG domain also in the longer constructs. Based on the TALOS predictions the N-terminal end of the TM2 helix is destabilized in TM12, TM123, and TM127. In the latter polypeptide some assignments are missing, possibly indicating the presence of conformational exchange. A short helix in the extracellular segment from"
https://openalex.org/W2551404175,"Overexpression of mutant p53 is a common finding in most cancers but testicular tumours accumulate wild-type p53 (wtp53). In contrast to the accepted concept that p53 homozygous mutant mice do not accumulate mutant p53 in normal cells, our study on a mutant p53 mouse model of Li-Fraumeni syndrome harbouring the hot-spot p53R172H mutation described an elevated level of mutant p53 in non-cancerous mouse tissues. Here we use detailed immunohistochemical analysis to document the expression of p53R172H in mouse testis. In developing and adult testes, p53R172H was expressed in gonocytes, type A, Int, B spermatogonia as well as in pre-Sertoli cells and Leydig cells but was undetectable in spermatocytes and spermatids. A similar staining pattern was demonstrated for wtp53. However, the intensity of wtp53 staining was generally weaker than that of p53R172H, which indicates that the expression of p53R172H can be a surrogate marker of p53 gene transcription. Comparing the responses of wtp53 and p53R172H to irradiation, we found persistent DNA double-strand breaks in p53R172H testes and the formation of giant spermatogonia (GSG) following persistent DNA damage in p53R172H and p53-null mice. Strikingly, we found that p53R172H promotes spontaneous formation of GSG in non-stressed p53R172H ageing mice. Two types of GSG: Viable and Degenerative GSG were defined. We elucidate the factors involved in the formation of GSG: the loss of p53 function is a requirement for the formation of GSG whereas DNA damage acts as a promoting trigger. The formation of GSG does not translate to higher efficacy of testicular tumorigenesis arising from mutant p53 cells, which might be due to the presence of delayed-onset of p53-independent apoptosis."
