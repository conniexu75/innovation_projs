https://openalex.org/W2018607339,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is comprised of a heterogeneous population of cells. It is unclear which cells within the tumor mass are responsible for tumor initiation and maintenance. In this study, we report that brain tumor stem cells can be identified from adult GBMs. These tumor stem cells form neurospheres, possess the capacity for self-renewal, express genes associated with neural stem cells (NSCs), generate daughter cells of different phenotypes from one mother cell, and differentiate into the phenotypically diverse populations of cells similar to those present in the initial GBM. Having a distinguishing feature from normal NSCs, these tumor stem cells can reform spheres even after the induction of differentiation. Furthermore, only these tumor stem cells were able to form tumors and generate both neurons and glial cells after in vivo implantation into nude mice. The identification of tumor stem cells within adult GBM may represent a major step forward in understanding the origin and maintenance of GBM and lead to the identification and testing of new therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W2027742580,"Angiogenin is an angiogenic protein that undergoes nuclear translocation in endothelial cells where it accumulates in the nucleolus and stimulates rRNA transcription, a rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, and cell growth. Here, we report that angiogenin is required for cell proliferation induced by various other angiogenic proteins including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Downregulation of angiogenin in endothelial cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense results in a decrease in rRNA transcription, ribosome biogenesis, and cell proliferation induced by these angiogenic factors. Inhibitors of the nuclear translocation of angiogenin abolish the angiogenic activities of these factors. Stable angiogenin antisense transfection in HeLa cells reduces tumor angiogenesis in athymic mice despite the elevated expression level of bFGF and VEGF. Thus, nuclear angiogenin assumes an essential role in endothelial cell proliferation and is necessary for angiogenesis induced by other angiogenic factors. Angiogenin-stimulated rRNA transcription in endothelial cells may thus serve as a crossroad in the process of angiogenesis induced by various angiogenic factors."

https://openalex.org/W2163820705,"Profiles of gene transcription have begun to delineate the molecular basis of ovarian cancer, including distinctions between carcinomas of differing histology, tumor progression and patient outcome. However, the similarities and differences among the most commonly diagnosed noninvasive borderline (low malignant potential, LMP) lesions and invasive serous carcinomas of varying grade (G1, G2 and G3) have not yet been explored. Here, we used oligonucleotide arrays to profile the expression of 12,500 genes in a series of 57 predominantly stage III serous ovarian adenocarcinomas from 52 patients, eight with borderline tumors and 44 with adenocarcinomas of varying grade. Unsupervised and supervised analyses showed that LMP lesions were distinct from high-grade serous adenocarcinomas, as might be expected; however, well-differentiated (G1) invasive adenocarcinomas showed a strikingly similar profile to LMP tumors as compared to cancers with moderate (G2) or poor (G3) cellular differentiation, which were also highly similar. Comparative genomic hybridization of an independent cohort of five LMP and 63 invasive carcinomas of varying grade demonstrated LMP and G1 were again similar, exhibiting significantly less chromosomal aberration than G2/G3 carcinomas. A majority of LMP and G1 tumors were characterized by high levels of p21/WAF1, with concomitant expression of cell growth suppressors, gadd34 and BTG-2. In contrast, G2/G3 cancers were characterized by the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle and by STAT-1-, STAT-3/JAK-1/2-induced gene expression. The distinction between the LMP-G1 and G2-G3 groups of tumors was highly correlated to patient outcome (chi(2) for equivalence of death rates=7.681189; P=0.0056, log-rank test). Our results are consistent with the recent demonstration of a poor differentiation molecular 'meta-signature' in human cancer, and underscore a number of cell-cycle- and STAT-associated targets that may prove useful as points of therapeutic intervention for those patients with aggressive disease."

Here we report the regulation of telomere length by production of a diphosphorylinositol tetrakisphosphate, PP-IP4, synthesized by the KCS1 gene product. Loss of PP-IP4 production results in lengthening of telomeres, whereas overproduction leads to their shortening. This effect requires the presence of Tel1, the yeast homologue of ATM, the protein mutated in the human disease ataxia telangiectasia. Our data provide in vivo evidence of a regulatory link between inositol polyphosphate signaling and the checkpoint kinase family and describe a third nuclear process modulated by phospholipase C activation. Activation of phospholipase C-dependent inositol polyphosphate signaling pathways generates distinct messengers derived from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that control gene expression and mRNA export.

Our data provide in vivo evidence of a regulatory link between inositol polyphosphate signaling and the checkpoint kinase family and describe a third nuclear process modulated by phospholipase C activation. Appropriate cellular responses to environmental changes involve intracellular second messenger systems that transduce the signals from cytoplasm to nucleus, thereby initiating adaptive genetic programs. One well described intracellular messenger system works through receptor-coupled activation of phospholipase C (PLC), 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; IP, inositol phosphate; IP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP4, inositol tetrakisphosphate; IP5, inositol pentakisphosphate; PP-IP4, diphosphorylinositol tetrakisphosphate; PP2-IP3, (bis)diphosphorylinositol trisphosphate; PP-IP5, diphosphorylinositol pentakisphosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kin–, catalytically inactive kinase; PIKK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase. which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to yield inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (reviewed in Refs. 1Berridge M.J.

In metazoans, cellular production of IP3 functions as a signal for calcium release from intracellular stores through allosteric activation of an IP3 receptor channel. Recent studies indicate that IP3 also plays an important role as precursor to multiple inositol polyphosphates (IPs), each with potentially unique signaling capability (reviewed in Ref. 3Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). This signaling potential is not restricted to the cytoplasm, because IPs are known to function in nuclear processes in budding yeast (reviewed in Ref. 4York J.D. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2003: 229-232Google Scholar). Activation of yeast phospholipase C (Plc1) produces IP3, which is rapidly phosphorylated by the dual specificity 6-/3-kinase Ipk2 (initially cloned as ArgRIII/Arg82 (5Dubois E. Messenguy F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) to yield IP4 and IP5 (6Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

IP5 is then phosphorylated by the 2-kinase Ipk1, generating IP6, which is required for efficient mRNA export from the nucleus (12York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R.

Both IP5 and IP6 can be converted to the diphosphoryl inositols PP-IP4 and PP-IP5 through the action of Kcs1, a kinase required for normal vacuolar morphology (15Huang C.F. Voglmaier S.M.

A nuclear role for Kcs1 is implied by its initial cloning as a regulator of mitotic DNA recombination, and inositol kinase activity is required for this regulation, but further understanding of its nuclear activity is lacking (20Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Yu H. Nagata E. Ye K. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recent work has provided further linking of IP production and nuclear function through an important family of protein serine/threonine kinases known as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related kinases (PIKKs). IP6 stimulates DNA repair by non-homologous end joining with mammalian proteins in vitro (22Hanakahi L.A. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Non-homologous end joining can be reconstituted in vitro with a limited number of purified proteins, including the Ku heterodimer, which binds DNA ends and IP6 (23Ma Y. Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Other PIKKs, namely ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) gene products in mammalian cells and Tel1 and Mec1 in yeast, have been shown to have important activities in DNA damage checkpoint and telomere maintenance (27Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 28Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 29Zhou B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Telomeres are specialized protein-nucleic acid structures at the ends of linear, eukaryotic chromosomes that preserve genetic information during DNA replication, promote genomic stability, and are important in both cellular senescence and oncogenic transformation (reviewed in Refs. 30Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 108: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 31Vega L.R. Mateyak M.K. Zakian V.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Smogorzewska A. De Lange T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 177-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Telomeric DNA is maintained through the action of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, which acts in late S-phase to add template-independent, species-specific TG-rich repeats to the lagging strand, ensuring that chromosome length and coding sequences are maintained. Telomere length is heterogeneous among chromosomes and cells, with the average length established by a dynamic equilibrium between forces that shorten (exonuclease access, low telomerase activity) and those that lengthen telomeric sequences (capping proteins, high telomerase activity). Here we describe a role for the phospholipase C-dependent IP signaling pathway in the regulation of telomere length through production of an inositol diphosphate, PP-IP4, synthesized by Kcs1. This modulation is dependent on Tel1 providing a functional connection between PIKKs and inositol phosphates in vivo. Strains, Media, and Genetic Methods—Yeast strains used in this study are isogenic with W303α (leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 ura3–1 ade2–1 trp1–1 rad5–535 can1–100) except for changes introduced by transformation as indicated. Yeast were grown either in standard rich (yeast-peptone-dextrose) medium or in complete minimal medium containing 2% glucose or galactose and lacking appropriate nutrients to verify and maintain plasmids and markers. Yeast genetic manipulations were performed using standard procedures. Deletion strains plc1::KANMX, ipk2::KANMX, ipk1::KANMX, tel1::ura3, and yku70::ura3 ura3::HIS3 were generated as described previously (7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Double and triple deletion strains were constructed by mating to isogenic strains of the opposite mating type followed by sporulation of the resulting diploid and dissection of tetrads. Nutrient requirements, inositol labeling, and PCR were used to screen spores for double mutations. The entire KCS1 and DDP1 open reading frames were deleted from the diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303 and replaced with the selectable marker HIS3 as described (35Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrads were dissected using a Zeiss micromanipulator following sporulation of the heterozygous diploids on 0.3% potassium acetate plates. The kcs1::HIS3 and ddp1::HIS3 spores both segregated 2:2 (not shown) and were identified by growth patterns on medium lacking histidine as well as by PCR analysis. Gene Identification and Plasmid Construction—To identify candidate mammalian inositol diphosphoryl synthases, human expressed sequence tag data bases were searched with BLASTP, gapped BLASTP, or TBLASTN with appropriate query sequences. The full-length human cDNA 646420 (designated as hIP6K, an orthologue of yeast Kcs1) was obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. as an insert in pBluescript SK(–). The entire open reading frame minus the codons for the first six amino-terminal amino acids was inserted in-frame into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pGEX-KG, derived from pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) and kindly donated by Dr. John Moskow in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Lew (Duke University, Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology), to generate pGEX-hIP6K. The entire open reading frame of the KCS1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and inserted into a pGEX vector to create an amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion. Primers were designed to incorporate EcoRI sites in-frame with the initiation sites and to place XhoI sites after the stop codons. Catalytically inactive Kcs1 was generated by a PCR strategy converting both Asp791 and Lys793 to alanine. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by sequencing the resulting construct termed pGEX-kcs1kin–. Complementation analyses in haploid kcs1Δ strains were performed by expressing wild type and catalytically inactive forms of Ksc1 and hIP6K using the episomal plasmid pRS426 containing a galactose-inducible promoter. In each case, the insert was removed from the pGEX vector with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pRS426GAL. These constructs were termed pRS-KCS1, pRS-kcs1kin–, and pRS-hIP6K. The construct for PLC1 overexpression was based on pYEX4T, modified by removal of the LEU2 sequence. The entire PLC1 coding sequence was removed in a BamHI-NotI fragment from the pGAL1–10-PLC1 vector described previously and provided by Dr. Jeremy Thorner (6Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This fragment was inserted into the modified multiple cloning site of the pYEX4T vector behind the CUP1 promoter with the resulting plasmid pYEX-PLC1. Inositol Radiolabeling of Yeast—Approximately 105 cells were inoculated into 1 ml of appropriately modified complete minimal medium containing myo-[3H]inositol (American Radiolabel Corporation, St. Louis, MO) and were labeled for 24 h with shaking at 30 °C. Soluble inositols were harvested as described (35Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Water-soluble inositol isomers were frozen quickly in a dry ice-isopropanol bath and stored at–80 °C prior to HPLC analysis. To analyze inositol isomers, samples were thawed, equilibrated to 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, and resolved on a 4.6 × 125-mm Partisphere SAX-HPLC strong anion exchange column (Whatman). Samples were eluted with the following gradient: 10 mm ammonium phosphate increased linearly to 1.7 m ammonium phosphate over 25 min followed by an isocratic flow at 1.7 m ammonium phosphate for 50 min. Radioactivity was measured using a BetaRAM™ in-line detector (INUS Systems, Tampa, FL). Individual IP isomers were assigned in the chromatograms as described (12York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). PP-IP4 and PP-IP5 were assigned based on published elution profiles and sensitivity to hydrolysis by mammalian diphosphoryl inositol pyrophosphatase (36Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Southern Analysis of Telomere Length—Details of this analysis are as published previously (37Ritchie K.B. Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared from 5-ml cultures grown to saturation and digested with PstI before electrophoresis on a 1% Tris borate-EDTA-agarose gel. The fragments were transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized at 65 °C to a probe derived from pYT14 containing telomeric DNA and a portion of the Y′ subtelomeric repeat. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Note that the Southern blot strategies are the accepted methods in the field; however, the effect appears small because the PstI site used for cleaving is about 800 bp from the chromosome end. Thus less than half of the fragment is composed of telomeric sequences. The bottom smear represents the terminal fragment resulting from cutting at the last Y′ elements (one of the subtelomeric repeats) on the chromosome. The bands near the top of the gel reflect hybridization to fragments generated by cutting tandem Y′ elements of two different sizes. These bands vary in intensity, even in wild-type strains, probably as a consequence of a high rate of unequal recombination. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that there is a somewhat higher rate of this type of recombination in one or more of the mutants, none of them has the dramatic phenotype seen in yeast strains undergoing alternative lengthening of telomere recombination, where the upper bands become extremely prominent. For example, see Fig. 3 in Ritchie et al. (37Ritchie K.B. Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Genetics of Inositol Polyphosphate Synthesis in S. cerevisiae—A graphic summary of the metabolism of soluble inositol phosphates in budding yeast is depicted in Fig. 1. A single phospholipase C (Plc1) and three inositol polyphosphate kinases, Ipk2, Ipk1, and Kcs1, function to generate over seven species of water-soluble IP messengers. Plc1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to release IP3 from the membrane (6Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). IP3 serves as substrate for the nuclear inositol kinase Ipk2 (also known as Arg82), which phosphorylates both the D-6 and D-3 position hydroxyl groups to produce IP5 (7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 38Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). IP5 is phosphorylated at the 2-hydroxyl by Ipk1 to generate IP6 (12York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Kcs1 has been reported to function as a inositol diphosphoryl synthase to produce PP-IP4 and PP-IP5 from IP5 and IP6 substrates, respectively (17Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of inositol diphosphates occurs through a phosphatase Ddp1 (36Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To further study the role of these kinases and phosphatases in inositol metabolism we analyzed a series of yeast mutant strains using isotopic equilibrium radiolabeling. Steady state metabolic radiolabeling of wild-type yeast cells with [3H]inositol indicates that the major soluble IP is IP6, representing ∼2% of the recovered radioactivity from soluble cellular extracts (Fig. 2). Other IPs, including PP-IP5, are present at low levels but are not observed under these labeling conditions (therefore HPLC traces only show relevant times of elution). A significant branch point in the IP pathway is exposed in metabolically labeled cells upon deletion of the IP5 2-kinase (ipk1Δ) cells, which accumulate IP5 and a diphosphoryl inositol, PP-IP4 (Fig. 2A) (12York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Deletion of KCS1 in the ipk1Δ strain abrogates the peak of PP-IP4, which can be complemented with active Kcs1; thus production of PP-IP4 is primarily dependent on Kcs1 in vivo (Fig. 2A) (17Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Disruption of KCS1 alone does not alter IP6 levels, demonstrating that PP-IP4 is not required for synthesis of IP6 (Fig. 2A). Disruption of the DDP1 gene exposes a peak of PP-IP5, which is not seen at appreciable levels in wild-type cells (Fig. 2B) (36Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Elimination of KCS1 in the ddp1Δ strain (kcs1Δ ddp1Δ) leads to an increase rather than an ablation of PP-IP5 production (Fig. 2B), demonstrating the existence of a second inositol diphosphoryl synthase (designated Ids1), which phosphorylates IP6 to a PP-IP5 isomer (see Fig. 1 schematic). This is surprising in light of the published work of others that Kcs1 is the major IP6 kinase activity in yeast (17Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts prepared from kcs1Δ ddp1Δ mutants have significant IP6 kinase activity, further indicating the presence of a second kinase (data not shown). Additionally, it does not appear that Ids1 is encoded by IPK2, as extracts from ipk2Δ kcs1Δ mutant cells harbor IP6 kinase activity, and we were not able to detect this activity using recombinant Ipk2 under a range of conditions (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the chemical nature of the PP-IP5 isomers generated by Kcs1 and Ids1 are not known; thus it is plausible that these kinases phosphorylate different positions, thereby generating distinct PP-IP5 products that are not resolved by our HPLC analysis. The observed elevation of PP-IP5 in the kcs1Δ ddp1Δ strain suggests either that: 1) Ids1 activity is negatively regulated by Kcs1 and/or one of its products; or 2) Kcs1 converts the product of Ids1 to PP2-IP4; thus when Kcs1 is deleted, PP-IP5 accumulates. Ids1 activity may also function as a minor kinase relative to Kcs1 in the synthesis of PP-IP4 from Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 as analysis of ipk1Δ kcs1Δddp1Δ mutant cells reveals a small but significant peak of PP-IP4 (not shown). Furthermore, PP2-IP3 derivatives are observed when DDP1 is eliminated in ipk1Δ strains; however, it is not known whether Kcs1 or Ids1 activity is responsible for generating this product(s). Collectively, our new results along with previously published data lead to the schematic pathway depicted in Fig. 1. Inositol Phosphates and Telomere Length in Vivo—Evidence implicating IPs in the regulation of nuclear function and DNA repair processes in mammalian and yeast systems provided the impetus to examine these pathways in budding yeast. Examination of non-homologous end joining repair in plc1, ipk2, ipk1, or kcs1 mutant yeast revealed that loss of inositol signaling pathways does not result in detectable disruption of non-homologous end joining in living yeast (data not shown). It is of interest that yeast possess two PIKKs, Tel1 and Mec1, which are orthologues of ATM and ATR that play an important evolutionarily conserved role in the regulation of telomere length. We therefore continued our examination of PIKK-related function by determining the length of telomeres in yeast defective in inositol metabolism. We find that strains with the genotypes plc1Δ, ipk2Δ, or kcs1Δ have similarly elongated telomeres, averaging 375 bp as compared with the average of 325 bp observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ipk1Δ cells have telomeres slightly shorter than wild type (Fig. 3A). The change in IP profile shared among the first three mutant strains is the inability to synthesize the diphosphoryl inositols PP-IP4 (and downstream higher phosphorylated forms such as PP2-IP3) and PP-IP5 (Fig. 1). The ipk1Δ cells have a telomere shift in the opposite direction, fail to synthesize IP6 and PP-IP5, and have increased PP-IP4 levels (Fig. 2). This finding clearly demonstrates that loss of PP-IP5 production is not responsible for the lengthened telomeres. Instead, these data implicate PP-IP4 production or a downstream metabolite as a negative regulator of telomere length. Importantly, kcs1Δ cells do not universally display the defects in gene expression or mRNA export observed in plc1Δ, ipk2Δ,or ipk1Δ cells, suggesting that the observed telomere phenotype is distinct from the previously reported nuclear activities of IP4,IP5, and/or IP6. Furthermore, the kcs1Δ ddp1Δ strain, which accumulates large amounts of PP-IP5, has long telomeres identical to kcs1Δ alone (not shown). Wild-type telomere length is observed in ddp1Δ strains, and double and triple mutants for ddp1Δ, ipk1Δ, and kcs1Δ are consistent with loss of Kcs1 being a dominant phenotype. Collectively, these results implicate phospholipase C-dependent PP-IP4 production through Kcs1 activity as a negative regulator of telomere length. To test whether increases in PP-IP4 production would lead to further telomere shortening, we overexpressed PLC1 in several mutant strains, which (based on our previous studies) significantly elevates IP production in cells (12York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Wild-type strains overexpressing PLC1 have increased IP6 levels (20-fold), no detectable increase in PP-IP4 levels, and normal telomere length (Fig. 3B). In contrast, ipk1Δ cells overexpressing PLC1 have significantly elevated levels of PP-IP4 (not shown) and undergo further shortening of telomeres to an average length of 265 bp from the 325 bp observed in wild type (Fig. 3B). When Kcs1 is eliminated from this strain, the cells again have a long telomere phenotype (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with a gain of function effect mediated by PP-IP4. Comparing the telomere lengthening in the absence of inositol diphosphates and the shortening seen with increases in Plc1- and Kcs1-mediated production of PP-IP4, we see a range of modulation of telomere length of over 120 bp, accounting for roughly one-third of the total wild-type telomere length (Fig. 3B). To confirm that inositol kinase activity is required for normal telomere length, we examined telomeres in kcs1Δ strains complemented with either wild-type Kcs1, kinase-inactivated Kcs1 (kcs1kin–), or a human inositol diphosphoryl synthase (hIP6K) (Fig. 4). Both Kcs1 and hIP6K expression complement telomere length in the kcs1Δ strain, whereas Kcs1 kinase-inactive expression does not (Fig. 4), demonstrating that kinase activity is required. The ability of Kcs1 to complement in dextrose indicated that the GAL promoter was not “off” and may be leaky in these strains. We therefore performed complementation analysis in the ipk1Δ kcs1Δ strains, which enable detection and quantification of PP-IP4. Indeed, the Kcs1 strains produced significant levels of PP-IP4 even in dextrose, confirming the leaky expression. Furthermore, growth of cells in galactose, which is a strong inducer of GAL promoters, only modestly elevated PP-IP4 levels as compared with dextrose (Fig. 4). Analysis of ipk1Δ kcs1Δ complemented strains confirm that expression of KCS1 restores telomere length equivalent to the ipk1Δ strain alone (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, expression of inactive kinase in this strain not only fails to complement telomere length but also further lengthens telomeres, suggestive of a direct kinase-effector protein interaction at the telomere (Fig. 4). Consistent with this idea, hIP6K only partially restores telomere length to the length observed in ipk1Δ cells in the ipk1Δ kcs1Δ mutant cells, despite PP-IP4 synthesis equivalent to exogenous Kcs1 (HPLC data not shown). These results indicate a requirement for kinase activity and PP-IP4 production, as well as a possible role for a non-catalytic protein component, such as a determinant that mediates proper localization or regulation. Kcs1 Regulation of Telomeres Requires Tel1—With this evidence for PP-IP4 as a regulator of telomere length, we used genetics to identify other components of the novel PP-IP4 pathway. Because of the initial report that IP6 interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase, we considered Tel1 and Ku70/80 to be reasonable effector candidates, because both have important yet independent roles in maintenance of the yeast telomere (34Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We predicted that the effect of PP-IP4 would be absent in cells missing a critical component of the IP effector pathway. Analysis of yku70 mutant cells indicates an average telomere length of ∼150 bp (Fig. 5A), consistent with published reports. Double (ipk1Δ yku70Δ and kcs1Δ yku70Δ) and triple (ipk1Δ kcs1Δ yku70Δ) mutant strains were constructed and tested for telomere length (Fig. 5A). In a yku70Δ background, the loss of Kcs1 function again lengthens telomeres about 50 bp (average length of 200 bp) consistent with Ku and Kcs1 functioning in independent pathways. To probe the gain of the PP-IP4 effect on shortening telomeres in the absence of Ku, we examined telomere length in both yku70Δ ipk1Δ (Fig. 5A) and yku70Δ ipk1Δ overexpressing Plc1 (not shown). Neither condition resulted in further shortening beyond the 150-bp length. Furthermore, we did not find evidence of recombination or senescence to suggest telomeres have reached a critical length, indicating either the gain of function effect cannot be reproduced in the setting of short telomeres or is dependent on the Ku pathway. In contrast, all effects of PP-IP4 at the telomere are abolished in the absence of Tel1. Both the double (ipk1Δ tel1Δ and kcs1Δ tel1Δ) and triple (ipk1Δ kcs1Δ tel1Δ) mutant strains have stable, shortened telomeres indistinguishable from tel1Δ cells (Fig. 5B). This result indicates that the IPs function in the same pathway of telomere regulation as this ATM homologue. Because loss of Tel1 function leads to short telomeres, the data are consistent with Kcs1 production of PP-IP4 acting as a negative regulator of Tel1 function. Here we report a novel role of a phospholipase C-dependent signaling pathway in the control of telomere length. Individual deletion of each of the three enzymes in the synthetic pathway to PP-IP4 causes an identical lengthening of telomeres. The long telomere phenotype is seen in yeast lacking all soluble inositol phosphates (plc1-null) as well as in those lacking only Kcs1 kinase activity, which do synthesize PP-IP5 by way of Ids1 activity. Because ipk1-null cells with no PP-IP5 have the opposite phenotype, loss of PP-IP5 cannot explain the longer telomeres observed. Therefore the kinase activity of Kcs1 must be producing something else, proximal to IP6 on the IP pathway, which is needed for normal telomere length. Because IP5 is a known substrate for Kcs1, the simplest interpretation is that PP-IP4 loss leads to longer telomeres. We cannot formally exclude PP2-IP3 and other molecules downstream of PP-IP4 or Kcs1 phosphorylation of another inositol substrate such as IP4 as the molecules acting at the telomere. Importantly, we also report that further increases in PP-IP4 synthesis lead to further shortening of telomeres. The opposing effects of gain and loss of PP-IP4 demonstrate that this signaling molecule regulates the equilibrium of telomere length. These dual criteria also distinguish Kcs1 and its products from a number of reported genes involved in the maintenance of telomeres in yeast, most of which have only been reported to either lengthen or shorten telomeres but not both. Such regulation by a signaling-activated intracellular messenger pathway puts telomere maintenance under the potential control of extracellular stimuli, providing a mechanism to alter the average telomere length based on growth conditions or other environmental inputs. Because neither the loss nor gain of PP-IP4 has any impact on telomere length in the absence of Tel1, our work also provides a novel functional interaction between IPs and the activity of a PIKK family member, linking two important nuclear signaling pathways. Given that loss of Tel1 and increase in PP-IP4 both lead to shortened telomeres, the simplest explanation is that PP-IP4 inhibits Tel1 kinase function, either through direct or indirect kinase inhibition, consistent with Tel1 being a downstream component of this IP pathway. Assigning Kcs1 a role as a negative regulator of Tel1 activity is consistent with earlier reports of the initial cloning of KCS1 as a second site suppressor of a mitotic recombination phenotype (20Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because loss of Tel1 function increases recombination rates (33Greenwell P.W. Kronmal S.L. Porter S.E. Gassenhuber J. Obermaier B. Petes T.D. Cell. 1995; 82: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Tel1 is not the only potential target of IP regulation as other candidate effectors in this pathway of telomere regulation include the Mre11·Rad50·Xrs2 protein complex components, but their precise biochemical roles at the telomere remain elusive. Because the Mre11·Rad50·Xrs2 complex as well as Tel1 favors lengthening telomeres, they must somehow favor telomerase access to the telomere end, and it is likely that the activity of Kcs1 opposes that access, thus changing the equilibrium to favor average loss of telomere sequence. Given the reported roles for Kcs1 and inositol diphosphates in cellular signaling events, we cannot rule out at this point that other processes are involved. Other important regulators may be gleaned from recent studies describing a genome-wide screen for deletion mutants with a telomere phenotype that yielded many mutants with length alterations similar to the plc1 and kcs1 phenotypes (39Askree S.H. Yehuda T. Smolikov S. Gurevich R. Hawk J. Coker C. Krauskopf A. Kupiec M. McEachern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The components of the PP-IP4 pathway were not identified in this laborious screen; however, the authors concede they failed to identify one-third of the described previously deletion strains with telomere phenotypes. The existence of mammalian homologues for both the inositol diphosphoryl synthases and Tel1 indicates that such an interaction may have important implications for human disease. Our data expand the role of IPs in nuclear function and provide new insights into the complexity of the described metabolic pathways of soluble IPs in yeast. Activation of phospholipase C produces several unique IP messengers, which have been found to modulate nuclear processes including transcriptional control, chromatin remodeling, and mRNA export. We see that the loss of Ipk1 activity uncovers a branch point in the IP synthetic pathway that, despite its low abundance at steady state, plays a significant regulatory role in the cell. Our evidence for a regulatory role of the diphosphoryl inositol PP-IP4 in determining the telomere length set point reinforces the hypothesis that a primordial role of phospholipase C activation is to generate an ensemble of IP messengers to control several nuclear events.

https://openalex.org/W2002160125,"Recently, we observed that suppression of tumor xenograft growth by silibinin was associated with reduction in tumor vasculature and an increased apoptosis. Here, we provide evidence for molecular events associated with antiangiogenic efficacy of pharmacologically achievable doses of silibinin in endothelial cell culture system. Our data show that silibinin almost completely (P<0.001) inhibits growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-dermal origin) together with induction of cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Growth inhibition was associated with a strong induction of G1 arrest accompanied by an increase in Kip1/p27, Cip1/p21 and p53. Apoptosis induction (up to 14- to 17-fold in both cell lines, P<0.001) was an underlying mechanism in silibinin-induced death of endothelial cells. In the studies elucidating the molecular events involved in apoptosis, silibinin caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cytochrome c release from mitochondria. An increase in Bax and a decrease in Mcl-1 proteins were also observed. Silibinin-induced apoptosis involved both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Silibinin also decreased survivin level and inhibited Akt and NF-κB signaling. Two different PI-3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, showed Akt-independent activation of NF-κB. Further, silibinin showed a concentration-dependent strong inhibition of capillary tube formation on matrigel, retraction and disintegration of preformed capillary network, inhibition of matrigel invasion and migration, and a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion by HUVEC. Together, these findings identify pleiotropic mechanisms for antiangiogenic efficacy of silibinin, and suggest its usefulness in angioprevention and antiangiogenic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1983271010,"DNA polymerase β (pol β) and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) are key players in pol β-mediated long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER). It was proposed that this type of LP-BER is accomplished through FEN1 removal of a 2- to 11-nucleotide flap created by pol β strand displacement DNA synthesis. To understand how these enzymes might cooperate during LP-BER, we characterized purified human pol β DNA synthesis by utilizing various BER intermediates, including single-nucleotide-gapped DNA, nicked DNA, and nicked DNA with various lengths of flaps all with a 5′-terminal tetrahydrofuran (THF) residue. We observed that nicked DNA and nicked-THF flap DNA were poor substrates for pol β-mediated DNA synthesis; yet, DNA synthesis was strongly stimulated by purified human FEN1. FEN1 did not improve pol β substrate binding. FEN1 cleavage activity was required for the stimulation, suggesting that FEN1 removed a barrier to pol β DNA synthesis. In addition, FEN1 cleavage on both nicked and nicked-THF flap DNA resulted in a one-nucleotide gapped DNA molecule that was an ideal substrate for pol β. This study demonstrates that pol β cooperates with FEN1 to remove DNA damage via a “Hit and Run” mechanism, involving alternating short gap production by FEN1 and gap filling by pol β, rather than through coordinated formation and removal of a strand-displaced flap.

The mammalian genome suffers from endogenous and exogenous insults that modify DNA. These modifications can be a small single-base lesion, bulky DNA adduct, base dimer, or other type of alteration. Among them, the single-base lesion is the most common form of DNA damage observed in mammalian cells, because it arises from both exogenous DNA-damaging agents (1Lawley P.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1966; 5: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as well as from endogenous biological processes resulting in base alkylation (2Lutz W.K. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar) and oxidation (4Ames B.N. Free Radic. Res.

Additionally, endogenous cytosine deamination and base loss resulting from hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond are important sources of DNA damage (6Lindahl T. Karlstrom O. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 5151-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 8Lindahl T.

It has been estimated that a single-base lesion caused by hydrolytic depurination alone occurs at a frequency of 2 × 103-104 per human cell per day (3Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA base modifications account for a large proportion of the total cellular DNA damage. To preserve genomic stability, mammalian cells have evolved a robust defense mechanism to repair these damaged bases. The repair of small single-base lesions is accomplished through base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; APE, AP endonuclease; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; pol, polymerase; SN-BER, single-nucleotide base excision repair; LP-BER, long patch base excision repair; FEN1, flap endonuclease 1; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; THF, tetrahydrofuran; nt, nucleotide(s); XRCC1, x-ray cross-complementing protein 1; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. (11Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). BER is often initiated by a DNA glycosylase that cleaves the N-glycosydic bond of a damaged base, leaving an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, also referred to as an abasic site or AP site (3Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar, 12Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Subsequently, AP endonuclease (APE) cleaves the sugar-phosphate backbone at the 5′-side of the AP site resulting in 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) groups at the margins of a one-nucleotide gap in DNA (13Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 14Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 315-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β (pol β) inserts a nucleotide into the gap leaving nicked DNA with a 5′-dRP flap (15Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J.

At this point, the repair will be directed into different sub-pathways depending, at least in part, on whether or not the sugar residue in the flap (i.e. 5′-dRP) has been further modified (i.e. oxidized or reduced). With the unmodified dRP group, pol β removes the 5′-dRP group through its associated lyase activity (16Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), resulting in nicked DNA that will be sealed by DNA ligase. This sub-pathway is designated as short-patch or single-nucleotide base excision repair (SN-BER). However, if the sugar group is oxidized or reduced and not removed by the pol β dRP lyase activity (16Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 17Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Matsumoto Y.

Thus, pol β is considered a key player in both SN-BER and LP-BER (17Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Sobol R.W.

The LP-BER sub-pathway mechanism requires an additional enzyme to effectively remove the modified 5′-dRP-containing flap. This enzyme, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), has been characterized as a multifunctional endo/exonuclease that specifically recognizes and removes a DNA flap (26Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Thus, it is expected that protein-protein interactions and cooperation could be important features of LP-BER. Depending on the involvement of PCNA, LP-BER has been further classified into a PCNA-dependent sub-pathway, where pol δ/ϵ is involved, and a PCNA-independent sub-pathway, where pol β is the only DNA polymerase that mediates LP-BER DNA synthesis (21Dianov G.L.

However, a recent study demonstrated that PCNA can also physically interact with pol β (49Kedar P.S. Kim S. Robertson A. Hou E. Prasad R. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 34: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PCNA may have a role even in pol β-dependent LP-BER. Most studies are consistent with the idea that pol β contributes a majority of the DNA synthesis during LP-BER and that FEN1 is required for processing (i.e. cleavage) the DNA flap intermediate (19Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 32Liu Y. Kao H-I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev.

The substrate specificities of pol β and FEN1 could allow these enzymes to perform reactions in a sequential order during LP-BER. In one scenario, pol β has been proposed to independently displace the downstream DNA strand and create a flap for FEN1 cleavage (19Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 21Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A recent study found that FEN1 stimulated pol β-mediated DNA synthesis on a LP-BER substrate, and conversely, pol β stimulated FEN1 cleavage on a LP-BER flap substrate (48Prasad R. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PARP-1 also stimulated pol β LP-BER DNA synthesis, but this stimulation required the presence of FEN1 (36Prasad R. Lavrik O.I. Kim S.J. Kedar P. Yang X.P. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32411-32414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), suggesting that the stimulation of pol β activity by PARP-1 was somehow mediated through FEN1. Overall, these results indicate that pol β and FEN1 interact functionally. However, the mechanism by which these two enzymes collaborate to achieve efficient LP-BER is not known. Mechanistically, FEN1 could stimulate the substrate binding step and/or catalysis of pol β. Alternatively, FEN1 may remove intermediates that pose a block to pol β-mediated LP-BER DNA synthesis. Thus, in this study, we dissected the functional coordination between pol β and FEN1 on LP-BER substrates in vitro. We initially characterized pol β DNA synthesis on various LP-BER intermediates and found them to be poor substrates for pol β DNA synthesis. Accordingly these LP-BER intermediates would represent barriers to accomplish BER. pol β relied on FEN1 cleavage to remove the barriers and proceed with LP-BER DNA synthesis. A “Hit and Run” mechanism is proposed to describe how these enzymes coordinate their enzymatic activities to accomplish LP-BER. Specifically, alternating pol β gap filling and FEN1 gap generation results in an efficient “gap translation.” Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (7000 mCi/mmol) (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and [α-32P]ddATP (3000 mCi/mmol) and MicroSpin G-25 columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Deoxynucleoside triphosphates were from Roche Diagnostics Corp. Optikinase and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase were from USB Corp. (Cleveland, OH). All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein Expression and Purification—Human pol β and FEN1 were expressed and purified as described previously (48Prasad R. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm (51von Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients used for pol β and FEN1 as calculated by Prot-Param were 21,170 m-1 cm-1 and 21,980 m-1 cm-1, respectively. Oligonucleotide Substrates—Oligonucleotides were designed to generate DNA substrates, including a single-nucleotide gap, a single-nucleotide gap with a 5′-tetrahydrofuran (THF) on the downstream oligonucleotide, a nicked DNA, and various lengths of downstream single-stranded flaps each with a 5′-THF residue in the context of nicked DNA. These substrates mimic various proposed SN- and LP-BER intermediates. The oligonucleotide sequences are given in Table I. Each substrate was constructed by annealing an upstream primer (U) and a down-stream oligonucleotide (D) to a 31-mer template (T). pol β DNA synthesis was measured by following extension of a 5′-labeled upstream primer. The upstream primer was 5′-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and Optikinase. The unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed with a G-25 spin column. The substrates utilized for FEN1 cleavage and gel mobility shift assays were radiolabeled at either the 5′- or 3′-end of the downstream oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]ATP and Optikinase or with [α-32P]ddATP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. These radio-labeled oligonucleotides were then purified using 12 or 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel electrophoresis. A radiolabeled oligonucleotide (U or D) and a corresponding U or D oligonucleotide were annealed to a template at a molar ratio of 1.5:1.5:1, respectively, to generate gapped and nicked DNA or nicked DNA substrates with various length flaps (Table I).Table IOligonucleotide sequencesOligonucleotideLengthSequenceaUnannealed residues are in boldface, and “F” denotes THFntDownstream (D)bThe subscripts describe the annealed product.

An aliquot of each reaction mixture (8 μl) was loaded onto a 1% agarose-1% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was prepared in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer by combining equal volumes of 2% acrylamide and 0.6% bisacrylamide with melted 2% agarose gel in a total volume of 80 ml. Ammonia persulfate (200 μl of 10%) and 20 μl of TEMED were then added into the gel mixture, which was then poured into a horizontal gel electrophoresis apparatus. The enzyme·DNA complex and unbounded DNA were then separated by electrophoresis in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 100 V for 1 h in the cold room (∼4 °C). Radioactive signals were detected with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Bioscience-GE Health) and quantified with ImageQuant version 1.2 software. The concentration of enzyme·DNA complex was calculated from the equation, C = [E] × Ib/(Ib + Iub), where C is the concentration of enzyme·DNA complex, [E] is the concentration of enzyme, Ib is the intensity of DNA·protein complex, and Iub is the intensity of free DNA. Apparent Kd was obtained by fitting the data to a quadratic equation, [pol β·DNA] = 0.5 × (pol β + Kd + DNA) - {[0.25 × (pol β + Kd + DNA)2] - (pol β× DNA)}1/2, where [pol β·DNA] is the concentration of pol β·DNA complex, pol β is the concentration of pol β, Kd is the apparent dissociation constant, and DNA is the concentration of DNA. Enzymatic Assays—pol β DNA synthesis was determined by measuring nucleotide insertion into a DNA substrate. The 5′-end of the upstream primer of these substrates was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP, as described above. In all cases, the 5′-end of the downstream oligonucleotide was phosphorylated. The reaction was performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. pol β, as indicated, was incubated with 50 nm DNA substrate in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 μm dCTP. The reaction mixture was assembled on ice, transferred to 37 °C, and incubated for 10 min. The FEN1 cleavage assay was performed under the same conditions except that the downstream oligonucleotides of the substrates were radiolabeled at the 3′-end. The substrates were separated from the products by 15 or 18% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels, and products were detected by a PhosphorImager and quantified by ImageQuant as described above. Measurement of kobs of pol β and FEN1—The apparent rate (kobs) of pol β nucleotide insertion with nicked-THF flap DNA and nicked DNA substrates in the absence and presence of FEN1 was measured by incubating 1 nm of each enzyme with 200 nm DNA in the same buffer as the one for pol β activity assay. The reaction was initiated with 5 mm MgCl2 and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed from the reaction mixture at various time intervals (0.5–5 min). The apparent rate of FEN1 cleavage on nicked-THF flap and nicked DNA substrates in the absence and presence of pol β was also measured. The substrates for measuring FEN1 cleavage were radiolabeled at the 5′-end of their downstream oligonucleotides. The slopes of the linear time courses were used to calculate the respective turnover numbers where kobs = Vobs/[E]total. FEN1 Stimulates Initiation of LP-BER—Previous studies had shown that FEN1 stimulated LP-BER DNA synthesis activity of pol β (36Prasad R. Lavrik O.I. Kim S.J. Kedar P. Yang X.P. Vande Berg B.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), thereby facilitating LP-BER. To explore the mechanism of this effect, we initially examined pol β DNA synthesis on a nicked-THF flap DNA substrate in the presence of FEN1. This substrate mimics the initial LP-BER transient intermediate, because the single-nucleotide gap has already been filled and the lyase activity of pol β will not remove the 5′-THF residue (16Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 17Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell.

DNA synthesis was measured over an 8-min time interval (Fig. 1). pol β was incubated with the substrate in the presence of 5 μm dNTPs with or without FEN1. In the absence of FEN1, only a small amount (∼5%) of the nicked-THF flap substrate (50 nm) was extended by one nucleotide (Fig. 1, A (lanes 1–8) and B). Addition of FEN1 enhanced the amount of pol β DNA synthetic products by ∼5-fold (Fig. 1, A (lanes 9–15) and B), and this was predominantly in the form of a single-nucleotide insertion synthesis. LP-BER DNA Synthesis of pol β Is Poor on Nicked DNA Substrates—To further understand the influence of FEN1 on pol β LP-BER DNA synthesis, we examined pol β nucleotide insertion on substrates that resemble various LP-BER intermediates. These included a nicked DNA, a nicked-THF flap, a nicked-THF-1nt flap, a nicked-THF-3nt flap, a nicked-THF-5nt flap, and a nicked-THF-15nt flap (Table I and Fig. 2). pol β-mediated DNA synthesis was lowest on the nicked DNA and nicked-THF flap DNA substrates, as compared with the other substrates (Fig. 2). DNA synthesis on longer nicked-THF flaps was lower than that with single-nucleotide gapped and 1nt-gap-THF DNA substrates that mimic SN-BER intermediates (Fig. 2). This was most obvious at lower enzyme concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 nm) where substrate depletion had little influence on the rate of product formation (Fig. 2, compare lanes 10 and 11 with 2 and 3, and lanes 14 and 15 with 6 and 7, respectively). Use of a higher concentration of pol β with the various lengths of nicked-THF flap substrates converted most of the labeled substrates into extended products indicating that all these substrates were fully annealed (Fig. 2, and data not shown). Gel mobility shift assays showed that the binding of pol β onto the nicked and various nicked-THF flap substrates was significantly decreased compared with gapped DNA (data not shown). This indicated that the nicked structures may not support pol β binding, thereby, compromising pol β nucleotide insertion. Thus, the LP-BER intermediates representing nicked DNA appear to form a barrier to pol β DNA synthesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that pol β DNA synthesis on nicked-THF flap and nicked DNA is poor; therefore, the development of a nicked flap intermediate during LP-BER would be a rate-limiting step of LP-BER DNA synthesis. FEN1 Cleavage Activity Is Critical for Stimulating pol β LP-BER DNA Synthesis—Because the nicked-THF flap and nicked DNA are poor substrates for pol β DNA synthesis, they will delay progression of LP-BER. FEN1 could alleviate this block by removing a nucleotide at the nicks, stimulating pol β DNA synthesis, or by stabilizing the interaction between pol β and these DNA substrates allowing an effective pol β-mediated strand displacement synthesis or, alternatively, by destabilizing (i.e. melting) the d"
https://openalex.org/W2041012906,"Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric carcinoma. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is one of the potent proinflammatory cytokines elicited by H. pylori infection. We have evaluated the role of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as one of the mediators of IL-1β release and dissected the signaling pathways leading to LPS-induced IL-1β secretion. We demonstrate that both the NF-κB and the C/EBPβ-binding elements of the IL-1β promoter drive LPS-induced IL-1β gene expression. NF-κB activation requires the classical TLR4-initiated signaling cascade leading to IκB phosphorylation as well as PI-3K/Rac1/p21-activated kinase (PAK) 1 signaling, whereas C/EBPβ activation requires PI-3K/Akt/p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling. We observed a direct interaction between activated p38 MAP kinase and C/EBPβ, suggesting that p38 MAPK is the immediate upstream kinase responsible for activating C/EBPβ. Most important, we observed a role of Rac1/PAK1 signaling in activation of caspase-1, which is necessary for maturation of pro-IL-1β. H. pylori LPS induced direct interaction between PAK1 and caspase-1, which was inhibited in cells transfected with dominant-negative Rac1. PAK1 immunoprecipitated from lysates of H. pylori LPS-challenged cells was able to phosphorylate recombinant caspase-1, but not its S376A mutant. LPS-induced caspase-1 activation was abrogated in cells transfected with caspase-1(S376A). Taken together, these results suggested a role of PAK1-induced phosphorylation of caspase-1 at Ser376 in activation of caspase-1. To the best of our knowledge our studies show for the first time that LPS-induced Rac1/PAK1 signaling leading to caspase-1 phosphorylation is crucial for caspase-1 activation. These studies also provide detailed insight into the regulation of IL-1β gene expression by H. pylori LPS and are particularly important in the light of the observations that IL-1β gene polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that causes chronic gastritis and also peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma. H. pylori-associated gastritis is characterized by severe infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells in the gastric mucosa (1Suerbaum S. Michetti P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). Accumulation and activation of these cells is induced by the local production of chemokines and cytokines.

ELISA and RT-PCR analyses suggest that IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α play important roles in gastric inflammation caused by H. pylori infection. Several potential soluble virulence factors derived from H. pylori are considered to attract or activate neutrophils and mononuclear cells, and there is evidence that H. pylori strain genotype as well as host factors determine the clinical outcome. H. pylori does not invade mononuclear cells. Evidence from our own laboratory (4Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Datta S. Chattopadhyay S Basu J. Kundu M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as well as other laboratories (5Innocenti M. Svennerholm A-M. Quiding-Jarbrink M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggests that H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediates release of cytokines and chemokines from human monocytes. The biological effects of these cytokines may result in the recruitment, influx, and activation of neutrophils in gastric mucosa during H. pylori infection. H. pylori LPS differs from that of Enterobacteriaceae (6Moran A.P. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in its ability to activate inflammatory cells possibly because of structural differences between the lipid A molecules. H. pylori LPS activates inflammatory cells to produce IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α (7Birkholz S. Knipp U. Nietzki C. Adamek R.J. Opferkuch W. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 6: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8 are increased in the antral mucosa of individuals with H. pylori gastritis (8Yamaoka Y. Kodama T.

Microbiol. 2000; 54: 615-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms associated with H. pylori LPS-induced cytokine/chemokine production have not been extensively studied. IL-1β is a potent inflammatory cytokine that is released as a component of the host response against bacterial infection. It is primarily expressed by activated monocytes/macrophages. IL-1β is produced as a precursor molecule, pro-IL-1β, in the cytosol of macrophages. Pro-IL-1β is a 31–34-kDa inactive form of the cytokine, which is later cleaved by caspase-1 to active 17-kDa IL-1β (10Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Ness VanK. Green-street T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T. Cannizzaro L.A. Huebner K. Black R.A. Science. 1992; 256: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The active IL-1β is released and exhibits its diverse biological functions. Soluble mediators of H. pylori are known to induce IL-1β. Of particular significance is the finding that IL-1β gene cluster polymorphisms suspected of enhancing production of IL-1β are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (11El-Omar E.M.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play central roles in innate immunity by recognition and discrimination of specific conserved patterns of molecules derived from bacteria, fungi, or viruses (16Medzhitov R.

The serine/threonine kinase IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is subsequently recruited, becomes phosphorylated, dissociates from the complex and associates with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (22Cao Z.

Investig. 2001; 107: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). MAPKs comprise an important group of serine/threonine signaling kinases that transduce a variety of extracellular stimuli through a cascade of protein phosphorylations, which lead to the activation of transcription factors (27Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar, 28Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

There are three principal MAPK family members: (i) p46 and p54 c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK or SAPK, respectively) with multiple subisoforms, (ii) p38 MAPK with α, β, γ, and δ isoforms, and (iii) p42 and p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). MAPKs are activated by specific upstream MAPK kinases (MKKs) (30Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu L.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Since TLR- and MAPK signaling lead to the control of gene transcription, we explored the role of these signaling pathways in H. pylori-LPS-mediated IL-1β release, and its regulation at the level of transcription. We also explored the pathways regulating proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β. The study described here provides evidence that H. pylori LPS signals through TLR4 to regulate IL-1β transcription driven by NF-κB and C/EBPβ elements in the IL-1β promoter. Whereas regulation at the level of NF-κB involves the canonical TLR4-directed phosphorylation of IκB-α leading to NF-κB activation, regulation of C/EBPβ involves a TLR4/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt/p38 MAPK pathway. We observed a direct interaction between phospho-p38MAPK and C/EBPβ, suggesting that p38MAPK is the immediate upstream kinase responsible for activating C/EBPβ. In addition, PI-3K/Rac1/p21-activated kinase 1(PAK1) signaling also regulates NF-κB, as well as the caspase-1-mediated processing of pro-IL-1β to -IL-1β. We present the novel finding that PAK1 interacts with caspase-1, and that this interaction is blocked in dominant-negative (dn)-Rac1-transfected cells. PAK1 immunoprecipitated from H. pylori LPS-challenged cells, phosphorylated caspase-1 at Ser376 and activation of caspase-1 was abrogated in caspase-1 (S376A)-transfected cells. We hypothesize that PAK1 is a key upstream kinase regulating the activation of caspase-1 at least in some cell types.

Treatment with LPS and Preparation of Cell Lysates—THP-1 cells were treated with PMA and cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates at 5 × 105 cells per well followed by treatment with H. pylori LPS (or E. coli LPS where indicated). The wells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Na-β-glycerophosphate, 4 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4,1mm pefabloc, 1 mm benzamidine) (buffer A) on ice for 15 min. Cell lysates were boiled for 5 min after the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Where necessary, THP-1 cells were first treated with pharmacological inhibitors or vehicle (Me2SO) alone, prior to incubation with LPS. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (in TBS-Tween 20 (1%, v/v) (TBST) with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). Following three washes of 5 min each with TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or appropriate secondary antibodies) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the blots were developed by chemiluminescence using the phototope-HRP Western Detection kit (Cell Signaling Technology) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR5). Western Analysis of Caspase-1 Activation—Transfected or non-transfected THP-1 cells after treatment with H. pylori LPS (20 ng/ml) were pelleted and freeze-thawed three times in 20 μl of cell extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pefabloc). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were boiled for 5 min after addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer before subjecting to Western blotting using anticaspase-1 antibody. Akt Kinase Assay—The activity of Akt protein kinase was determined by using the Akt kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) using glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 as substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, lysates were incubated with immobilized Akt monoclonal antibody. The beads after washing, were incubated with 2 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein as substrate in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 200 μm ATP. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Blots were probed with anti-phospho-GSK-3 antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence. Affinity Precipitation Assay for Rac—This was done as described by Benard et al. (33Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Cell extracts after treatment were incubated with GST-PBD (the p21-binding domain (PBD) of PAK1 fused to GST) in a maximal final volume of 500 μl for 1 h at 4 °C. The bead pellet was then centrifuged for 2 min at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C and washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and twice with the same buffer without Nonidet P-40. The bead pellet was finally suspended in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted for Rac1. Assays of C/EBPβ-p38 MAP Kinase Interaction—In order to study the in vivo interaction between C/EBPβ and p38 MAP kinase, C/EBPβ was immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells treated without or with H. pylori LPS. The immunoprecipitate was boiled in Laemmli buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted for p38 MAPK. In separate experiments, lysates from cells treated without or with H. pylori LPS were incubated with immobilized phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C. Bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and probed with anti-C/EBPβ antibody. In an alternative approach, GST-C/EBPβ-(22–227) was expressed in E. coli BL21, purified over glutathione-Sepharose beads and GST-C/EBPβ-bound beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with lysates from cells treated without or with H. pylori LPS as described by Kovacs et al. (34Kovacs K.A. Steinmann M. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J-R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36959-36965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The bead pellets were washed, suspended in Laemmli buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted for p38 MAP kinase. Affinity Precipitation Assay to Study the Interaction of Caspase-1 and PAK1—His-tagged caspase-1 was expressed in E. coli DH5α by inducing cells using 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h and immobilized on Ni2+-NTA-agarose. The agarose beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with lysates from cells treated without or with H. pylori LPS. The bead pellets were washed, suspended in Laemmli buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (7.5%) gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blotted for PAK1. In order to study the in vivo interaction between PAK1 and caspase-1, lysates from cells treated without or with H. pylori LPS were incubated overnight with PAK1 antibody at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 3 h. Agarose-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electro-transferred, and probed with anti-caspase-1 antibody. Caspase-1 Activity Assays—Transfected or non-transfected THP-1 cells were either left untreated or were treated with LPS (20 ng/ml) and then lysed by incubating with 25 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm pefabloc) on ice for 15 min. The supernatant was kept frozen at–70 °C until used. Lysates (20 μg of protein) were taken in 100 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 200 μm caspase-1 substrate Ac-YVAD-AFC. Fluorescence of the released AFC was measured using excitation and emission wave-lengths of 400 nm and 505 nm, respectively. Phosphorylation of Caspase-1 in Vitro—PAK1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells challenged with H. pylori LPS by incubating with PAK1 antibody overnight followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for another 3 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed twice in kinase buffer (300 mm Tris, 1 m KCl, 1 mm CaCl2,60mm MgCl2,1mm Na3VO4, 10 mm DTT, pH 7.5) and incubated with 5 μg of purified His-tagged caspase-1 as substrate in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ32P]ATP and 7.5 μm cold ATP for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer and phosphorylated caspase-1 was detected by autoradiography of proteins or by Western blotting using phosphoserine-specific antibody. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Titan 1-tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Sciences). The sense primer 5′-AAA CAG ATG GCT TAT TAC AGT-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-TGG AGA ACA CCA CTT GTT GCT CCA-3′, were used to amplify 391 bp of IL-1β mRNA. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified using the following primers: sense, 5′-CCA TCA ATG ACC CCT TCA TTG ACC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GAA GGC CAT GCC AGT GAG CTT CC-3′ to generate a 604-bp product. The PCR conditions for IL-1β mRNA were: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, extension at 68 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To prepare nuclear extracts, cells after treatment were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in ice-cold TNE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 1 min, resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm pefabloc, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine) and lysed by the addition of 12.5 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was suspended in 25 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm pefabloc, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The supernatant (nuclear extract) was immediately frozen and stored at–70 °C. Typically, 15 μg of nuclear extract was incubated on ice for 5 min in a volume of 20 μl containing 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (125 mm HEPES, pH 8, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol) and 0.75 μg of poly (dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA. 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (80,000 counts per minute per reaction) containing the IL-1β gene-specific C/EBP-binding site (5′-TTTTGAAAG-3′) or the mutated oligonucleotide with the mutated sites underlined (5′-GTTTTAAGG-3); IL-1β-specific Spi1 site (5′-TACTTCTGCTTT-3′) or the mutated oligonucleotide with the mutated sites underlined (5′-TACTTAGGCTTT-3′); IL-1β gene-specific NFκB site (5′-GGGAAAATCC-3′) or the mutated oligonucleotide with mutated sites underlined (5′TCTAGAATCC-3′), was added and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The DNA-protein complex that formed was separated from the oligonucleotide on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, which was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For supershift assays nuclear extracts were incubated for 1 h at"

Tse T.E. Rohan J.G. Schaack J. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Tse T.E. Schaack J. Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13049-13054Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Here we sought to directly monitor PDE activity in real-time using a physiological system. It seemed important to analyze such a PDE that could be selectively activated by a specific stimulus and would represent a predominant isoform in the cells of interest to avoid a possible interplay with other PDEs. Among numerous PDEs only PDE2 has been characterized as a cGMP-stimulated isoform hydrolyzing cAMP (11Mehats C. Andersen C.B. Filopanti M. Jin S.L. Conti M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 29-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In PDE2, cGMP binding to an allosteric site in the regulatory GAF-B domain stimulates catalytic activity (12Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which has numerous physiological consequences in vivo. For example, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stimulation of cGMP production and subsequent activation of PDE2 in the adrenal cortex decreases aldosterone secretion, thereby mediating the effect of the hormone on blood volume (7MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ANP stimulates its NPR-A type receptors containing an intracellular guanylyl cyclase domain, thereby generating cGMP, which diffuses in the cytosol and specifically activates PDE2 (13Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme results in the degradation of cAMP, a messenger that induces aldosterone production in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (Ref. 14Spat A. Hunyady L. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 489-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A). Moreover, in bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells PDE2 is not only a predominant isozyme providing almost 100% of PDE activity (7MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also a unique cGMP-binding protein, because in contrast to rat ZG cells cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG; Ref. 15Gambaryan S. Butt E. Marcus K. Glazova M. Palmetshofer A. Guillon G. Smolenski A. J. Biol.

A, signaling pathway in bovine adrenal ZG cells, which regulates aldosterone production. cAMP is produced by adenylyl cyclases (AC), which are activated by Gs protein-coupled receptors, e.g. ACTH or β-adrenergic receptors, or directly by forskolin. cGMP-stimulated PDE2 blocks aldosterone production by degrading cAMP after activation of ANP receptors, which contain a guanylyl cyclase domain (GC). EHNA is a selective inhibitor of PDE2. B, measuring dissociation of cAMP from Epac2-camps. 40 nm solution of purified protein (600 μl) was saturated with 20 μm cAMP, and the bovine heart PDE was added to the cuvette at 10 μm final concentration leading to a rapid dissociation of the bound ligand. Representative experiment, n = 4. C, Epac2-camps is a fluorescent cAMP indicator, which changes its conformation upon the ligand binding (black arrow) that could be monitored measuring FRET between CFP and YFP. D, Epac2-camps was introduced to primary bovine ZG cells by adenoviral gene transfer (YFP emission image). E, addition of ANP to forskolin-stimulated (10 μm, 5 min) cells leads to a rapid PDE2-mediated degradation of cAMP, visualized by a conformational switch in sensor molecules with gain in FRET (increase of YFP and simultaneous decrease of CFP fluorescence).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For real-time monitoring of PDE2 activity we decided to use our very recently developed, genetically encoded, fluorescent cAMP-indicator Epac2-camps, which is capable of detecting cAMP in living cells with high temporal resolution within a physiologically relevant concentration range of 100 nm to 20 μm (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Using this approach we monitor the real-time PDE2 activity in adrenal ZG cells and demonstrate unexpectedly rapid kinetics of ANP-induced PDE2 action, which dynamically overcomes ATCH and isoprenaline-induced cAMP production. Preparation of Adenovirus Expressing Epac2-camps—A E3-deleted adenoviral vector encoding Epac2-camps was generated following standard procedures. After tittering adenoviral concentrations by plague assays conducted on monolayer 293 cultures, a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) between 10 and 50 was used to infect primary adrenal ZG cells 48–72 h prior to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Preparation of Zona Glomerulosa Cells—Bovine (adrenal glands were obtained from a local slaughterhouse) adrenal ZG cells attached to the adrenal capsule were digested with collagenase and mechanically disaggregated as described (15Gambaryan S.

Payet M.D. Chouinard L. Balestre M.N. Guillon G. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 651-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For FRET measurements, cells were plated on glass coverslips (20 mm diameter) at a density of 10,000 cells/ml and after 2 days were infected with Epac2-camps adenovirus. For experiments on aldosterone production and Western blotting, the cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 10–12 × 104 cells/dish. After 3 days in culture the medium was replaced by serum-free medium for 12 h and cells were incubated for 1 h with forskolin, ANP, and ACTH-1–24 peptide (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), then the medium was collected for aldosterone radio-immunoassay (RIA), and cells were harvested in SDS gel loading buffer. Protein kinase A (PKA) activity in samples was analyzed by Western blot using the phosphorylation of the well known PKA and PKG substrate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) detected by monoclonal anti-phospho-Ser239 mouse antibody (18Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Honig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20029-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Equal loading was controlled by Ponceau S staining of the membrane and incubation of the stripped membranes with non-phospho antibody (data not shown). For visualization of the signal, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary antibody, followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Aldosterone RIA—Aldosterone concentration in the culture medium was determined by RIA using a commercially available aldosterone kit (DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany). Statistical Analysis—The data shown are from at least triplicate experiments. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. FRET Measurements—FRET measurements to monitor PDE2 activity in live glomerulosa cells were done 48–72 h after infection with Epac2-camps adenovirus. Microscopic experiments and data analysis were performed as described previously (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Cells were continuously superfused with a buffer (144 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH = 7.3) and challenged with ACTH, isoprenaline, forskolin, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA), and rat 1–28 ANP (Sigma) in different combinations. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements in vitro were performed as described (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Epac2-camps purified from Sf9 cells was diluted in 5 mm Tris buffer, pH = 7.4, to a final concentration of 40 nm (in 600 μl) and saturated with 20 μm cAMP. 0.12 unit (10 μm final concentration) of PDE (EC 3.1.4.17 from bovine heart, Sigma) were added to degrade unbound cAMP and monitor ligand dissociation from the sensor. Epac2-camps Rapidly Responds to Binding and Dissociation of cAMP—Epac2-camps is a cAMP sensor, which is based on a single binding domain of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) fused between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (Fig. 1C). The binding of cAMP leads to a conformational change of the sensor (black arrow, Fig. 1C), which is detected by a decrease in FRET between CFP and YFP. To test whether our fluorescent indicator could be applied to monitoring of PDE activity in live cells, we investigated how fast bound cAMP dissociates from the sensor. In case of slow dissociation this step might become time-limiting for our system, making correct measurements of PDE2 action impossible. After saturating purified Epac2-camps with 20 μm cAMP (with a fast on-rate of 2.0 ± 0.2 s), a high amount of purified catalytically active PDE (10 μm final concentration) was added to the cuvette to rapidly degrade unbound ligand. cAMP depletion led to a fast dissociation of the sensor-bound ligand fraction with an apparent half-life of 2.9 ± 0.3 s (Fig. 1B). At a catalytic activity of the PDE-preparation used of 0.3 mol of cAMP/s/mol of PDE, degradation of cAMP in the cuvette can be estimated to occur with a half-life of ∼3 s. Since cAMP depletion in this experiment is limited by this speed of PDE-mediated cAMP hydrolysis, the real kinetics of cAMP dissociation from the sensor are difficult to estimate but should be even faster than measured, indicating that we can use Epac2-camps to monitor PDE2 activity provided that the latter process occurs with a half-life significantly above 2 s. ANP-activated PDE2 Rapidly Blocks Forskolin-induced cAMP Accumulation—To monitor PDE2 activity in primary adrenal ZG cells, we transfected them with Epac2-camps (Fig. 1D), an inert fluorescent cAMP indicator, without any additional manipulations of the cells. After 2–3 days in culture we performed single-cell microscopic measurements. cAMP degradation by PDE was monitored as an increase of the FRET signal (Fig. 1E). Addition of 10 μm forskolin resulted in a substantial increase of intracellular cAMP (monitored as a decrease in FRET ratio) from basal sub-micromolar levels up to a plateau (Fig. 2A), indicating a saturation of the sensor (≈20 μm). Next, we activated PDE2 in the cells by stimulation with ANP and observed an unexpectedly rapid signal, demonstrating a fast degradation of cAMP by PDE2. After a few seconds delay, PDE2 became apparently active and hydrolyzed the major amount of intracellular cAMP with a half-maximal time constant (t0.5) of 15.5 ± 0.9 s (Fig. 2A). This is at least five times higher than the speed of cAMP dissociation from purified Epac2-camps in vitro (Fig. 1B), suggesting that we can accurately monitor PDE2 activity as a time-limiting process. Using this protocol we measured a concentration response dependence of the ANP effect on PDE2 activity with a half-maximal response at 0.43 ± 0.02 pm ANP (Fig. 2B). This curve appears steep (Hill coefficient of 2.9), presumably due to the fact that the cAMP-sensor does not cover the entire range of intracellular cAMP-levels, causing truncation of the signal at higher cAMP concentrations (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Levels of intracellular cAMP measured in real-time with our system also correlated well with the data of conventional biochemical experiments on aldosterone production and phosphorylation of VASP, a substrate of PKA and PKG (Fig. 2C). In addition to the generally accepted concept that aldosterone production in adrenal cortex cells is critically dependent on cAMP levels, which are regulated by ANP-activated PDE2 (14Spat A. Hunyady L. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 489-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that PDE2 activity kinetically overcomes the forskolin-induced cAMP production, providing a mechanism to hydrolyze extensive amounts of the second messenger. Being intrigued by a fast action of PDE2 on forskolin-induced cAMP in ZG cells, we sought to monitor the activity of this enzyme under different conditions including stimulation of the cells via physiologically relevant G-protein coupled receptors. Monitoring PDE2 Activity under Basal and Agonist-stimulated Conditions—To further characterize PDE2 activity in ZG cells, we used its specific inhibitor EHNA, which at micromolar concentrations allows to selectively block the enzyme, inhibiting other PDEs at more than 100 μm only partially (19Podzuweit T. Nennstiel P. Muller A. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When applying EHNA to the cells under basal conditions, little effect on cAMP could be observed even at 100 μm (Fig. 3A), indicating that basal PDE2 activity in unstimulated ZG cells is very low. isobutylmethylxanthine, an unspecific PDE inhibitor, at 350 μm also had little effect comparable with EHNA (data not shown). In contrast, applying a saturating concentration of ANP activated PDE2, which led to a decrease in cAMP, even though this effect was not as prominent as after forskolin stimulation, corresponding well with the functional data on aldosterone production (Fig. 2C). Next, we monitored PDE2 activity in agonist-stimulated cells, using agonists for endogenously expressed G-protein coupled receptors (Fig. 1A). ACTH as a natural ligand capable of stimulating aldosterone secretion (14Spat A. Hunyady L. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 489-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) induced a slow cAMP accumulation, which could be fully and rapidly blocked (t0.5 of 13.0 ± 3.2 s) by ANP-induced PDE2 (Fig. 3B). This PDE2 effect was inhibited by 10 μm EHNA, applied in addition to ACTH and ANP. Interestingly, the ACTH effect on cAMP production in this case was much stronger. Similar effects have been previously observed for specific PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors and adrenergic stimulation in cardiac myocytes (5Mongillo M. McSorley T. Evellin S. Sood A. Lissandron V. Terrin A. Huston E. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. Pozzan T. Houslay M.D. Zaccolo M. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Upon removal of the inhibitor, ANP-induced PDE2 activity was immediately restored and brought cAMP in cells down to the basal level. The t0.5 for this restoration of PDE2 activity was 18.3 ± 1.9 s, which is comparable with the speed of ANP effects in presence of forskolin (Fig. 2A). EHNA has been demonstrated to reverse the inhibitory effect of cGMP-dependent PDE2 on cAMP-stimulated calcium current in frog ventricular cardiomyocytes after isoprenaline treatment (20Mery P.E. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Fischmeister R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we studied ANP and EHNA effects on β-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP production in ZG cells. The β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoprenaline induced a cAMP signal that was again blocked by ANP-stimulated PDE2 (Fig. 3C). EHNA, comparable with the ACTH experiments, fully reversed PDE2 activity and together with isoprenaline further increased cAMP, exhibiting a half-maximal effect at ≈1 μm (Fig. 3D), which corresponds well with the previously measured constants (19Podzuweit T. Nennstiel P. Muller A. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Mery P.E. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Fischmeister R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar). Again, PDE2 recovery demonstrated rapid kinetics with a t0.5 of 19.8 ± 2.6 s (Fig. 3C). Using the bovine adrenal cells as a model system, here we report the real-time monitoring of PDE activity in live cells. Taking an advantage of the high expression of PDE2, which is responsible for physiological regulation of aldosterone production, we specifically stimulate this predominant PDE isoform with ANP and analyze real-time kinetics of cAMP hydrolysis by PDE2. Extremely fast action of PDE2 could be monitored, which allows to kinetically overcome forskolin, ACTH, or β-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation, to fully block their effects on aldosterone production. Epac2-camps in this measuring system is capable of measuring PDE2 activity due to a much faster ligand dissociation from the sensor (Fig. 1B), as compared with the speed of PDE2-mediated, time-limiting cAMP hydrolysis (Figs. 2A and 3, B and C). In contrast to the classical biochemical studies where the activity of PDE is estimated on a scale of minutes (7MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our real-time live cell experiments reveal that the endogenous PDE2 only needs 15–20 s to decrease intracellular cAMP from high micromolar (saturation of the sensor at ≈20 μm) to submicromolar (the lower detection limit of Epac2-camps at ≈100 nm) concentrations (Figs. 2A and 3, B and C). Such a high catalytic activity and rapid action of PDEs could be crucial for their physiological function to rapidly antagonize cAMP formation in the cells and shut down its signaling. Extremely rapid PDE2-mediated cAMP degradation observed in our experiments could be important for compartmentalization of the cAMP signaling, which might be possible due to much higher speed of PDE-catalyzed cAMP hydrolysis compared with the speed of cAMP production in living cells. Compartmentalization of cAMP is supposed to be regulated by constitutively active PDEs as demonstrated by various experimental approaches, using cyclic nucleotide-gated channels or fluorescent PKA as sensors (5Mongillo M. McSorley T. Evellin S. Sood A. Lissandron V. Terrin A. Huston E. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. Pozzan T. Houslay M.D. Zaccolo M. Circ.

A. 2001; 98: 13049-13054Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This can be concluded from the fact that PDE inhibitors led to the diffusion of cAMP out of the restricted microdomains. In our previous study using Epac-camps in neurons we measured a high speed of cAMP propagation at 40 μm/s without visible barriers (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The speed of ANP-activated PDE2-mediated cAMP hydrolysis in ZG cells, however, is much lower since the cGMP-dependent PDE activity of the whole cell has been monitored. Further studies will need to define the rate-limiting elements in this signaling cross-talk between cGMP and cAMP and to determine the physiological relevance of cAMP compartmentalization achieved by this mechanism. We thank Silke Oberdorf-Maass for help with the adenovirus construction."
https://openalex.org/W2094470771,"Mutations in the PARKIN gene are the most common cause of hereditary parkinsonism. The parkin protein comprises an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, a linker region containing caspase cleavage sites, a unique domain in the central portion, and a special zinc finger configuration termed RING-IBR-RING. Parkin has E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and is believed to mediate proteasomal degradation of aggregation-prone proteins. Whereas the effects of mutations on the structure and function of parkin have been intensely studied, post-translational modifications of parkin and the regulation of its enzymatic activity are poorly understood. Here we report that parkin is phosphorylated both in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The turnover of parkin phosphorylation was rapid, because inhibition of phosphatases with okadaic acid was necessary to stabilize phosphoparkin. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation occurred mainly on serine residues under these conditions. At least five phosphorylation sites were identified, including Ser101, Ser131, and Ser136 (located in the linker region) as well as Ser296 and Ser378 (located in the RING-IBR-RING motif). Casein kinase-1, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C phosphorylated parkin in vitro, and inhibition of casein kinase-1 caused a dramatic reduction of parkin phosphorylation in cell lysates. Induction of protein folding stress in cells reduced parkin phosphorylation, and unphosphorylated parkin had slightly but significantly elevated autoubiquitination activity. Thus, complex regulation of the phosphorylation state of parkin may contribute to the unfolded protein response in stressed cells."

Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that pharmacological activators of HIF-1 (e.g. deferoxamine, cobalt chloride) could also protect cultured primary neurons or an immortalized hippocampal neuroblast line (HT22) from oxidative stress-induced death. However, whether HIF-1 activation is sufficient to abrogate neuronal death resulting from oxidative stress or other hypoxia-independent death inducers remains unclear. To address this question we utilized a HIF-1α fusion protein that partially lacks the domain required for oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1α and that has a VP16 transcriptional activation domain from herpes simplex virus. HT22 cells were infected with a retrovirus encoding either the HIF-1α-VP16 fusion protein or the activation domain of the VP16 protein alone as a control. Expression of HIF-1α-VP16, but not VP16 alone, increased luciferase activity driven by a canonical hypoxia response element, increased mRNA of established HIF-1 target genes, and increased activity of one of these HIF-1 target genes.

Accordingly, suppression of HIF-1α expression using RNA interference prevented oxidative death. By contrast, HIF-1α-VP16-expressing HT22 cells were more resistant to DNA damage (induced by camptothecin) or endoplasmic reticulum stress (induced by thapsigargin and tunicamycin) than were VP16-expressing cells, and suppression of HIF-1α expression using RNA interference rendered HT22 cells more sensitive to death induced by DNA damage or endoplasmic reticulum stress.

It is composed of two subunits called HIF-1α and HIF-1β (1Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both subunits are expressed constitutively; however, HIF-1α is subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. The ubiquitination of HIF-1α is primarily regulated by a prolyl hydroxylase-catalyzed reaction (2Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several converging lines of inquiry argue that HIF-1 can mediate survival responses in the nervous system. First, activators of HIF-1 such as cobalt chloride and deferoxamine can prevent neuronal death due to oxidative stress and ischemia in vitro and in vivo (8Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K.

Second, HIF-1 target genes such as erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have established neuroprotective properties. EPO has been shown to prevent neuronal death due to oxidative or nitrosative stress in vitro or to enhance recovery following stroke or spinal cord injury in vivo (16Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M.

Similarly, VEGF has been shown to protect motor neurons from growth factor deprivation and hydrogen peroxide treatment in vitro and ischemia in vivo (21Sun Y. Jin K. Xie L. Childs J. Mao X.O.

Moreover, conditional deletion of the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the VEGF gene leads to delayed motor neuron degeneration (24Oosthuyse B. Moons L. Storkebaum E. Beck H. Nuyens D. Brusselmans K. Van Dorpe J. Hellings P. Gorselink M. Heymans S. Theilmeier G. Dewerchin M. Laudenbach V. Vermylen P. Raat H. Acker T. Vleminckx V. Van Den Bosch L. Cashman N. Fujisawa H. Drost M.R.

Third, forced expression of HIF-1α can block death due to β-amyloid (25Soucek T. Cumming R. Dargusch R. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). By contrast, HIF-1 also has been shown to be associated with prodeath responses in neurons. A dominant negative form of HIF-1α inhibits delayed neuronal death following hypoxia-ischemia in vitro (26Halterman M.W. Federoff H.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of HIF-1-regulated “prodeath” BH3-only family members, such as BNIP3, has been shown to increase following cerebral ischemia (27Schmidt-Kastner R. Aguirre-Chen C. Kietzmann T. Saul I. Busto R. Ginsberg M.D. Brain Res. 2004; 1001: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Yin X.M. Luo Y. Cao G. Bai L. Pei W. Kuharsky D.K. Chen J. J. Biol.

These apparently paradoxical results have stimulated efforts to define the factors that determine whether HIF-1 activation will mediate prodeath or prosurvival responses. Some have suggested that the cell type examined, the duration of the stimulus, and/or the nature of the stimulus can explain the disparate outcomes. Here we have shown that a cell line that constitutively expresses a form of HIF-1α resistant to oxygen degradation leads to increased or decreased resistance to cell death depending on the injury stimulus. These findings suggested that the nature of the injury stimulus is an important determinant of whether HIF-1 will be prodeath or prosurvival in a given cell type. Plasmid and Retroviruses—A plasmid encoding a fusion protein of amino acids 1–529 of HIF-1α and the herpes simplex virus VP16 transactivation domain (pBABE-puro-HIF-1α-VP16) and a control plasmid encoding only VP16 (pBABE-puro-VP16) were described previously (31Kung A.L. Wang S. Klco J.M. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Short interfering RNAs (siRNA) were cloned into the pSuperRetro vector (OligoEngine) under the control of polymerase-III H1-RNA gene promoter. SiRNAs that correspond to the HIF-1α and GFP genes were designed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The target sequence for GFP was selected as described (32Tiscornia G. Singer O. Ikawa M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1844-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used: the siHIF-1α sense 5′-GATCCCCTGTGAGCTCACATCTTGATTTCAAGAGAATCAAGATGTGAGCTCACATTTTTGGAAA-3′ and the siHIF-1α antisense 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAATGTGAGCTCACATCTTGATTCTCTTGAAATCAAGATGTGAGCTCACAGGG-3′, the siGFP sense 5′-GATCCCCGCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCTTCAAGAGAGAACTTCAGGGTCAGCTTGCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and the siGFP antisense 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAA GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCTCTCTTGAAGAACTTCAGGGTCAGCTTGCGGG-3′ (siRNA targets are underlined). Oligos were annealed and cloned into the BglII-HindIII site of the vector. Murine leukemia virus-based viruses were generated by transfection in 293T cells (Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative, Boston). A pGL2 promoter (Promega) with a 68-bp sequence containing the hypoxia response element from the enolase 1 gene was kindly provided by G. Semenza and used to monitor HIF-1 transcriptional activity (33Semenza G.L. Jiang B.H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Virus Infection—HT22 murine hippocampal cells (a kind gift from D. Schubert, Salk Institute) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, l-glutamine, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were plated on a 12-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml 16 h prior to infection. Retroviral infections of HT22 cells were performed in the presence of polybrene (4 μg/μl; Sigma) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 and 24 h after incubation and were selected with puromycin (4 μg/ml; Sigma). Nuclear Extracts and DNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay— Following infection or drug treatment, cells were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and washed in five packed cell volumes of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) freshly supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μl/ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). This was followed by 10 min of incubation in the same buffer on ice and homogenization in a glass Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle) (34Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 35Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and nuclei were resuspended in buffer (0.42 M KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.5 mm MgCl2), freshly supplemented with dithiothreitol, sodium vanadate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin. The suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the eluted nuclear proteins was collected. Nuclear proteins were used for an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, using an oligonucleotide probe from the erythropoietin enhancer region, which includes the HIF-1 binding site (5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′). Immunoblotting—After washing in cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cell pellets were used for nuclear extract preparation as described above or lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 1% P-40, 0.55% deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After 20 min of incubation on ice, extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Protein extracts were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) using standard procedures. Primary monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1α (NB-100-105) were obtained from Novus Biologicals and against VP16 (clone 1–21, sc-7545) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The bands were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from control and infected cells 1 week following infection and selected with puromycin using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) followed by in-column treatment with DNase (Qiagen). Reverse transcription reaction (30 min at 50 °C) and PCR amplification were carried out with a Reverse-IT™ one-step kit (ABgene, NY) in a thermal cycler PTC-100 (MJ Research, Inc.) with specific primers (Table I). Acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein and β-actin were monitored as housekeeping genes. Primer sequences utilized for VEGF A were described by Elson et al. (36Elson D.A. Thurston G. Huang L.E. Ginzinger D.G. McDonald D.M. Johnson R.S. Arbeit J.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2520-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Primers for VP16, HIF-VP16, HIF-1α, enolase 1, and housekeeping genes were designed using the GeneWorks 2.5.1 program (Oxford Molecular Group Inc.). Total RNA at concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 ng was used for cDNA amplification to confirm the linear range of amplification. cDNA synthesis was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by a 4-min initial denaturation step and by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for VP16, HIF1α-VP16, HIF-1α, BNIP3, NIX, and PUMA primers. VEGF A, enolase 1, β-actin, and phosphoprotein were amplified in a two-step PCR reaction, at 94 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min.Table IPrimer sequencesPrimer nameForward, 5′-Reverse, 5′-VP16TAGACGATTTCGATCTGGACCGTACTCGTCAATTCCHIF-VP16TCACCTGAGCCTAATAGTCCACCGTACTCGTCAATTCCHIF-1αGACAATAGCTTCGCAGAATGCTCGTAACTGGTCAGCTGTGGVEGF ACTGTGCAGGCTGCTGTAACGGCTCATTCTCTCTATGTGCTGGCEnolaseATCGAAGATCCCTTTGACCCAGACCAATCACATGATTGCBNIP3GCAAGGATCCATGTCGCAGAGCGGGGAGCCGAATTCTCAGAAGGTGCTAGTGGAAGTTGNIXAGCAGCTCAAGAGGCAGTTCGAATTTCCAGGGCTTTTCGTCTCPUMACCTCAGCCCTCCCTGTCACCAG3CCTCAGCCCTCCCTGTCACCAGβ-ActinCCTCATGAAGATCCTGACCGTGCCAATAGTGATGACCTGGPOTGTGTTCACCAAGGAGGACCCATTGATGATGGAGTGAGGC Open table in a new tab Luciferase Assay—Stable cell lines expressing an HRE-luciferase reporter were obtained by transfection of HT22 cells with an enolase 1 promoter-reporter construct (33Semenza G.L.

Cells were transfected with a mix of luciferase reporter plasmid and pHygEGFP vector (BD Biosciences) in a 1:100 ratio using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After selection with hygromycin, cells were infected with retrovirus constructs containing either VP16 or HIF-1α-VP16 sequences. As a positive control, cells expressing the HIF-1 reporter were treated with 100 μm deferoxamine (DFO) overnight. All cell extracts were prepared and analyzed using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence was measured with a TR717 microplate luminometer (PE Applied Biosystems), and results were expressed as relative light units/μg of total protein. LDH Assay—Cells were plated in a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using a CytoTox96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega). Results were expressed as a change in absorbance/μg of total protein. Viability—Cell viability was assayed using a CellTitre 96 aqueous assay (Promega). Cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/ml for VP16-infected cells and 5 × 104 cells/ml for HIF-1α-VP16-infected cells and incubated as described above. Distinct initial plating densities were used because because HIF-1α-VP16-expressing HT22 cells divide more slowly than those cells expressing VP16 alone; similar densities would be present at the time of exposure to distinct death-inducing stimuli. Twenty four hours after plating, cells were treated with l-glutamic acid (1–20 mm; Sigma). Camptothecin (Sigma) and thapsigargin and tunicamycin (A.G. Scientific) were used at concentrations from 1 to 10 μm as noted. Expression of Recombinant HIF-1α in Mouse Hippocampal Cell Line HT22—To evaluate the effect of HIF-1α stabilization on survival in response to oxidative stress in an HT22 cell line, we infected these cells with a retrovirus construct encoding the fusion protein containing amino acids 1–529 of HIF-1α and a VP16 transactivation domain or a retrovirus encoding the VP16 transactivation domain alone as a control. The HIF-1α-VP16 fusion, unlike native HIF-1α, should be stable under normoxic conditions because it lacks the prolyl residue at position 564, which is a target for oxygen-dependent hydroxylation and degradation. The fusion protein or the VP16 control was detected by Western blot in lysates from normoxic HT22 cells by using antibodies against HIF-1α or against VP16. Both antibodies under normoxic conditions recognized a band corresponding to the HIF-1α-VP16 protein, and it migrated to the predicted molecular mass of about 90 kDa in HT22 cells infected with the HIF1α-VP16 retrovirus (not shown). These findings demonstrate that the HIF-1α fusion protein, unlike endogenous HIF-1α, is expressed under normoxic conditions. To verify that the functional properties of the oxygen-stabilized, HIF-1α fusion protein are similar to endogenous HIF-1α, several experiments were performed. Four days after the growth of puromycin-selected HT22 transformants, total RNA was isolated and expression of mRNA, which encodes the recombinant HIF-1α-VP16 protein in infected cells, was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Two sets of primers were used. One set of primers (sense and antisense) was complementary to the VP16 transactivation domain; the second set of primers included a sense primer targeted to the HIF-1-α portion and an antisense primer to the VP16 portion (Table I and Fig. 1). RT-PCR assays verified that mRNA expression of each heterologous protein, VP16 or HIF-1α-VP16, was expressed at similar levels in each cell line generated. By contrast, the level of endogenous HIF-1α mRNA was not altered by expression of either recombinant protein (Fig. 1). The heterologous, oxygen-stabilized HIF-1α thus does not alter expression of endogenous HIF-1α. The DNA binding properties of the recombinant HIF-1α-VP16 fusion protein were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide with a canonical HIF-1 binding site (Fig. 2). Under basal, normoxic conditions, electrophoretic mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts from wild type HT22 cells or VP16 HT22 cells show two DNA binding complexes (Fig. 2, c and d). Supershift analysis demonstrated that these complexes contain ATF-1 and CREB (not shown). In response to DFO, an agent known to enhance binding of HIF-1α and ATF-1/CREB under normoxic conditions, HT22 cells show the expected increase in DNA binding of the ATF-1/CREB binding complexes (c and d, lanes 2, 3, 9–11) (8Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K.I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G.L. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as another, slower migrating complex designated “b”. Note that in lanes 3 and 10, complex b is supershifted by an antibody to HIF-1α (supershifted complex designated a) indicating that complex b contains HIF-1α. A distinct, slower migrating complex, h, was detected in nuclear extracts from normoxic HT22 cells that stably express the HIF-1α-VP16 fusion protein (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 9) but not from cells expressing the VP16 protein alone (Fig. 2, lane 4). This complex could be supershifted by a HIF-1α antibody (Fig. 2, lane 6) or a VP16 antibody (Fig. 2, lane 7), confirming that it contains HIF-1α-VP16. Of note, the level of oxygen-stabilized HIF1α-VP16 pro-tein was higher in DFO-treated HIF-1α-VP16 HT22 cells (compare lanes 5 and 9). The level of endogenous HIF-1α after the DFO treatment was comparable with that in controls, both in non-infected HT22 cells (lane 2) and VP16 HT22 cells (not shown). These data demonstrate that the HIF-1α-VP16 fusion can bind appropriately to the hypoxia response element under normoxic conditions. Furthermore, we have shown that the expression of this protein does not alter the basal or induced DNA binding of endogenous HIF-1α. Expression of the HIF-1α-VP16 Fusion Protein in HT22 Cells Can Induce HIF-dependent Target Gene Expression—The ability of the HIF-1α-VP16 fusion protein to activate expression of established HIF-1-dependent target genes was confirmed using a HIF-1 luciferase-reporter assay as well as RT-PCR and immunoblotting of established HIF-1 target genes. For the reporter assay, we used a luciferase reporter construct that contained the HRE (68 bp) from the enolase 1 promoter (HRE-luc). HT22 cells stably transfected with HRE-luc-encoding plasmid were infected either with VP16 (control) or with HIF-1α-VP16. After selection with puromycin, cells were plated onto a 96-well plate and used for the luciferase activity assay. As a positive control, VP16-infected cells were treated with 100 μm DFO. Cells treated with DFO showed an expected 2–3-fold increase in HRE-luciferase activity (data not shown), whereas the cells expressing HIF-1α-VP16 had an ∼60-fold increase in luciferase activity (*, p <0.05, Fig. 3A). To determine whether changes in reporter expression induced by HIF-1α-VP16 are associated with changes in message of established HIF-1 target genes, we examined by RT-PCR enolase 1, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A), BNIP 3, Puma, and Noxa. Indeed, the message for all of these genes, but not β-actin (which does not have an HRE in its promoter), increased in HIF-1α-VP16-infected HT22 cells as compared with VP16 alone (Fig. 3B); the increases were similar to those seen in the VP16-infected cells treated with DFO. In all cases examined (VEGF, enolase 1, and BNIP3, NIX, and PUMA), changes in message were correlated with changes in protein (not shown). Moreover, changes in activity of one of the established HIF-1-regulated genes, LDH, also was evaluated. Cells expressing the HIF-1α-VP16 viral construct had a 2-fold increase in LDH activity (*, p <0.05, Fig. 3C) compared with cells expressing VP16 alone. Taken together, these data demonstrate that HIF-1α-VP16 expression can induce the transcriptional up-regulation of HIF-1-dependent genes and the activity of one of these genes under normoxic conditions in immortalized murine HT22 hippocampal neuroblasts. Does Expression of an Oxygen-stabilized Form of HIF-1α Prevent Neuronal Death Caused by Oxidative Stress?—Previous work from our laboratory showed a close correlation between the ability of iron chelators and cobalt chloride to prevent oxidative death in neurons through their ability to activate HIF-1-dependent transcription in primary neurons and hippocampal cell lines (8Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K.I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G.L. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HIF-1α-VP16 line provides an experimental paradigm in which to determine whether HIF-1 activation is sufficient to prevent oxidative stress-induced death in HT22 cells. Oxidative stress was induced in VP16 or HIF-1α-VP16 lines by continuous exposure of these cells to the excitatory amino acid, glutamate (2–20 mm). Glutamate induces concentration-dependent, oxidative stress-induced death with features of apoptosis (37Tan S. Wood M. Maher P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 38Ratan R.R. Murphy T.H. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress results from the ability of glutamate to competitively inhibit the transport of cystine into the cell via its plasma membrane transporter. Inhibition of cystine transport leads to deprivation of intracellular cysteine, the rate-limiting precursor in the synthesis of glutathione. Depletion of glutathione resulting from cellular cysteine deprivation leads to an imbalance between oxidants and"

In this report, we demonstrate that a 46-amino acid polypeptide toxin has one d-phenylalanine at position 44, and that the epimerization from an l-Phe to a d-Phe has a dramatic effect on the excitatory effects of the peptide. In one electrophysiological assay carried out, the d-Phe-containing peptide was extremely potent, whereas the unmodified polypeptide had no biological activity, demonstrating that the chirality of the post-translationally modified amino acid is functionally significant. The peptide toxin analyzed, r11a, belongs to the I-gene superfamily of conotoxins that has four disulfide cross-links. The d-Phe in r11a is at the third amino acid from the C terminus, the same relative position from the C-terminal end as the d-amino acid in ω-agatoxin TK from a spider, an unrelated peptide. Thus, although post-translational amino acid isomerization appears to have no strong specificity for the chemical nature of the amino acid side chain, the few peptides where this modification has been established suggest that there may be favored positions near the N or C terminus that are preferential sites for isomerization to a d-amino acid.

A remarkable post-translational modification of polypeptides synthesized on ribosomes is the conversion of a standard l-amino acid into the corresponding d-isomer (1Kreil G. J. Biol.

Most cases of post-translational isomerization to d-amino acids have been documented in small peptides from vertebrate, arthropod, and molluscan systems. This post-translational modification does not appear to be specific for a particular amino acid; a variety of different amino acids have been post-translationally converted to the d-form. The diverse biological systems in which d-amino acid-containing gene products have been characterized, and the apparently unrelated sequence contexts in which these post-translationally modified amino acids occur raises the question of whether such a post-translational modification can be predicted. A difficulty in critically assessing the natural distribution of the post-translational isomerization of amino acids is that the larger the gene product, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the presence of a modified amino acid. In small peptides, the effect of converting a single l- to a d-amino acid can cause a significant difference in chromatographic and other properties; however, as the polypeptide gets larger, converting one amino acid residue to the corresponding d-isomer results in more subtle global changes. Furthermore, in contrast to all other post-translational modifications, isomerization to a d-amino acid is not detectable by any of the standard techniques used in proteomics, such as mass spectrometry. In order to be able to predict when the post-translational conversion to a d-amino acid might occur, the identification of more bona fide cases of natural polypeptides having a d-amino acid is required. The first larger peptidic gene product in which a d-amino acid was identified was ω-agatoxin TK from the funnel spider Agelenopsis aperta: a single d-serine was identified toward the C-terminal end (3Kuwada M. Teramoto T. Kumagaye K.Y. Nakajima K. Watanabe T. Kawai T. Kawakami Y. Niidome T. Sawada K. Nishizawa Y. Katayama K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 587-593PubMed Google Scholar). The only other larger peptide with a d-amino acid, also from an arthropod system, was the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, where the amino acid modified is toward the N-terminal end (4Soyez D.

There is no similarity at all that can be detected between the sequence context of the post-translational isomerization in these two cases. Among peptides that have been modified from different sources such as frog skin, molluscan nervous tissue, or platypus venom, the d-amino acid is most often located at the second position from the N terminus (7Monteccuchi P.C. de Castiglione R.

However, in the contryphans, a group of octapeptides from the venom of Conus, the d-amino acid is found at the fourth amino acid residue (15Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Cruz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 281: 28002-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Jacobsen R. Jimenez E.C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J.

Peptide Res. 1999; 54: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In both the frog peptides and in the contryphans, the position within the peptide seems to be the dominant determinant of whether a change in chirality from an l-amino acid to a d-amino acid will occur, rather than the type of amino acid at that position. In this work, we describe the presence of a d-amino acid in a member of a recently characterized group of conotoxins, the I-superfamily (18Jimenez E.C. Shetty R.P. Lirazan M. Rivier J. Walker C. Abogadie F.C. Yoshikami D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This conotoxin, r11a, is only the third example found of a larger polypeptidic gene product, which has definitively been shown to have undergone this unusual post-translational modification. We have synthesized both the l- and the d-amino acid-containing isomers of conotoxin r11a, and demonstrate that the presence of the modified amino acid causes a marked change in biological activity. Purification of Conotoxin r11a from Venom—Crude venom extract was prepared as described earlier (15Jimenez E.C. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Cruz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 281: 28002-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The extract was loaded onto a Vydac C18 semipreparative HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MTBE, methyl-tert-butyl ether; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HBTU, 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; DIEA, N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine; i.c., intracranially; MS, mass spectrometry. column and eluted at 5 ml/min with a gradient of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B90 (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile). Further purification was done on a Vydac C18 analytic column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were obtained using a Voyager DE STR mass spectrometer, courtesy of the Mass Spectrometry and Proteomic Core Facility, University of Utah. Alternatively, MALDI spectra were obtained using a Bruker REFLEX time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) fitted with a gridless reflectron, an N2 laser, and a 100 MHz digitizer, courtesy of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (La Jolla, CA). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized on solid support by an automated peptide synthesizer using N-Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxy-carbonyl) -protected amino acids, HBTU and DIEA (19Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar), courtesy of Dr. Robert Schackmann of the DNA/Peptide Facility, University of Utah. All cysteine residues were trityl-protected. The coupling time was 1 h. Peptide cleavage/deprotection was accomplished with reagent K (82.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% H2O, 5% thioanisole, 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol) for 2 h at room temperature. Soluble crude peptides were precipitated with cold MTBE and centrifuged. The pellet was washed with MTBE, centrifuged again, then dissolved in 25% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and lyophilized. The linear peptides were purified on a Vydac C18 semipreparative HPLC column. Oxidative Folding—Oxidative folding of peptides was done with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSSG, and 1 mm GSH at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was initiated by adding the linear synthetic peptide to a final concentration of 20 μm, then quenched by adding formic acid to a final concentration of 8%. The oxidized form was purified on a Vydac C18 HPLC column with a gradient of 15–60% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile) for 40 min. Reduction and Alkylation—Two nanomoles of peptide were dissolved in 40 μl of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and reduced by addition of 10 μl of reduction buffer (0.5 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and 100 mm dithiothreitol) and incubation at 65 °C for 30 min. The peptide was then alkylated with 40 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetic acid in 0.5 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was applied to a Vydac C18 analytical HPLC column and eluted with 30% solvent B for 15 min followed by a gradient of 30–55% solvent B for 25 min. Digestion with Endoproteinase Asp-N—Both natural and synthetic conotoxin r11a were digested with endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) to generate fragments. Two nanomoles of the reduced and alkylated peptide were dissolved in 4 μl of 30% acetonitrile and added to 36 μl of endoproteinase Asp-N solution (2.8 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) to yield an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). After 2 h of incubation at 35 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 40 μl of 0.1 m EDTA. The digestion products were separated on Vydac C18 analytical HPLC column using a gradient of 5–50% solvent B for 45 min. The digestion products were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Digestion with Chymotrypsin—Natural and synthetic conotoxin r11a were digested with sequencing-grade chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science). Two nmol of alkylated peptide were dissolved in 4 μl of 30% acetonitrile and added to 34 μl of chymotrypsin solution (5.6 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) to yield an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). After 12 h of incubation at room temperature, the digestion products were separated on a Vydac C18 analytical HPLC column, using a gradient as for endoproteinase Asp-N digestion products, and then analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Additionally, peptide fragments were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Model 492 Sequenator, courtesy of Dr. Robert Schackmann (DNA/Peptide Facility, University of Utah). Bioassay—Conotoxins were dissolved in normal saline solution (NSS) and injected using a 29-gauge insulin syringe. Swiss Webster mice (15 days old) were injected intracranially (i.c.) with 20 μl of the conotoxin solution as described previously (20Clark C. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Control animals were similarly injected with NSS. Proper animal care and use protocols were followed in accordance with the guidelines set by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Electrophysiology—The cutaneus pectoris muscle preparation of Rana pipiens was used as described previously (18Jimenez E.C. Shetty R.P. Lirazan M. Rivier J. Walker C. Abogadie F.C. Yoshikami D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on a single batch of summer frogs purchased from Charles D. Sullivan (Nashville, TN). Briefly, the recoding/stimulating chamber was made from a silicone elastomer, Sylgard (Dow Corning), and consisted of a rectangular trough (about 1 mm × 15 mm × 4 mm deep) and an adjacent series of four cylindrical wells (4 mm diameter × 4 mm deep). The different compartments were separated by 1-mm-wide partitions. A mini-muscle preparation (see Ref. 21Yoshikami D. Bagabaldo Z. Olivera B.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 560: 230-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was placed in the trough, and the attached motor nerve was draped into the adjacent wells, with the proximal (severed) end of the nerve in the well farthest from the trough. Portions of the nerve overlying the partition, and therefore exposed to air, were covered with Vaseline. A pair of stimulating electrodes spanned the two wells furthest from the trough, and of these two wells, that closest the trough also contained a ground electrode. Pulses, 0.1 ms in duration and 6 V in amplitude, and applied via a stimulation isolation unit, were used to stimulate the motor nerve at a frequency of 2/min. To record the activity of the muscle, a pair of recording electrodes was located in the trough, with one electrode near the middle and the other at one end. Activity of the nerve was recorded with a second pair of electrodes located in the two wells closest to the trough. Each set of recording electrodes were connected to a differential A/C amplifier, and the signal bandpass filtered (1 Hz to 3 kHz) and digitized at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. This arrangement allowed the electrical activity from nerve and muscle to be recorded simultaneously. Homemade software programmed in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX) was used for data acquisition. All electrodes were 0.01 diameter stainless steel wires. Solutions in all compartments were static and refreshed periodically by manual replacement. Peptides were dissolved in frog Ringer's containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. To apply peptide, the fluid in the muscle-containing trough was removed and replaced with peptide at the indicated concentration. The solution was stirred by aspirating the solution into the tip of a pipettor, then discharging it back out into the trough, for 20 cycles. During this solution exchange and stirring, the inputs of the recording amplifiers were grounded for protection. The entire process took between 1.5 and 2 min and accounts for the hiatus in the records in Fig. 4. All recordings were performed at room temperature (∼21 °C). Non-identity of Synthetic Conotoxin (All l Version) and Natural Conotoxin r11a: Preliminary Evidence Suggesting the Presence of a d-Amino Acid—The excitatory conotoxin r11a which belongs to the I-superfamily is a relatively large conotoxin (46 amino acids) with four disulfide bonds, purified from the venom of the piscivorous species Conus radiatus. The purification of the natural conotoxin used in the studies described below was carried out by a modification of the method described previously (18Jimenez E.C. Shetty R.P. Lirazan M. Rivier J. Walker C. Abogadie F.C. Yoshikami D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). C. radiatus venom has at least 18 different I-superfamily peptides; all that have been purified from venom are excitatory. A major challenge in purification is the separation of one isoform from another. As shown in Fig. 1, peptide r11a was purified to homogeneity, but this required four reverse-phase HPLC runs to separate the peptide from contaminating isoforms. The linear peptide with all l-amino acids was chemically synthesized and folded, and the resultant synthetic peptide was shown to elicit excitatory biological activity. However, a biochemical characterization of folded synthetic peptide revealed that it did not co-elute with the natural peptide. When the natural peptide was reduced, the linear synthetic peptide and the linear natural peptide also did not co-elute. However, the mass value of the synthetic material was identical to that of the natural peptide. A preliminary functional characterization indicated that the synthetic peptide, though biologically active, was not as potent as natural r11a. Together, these initial data raised the possibility that a d-amino acid residue might be present in the natural conotoxin r11a. In order to further explore this possibility, both the reduced and alkylated synthetic (all l version) and natural peptides were digested with endoproteinase Asp-N as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After digestion with the endoproteinase, the products were analyzed by HPLC. Three digestion products were identified by mass spectrometry. These were the predicted end digestion products of endoproteinase Asp-N (Fig. 2A): an N-terminal heptapeptide (P2), a nonapeptide from residues 8 to 16 (P1) and a large C-terminal fragment from residues 17 to 46 (P3). The two smaller peptides from synthetic and natural r11a were identical in their elution properties on HPLC, but there was a small shift between the synthetic and natural peptide for P3, the large C-terminal product. This indicated that any d-amino acid(s) were likely to be between amino acids 17 and 46. The reduced and alkylated natural and synthetic linear peptides yielded different products upon digestion with chymotrypsin (Fig. 2B). For the synthetic peptide, four different digestion products were obtained. A combination of mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing was used to identify the cleavage products. This analysis revealed that chymotrypsin cleavage after Trp33 and Phe44 had occurred on the synthetic peptide, but that the digestion at these loci was incomplete. Thus, two of the predicted digestion products, the fragments from amino acids 1 to 33 (P4) and 34 to 44 (P5) were obtained, as well as two incomplete digestion products (1–44 (P7) and 34–46 (P6)). However, when a similar digestion of the natural peptide was carried out, a strikingly different pattern was obtained. No digestion after Phe44 was detected, and only fragments from 1 to 33 and a new fragment whose sequence and mass value were consistent with AA 34 to 46 (P6, dashed line) were obtained. However, although the mass of the peptide was consistent with residues 34–46, this peptide fragment did not co-elute with the corresponding fragment from the synthetic r11a. These results are consistent with the presence of a d-amino acid in the interval from amino acids 34 to 46. We reasoned that if residue 44 were in fact a d-amino acid, the failure of chymotrypsin to cleave after Phe44 in the natural peptide would be explained. Thus, together, the data led us to the specific working hypothesis that natural conotoxin r11a differs in having a d-phenylalanine residue at position 44, instead of the l-Phe in the synthetic peptide. Direct Verification of the Presence of a d-Amino Acid in r11a by Chemical Synthesis—The hypothesis that r11a contains a d-phenylalanine residue at position 44 was directly tested by chemical synthesis. Peptide P6 with amino acids from 34 to 46 was chemically synthesized with both l-Phe44 and d-Phe44; when these synthetic peptides were chromatographed with the corresponding chymotrypsin fragment from natural r11a, only the d-Phe44 peptide co-eluted, and the l-Phe44 peptide was resolved from the natural 34–46 fragment. These results led us to synthesize the entire peptide r11a as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An all l version and a d-Phe44 version of the r11a primary sequence were synthesized, and both peptides were folded. As is shown in Fig. 3, only the d-Phe44-containing conotoxin r11a co-eluted with the natural peptide. This provides direct biochemical evidence that Phe44 is post-translationally modified from an l- to a d-amino acid in the natural conotoxin. Thus, the correct amino acid sequence of the conotoxin r11a is: GOSFCKADEKOCEYHADCCNCCLSGICAOSTNWILPGCSTSSFFKI, where F is d-phenylalanine. We refer to the d-Phe44 version of the peptide simply as r11a and the all l version as [l-Phe44]r11a. Biological Activity of Synthetic Peptides r11a and [l-Phe44]r11a—A functional comparison of the folded r11a analogs with different chirality at position 44 was carried out both by an electrophysiological characterization with an in vitro nerve-muscle preparation from frog, as well as by using an in vivo behavioral assay on mice. Unlike either natural or synthetic r11a, both of which induce repetitive activity in the amphibian nerve-muscle preparation at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm (see below), no repetitive activity was seen with [l-Phe44]r11a when tested at concentrations up to 25 μm. Thus, using the in vitro frog nerve-muscle preparation, the natural d-Phe form of the peptide is >250-fold more potent than the l-Phe form. However, when a whole animal behavioral assay (with 15-day-old mice) was used to assess the d-Phe and l-Phe forms of r11a, a smaller differential (10–20-fold) was observed in potency of the d-Phe and l-Phe r11a analogs. This estimate is based on comparing the dose in which hyperactivity symptoms but no death occurred (5 versus 100 pmol for the d- and l-Phe forms), as well as the doses in which marked hyperactivity was followed by death some minutes later (20 versus 250 pmol for the d- and l-Phe forms). Thus, using two very different assays, the natural d-Phe r11a peptide is significantly more potent than the l-Phe r11a analog. Comparison of the Activity of Native and Synthetic Peptides r11a—The ability of the natural r11a to elicit trains of action potentials in an isolated nerve-muscle preparation from frog was previously reported (18Jimenez E.C. Shetty R.P. Lirazan M. Rivier J. Walker C. Abogadie F.C. Yoshikami D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Normally, action potentials are not seen in skeletal muscle unless the nerve is stimulated; that is, spontaneous action potentials are not seen. Furthermore, a single stimulus applied to the motor nerve usually produces only a single action potential in the muscle. However, in the presence of I-superfamily conotoxins both evoked and spontaneous trains of action potentials are observed. This is the case for both natural and synthetic r11a. The effects produced by the peptides were comparable in several respects: 1) On-rate. At a concentration of 1 μm, both peptides induced repetitive activity within a minute of their application. However, at lower concentrations, the first signs of repetitive activity took several minutes to appear (see Fig. 4 for examples). At 100 nm, the mean (±S.D.) induction time in three trials with each peptide was 3.8 ± 0.8 min for the natural peptide and 4.9 ± 2.2 min for the synthetic peptide. Thus, within experimental error, the peptides have the same on-rate. 2) Off-rate. The repetitive activity induced by both peptides persisted for >18 h following their washout. Thus, the effect of both peptides is relatively irreversible. 3) When the peptide-induced activities are simultaneously recorded in nerve and muscle, it was observed that each action potential in the muscle is preceded by an action potential in the nerve. This was originally reported for the native peptide (18Jimenez E.C. Shetty R.P. Lirazan M. Rivier J. Walker C. Abogadie F.C. Yoshikami D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and is also seen with the synthetic peptide (Fig. 5). This indicates that with both natural and synthetic peptides, repetitive activity is primarily induced in the motor nerve and only secondarily in the muscle. That is, the peptide induces repetitive activity in the motor nerve, and this activity is conveyed to the muscle via synaptic transmission. As would be expected, when synaptic transmission is blocked by exposing the preparation to 5 μm d-tubocurare, an acetylcholine receptor-antagonist, repetitive activity in the muscle, but not in the nerve, is blocked (not illustrated). The studies above have demonstrated the presence of an unusual post-translationally modified amino acid, d-phenylalanine, at amino acids 44 of r11a, a conotoxin with eight Cys residues and 46 amino acids. This is the first multiple disulfide-bonded conotoxin shown to contain a d-amino acid. The post-translational modification is important for optimal biological activity of the toxin. d-Amino acids have a sporadic distribution in a number of biological systems. These have been characterized mostly in smaller peptides (for a comprehensive review on d-amino acids see Ref. 2Kreil G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), most notably those produced by frog skin, as well as by various invertebrate and mammalian sources. d-amino acids were described previously in the contryphans, a family of small peptides, which are widely distributed across the genus Conus (15Jimenez E.C.

Peptide Res. 1999; 54: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These small peptides (typically, eight amino acids) have a single disulfide bond; most have either a d-tryptophan or d-leucine residue (Table I). The contryphans were notable biochemically because of the slow equilibration between two conformational states exhibited by many of these peptides; the presence of a d-Trp residue was required for the slow conformational equilibrium.Table IPeptides containing d-amino acidsA.

Open table in a new tab The notable feature of the I-conotoxin superfamily, to which conotoxin r11a characterized above belongs, is the large number of different molecular isoforms differing in their primary sequences that can be present in a single venom. Conotoxin r11a is from the venom of C. radiatus, which is believed to be fish-hunting species. More than 20 distinct I-superfamily conotoxins, each significantly different in sequence, are expressed by C. radiatus. However, these share different extents of homology to the d-phenylalanine-containing conotoxin r11a characterized in this report. The modified phenylalanine residue is conserved in a subset of several I-superfamily conotoxins from C. radiatus and other Conus species, strongly suggesting that at least the members of this subset of I-superfamily conotoxins undergo the post-translational isomerization at this locus. The amino acids preceding the d-Phe residue are part of a conserved sequence motif, —GCSTSSFF—(where F is the d-Phe residue) (18Jimenez E.C. Shetty R.P. Lirazan M. Rivier J. Walker C. Abogadie F.C. Yoshikami D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 2M. Watkins and B. Olivera, unpublished results. We have demonstrated that the d-Phe residue is important for the biological activity of conotoxin r11a. If an l-Phe, instead of a d-Phe is present, the peptide is significantly less active as an excitotoxin. A comparison of native and synthetic d-Phe-containing peptides was carried out. Since the effects of both native and synthetic peptides are relatively irreversible, equilibrium dose-response measurements could not be obtained. Instead, as an index of toxin potency, the time interval between the administration of peptide and the first observation of repetitive activity (the induction time) was used. Higher concentrations of peptide had shorter induction times. At the same concentration, native and synthetic peptides had similar induction times. Furthermore, both peptides targeted channels in the nerve, rather than the muscle. Thus, both natural and synthetic peptides have comparable potencies and specificities. These functional features, along with their chemical characteristics, lead us to conclude that the natural and synthetic r11a are identical. Although all of the I-superfamily peptides characterized so far appear to be excitotoxins, and several have been shown to target K channels in animals as diverse as mammals and stem chordates (22Kauferstein S. Huys I. Lamthanh H. Stöcklin R. Sotto F. Menez A. Tytgat J. Mebs D. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it remains to be established which of the I-superfamily members (that all share the same Class 11 Cys pattern found in r11a) also contain d-amino acids. The discovery of a d-amino acid in conotoxin r11a introduces a cautionary note into using standard genetic/proteomic methods to investigate conotoxins: although the sequence of r11a and other I-superfamily conotoxins can be readily derived by PCR/cloning, and the number of hydroxylated Pro residues can be deduced by mass spectrometry, the presence of a d-amino acid would have eluded both of these methods. We note that although the sequence of conotoxin r11a has no apparent homology to the ω-Aga-TK spider toxin, and the amino acids modified are different (Phe versus Ser), the locus of modification is the same distance from the C terminus (see Table I, A). In conotoxin r11a, which has 46 residues, it is a Phe residue at amino acid 44; in ω-Aga-TK, which has 48 residues, it is a Ser residue at amino acid 46. The characterization of a d-amino acid in conotoxin r11a raises the possibility that the third amino acid from the C terminus may be a favored site. This prediction is suggested by the discovery that another I-superfamily conotoxin, with a Leu residue at the third position from the C terminus, has a d-Leu in the native peptide. 3O. Buczek and E. Jimenez, manuscript in preparation. It is noteworthy that in Table I, A–C, examples of peptides from different phyla are shown (Agelenopsis is a spider and Conus is a mollusc; Achatina and Mytilus are molluscs; Phyllomedusa is a frog; Ornithorhynchus is a platypus). This broad phylogenetic distribution, combined with the preferential loci of the amino acids modified, suggests that this post-translational isomerization, which occurs in many animal taxa, may be carried out by enzymatic systems that may be specific for a particular amino acid locus rather than the chemical nature of the amino acid isomerized. A summary of the natural occurrence of d-amino acids in polypeptides is shown in Table I. The evidence that d-amino acids found in most polypeptides are formed post-translationally has been reviewed (2Kreil G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In many cases, mRNA encoding a precursor for the peptide containing the d-amino acid was identified. (The first peptide where post-translational modification was definitely established was dermorphin in 1987 by Gunther Kreil's laboratory (23Richter K. Egger R. Kreil G. Science. 1987; 238: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).) The codon specifying the standard l-amino acid is found in the mRNA sequence at the locus for the corresponding d-amino acid, suggesting conventional translation by ribosomes, followed by post-translational isomerization. Enzymatic activities have been purified both from spider venoms (24Heck S.D. Kelbaugh P.R. Kelly M.E. Thadeio P.F. Saccomano N.A. Stroh J.G. Volkmann R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10426-10436Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and from frog skin secretions 4A. Jilek and G. Kreil, personal communication. that specifically convert one l-amino acid to the d-amino acid in the peptide precursor. The d-amino acids found in conotoxins are therefore presumed to be produced post-translationally. In most cases, the relevant cDNA clones encoding these conotoxins with d-amino acids have been identified. It is noteworthy that C. radiatus, the organism used for the present study, is the first in which two post-translationally modified polypeptides have been characterized that differ in their d-amino acids (Phe in the present peptide, Trp in contryphan-R), as well as in the loci in which these d-amino acids are found on the polypeptide chain. This raises the possibility that different enzymatic activities catalyze the isomerization from l- to d-amino acids in the two C. radiatus peptides; whether these are related to the factors identified in the spider and frog systems remains to be established."

https://openalex.org/W2001311551,"DDB2 is an essential subunit of the damaged-DNA recognition factor DDB, which is involved in global genomic repair in human cells. Moreover, DDB2 is mutated in the repair-deficiency disease xeroderma pigmentosum (Group E). Expression of DDB2 in human cells is induced by P53, BRCA1 and by ionizing radiation. The DDB2 protein associates with transcriptional activator and coactivator proteins. In addition, DDB2 in conjunction with DDB1 associates with cullin 4A and the Cop9/signalosome. We generated a mouse strain deficient for DDB2 (DDB2−/−). Consistent with the human disease (XP-E), the DDB2−/− mice were susceptible to UV-induced skin carcinogenesis. We observed a significant difference in the initial rate of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD)-removal from the skin following UV irradiation. Also, the DDB2-deficient mice exhibited a significantly reduced life span compared to their wild-type littermates. Moreover, unlike other XP-deficient mice, the DDB2-deficient mice developed spontaneous malignant tumors at a high rate between the ages of 20 and 25 months. The observations suggest that, in addition to DNA repair, the other interactions of DDB2 are significant in its tumor suppression function."

In addition to its anti-apoptotic properties, BCL-2 inhibits efflux of GSH from B16M-F10 cells and thereby may facilitate metastatic cell resistance against endothelium-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress. Thus, we investigated in B16M-F10 cells which molecular mechanisms channel GSH release and whether their modulation may influence metastatic activity. GSH efflux was abolished in multidrug resistance protein 1 knock-out (MRP-/-1) B16M-F10 transfected with the Bcl-2 gene or in MRP-/-1 B16M-F10 cells incubated with l-methionine, which indicates that GSH release from B16M-F10 cells is channeled through MRP1 and a BCL-2-dependent system (likely related to an l-methionine-sensitive GSH carrier previously detected in hepatocytes). The BCL-2-dependent system was identified as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, since monoclonal antibodies against this ion channel or H-89 (a protein kinase A-selective inhibitor)-induced inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene expression completely blocked the BCL-2-sensitive GSH release. By using a perifusion system that mimics in vivo conditions, we found that GSH depletion in metastatic cells can be achieved by using Bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide- and verapamil (an MRP1 activator)-induced acceleration of GSH efflux, in combination with acivicin-induced inhibition of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (which limits GSH synthesis by preventing cysteine generation from extracellular GSH). When applied under in vivo conditions, this strategy increased tumor cytotoxicity (up to ∼90%) during B16M-F10 cell adhesion to the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium.

Obrador E. Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Estrela J.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The liver is a common site for metastasis development, and we demonstrated that GSH protects B16M cells against nitrosative and oxidative stress in the murine hepatic microvasculature (2Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Carretero J. Obrador E. Esteve J.M.

The concept that high GSH content status is an important factor for metastasis progression was strongly supported by the fact that metastatic B16M cell survival and growth can be enhanced by directly increasing their GSH content with GSH ester, which readily enters the cell and delivers free GSH (4Obrador E. Carretero J. Ortega A. Medina I. Rodilla V. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Ortega A. Ferrer P. Carretero J. Obrador E. Asensi M. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39591-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In consequence, the maintenance of high intracellular levels of GSH appears critical for metastatic cells to survive intravascularly and to progress extravascularly. Multidrug and/or radiation resistance, which are characteristic features of malignant tumors, frequently associate with high GSH content in the cancer cells (6Estrela J.M. Obrador E. Navarro J. Lasso De la Vega M.C. Pellicer J.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Efflux of GSH and GSH S-conjugates from different mammalian cells is mediated by multidrug resistance proteins (MRP), among which MRP1 and MRP2 have been characterized at the functional level as ATP-dependent pumps with broad specificity for GSH and glucuronic or sulfate conjugates (7Zaman G.J. Lankelma J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J. Dekker H. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4635) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance frequently associates with the overexpression of P-glycoprotein and/or MRP1 (11Zhou D.C. Zittoun R. Marie J.P. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1995; 9: 1661-1666PubMed Google Scholar), both functioning as pumps that extrude drugs from tumor cells. GSH depletion induced by l-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (the rate-limiting step in GSH biosynthesis) (12Meister A. Science. 1983; 220: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), resulted in a complete reversal of resistance to anticancer drugs of different cell lines overexpressing MRP1 but had no effect on P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (13Versantvoort C.H. Broxterman H.J. Bagrij T. Scheper R.J. Twentyman P.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, cancer cells can release GSH through MRP1 even in the absence of cytotoxic drugs (7Zaman G.J. Lankelma J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J. Dekker H. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7690-7694Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In a recent study we demonstrated that B16M-F10 cells with a high metastatic potential overexpress BCL-2, show an increase in intracellular GSH content, show no change in the GSH synthesis rate, but show a decrease in GSH efflux (5Ortega A. Ferrer P. Carretero J. Obrador E. Asensi M. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39591-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This study also provides evidence that BCL-2 can directly inhibit GSH export, thereby accounting for the increase in intracellular GSH. Moreover, it demonstrates that GSH depletion and BCL-2 antisense therapy can sensitize cells to TNF-α-induced apoptotic death. In consequence, it is plausible that BCL-2, in addition of its anti-apoptotic properties (14Pommier Y. Sordet O. Antony S. Hayward R.L. Kohn K.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2934-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), may also increase metastatic cell resistance against oxidative/nitrosative stress by preserving intracellular GSH. In fact, GSH efflux prior or during apoptosis appears an essential regulator of the apoptotic killing mechanism (15Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Because GSH efflux from B16M cells can be increased by using Bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (Bcl-2-AS) (5Ortega A. Ferrer P. Carretero J. Obrador E. Asensi M. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39591-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and possibly by using different MRP1 regulators, the aim of the present report was to investigate whether the rate of efflux may become an important factor regulating intracellular GSH content and thereby metastatic cell survival. Culture of B16M-F10 Cells—Murine B16M-F10 cells (from the ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), pH 7.4, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (4Obrador E. Carretero J. Ortega A. Medina I. Rodilla V. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cell integrity was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase activity (4Obrador E. Carretero J. Ortega A. Medina I. Rodilla V. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GSH and GSSG—GSH was measured by the glutathione S-transferase reaction and GSSG by high pressure liquid chromatography (4Obrador E. Carretero J. Ortega A. Medina I. Rodilla V. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Total glutathione (GSH + 2GSSG) was determined by a kinetic assay in which a catalytic amount of GSH or GSSG and glutathione reductase cause the continuous reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma) by NADPH (16Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). GSH monoisopropyl(glycyl) ester was prepared as described previously (17Martensson J. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 Gene Transfer and BCL-2 Analysis—The Tet-Off gene expression system (Clontech) was used, as in Ref. 5Ortega A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39591-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, to insert the mouse Bcl-2 gene and for transfection into B16M cells following the manufacturer's instructions. BCL-2 protein was quantitated in the soluble cytosolic fraction by enzyme immunoassay (18Eissa S. Seada L.S. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody-based assay from Sigma (1 unit of BCL-2 was defined as the amount of BCL-2 protein in 1,000 nontransfected B16M cells). Cellular BCL-2 protein levels were also analyzed, as recently reported (5Ortega A. Ferrer P. Carretero J. Obrador E. Asensi M. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39591-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), by flow cytometry using an EPICS PROFILE II (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), at 488 nm and 250 milliwatts. Cellular suspensions were diluted to ∼250,000 cells/ml. Primary monoclonal anti-BCL-2 from mouse followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (Sigma) were used. BCL-2 protein levels were expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units (ΔFL1). Cell viability in these experiments was determined with propidium iodide (final concentration 10 μm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Electroporation and Selection of B16M-F10 Multidrug Resistance Protein Knock-out Clones—Murine MRP genomic sequences were isolated from a λ Charon 35 phage library constructed with DNA from mouse strain C57BL/6J. The preparation of the gene-targeting construct, electroporation into tumor cells (Bio-Rad), and selection and screening of the clones, first by PCR analysis and then by DNA blot analysis, were carried out as described previously (19Lorico A. Rappa G. Flavell R.A. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5351-5355PubMed Google Scholar). The multidrug resistance associated protein-1 or -2 knock-out clones (MRP-/-1 and MRP-/-2) were obtained by exposing a single knock-out clone to high concentrations of G418 for 2 weeks. Treatment of B16M-F10 Cells with Oligodeoxynucleotides—B16M-F10 cells were incubated, as described previously (5Ortega A. Ferrer P. Carretero J. Obrador E. Asensi M. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39591-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), in the presence of Bcl-2 antisense phosphorothioate-derivatized oligodeoxynucleotides (Bcl-2-AS) from Eurobio (Les Ulis, France). Fresh oligodeoxynucleotides were added every day, starting 24 h after cell plating, as 1:1 complexes with the Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The sequence of Bcl-2-AS corresponding to the mouse Bcl-2 translation initiation codon site and extending 3′ downstream for a total of 18 bases was 5′-TCTCCCGGCTTGCGCCAT-3′ (20Miyake H. Tolcher A. Gleave M.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4030-4034PubMed Google Scholar). A 2-base Bcl-2 mismatch oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-TCTCCCGGCATGTGCCAT-3′) was used as control. Quantitative Determination of the Plasma Membrane Potential— Plasma membrane potential (PMP) was measured using a standard technique (21Porteous W.K. James A.M. Sheard P.W. Porteous C.M. Packer M.A. Hyslop S.J. Melton J.V. Pang C.Y. Wei Y.H. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). B16M-F10 cells were cultured for 24 h, as described above, but seeded at 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in glass Petri dishes. Culture dishes were mounted on a tube-focusing microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Intracellular measurements were performed, at 25 °C, with glass micropipettes filled with 3 m KCl and with a 20-megohm DC resistance. Membrane potentials were measured with a WP Instruments M4-A electrometer amplifier (Sarasota, FL), and the output was displayed using a MacLab System (Castle Hill, Australia). Measurements were made only in cells (from at least four different preparations) that gave a stable membrane potential within 10 s of penetration, which indicates a good seal of the plasma membrane with the recording electrode. Western Blots—Cultured cells were harvested, as reported previously (1Carretero J. Obrador E. Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Estrela J.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and then washed twice in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium, pH 7.4. Whole cell extracts were made by freeze-thaw cycles in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4. Fifty μg of protein (as determined by the Bradford assay) were boiled with Laemmli buffer and resolved in 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western blotting with anti-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (anti-CFTR) monoclonal antibody (CFTR (CF3) antibody from Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Immunizing peptide corresponds to amino acid residues 103–1117 found in the first extracellular loop of human CFTR. This sequence is conserved in mice. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcription-PCR—A 392-bp region corresponding to nucleotides 1340–1730 of the mouse CFTR gene (22Tata F. Stanier P. Wicking C. Halford S. Kruyer H. Lench N.J. Scambler P.J. Hansen C. Braman J.C. Williamson R. Wainwright B.J. Genomics. 1991; 10: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was amplified with the forward primer 5′-GGGAGGAGGGATTTGGGGAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GTGATGTCCTGCTGTAGTTG-3′. The CFTR cDNA was obtained using a random hexamer primer and a MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase kit as described by the manufacturer (TaqMan RT Reagents, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A PCR master mix containing the specific primers and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) were then added. Amplifications were performed in a GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol kit from Invitrogen and following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of total RNA were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. RNA was electrophoretically transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and covalently bound to the membrane following UV cross-linking. Murine CFTR and control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH, Clontech) cDNA probes were radiolabeled with 32P by random priming (23Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized at 65 °C with the 32P-labeled cDNA fragments. After washing at room temperature, the filters were exposed to film, and autoradiography was performed using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Perifusion of B16M-F10 Cells—Isolated B16M cells, suspended in DMEM, were incubated in a perifusion system similar to that described previously for rat hepatocytes (24Groen A.K. Sips H.J. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, a buffer gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 was constantly pumped by an LKB multiperpex roller pump (type 2115; Amersham Biosciences) to a chamber containing a final volume of 10 ml and 3 × 106 B16M-F10 cells per ml. The filter (Ultracel Amicon YM100 membrane, Millipore, Billerica, MA) was placed at the top of the chamber. The tumor cell suspension was perifused at 37 °C and maintained at a homogenous state by using a magnetic stirrer placed at the bottom of the chamber. The perifusion buffer was Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium, pH 7.4, containing plasma concentrations (aortic blood) of free l-amino acids found in tumor-bearing C57BL/6J mice (395 ± 34 μm Ala, 56 ± 8 μm Asn, 24 ± 3 μm Asp, 8 ± 1 μm Cyst(e)ine, 72 ± 18 μm Glu, 442 ± 37 μm Gln, 229 ± 36 μm Gly, 46 ± 11 μm His, 62 ± 13 μm Ile, 78 ± 16 μm Leu, 265 ± 23 μm Lys, 44 ± 6 μm Met, 56 ± 9 μm Phe, 107 ± 11 μm Pro, 87 ± 24 μm Ser, 117 ± 14 μm Thr, 70 ± 15 μm Trp, 83 ± 10 μm Tyr, 115 ± 18 μm Val, 129 ± 16 μm Arg; n = 15), GSH (9 ± 1 μm), glucose (1 g/liter), sodium pyruvate (10 mg/liter), albumin-free fetal calf serum (1.0%, Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Perfusate flow (2 ml/min) was constant throughout the experiment. Effluent flow was monitored continuously for O2 and pH with Philips electrodes. Tumor cell viability was always >97% along the experimental time. A syringe was introduced into the chamber through a rubber septum to take samples (0.5 ml) of the cell suspension without interrupting the flow. Amino Acid Analysis—Proteins were precipitated by treating 0.1 ml of intracellular compartment or plasma with 0.4 ml of 3.75% (w/v) ice-cold sulfosalicylic acid in 0.3 m lithium citrate buffer, pH 2.8. After centrifugation, 0.25 ml of the supernatant were injected into an LKB 4151 amino acid analyzer (Amersham Biosciences) (25Estrela J.M. Hernandez R. Terradez P. Asensi M. Puertes I.R. Vina J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Verapamil and Acivicin Cellular Pharmacokinetics—Accumulation of N-methyl[3H]verapamil (VRP) (α-[3-[[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl] methylamino]propyl]-3,4-dimethoxy-α-(1-methylethyl)monohydrochloride) or [3H]acivicin (ACV) (l-(αS,5S)-α-amino-3-chloro-4-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in perifused cells was measured as described previously (26Cole S.P. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rosenfeld H. Roberts J. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1324-1328PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, B16M-F10 cells were perifused (see above) in the presence of 1 μm [3H]VRP (0.05 μCi/ml) or 2 μm [3H]ACV (0.1 μCi/ml). Aliquots of perifused cells (0.2 ml) were taken from the chamber each 10 min, and accumulation of [3H]VRP or [3H]ACV was stopped by rapid dilution into ice-cold PBS. Cells were centrifuged and washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. After centrifugation, cell pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. GSH-related Enzyme Activities—B16M-F10 cells were detached (see above), washed twice at 4 °C in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium (without Ca2+ or Mg2+) containing 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, resuspended, and homogenized in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and GSH synthetase activities were measured as described elsewhere (4Obrador E. Carretero J. Ortega A. Medina I. Rodilla V. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). γ-Glutamylcysteine Synthetase Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by the acid phenol guanidine method (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA was obtained using a random hexamer primer and a MultiScribe reverse transcriptase kit as described by the manufacturer (TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A PCR master mix containing the specific primers (γ-GCS-heavy subunit (γ-GCS-HS): forward, 5′-ATC CTC CAG TTC CTG CAC ATC TAC, and reverse 5′-GAT CGA AGG ACA CCA ACA TGT ACTC; γ-GCS-light subunit (γ-GCS-LS): forward, TGG AGT TGC ACA GCT GGA CTC T, and reverse 5′-CCA GTA AGG CTG TAA ATG CTC CAA; G3PDH: forward, 5′-CCT GGA GAA ACC TGC CAA GTA TG, and reverse 5′-GGT CCT CAG TGT AGC CCA AGA TG) and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) were then added. Real time quantitation of γ-GCS-HS and γ-GCS-LS mRNA relative to G3PDH mRNA was performed with a SYBR Green I assay and evaluated using a iCycler detection system (Bio-Rad). Target cDNAs were amplified in separate tubes using the following procedure: 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min per cycle). The increase in fluorescence was measured in real time during the extension step. The threshold cycle (CT) was determined, and then the relative gene expression was expressed as follows: fold change = 2-Δ(ΔCT), where ΔCT = CT target - CT G3PDH, and Δ(ΔCT) = ΔCT treated - ΔCT control. Measurement of H2O2—The assay of H2O2 production was based on the H2O2-dependent oxidation of the homovanillic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) to a highly fluorescent dimer (2,2′-dihydroxydiphenyl-5,5′-diacetic acid) that is mediated by horseradish peroxidase (3Carretero J.

Cystine Uptake—B16M-F10 cells were plated in 25-cm2 culture dishes. At the required times, cells were rinsed three times with prewarmed transport medium (10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.01% CaCl2, 0.01% MgCl2 and 0.1% glucose). Uptake measurement was initiated by addition of 1.0 ml of transport medium containing 1 μCi of l-[3H]cystine (Amersham Biosciences) and nonradioactive l-cystine (0.5 mm). After incubation at 37 °C, uptake was finished by rinsing several times with ice-cold PBS until less than 0.001% of the initial radioactivity was present in the supernatant. Cells were then dissolved with 0.5 ml of 0.5 n NaOH, and an aliquot was used for determining radioactivity and another for protein assay. To correct for trapping, transport at 4 °C was studied in parallel (29Takada A. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2441-2445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Glutamyltranspeptidase Assay—γ-GT activity was measured as described previously (30Shaw L.M. London J.W. Fetterolf D. Garfinkel D. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein was determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Isolation and Culture of Hepatic Sinusoidal Endothelium—Syngenic male C57BL/6J mice (10–12 weeks old) were from IFFA Credo (L'Arbreole, France) and received care according to the criteria outlined by the National Institutes of Health. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE) was separated in a 17.5% (w/v) metrizamide gradient and identified as described previously (3Carretero J. Obrador E. Esteve J.M. Ortega A. Pellicer J.A. Sempere F.V. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25775-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cultures of HSE were established and maintained in pyrogen-free DMEM supplemented as described above for the B16M cells. Differential adhesion of endothelial cells to the collagen matrix and washing allows a complete elimination of other sinusoidal cell types (Kupffer, stellate, lymphocytes) from the culture flasks. B16M-F10-Endothelial Cell Adhesion and Cytotoxicity Assays— B16M-F10 cells were loaded with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM, Molecular Probes) (106 cells were incubated in 1 ml of HEPES buffered DMEM, containing 50 μg of BCECF-AM and 5 μl of Me2SO, for 20 min at 37 °C). After washing, BCECF-AM-containing cells were resuspended in HEPES buffered DMEM without phenol red at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and added (0.2 ml/well) to endothelial cells (plated 24 h before) and also to plastic or collagen pre-coated control wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C, and 20 min later the wells were washed three times with fresh medium and read for fluorescence using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Labsystems, Manchester, UK). The number of adhering tumor cells was quantified by arbitrary fluorescence units based on the percentage of the initial number of B16M-F10 cells added to the HSE culture (3Carretero J. Obrador E.

Damage to B16M-F10 cells during their in vitro adhesion to the HSE was measured, as described previously (2Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using tumor cells loaded with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes). The integrity of B16M-F10 cells cultured alone was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity released to the extracellular medium (1Carretero J. Obrador E. Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Estrela J.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other reagents used in experiments of tumor cytotoxicity were from Sigma. Cytokines—Recombinant murine TNF-α (2 × 107 units/mg protein) and recombinant murine (IFN-γ; 105 units/mg protein) were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions (5 × 105 units TNF-α/ml and 25 × 104 units of IFN-γ/ml) were diluted in sterile physiological saline solution (0.9% NaCl), adjusted to pH 7.0, and stored at 4 °C. In Vivo Microscopy—C57BL/6J mice were fed ad libitum on a stock laboratory diet (Letica, Barcelona, Spain) and kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with the room temperature maintained at 22 °C. Procedures involving animals were in compliance with the national and international laws and policies (EEC Directive 86/609, OJ L 358. 1, December 12, 1987; and National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Number 85-23). In vivo microscopy to follow metastatic cell dynamics within the liver was performed, as earlier described (2Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using calcein-AM (Molecular Probes)-labeled B16M-F10 cells. The total number of calcein-AM-labeled cells per hepatic lobule was recorded in 10 different lobules"
https://openalex.org/W2024666704,"A novel proteinaceous metallo-carboxypeptidase inhibitor, named tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI), was isolated from the ixodid tick Rhipicephalus bursa and N-terminally sequenced. The complete cDNA encoding this protein was cloned from tick mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. The full-length TCI cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a precursor protein of 97 amino acid residues that consists of a predicted signal peptide of 22 residues and of mature TCI, a 75-residue cysteine-rich protein (12 Cys). The deduced amino acid sequence shows no homology to other known proteins; the C terminus, however, resembles those of other protein metallo-carboxypeptidase inhibitors, suggesting a common mechanism of inhibition. Recombinant TCI expressed in Escherichia coli is fully functional and inhibits carboxypeptidases of the A/B subfamily with equilibrium dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural analyses by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that TCI is a protein strongly constrained by disulfide bonds, unusually stable over a wide pH range and highly resistant to denaturing conditions. As a tight binding inhibitor of plasma carboxypeptidase B, also known as thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, recombinant TCI stimulates fibrinolysis in vitro and thus may have potential for applications to prevent or treat thrombotic disorders.

The biological actions of many proteases are tightly controlled by specific interactions with proteinaceous inhibitors (1Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 2Bode W. Huber R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wide variety of structurally and functionally diverse inhibitors of endoproteinases (3Turk B. Turk V. Turk D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), however, only few specific inhibitors that bind to metallo-carboxypeptidases have been identified. The inhibitors described so far are from Solanacea (tomato and potato; 38–39 residues) (5Hass G.M. Nau H. Biemann K. Grahn D.T. Ericsson L.H. Neurath H.

These carboxypeptidase inhibitors differ in their mechanism of action; whereas the inhibitor from mammalian tissues apparently binds to carboxypeptidases through a small region that shows sequence similarity to the inhibitory loop present in their propeptides (9Normant E.

Querol E. Aviles F.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 284-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In recent years the interest in carboxypeptidase inhibitors has been fostered by the identification of nondigestive carboxypeptidases in extrapancreatic tissues and fluids that possess diverse physiological functions (13Vendrell J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). CPN is a constitutively active enzyme that cleaves numerous endogenous vasoactive peptides and proteins such as kinins and anaphylatoxins (18Matthews K.W. Mueller-Ortiz S.L. Wetsel R.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TAFI circulates in plasma as a zymogen; the activated form TAFIa down-regulates fibrinolysis presumably by removing C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin that is already partially digested by plasmin (19Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Removal of these residues, which act as ligands for the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), results in a reduced plasminogen activation by tPA and consequently in a prolongation of clot lysis time (20Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1566-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This mechanism provides a rationale for inhibiting TAFIa to enhance clot lysis. Indeed, experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo have shown that the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) significantly enhances clot lysis induced by tPA via the inhibition of TAFIa (21Klement P.

Salamanca, J. Lorenzo, A. Rovira, M. Borrell, J. Vendrell, F. X. Aviles, H. Fritz, and C. P. Sommerhoff, manuscript in preparation. Taken together, these data suggest a potential application of carboxypeptidase inhibitors as pro-fibrinolytic agents or lead compounds for the prevention or treatment of thrombotic disorders. Blood-sucking animals such as leeches, insects, and ticks are known to contain complex mixtures of compounds that interfere with their hosts hemostatic system, allowing fast and successful feeding of blood (23Bowman A.S.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 67: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several protein inhibitors of serine proteases have been isolated from leeches and ticks that include anticoagulants such as thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors (25Salzet M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Mans B.J. Neitz A.W. Insect Biochem. Mol.

In the present study, we have detected, isolated, cloned, expressed, and characterized a novel carboxypeptidase inhibitor from the ixodid tick Rhipicephalus bursa. This protein, named tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI), is the first carboxypeptidase inhibitor found in ticks. Most of TCI does not show sequence similarity with other known proteins; its C terminus, however, resembles those of the inhibitors from Solanacea, Ascaris, and Hirudo, suggesting a common mechanism of action. TCI inhibits different carboxypeptidases of the A/B subfamily with nanomolar affinities. Moreover, the generated recombinant form of the inhibitor (rTCI) accelerates fibrinolysis ∼10 times more effectively than rPCI and thus may have potential for applications in coagulation disorders. Materials—R. bursa ticks were collected from cows and sheep in Catalonia, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Restriction enzymes, ligases, and DNA polymerases were obtained from Roche Applied Science and Ecogen. Roche Applied Science synthesized all of the oligonucleotides. Dithiothreitol, guanidine hydrochloride, reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant PCI was produced and purified as described previously (29Arolas J.L. Lorenzo J. Rovira A. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Ventura S Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7973-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Rabbit lung thrombomodulin (TM) was obtained from American Diagnostica, human thrombin was from Sigma, and recombinant tPA (Actilyse) was from Roche Applied Science. Bovine CPA and porcine CPB were purchased from Sigma, and human CPN was from Elastin Product Co. Recombinant human CPA1, CPA2, and CPB were produced and purified following described procedures (30Reverter D. Ventura S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. J. Biol.

The chromogenic substrates N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH and N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Arg-OH were obtained from Bachem, and N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-Lys was from Sigma. Purification of Natural TCI—Whole ticks were homogenized in Tris acetate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5) using a Politron, and the insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18 Cartridge (Waters), which was subsequently eluted using different concentrations of acetonitrile (0–50%). After evaporation of acetonitrile, fractions were analyzed by CPA inhibition tests, and inhibitor-containing fractions were lyophilized. For further enrichment of TCI, an affinity purification step using a CPA-Sepharose column was required. The column was prepared by coupling bovine CPA to CBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the guidelines of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. The lyophilized TCI was reconstituted in this buffer and applied onto the CPA-Sepharose column, which was subsequently washed with water and phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 10.0). The proteins retained on the column were eluted with phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 12.0) and subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Vydac C18 column using a 10–60% linear acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min over 60 min. The purity of the isolated inhibitor was verified by matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Molecular Cloning of the Full-length TCI cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from frozen ticks using the Nucleospin kit, and poly(A)+ RNA was purified using the Nucleotrap kit (both Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesis of the first strand of R. bursa cDNA was performed using the adaptor oligonucleotide R0R1-dT (R0, 5′-CCGGAATTCACTGCAG-3′; R1 5′-GGTACCCAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). For the cloning of the TCI cDNA, three degenerated oligonucleotides were designed based on the N-terminal sequence of the purified TCI: N1, 5′-AAYGARTGYGTIWSIAARGGITTYGG-3′ with Y = C or T, R = A or G, I = inosin, and W = A or T (corresponding to the N-terminal 9 amino acids of the isolated TCI protein); N2, 5′-AARGGITTYGGITGYYTICCICA-3′ (amino acids 6–13); and N3, 5′-CCICARWSIGAYTGYCCICARGARGC-3′ with S = G or C (amino acids 12–20). The 3′-end fragment of the TCI cDNA was obtained using a 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol. For the first round of PCR tick cDNA was amplified using oligonucleotide N1 and adaptor oligonucleotide R0. PCR was conducted with 30 cycles each at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. PCR mixtures were diluted 20-fold and reamplified using the N2 and R1 nested oligonucleotides. Subsequently, PCR mixtures were diluted again and reamplified using the N3 and R1 oligonucleotides. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. The prominent PCR product was recovered from the gel and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to generate the clone pGEM-TCI-N3/R1. Subsequently, the 5′-end fragment of TCI-cDNA was obtained by 5′-RACE using the Smart RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences Clontech). Based on the sequence of the 3′ cDNA end, two nested oligonucleotides were designed: gene-specific primer 1, 5′-TTGTAACTCGGTGCGATATCCTCG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 444–421 of the complete cDNA; see Fig. 1) and gene-specific primer 2, 5′-TGATCCACGACGACATCGTGCGCC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 420–397). After second strand cDNA synthesis and ligation of the adaptor oligonucleotide, “semi-nested” PCR was performed with the adaptor primer mix and gene-specific primers 1 and 2 in a first and second round of PCR, respectively. The PCR products were analyzed and cloned as described above. Construction of the TCI Expression Vectors—PCR was used to append the 5′ bases coding for the N-terminal amino acids of mature TCI to the partial TCI-cDNA obtained by 3′-RACE. Two oligonucleotides were designed using Escherichia coli codon usage: A, 5′-AACGAATGCGTGAGCAAAGGCTTTGGCTGCCTGCCGCAGTCGGATTGTCCGCA-3′, and B, 5′-CAAGCTTGGTCATTAGTGCAGCCAGACGCA-3′. PCR was performed with these oligonucleotides and the plasmid pGEM-TCI-N3/R1 as template using 30 cycles each with 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. For the cloning of this semisynthetic TCI cDNA into the expression vector pBAT-4 (32Peranen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvonen M. Kaariainen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), three oligonucleotides were designed using E. coli codon usage: C, 5′-CGGAATTCCATGAACGAATGCGTGAGCAAA-3′; D, 5′-TGGCACTGGCTGGTTTCGCTACCGTAGCGCAGGCCAACGAATGCGTGAGCAAAGG-3′; and E, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGAAAAAGACAGCTATTGCGATTGCAGTGGCACTGGCTGGTTTCGCT-3′. The product obtained by two successive PCRs (conditions see above) using the oligonucleotides D/B and E/B, respectively, to introduce the OmpA signal sequence was cleaved with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated with the pBAT-4 vector to generate pBAT-4-OmpA-TCI. Similarly, the product obtained using oligonucleotides C and B was ligated using the same restriction sites with pBAT-4 to generate pBAT-4-TCI. The pBAT-4-OmpA-TCI vector was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), whereas pBAT-4-TCI was used to transform E. coli strains BL21(DE3) and B834. Heterologous Expression of TCI—For the production of rTCI, an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pBAT-4-OmpA-TCI grown in Luria-Bertani medium was used to inoculate 0.5 liter of M9CAS medium containing 0.5% glycerol. At an A550 of 1 the culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 24 h of induction the culture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied onto a Sep-Pak C18 Cartridge. The column was washed with water followed by 10% acetonitrile, and the bound proteins were eluted with 30% 2-propanol and then concentrated in a Roto-Vapor to remove the organic solvent. The rTCI was further purified by cation exchange chromatography (Fractogel EMD SO–3; Merck) using MES buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5) containing 1 m NaCl as elution buffer. Inhibitor-containing fractions were kept at 20 °C for 24 h with 1 mm reduced/0.5 mm oxidized glutathione at pH 8.5 to promote the formation of disulfide bonds. Finally, the protein was purified by HPLC on a Vydac C4 column using a linear gradient from 10 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min for 40 min. For the intracellular expression of rTCI, BL21(DE3)/pBAT-4-TCI and B834/pBAT-4-TCI were grown in Luria-Bertani medium and used to inoculate 0.5 liter of the same medium. At an A550 of 0.8–1.0, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 8 h of induction the culture was centrifuged, and cells were sonicated in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 8.5) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. After centrifugation the pellet was washed with Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 2% Triton X-100, dissolved in Tris buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 30 mm dithiothreitol, and kept for 6 h at 20 °C. Subsequently, the sample was dialyzed against Tris buffer containing 1 mm reduced and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione for 24 h before measurements of CP inhibitory activity. Molecular Mass Determination, Carboxymethylation, and Amino Acid Sequencing—The molecular masses of natural and of recombinant TCI were determined by MALDI-TOF MS on a Bruker Ultraflex spectrometer. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and matrix solution (sinapic acid in 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). To determine the number of cysteines the inhibitor (0.5 μg) was dissolved in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (0.2 m, pH 8.5) and further denatured and reduced by incubation with 5 m guanidine hydrochloride and 30 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 50 °C. Carboxymethylation of cysteines was achieved by the addition of 0.5 m iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The solution was diluted 10 times with water and analyzed using the same spectrometer. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was carried out by automatic Edman degradation using a Beckman LF3000 Protein Sequencer. Circular Dichroism and NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for CD spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving the proteins to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.0) or sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 6.5 or 8.0). CD analyses were carried out in a Jasco J-715 spectrometer at 25 or 90 °C using a cell with 2-mm path length. Reduction and/or denaturation were achieved by treating rTCI with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 24 h and/or dissolving the protein in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Protein samples for 1H and two-dimensional NMR experiments were prepared by dissolving the proteins in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 6.5) to a final concentration of 1 mm. NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX 500 MHz spectrometer at different temperatures using both normal and deuterated water. CP Inhibitory Activity—The inhibitory activity of rTCI was assayed by measuring the inhibition of the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH by carboxypeptidases type A and N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Arg-OH by carboxypeptidases type B at 350 nm. TAFI was activated to generate TAFIa immediately before use by incubation (2.2 μm) with TM (200 nm) and thrombin (160 nm) in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl at 23 °C for 40 min. All of the assays were performed in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 100 μm substrate. Inhibition constants (Ki) for the complexes of recombinant TCI and PCI with the different carboxypeptidases were determined using pre-steady-state kinetics as described for tight binding inhibitors (33Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The concentration of rTCI used in these assays was determined based on the A280 and a calculated extinction coefficient of E0.1% = 0.97. The inhibitory activity of rTCI toward CPN was tested by measuring its effect on the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate N-(3-[2-Furyl]-acryloyl)-Ala-Lys. The assay was performed in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.35 mm of the substrate at 37 °C and 340 nm. In Vitro Clot Lysis Assays—Clot lysis assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates using control human plasma (Dade Behring) diluted 1:3 with Hepes buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl. Clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis was initiated by simultaneous addition of thrombin (final concentration, 5 nm), CaCl2 (10 mm), and tPA (1.2 or 2.4 nm) in the absence or presence of TM (10 nm). The effects of rPCI and rTCI on clot lysis time were assessed by addition of various concentrations (0–2000 nm) into the assay mixture. In all of the experiments, microtiter plates were sealed with clear tape to avoid evaporation, and the turbidity of the clots at 405 nm was monitored at 37 °C using a Biolumin 960 plate reader (Molecular Dynamics). The time required for 50% clot lysis was determined graphically as the midpoint between the maximum absorbance after clot formation and the minimum after complete clot lysis. Purification, Protein Sequence Analysis, and Mass Determination of TCI—TCI was isolated from R. bursa ticks using a combination of reverse phase and affinity chromatography. A crude homogenate was prepared from 200 adult specimens, clarified by centrifugation, and injected into a reverse phase cartridge (Sep-Pak C18). The fractions were eluted with increasing acetonitrile concentrations, evaporated, and tested for inhibition of bovine CPA. The majority of the inhibitory activity was recovered in the fraction eluted at 20% acetonitrile. The material was subsequently loaded at intermediate pH onto an affinity column prepared by immobilization of bovine CPA on a Sepharose 4B resin. The inhibitor was strongly bound and could only be eluted using an extremely alkaline pH (phosphate buffer, pH 12); the recovery of the active inhibitor at such an extreme pH indicated a strong affinity toward CPA and a high stability of the protein. In a final reversed phase HPLC step a virtually homogeneous TCI preparation was obtained in a peak with a retention time of ∼31 min (10–60% linear acetonitrile gradient over 60 min). Using this procedure, ∼2 μg of TCI were isolated from 200 ticks. The purified TCI was analyzed by automated Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF MS. The sequence NH2-NECVSKGFGCLPQSDCPQEARLSYGGCSTV was obtained for the N-terminal 30 residues. Mass spectrometry revealed a molecular mass of 7798 Da for the native inhibitor. After reduction and carboxymethylation MS showed the incorporation of 12 carboxymethyl groups and no incorporation when the previous reduction was absent, suggesting that TCI contains 12 cysteine residues that are involved in disulfide bond formation. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of TCI cDNA—A combination of 3′- and 5′-RACE was used to clone the cDNA of TCI. Three degenerated oligonucleotides (N1, N2, and N3) were designed based on the N-terminal peptide sequence derived from the isolated TCI protein. First strand cDNA synthesized from R. bursa poly(A)+ RNA was used as template for three successive rounds of PCR with these oligonucleotides in combination with the two 3′-RACE adaptor oligonucleotides as primers. A major PCR product of about 340 base pairs was generated, purified, and cloned. Sequence analysis of the plasmid showed the presence of a 3′-cDNA fragment (nucleotides 166–494 of the complete cDNA; Fig. 1). This partial cDNA sequence was used to design two specific oligonucleotides for 5′-RACE. A fragment of ∼450 base pairs was amplified by nested PCR and cloned. Seven clones were sequenced that all contain fragments representing nucleotides 1–420 of the TCI cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1 the full-length TCI cDNA consists of 494 nucleotides and contains a 66-nt 5′-untranslated sequence, an open reading frame of 291 nucleotides, and a 137-nt 3′-untranslated region. A canonical polyadenylation signal AATAAA is found 16 nucleotides upstream the poly(A)+ tail. The deduced protein consists of 97 amino acid residues. A 22-residue hydrophobic signal peptide, predicted by the program SignalP (34Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. von Brunak S. Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), precedes the N-terminal Asn residue found in the TCI protein isolated from ticks. With 7935 Da the calculated molecular mass of the deduced mature protein (75 amino acid residues) is larger than that of natural TCI determined by MS (7798 Da). The observed difference of 137 Da corresponds to the mass of the C-terminal His75 residue that most likely is removed by proteolytic processing during the CPA affinity chromatography. Computer search analyses did not show significant homology with any deposited amino acid or nucleotide sequence. Heterologous Expression of rTCI—PCR was used to generate the 5′-bases that are missing in the partial cDNA obtained by 3′-RACE and code for the 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of mature TCI. The resulting semi-synthetic cDNA was ligated into the expression vector pBAT-4 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) that was previously utilized for the recombinant production of PCI and LCI (29Arolas J.L. Lorenzo J. Rovira A. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Ventura S Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7973-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The resulting expression plasmid pBAT-4-OmpA-TCI was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3). After induction of expression in shaker flasks, recombinant TCI was predominantly detected in the culture medium, suggesting that the OmpA signal peptide correctly directed the immature protein through the plasma membrane into the bacterial periplasmic space with concomitant removal of the signal peptide and subsequent release of mature rTCI through the outer membrane into the culture medium. Approximately 2 mg of rTCI/liter of supernatant were produced, of which 40–50% was recovered by purification using reverse phase and cation exchange chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this recombinant preparation several rTCI species were detected by reversed phase HPLC; these species most likely reflect different folding intermediates because one predominant species was obtained after treatment with reduced/oxidized glutathione (pH 8.5, 24 h), which showed a chromatographic retention time similar to that of natural TCI isolated from ticks. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and MALDI-TOF MS (7935 Da) verified the identity and correct processing of rTCI. In addition, MS analysis after treatment with the alkylating reagent vinylpyridine showed no incorporation of vinylpyridine groups, suggesting that all of the cysteine residues of this rTCI preparation are involved in disulfide bond formation. During optimization of rTCI production intracellular expression systems were also examined. Unfortunately, neither soluble intracellular TCI nor inclusion bo"
https://openalex.org/W1972681803,"The molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana specifically regulates the activity of the molybdenum enzymes aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase by converting their molybdenum cofactor from the desulfo-form into the sulfo-form. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with an NH2-terminal domain sharing significant similarities to NifS proteins that catalyze the decomposition of l-cysteine to l-alanine and elemental sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. Although different in its physiological function, the mechanism of ABA3 for sulfur mobilization was found to be similar to NifS proteins. The protein binds a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor and a substrate-derived persulfide intermediate, and site-directed mutagenesis of strictly conserved binding sites for the cofactor and the persulfide demonstrated that they are essential for molybdenum cofactor sulfurase activity. In vitro, the NifS-like domain of ABA3 activates aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase in the absence of the C-terminal domain, but in vivo, the C-terminal domain is required for proper activation of both target enzymes. In addition to its cysteine desulfurase activity, ABA3-NifS also exhibits selenocysteine lyase activity. Although l-selenocysteine is unlikely to be a natural substrate for ABA3, it is decomposed more efficiently than l-cysteine. Besides mitochondrial AtNFS1 and plastidial AtNFS2, which are both proposed to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation, ABA3 is proposed to be a third and cytosolic NifS-like cysteine desulfurase in A. thaliana. However, the sulfur transferase activity of ABA3 is used for post-translational activation of molybdenum enzymes rather than for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.

However, the sulfur transferase activity of ABA3 is used for post-translational activation of molybdenum enzymes rather than for iron-sulfur cluster assembly. NifS and NifS-like enzymes are present in almost all organisms and fulfill their main functions during iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) cluster synthesis. Accordingly, they have a cysteine desulfurase activity that is required for the mobilization of sulfur from l-cysteine by simultaneous release of l-alanine. In all NifS-like enzymes, the sulfide is bound as a persulfide to a conserved cysteine residue of the protein, from which it is subsequently transferred to other target proteins such as the scaffold proteins NifU and/or IscU in bacteria to finally assemble [Fe-S] clusters. A pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; AO, aldehyde oxidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; 1,5-I-AEDANS, N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylendiamine; Moco, molybdenum cofactor; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase. cofactor bound to a conserved lysine residue is essential for this cysteine desulfurase activity (1Zheng L.

However, besides [Fe-S] cluster formation, other functions for NifS-like proteins are described as well. The Escherichia coli IscS protein also was found to be involved in the biosynthesis of thiamin and NAD+ and to be able to transfer a sulfur atom to uridine to produce a 4-thiouridine tRNA (2Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In E. coli, another NifS-like protein, SufS (CsdB), is able to catalyze the elimination of selenium from l-selenocysteine more efficiently than the elimination of sulfur from l-cysteine (3Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, its physiological function is connected to its cysteine desulfurase activity, which is up to 50× higher when SufS forms a complex with SufE (4Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38352-38359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The only NifS-like protein in yeast, Nfs1p, is essential not only for [Fe-S] cluster formation in mitochondria but also for tRNA splicing (5Kolman C. Soll D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cell viability, this protein also needs to be localized in the cytosol and to some extent in the nucleus (6Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similar to bacteria, Arabidopsis thaliana also possesses more than one NifS-like protein: AtNFS1, which is located in mitochondria (7Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Storozhenko S. Davey M.W. Papenbrock J. De Rycke R. Engler G. Stephan U.W. Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. Van Montagu M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and AtNFS2, which is located in chloroplasts (8Léon S. Touraine B. Briat J.F. Lobreaux S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Pilon-Smits E.A. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, cysteine desulfurase activity was also shown for ABA3 (10Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ABA3 is a molybdenum cofactor (Moco) sulfurase consisting of an N-terminal NifS-like domain that is fused to a C-terminal domain with an as yet unknown function, thereby being distinguished from all other NifS-like proteins described thus far. Although its physiological function is unrelated to [Fe-S] cluster assembly, cysteine desulfurase activity and sulfur transferase activity of ABA3 were shown to be essential for the activation of the two Moco-containing enzymes aldehyde oxidase (AO; EC 1.2.3.1) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH; EC 1.1.1.204) that are involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis and degradation of purines, respectively (for review, see Refs. 11Mendel R.R. Haensch R. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 317-368PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hesberg C. Haensch R. Mendel R.R. Bittner F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13547-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After having incorporated the Moco, AO and XDH remain inactive unless one of the two oxygen ligands at the molybdenum center is replaced by a sulfur atom that is delivered by ABA3. This sulfuration step catalyzes the final maturation of AO and XDH enzymes that occur in both the sulfo-form and the desulfo-form in the living cell. By this mechanism, the plant is able to rapidly increase the activities of AO and XDH, e.g. for adapting to altering environmental conditions without de novo synthesis of AO and XDH apoproteins. In this work, we examined the mechanism of sulfur mobilization as catalyzed by the NifS-like domain of ABA3 from A. thaliana. We identified the nature of the cofactor and the sulfur bound by ABA3-NifS and characterized the sub-activities of the protein. Finally, we examined the function of the highly conserved lysine 271 and cysteine 430, and we discussed the role of the NifS-like domain during Moco sulfuration. Construction of Expression Vectors—During purification of the N-terminally His6-tagged protein, it became obvious that ABA3 is not only present in full-length with a molecular mass of about 90 kDa but also as a C-terminally truncated cleavage product. The molecular mass of this product was found to correspond well with the calculated mass of the ABA3 NifS-like domain as deduced from sequence comparison with other NifS-like proteins. Both full-length ABA3 and the cleavage product were detected by anti-His tag antibodies in immunoblot analysis. Therefore, the cleavage product as purified by affinity chromatography most likely represents the N-terminal NifS-like domain of ABA3. Hence, we cloned the 5′-region of 1518 bp of the aba3 cDNA open reading frame (GenBank AF325457) encoding a peptide of 506 amino acids with a molecular mass of ∼56 kDa and introduced a TGA termination codon at the 3′-end. The aba3 cDNA construct described previously (10Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was used for expression of the full-length protein and as a template for PCR generation of constructs expressing either the NifS-like domain or the C-terminal domain of ABA3, respectively. Primers for generating ABA3-NifS cDNA fragments were as follows: nifS-start-BamHI/NcoI, 5-TTT-CTT-GGA-TCC-ATG-GAA-GCA-TTT-CTT-AAG-GAA-TTC-3′; and nifS-stop-BamHI, 5′-ATA-TAT-GGA-TTC-TCA-GGT-TCC-ATT-CCC-AGT-CTT-CTT-3′. Primers for generating a 921-bp open reading frame of the C-terminal domain were as follows: C-term-start-BamHI, 5′-TAT-ATA-GGA-TTC-ATG-CAA-CTT-CTT-AGT-GAA-GAC-CTT-GAA-3′; and C-term-stop-BamHI, 5′-CAC-AAG-CGG-ATC-CTT-ATT-CAA-TAT-CTG-GAT-TAA-CTT-CTT-CCC-C-3′. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and subcloned into BamHI-pretreated pQE80 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), thereby fusing the respective protein's N terminus to a His6 tag. Expression of ABA3, ABA3-NifS, and ABA3-C—Protein expressions of ABA3, ABA3-NifS, and ABA3-C were performed in freshly transformed E. coli DL41 cells. Expression conditions for full-length ABA3 were as described previously (10Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For expression of ABA3-NifS, cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.5 before a combined induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5 g lactose/liter expression culture. After induction, cells were cultured for an additional 22 h at 22 °C. Hyperproduction of the C-terminal domain of ABA3 was performed by growing cells at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.5 before induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and additional culturing for 20 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –70 °C until use. Expression of AOα in Yeast—Overexpression of recombinant His6-tagged Arabidopsis AOα in the yeast Pichia pastoris (kindly provided by Tomokazu Koshiba, Tokyo, Japan) was performed as described previously (14Koiwai H. Akaba S. Seo M. Komano T. Koshiba T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—Purification of recombinant ABA3, its separately expressed domains, and AOα was performed on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow matrix (Qiagen) under native conditions at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were rebuffered to 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and stored at 4 °C, except for the C-terminal domain of ABA3 that was found to be unstable in low-salt buffers. For further purification, ABA3 proteins were subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a 10-ml Source Q-15 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA (buffer A). Protein samples were applied to the column and eluted with buffer A followed by a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A. Final purification and size determination were achieved by chromatography on a preparative 100-ml Superose 12 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT. Enzyme Assays—l-Cysteine desulfurase activity of recombinant ABA3 proteins was recorded either as the amount of l-alanine or as the amount of hydrogen sulfide released from l-cysteine as described previously (Refs. 1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar and 15Fogo J.K. Popowsky M. Anal. Chem. 1949; 21: 732-734Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar, respectively). l-Selenocysteine lyase activity was measured by determination of H2Se with lead acetate as described previously (16Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that assays were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.3, containing 2 mm DTT. The substrate l-selenocysteine always was freshly prepared from its oxidized form, l-selenocystine, under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 5 mol DTT/mol l-selenocystine as described in Ref. 16Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Km for l-cysteine was determined over a substrate range of 0.01–1 mm within 10 min at 37 °C with 20 μg of ABA3-NifS in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.3, by measuring the production of H2S. Km for l-selenocysteine was determined over a substrate range of 0.005–1 mm within 5 min at 37 °C with 25 μg of ABA3-NifS in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.3, by measuring the production of H2Se. Specific activities were determined with 20 μg of ABA3-NifS using 0.5 mm of each substrate during 10 min at 37 °C. Inactivation of recombinant AOα by cyanide was performed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, in the presence of 50 mm KCN for 20 h at 37 °C. After this incubation period, the generated thiocyanate was removed by rebuffering the protein to 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, before subsequent reconstitution assays. In vitro reconstitution of recombinant AOα by ABA3 was performed aerobically in a total volume of 150 μl of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Three μg of AOα were incubated with the respective ABA3 protein (10 mol ABA3 protein/mol AOα) in the presence of 0.5 mm l-cysteine for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by native PAGE with 0.33 volume of the reaction mixture and activity staining with indole-3-carboxaldehyde as substrate as described in Ref. 14Koiwai H. Akaba S. Seo M. Komano T. Koshiba T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Determination of Protein Concentrations—Concentrations of total soluble protein were determined by use of Roti Quant solution (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) as described in Ref. 17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar. Wavescan of ABA3 Proteins—Absorption spectroscopy was carried out using an Ultrospec 3000® spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of Pyridoxal Phosphate as the ABA3-bound Chromophore—PLP was identified by the specific fluorescence of a PLP-cyanide product that is formed during coincubation of free PLP and cyanide (18Adams E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 31: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PLP therefore has to be released from the protein by combined treatment with trichloroacetic acid and heating, by which the protein is denatured. Subsequent addition of potassium cyanide and adjustment of pH to 3.8 allows the detection of the formed PLP-cyanide product by following the fluorescence at 420 nm after excitation at 325 nm. Comparison of PLP-cyanide-specific fluorescence with a PLP standard curve allows the determination of absolute PLP amounts within a given protein sample of known concentration. As known from other NifS-like enzymes and indicated by the presence of one putative PLP-binding site within the primary sequence of ABA3, binding of one PLP molecule per ABA3 protein monomer was assumed. The concentration of the protein in each sample therefore was adjusted to ≤1 nmol to fit into the standard curve range (0–1 nmol). Because the molecular mass of the NifS-like domain of ABA3 is 55 kDa, a maximum amount of 55 μg of purified ABA3-NifS (1 μg = 0.01818 nmol) per sample can be used. Finally, fluorescence of the protein samples was measured, and excitation and emission spectra were detected and compared with those of pure PLP. Identification of the ABA3-bound Persulfide Intermediate—To prove the nature of the transferable sulfur bound by ABA3-NifS, we followed a procedure described previously (19Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Initially, 250 μg of ABA3-NifS were coincubated with 1 mml-cysteine for 30 min in a total volume of 500 μl to yield maximum saturation of the protein with transferable sulfur. Excess substrate in the sample was removed by buffer exchange using a microcon concentrator with a 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). ABA3-NifS then was coincubated with 0.2 mm 1,5-I-AEDANS for 1 min at 25 °C. The excess of unbound 1,5-I-AEDANS was removed by buffer exchange as described above to avoid nonspecific fluorescence. Subsequently, addition of 1 mm DTT released only those 1,5-I-AEDANS molecules from the protein that were bound via a disulfide bond that originated from an enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide. After separating low mass molecules from the protein sample, the low mass molecule fraction was analyzed for 1,5-I-AEDANS-specific fluorescence under UV light. A protein sample that was incubated in the absence of l-cysteine but treated in the same way at all other steps served as a control. Identification of the ABA3-bound Chromophore as PLP— A specific motif with an invariant lysine residue, conserved among NifS-like proteins (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), argued for PLP as a chromophoric cofactor bound to ABA3-NifS. Spectra of protein samples that were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures” were compared with those of pure PLP and found to be very similar, thus indicating that the bound chromophore is in fact PLP (Fig. 1). Furthermore, comparison of the protein-derived fluorescence with a PLP standard curve showed that the calculated number of PLP molecules bound by one monomer of ABA3-NifS is 0.91 in protein samples that were obtained when culturing E. coli in the presence of 5 mm pyridoxine (Table I). Lowering the pyridoxine concentrations in the E. coli growth medium also lowered the values for the PLP/monomer ratio, indicating that supplementation with pyridoxine is required when hyperproducing PLP-binding ABA3-NifS in E. coli and that each monomer of ABA3-NifS binds one PLP molecule.Table IMolar ratio of PLP molecules per molecule of ABA3-NifSSampleFluorescenceProtein/standard fluorescence ratioPLP standard521.5 ± 32.048Protein (0 mm pyr)340 ± 5.5080.652 ± 0.0106Protein (1 mm pyr)381 ± 3.0000.731 ± 0.0058Protein (5 mm pyr)489 ± 10.0670.938 ± 0.1007 Open table in a new tab Identification of the ABA3-bound Sulfur as Persulfide—For specific proof of a bound persulfide intermediate, we used the fluorescent alkylating reagent 1,5-I-AEDANS, which binds to exposed thiol groups of protein cysteinyl residues, thereby forming either thio-esters at free SH groups or disulfide bonds in the case of prebound persulfides. Once having bound to free SH groups, 1,5-I-AEDANS cannot be released from the protein by reducing agents such as DTT, whereas 1,5-I-AEDANS linked to the protein by disulfide bonds can be cleaved off efficiently in the presence of DTT by reducing both thiol groups of the disulfide bond. 1,5-I-AEDANS released from the protein by DTT treatment can be identified by its specific fluorescence. Our results show that a significantly higher fluorescence was detected in samples that contained ABA3-NifS pre-incubated with l-cysteine in comparison with samples that were not pre-incubated with l-cysteine (Table II). Thus, it can be concluded that during the incubation of ABA3-NifS with l-cysteine, a persulfide intermediate was formed that was later released by DTT treatment. Furthermore, significantly less 1,5-I-AEDANS-specific fluorescence was detected when using an altered protein carrying an alanine instead of a cysteine residue at position 430 (ABA3-NifS/C430A), indicating that the motif responsible for binding the persulfide intermediate contains cysteine 430 as an essential core residue.Table IIRatio of protein-bound persulfide as determined by 1,5-I-AEDANS-specific fluorescenceSampleIncrease of fluorescence (excitation, 322 nm; emission, 438 nm)NifS/C430A:NifS fluorescence ratio%ABA3-NifS59.735 ± 4.901ABA3-NifS/C430A11.258 ± 1.61518.85 Open table in a new tab Cysteine Desulfurase Activity of ABA3-NifS—To determine whether cysteine desulfurase activity of ABA3 is located within the NifS-like domain, we used ABA3-NifS to convert l-cysteine into l-alanine and elemental sulfur according to Ref. 1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar and as described previously for full-length ABA3 (10Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ABA3-NifS converted l-cysteine even more efficiently within a given time than equimolar amounts of full-length ABA3 (Fig. 2A). Addition of the C-terminal domain to the NifS-like domain reduced rather than enhanced cysteine desulfurase activity. These results were also reflected by the in gel AO activity assay, in which the sulfur as mobilized from l-cysteine and bound to ABA3 or ABA3-NifS, respectively, is transferred to the Moco of recombinant AOα. The NifS-like domain of ABA3 alone was found to have the ability to donate sulfur for activation of AOα (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, as seen for cysteine desulfurization, ABA3-NifS was more efficient than full-length ABA3 in activation of AOα, whereas the presence of the C-terminal domain again had no enhancing effect. Additionally, we quantified the amount of sulfide that was released as hydrogen sulfide in the presence of the reductant DTT to analyze the conversion of sulfur substrates other than l-cysteine that might not release l-alanine. Of all putative sulfur substrates tested, only l-cysteine and l-cysteine methylester were converted by ABA3-NifS. However, the amount of H2S detected when using l-cysteine methylester as substrate was only 37.9% relative to l-cysteine. No release of H2S was detected from the other tested substrates (l-cysteine ethylester, glutathione, β-mercaptopyruvate, l-cysteamine, and l-cystine). Identification of Residues Essential for Catalysis—Substitution of the invariant ABA3-NifS lysine 271, which corresponds to Azotobacter vinelandii lysine 202 and is believed to participate in PLP binding (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), with a serine (ABA3-NifS/K271S) resulted in complete loss of the yellow color that is typical for purified PLP-containing ABA3-NifS protein. This change in color is accompanied by a change of the visible spectrum of the altered protein. Whereas the spectrum of ABA3-NifS showed a maximum at ∼420 nm, no maximum but just a shoulder could be observed in the ABA3-NifS/K271S spectrum (Fig. 3A). On the activity level, this mutation caused a complete loss of cysteine desulfurase activity and Moco sulfurase activity (Fig. 3, B and C). Substituting the cysteinyl residue, which corresponds to A. vinelandii cysteine 325 and is proposed to bind the persulfide (19Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), with an alanine (ABA3-NifS/C430A) did not affect the spectroscopic properties of ABA3 (data not shown) but strongly reduced the two sub-activities of the protein. A residual cysteine desulfurase activity of ∼14% was found when comparing ABA3-NifS/C430A with ABA3-NifS (Fig. 3B). This decreased ability to mobilize sulfur from l-cysteine is reflected by the reduced ability of ABA3-NifS/C430A to activate recombinant AOα (Fig. 3C). Selenocysteine Lyase Activity of ABA3-NifS—Most NifS-like proteins catalyze not only the formation of elemental sulfur and alanine from l-cysteine but also the formation of elemental selenium and alanine from l-selenocysteine. It was found that ABA3-NifS decomposed the selenium substrate even more efficiently than the sulfur substrate l-cysteine. Using 0.5 mm l-cysteine as substrate, the specific activity of the purified enzyme was determined to be 3.7 mol product/min/mol protein, as measured by the production of H2S (Table III). In contrast, the specific activity with l-selenocysteine as substrate was 21.4 mol product/min/mol protein, as measured by the formation of l-alanine. Whereas the apparent Km of ABA3-NifS for l-cysteine is 50 μm, the Km for l-selenocysteine is 200 μm, indicating that ABA3-NifS prefers l-cysteine over l-selenocysteine. However, it should be noted that deviation from standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics was observed at concentrations above 1.0 mm for either substrate, thereby precluding the determination of true Km values for ABA3-NifS. Furthermore, because activity of ABA3-NifS is very sensitive to pH and temperature, the Km value might also depend on the conditions used.Table IIISubstrate specificity and kinetic properties of ABA3-NifSSubstrateKmSpecific activityμmmol product/min/mol proteinl-Cysteine501.8l-Selenocysteine20021.4 Open table in a new tab ABA3-NifS/K271S, which was shown to be unable to bind the PLP cofactor and therefore lost its cysteine desulfurase activity, was found to be blocked in selenocysteine lyase activity as well (Fig. 4). Furthermore, like the capacity to desulfurate l-cysteine, the ability to deselenate l-selenocysteine also was reduced to a residual activity of about 20% in the ABA3-NifS/C430A protein that was found earlier to be affected in persulfide binding. Moco sulfurases catalyze the transfer of a sulfur atom to the Mo center of enzymes belonging to the xanthine oxidase class such as AO and XDH, thereby activating these enzymes. Before Moco sulfuration, the molybdenum of the cofactor is coordinating two oxygen ligands, one of which has to be replaced by this sulfur atom. Previous experiments have shown that the Moco sulfurase ABA3 from A. thaliana is able to activate AOα from A. thaliana in vitro in the presence of l-cysteine as sulfur substrate (10Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of ABA3 reveals remarkable similarities to bacterial NifS and NifS-like enzymes, suggesting a common mechanism for sulfur mobilization and transfer. In this work, it was shown that the NifS domain of ABA3 binds a PLP cofactor and generates a protein-bound persulfide intermediate from the decomposition of l-cysteine, as was demonstrated previously for NifS from A. vinelandii (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 19Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, unlike other NifS-like proteins, ABA3 does not utilize the sulfur for [Fe-S] cluster assembly but transfers it to the Moco of AO and XDH for generation of the sulfurated form of Moco, which is the essential final step for activation of AO and XDH. In vitro, the NifS domain of ABA3 alone possesses not only cysteine desulfurase activity but also the capacity to activate AOα. Because this activation of AOα can be ascribed to the formation of sulfide, it can be assumed that any protein that releases sulfide in principal is able to sulfurate the Moco of AOα. However, in planta, all known mutations within the NifS-like domain of ABA3 lead to a complete loss of AO and XDH activity (10Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 20Schwartz S.H. Leon-Kloosterziel K.M. Koornneef M. Zeevaart J.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Xiong L. Ishitani M. Lee H. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2063-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), thereby demonstrating the specificity of ABA3. It is most likely that in vivo the specificity for ABA3 is bound to its subcellular localization, which is different from the localization of the other A. thaliana cysteine desulfurases. Unlike AtNFS1 and AtNFS2, which are located in mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively, ABA3 presumably is a cytosolic protein, like its target enzyme AO (22Cutler A.J. Krochko J.E. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It might well be that, in addition to the respective localization, the sulfur transfer from the NifS domain to the Moco of AO and XDH also needs the presence of the C-terminal domain. In vivo, the function of the C-terminal domain is required for activation of AO and XDH, as was shown recently by characterization of the tomato flacca mutant (23Sagi M. Scazzocchio C. Fluhr R. Plant J. 2002; 31: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although this Moco sulfurase mutant has detectable activities of AO and XDH in the roots, it shows a complete loss of AO and XDH activities in the shoot, indicating that the function of the C-terminal domain is a regulative one. Because cysteine desulfurization by ABA3-NifS is reduced in the presence of the C-terminal domain, an interaction of ABA3-NifS and the C-terminal domain during catalysis is not unlikely, although such an has not been able to be shown to date. 2T. Heidenreich and S. Wollers, unpublished data. Both full-length ABA3 and ABA3-NifS form homodimers with an apparent molecular mass of 200 ± 10 and 105 kDa, respectively, whereas the C-terminal domain is monomeric with a mass of 31 kDa. 3T. Heidenreich, S. Wollers, and M. Oreb, unpublished data. This implies that dimerization of full-length ABA3 is mediated by its NifS-like domain and that one ABA3 dimer mobilizes two sulfur atoms as required by AO and XDH, which are dimers of two independently acting subunits as well. Thus, it might well be that the C-terminal domain coordinates the sulfur transfer from one subunit of ABA3-NifS to one subunit of AO or XDH, thereby also affecting the efficiency of ABA3-NifS during sulfur mobilization. Like most of the NifS-like proteins, ABA3-NifS also was found to act on l-cysteine and l-selenocysteine. Decomposition of l-selenocysteine by ABA3-NifS was found to be more efficient than cysteine desulfurization, which is true for other NifS-like enzymes as well (24Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, no specific physiological function is obvious for the selenocysteine lyase activity of ABA3 because no selenium-containing enzymes were described for higher plants to this end. It is still questionable whether higher plants even possess the protein environment for the formation of l-selenocysteine and thus whether a mechanism for the decomposition of selenocysteine is required at all. When comparing ABA3-NifS with other NifS-like enzymes that were described to function in [Fe-S] cluster formation, it became obvious that ABA3-NifS comprises all properties and features that are typical for “classical” NifS-enzymes: (i) ABA3-NifS is a homodimer and mediates dimerization of the full-length ABA3 protein. (ii) It binds a PLP cofactor that is essential for cysteine desulfurase activity and consequently for sulfur transferase activity, as was shown by proving binding of one mole PLP per mole of ABA3-NifS and by characterization of the ABA3-NifS/K271S protein. (iii) It catalyzes the formation of l-alanine and elemental sulfur by using l-cysteine as substrate to generate an enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide, which was shown by treatment of the ABA3-NifS protein with the alkylating agent 1,5-I-AEDANS and by site-directed mutagenesis of the proposed persulfide binding site at cysteine 430. (iv) ABA3-NifS possesses sulfur transferase activity, which is required for transferring the persulfide sulfur to the Moco of AO and XDH, and (v) it harbors selenocysteine lyase activity, which also depends on the presence of PLP and is profoundly dependent on cysteine 430. Although the physiological function of ABA3 is very distinct from the function of all NifS proteins described thus far, our findings indicate that ABA3 can be referred to as a NifS-like protein. Hence, it can be concluded that besides AtNFS1 in mitochondria and AtNFS2 in chloroplasts, ABA3 represents a third and putative cytosolic NifS-like protein in A. thaliana.

It encoded a protein of 138 kDa, which was the truncated form of Duox2. At the same time, based on the functional homology existing between the leukocyte and the thyroid H2O2 generating systems, two cDNAs encoding two proteins of 1551 and 1548 amino acids, respectively, called ThOX1 and ThOX2 were cloned (15De Deken X.

These ThOX proteins belong to the family of NADPH oxidases and were later called Duox1/Duox2 because their expression is not restricted to the thyroid tissue and because they present peroxidase like domain at their N-terminal ends. In the thyroid Duox1/Duox2 show two N-glycosylated states: the fully glycosylated mature form (190 kDa) expressed at the plasma membrane and the high mannose glycosylated immature form (180 kDa) expressed exclusively inside the cell in the endoplasmic reticulum (16De Deken X.

Duox cDNA-transfected cell lines express only the immature form of the protein and no H2O2 production can be detected (16De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggesting the involvement of other proteins in the maturation process of Duoxs to permit the capacity of the oxidase system. It is well known that in the leukocyte gp91phox (also referred to as NOX2), the NADPH oxidase moiety of the superoxide anions generator, needs p22phox to be processed to the membrane (18Yu L.

These two proteins are able to activate NOX1, the NADPH oxidase responsible for O2˙− production mainly in the colon. The unsuccessful reconstitution of the H2O2-generating capacity in PLB-XCGD (gp91phox-knock-out PLB) cells with Duox1 and Duox2 suggests that other thyroid-specific factors are required to permit H2O2 production in thyroid (16De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The interaction of Duox with thyroid proteins was investigated by the yeast two-hybrid method to isolate potential partners that are able to play a physiological role in the maturation of protein leading to the generation of H2O2. The method allowed us to isolate a protein containing thioredoxin domains. Thioredoxins (Trx) are small proteins that were first identified in Escherichia coli. They are characterized by an evolutionary conserved active cysteine site, CGPC, which undergoes reversible oxidation of the two cysteine residues from dithiol to disulfide form (29Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maintenance of thioredoxin in its active reduced form is carried out by thioredoxin reductase in the presence of NADPH forming the thioredoxin system (29Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells thioredoxin has been implicated in a wide variety of biochemical functions. It functions as a hydrogen donor and facilitates the folding of disulfide containing proteins (31Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is also an antioxidant participating in the reduction of H2O2, scavenging free radicals and protecting against oxidative stress (32Zhang P. Liu B. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Rhee S.G. Obeid L.M.

The active sites of human Trx, Trx2, and TRP32 are identical to that of E. coli Trx, while modified active site sequences are found in TRP14 (CPDC), TMX (CPAC), Nrx (CPPC), and PDI (CGHC). Human Trx and TRP32 are localized in cytoplasm, Trx2 (also called mTrx), and Nrx are localized in the mitochondria and the nucleus respectively. TMX2 possesses only one cysteine at the active site (SNDC) and a predicted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane retention signal, KKXX-like motif, and is likely localized in ER (42Meng X. Zhang C. Chen J. Peng S. Cao Y. Ying K. Xie Y. Mao Y. Biochem. Genet. 2003; 41: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PDI has been known for many years to assist proteins containing disulfide bonds to fold in ER to attain their native structure. Studies also suggest that some PDIs are located in non-ER fractions and presumably have different functions (46Turano C. Coppari S. Altieri F. Ferraro A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Most of the thioredoxin domain-containing proteins are widely expressed in human tissues and have been proven to have Trx-like reducing activities in vitro by insulin disulfide reduction assay, but their precise physiological function in the cell remains to be defined (37Collet J.F.

In this study we report a novel thioredoxin-related protein EFP1 (EF-hand binding protein 1), which interacts with the intracellular part of Duox1 and Duox2 containing two EF-hand domains. It may play a critical role in the protein processing. Two-hybrid Screenings and Constructs—The cDNA fragment (DEF) corresponding to the first intracellular loop of dog Duox1 protein containing the two EF-hand domains (aa 616–1043, Fig. 1) was cloned by PCR downstream from the Gal4 DBD (DNA-binding domain) in the yeast two-hybrid vector pPC97. The construction was checked by sequencing confirming the correct reading frame of the fusion protein. A dog thyroid cDNA library constructed in pPC86 vector fused to Gal4 transcription-activating domain has been used for yeast two-hybrid screening (47Arsenijevic T. Degraef C. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Pirson I. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 673-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast host strain pJ69–4A was used for the screening and the reconstruction steps as described previously (48Vandenbroere I. Paternotte N. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Pirson I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For the screening, the pJ69–4A yeast containing Gal4DBD-DEF was transformed with the dog thyroid cDNA library mentioned above. The yeasts growing on medium without Leu and Trp (αLeuαTrp) were transformed with plasmids from the bait and the library. Such transformants were first selected on medium lacking His (αLeuαTrpαHis) and then on the medium lacking His and Ade (αLeuαTrpαHisαAde). DH10B bacteria were transformed by electroporation with the cDNAs coming from yeasts growing on αLeuαTrp αHisαAde medium. The potential partner, DEFP1 (dog Duox EF-hand partner 1), was isolated. Reconstruction was performed to verify the specificity of the interaction. The same procedure was applied for another construction HEF corresponding to the human EF-hand-containing fragment of Duox (aa 616–1043). Identification and Subcloning of Human cDNA-encoding DEFP1 Homologous Protein—Searches of non-redundant sequence and expressed sequence tag data bases with DEFP1 sequence yielded an unknown human protein (EFP1) sharing 74% identity with DEFP1. Simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) was used to perform hydropathy plot and motif analysis. The secondary structure was analyzed using the PredictProtein server. The cDNA in pME18SFL3 encoding 958 aa was purchased from Takara Biomedical Europe and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/HIS between EcoRI and NotI sites (Invitrogen). Demonstration of Interaction by Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—2 × 105 COS cells were transfected with the HIS-tagged EFP1 or/and human Duox cDNAs using FugENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in Laemmli buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol) to obtain total lysates, and with nondenaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02 mm sodium azide, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. Thyrocytes in primary culture were obtained from follicles isolated by collagenase digestion and differential centrifugation from fresh human thyroid as described previously (49Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 50Roger P.P. Dumont J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The thyrocytes were harvested after 4 days of culture in lysis buffer described above. After preclearing, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-Duox or anti-TPO mAb15 antibodies that had been prelinked to 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (16De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and analyzed by 4–6% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The membrane was immunodetected with anti-Duox (1/8000)/anti-rabbit Ig-HRP (1/10,000) and anti-TPO mAb47 (1/1000)/anti-mouse Ig-HRP (1/10,000), respectively. 12% SDS-PAGE was used to detected p22phox with anti-p22 mAb448 (1/200)/anti-mouse Ig-HRP (1/10,000). After stripping treatment (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 30 min at 60 °C), the membrane was immunodetected with monoclonal anti-HIS (1/10,000)/anti-mouse Ig-HRP (10,000) in transfected cells, with polyclonal anti-hTRX (2 μg/ml)/anti-goat biotinylated (1/10,000)/strepavidin (1/2000) in human thyrocyte co-immunoprecipitation. Anti-Duox antibodies were produced by our group (15De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar); anti-TPO mAb15 and mAb47 and anti-p22phox mAb448 were kindly given by Dr. J. Ruf (51Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Dr. D. Roos (52Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G. Meerhof L.J. van Zwieten R. Keijer J. Weening R.S. Roos D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively; anti-HIS and anti-human TRX antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences; anti-rabbit Ig-HRP, anti-mouse Ig-HRP, anti-goat biotinylated, and streptavidin were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Immunofluorescence—CHO-K1 cells were seeded on a cover glass (Corning Glass) and transfected with the HIS-tagged EFP1 and/or human Duox cDNAs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde on ice during 15 min. After permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100 and blocking with 5% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with the polyclonal antibodies against Duox (1/2000) or/and monoclonal antibody against HIS tag (1/200) in 0.3% dithiothreitol-bovine serum albumin. These primary antibodies were finally detected using anti-rabbit-Texas Red (1/50) or/and anti-mouse-FITC (1/50, Amersham Biosciences). The observations were made on an Axioplan2 imaging fluorescence inverted microscope (Zeiss) and a confocal microscope (MRC 1024, Bio-Rad) fitted on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss). Expression Profile of EFP1 mRNA in Human Tissues—An equal amount of cDNA from multiple tissue cDNA (MTC™) panel II (BD Biosciences) and of cDNA resulting from reverse transcription of total RNA prepared from human thyrocytes in primary culture were used to perform PCR with the specific human Duoxs and EFP1 primers (for Duox1, 5′-GTGTCTGAGAAGCTCGTGGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGAGGGTCTGTGTCCATGG-3′ (reverse); Duox2, 5′-ATGGGACTTCTGCGTGCGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATACCATTTCCACCTCCACC-3′ (reverse); EFP1, 5′-CCACTTCTCTACATCCCATCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCATCAACCTCACATTTCTTC-3′ (reverse)). The amount of amplified cDNA was normalized using the PCR amplification of G3PDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) with the primers provided in the kit. To confirm the RT-PCR results, a human multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blot (Clontech) and a blot with 2 μg of human thyroid mRNA were hybridized with an EFP1-specific probe obtained by PCR using EFP1F and EFP1R primers as described above. The blots were re-hybridyzed with a probe obtained by PCR (T1-F, 5′-TTTCCCCGAGACTCGCAGAAC-3′; T1-R: 5′-AAGCTGGGCAGCCACTCATAC-3′) corresponding to the common region of Duox1 and Duox2 (53Pachucki J. Wang D. Christophe D. Miot F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 214: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Total RNA from human thyroid tissue was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The mRNA was prepared using PolyATtract mRNA isolation systems (Promega) and 2 μg were quantified spectrophotometrically. Isolation of EFP1 as a Partner of Duox1 by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The cDNA corresponding to the first intracellular loop of dog Duox1 protein containing two EF-hand domains (DEF, aa 956–1248; Fig. 1) was cloned by PCR downstream from the Gal4 DBD in the yeast two hybrid vector pPC97 and was used to screen a dog thyroid cDNA library cloned downstream from the Gal4 activation domain in the yeast two hybrid vector pPC86. 1.8 × 106 transformants growing on αLeuαTrp medium were screened with the bait. Forty-two and 14 positive clones were isolated after plating on αLeuαTrpαHis and αLeuαTrpαHisαAde selective media, respectively. The cDNAs of potential partners of the positive clones were purified and re-introduced in yeasts in pPC97 vectors expressing Gal4 DBD-containing HEF (human EF-hand-containing sequence) or DEF to confirm interaction and p45 (an unrelated protein) to check the specificity of the interaction with the bait. After the reconstruction the positive clones were sequenced. As shown in Fig. 1, clones n1.5 and n5.1 interacted only with DEF and HEF baits. No interaction occurred with pPC97 alone nor with Gal4 DBD fused with an irrelevant protein p45. Sequence analysis revealed that the two cDNAs, n1.5 and n5.1, corresponded to a dog protein showing high similarity with the so called hypothetical human protein LOC51061 (GenBank™ accession number NP_056998). This human peptide sequence is a fragment of a 958-amino acid protein with a theoretical PI of 6.14 and a molecular mass of 107.511 kDa according to PeptideMass program. This protein shares 82.9% similarity with a mouse protein of 948 aa (GenBank™ accession number NP_083858). We called it EFP1. The gene encoding the protein EFP1 possesses 13 exons and is located on chromosome 16p13.13. N1.5 and n5.1 cDNAs encoded peptides corresponding to aa 744–958 and 644–874 of human EFP1 and sharing 67 and 81% identity in amino acids, respectively, with this human protein. The alignment of these two overlapping dog cDNAs showed 74% identity in amino acids with human EFP1 (Fig. 2A). Further sequence analysis predicted EFP1 as a protein without signal peptide but containing two thioredoxin domains. The second thioredoxin domain was located between aa 665 and 772 and contained the conserved active site motif WCGFC (aa 691–695). The first thioredoxin domain (aa 124–211) contained only one cysteine in the active site motif (WCGQS). The structure analysis of EFP1 using the Predict-Protein program showed that the thioredoxin domains shared the same secondary structure of thioredoxin (54Martin J.L. Structure (Camb.). 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar); both of them comprise β-α-β structure followed by β-β-α structure, and the active cysteines were located in the loop separating a β-strand and an α-helix (Fig. 2B). Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila data base screening (tblastn of Blast program) with the EFP1 protein sequence showed that the amino acid sequence around the potential active site (aa 683–747) of EFP1 shared 40% identity and 59% similarity with the C. elegans protein disulfide isomerase-3 (PDI-3) and 37% identity and 60% similarity with Drosophila D-ERp60 (PDI isoform) (Fig. 3A). A multiple amino acid sequences alignment showed that EFP1 shared 30–46% similarities with several other mammalian thioredoxin-related proteins (Fig. 3B). It is noteworthy that during the preparation of this manuscript, the sequence of protein LOC51061 has been modified. The most recent sequence corresponding to a protein of 985 amino acids instead of in the previous 958 amino acids with 27 amino acids insertion between aa 264 and 265 (ALESTSSPRALVSFTGEWHLETKIYVL), which does not contain particular domains or structure after analysis with the PredictProtein program. Interestingly the mouse homolog does not contain this 27-aa stretch. EFP1 Tissue Distribution—The tissue distribution of EFP1 was investigated by RT-PCR amplification on a panel of cDNAs. A human multiple tissue cDNA panel and cDNA from reverse-transcribed total RNA of human thyrocytes in primary culture were used. The amount of amplified cDNA was normalized and compared with the expression of G3PDH. As shown in Fig. 4, EFP1 and Duox2 shared the same tissue expression distribution, i.e. basal level expression was observed in all of the nine tissues (except Duoxs in leukocytes), and high expression of EFP1, Duox1, and Duox2 was found in thyroid and prostate.

https://openalex.org/W2085022379,"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) activates the G-protein-coupled receptor leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1) to mediate a diverse array of cellular responses in leukocytes including chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, degranulation, and gene expression. To determine the role of phosphorylation in BLT1 regulation, we generated mutants of BLT1 in which all of the serine/threonine residues in the C-tail are converted to alanine or to aspartate/glutamate. These mutants expressed in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells bound LTB4 with similar affinity and activated all of the known functional activities of BLT1, albeit at different levels. The conversion of phosphorylation sites to alanine resulted in enhanced G-protein-mediated activities, whereas conversion to aspartate/glutamate resulted in reduced responses and a right shift in dose response, indicating that receptor phosphorylation is a critical regulator of G-protein-mediated pathways. Surprisingly, translocation of β-arrestin and receptor internalization was completely independent of BLT1 phosphorylation. Real-time analysis of β-arrestin translocation and receptor internalization using digital fluorescence video microscopy in cells expressing a red fluorescent protein labeled BLT1 and a green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin confirmed phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin translocation and internalization of BLT1. In β-arrestin-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, the BLT1 receptors failed to display endosomal localization upon stimulation. In these cells, co-expression of β-arrestin-green fluorescent protein with BLT1-red fluorescent protein resulted in co-localization of BLT1 and β-arrestin upon activation. Thus, receptor phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms regulate G-protein-mediated pathways; however, phosphorylation-independent mechanisms regulate β-arrestin association and internalization of BLT1. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) activates the G-protein-coupled receptor leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1) to mediate a diverse array of cellular responses in leukocytes including chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, degranulation, and gene expression. To determine the role of phosphorylation in BLT1 regulation, we generated mutants of BLT1 in which all of the serine/threonine residues in the C-tail are converted to alanine or to aspartate/glutamate. These mutants expressed in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells bound LTB4 with similar affinity and activated all of the known functional activities of BLT1, albeit at different levels. The conversion of phosphorylation sites to alanine resulted in enhanced G-protein-mediated activities, whereas conversion to aspartate/glutamate resulted in reduced responses and a right shift in dose response, indicating that receptor phosphorylation is a critical regulator of G-protein-mediated pathways. Surprisingly, translocation of β-arrestin and receptor internalization was completely independent of BLT1 phosphorylation. Real-time analysis of β-arrestin translocation and receptor internalization using digital fluorescence video microscopy in cells expressing a red fluorescent protein labeled BLT1 and a green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin confirmed phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin translocation and internalization of BLT1. In β-arrestin-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, the BLT1 receptors failed to display endosomal localization upon stimulation. In these cells, co-expression of β-arrestin-green fluorescent protein with BLT1-red fluorescent protein resulted in co-localization of BLT1 and β-arrestin upon activation. Thus, receptor phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms regulate G-protein-mediated pathways; however, phosphorylation-independent mechanisms regulate β-arrestin association and internalization of BLT1.

Bray M.A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith M.J. Nature. 1980; 286: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). LTB4 also activates a wide range of other biological responses in leukocytes including the respiratory burst, granule release, and changes in gene expression (2Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A.

Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Whereas the high affinity receptor BLT1 is expressed mainly in phagocytic leukocytes and T-lymphocytes, the low affinity receptor BLT2 is more ubiquitously expressed. A number of studies using gene-targeted mice and antagonists and genetic analysis in mice and humans have implicated the importance of leukotrienes and their receptors in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (6Brink C.

However, the molecular mechanisms of signaling and regulation of leukotriene receptor functions largely remain unexplored.The activation of BLT1 in primary leukocytes or in cell lines expressing BLT1 results in G-protein activation, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization, exocytosis, and chemotaxis (3Yokomizo T.

Although BLT1 couples to both Gi and Gq family of proteins, the activation of Gi is essential for chemotaxis. An eighth helix in the cytoplasmic tail of BLT1 as well as threonine 308 within this region was shown to modulate the receptor activity (9Okuno T. Ago H. Terawaki K. Miyano M. Shimizu T. Yokomizo T.

Phosphorylation of GPCRs by a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase results in uncoupling of the receptor from G-proteins (12Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). This desensitization process is further facilitated by the association of the phosphorylated receptors with the cytoplasmic adaptor, β-arrestin (13Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor-β-arrestin complex associates with clathrin and accessory proteins involved in the formation of clathrin-coated pits, ultimately leading to receptor internalization (14Ferguson S.S.

To investigate the role of receptor phosphorylation in BLT1 regulation, we generated a phosphorylation-deficient mutant by conversion of all of the serine/threonine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of BLT1 to alanine. These serine/threonine residues were also mutated to aspartate/glutamate, respectively, to mimic constitutive phosphorylation. Such phosphomimic mutants have been used extensively to simulate constitutive phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases (16Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The results showed that phosphorylation of BLT1 is an important regulator of signaling through G-proteins but revealed an unexpected dissociation of receptor phosphorylation from interaction with β-arrestin and internalization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[32P]Orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol) and [3H]leukotriene B4 (163 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. LTB4 was obtained from Cayman Chemicals. Rat collagen was obtained from Collaborative Biochemicals, and 25 × 80-mm, 8-μm pore size polycarbonate filters were from Neuroprobe Inc. The staining kit (PROTOCOL) was obtained from Fisher. Monoclonal 12CA5 antibody and protein G-agarose were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Indo-I was purchased from Molecular Probes (Boston, MA). Geneticin (G418) and all of the tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. The mutant oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized from Midland Certified Reagent Company and MWG Biotech Inc. Restriction endonucleases and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The glass bottom dishes were purchased from World Precision Instruments. pDSRed2 N1 and enhanced GFP vectors were purchased from Clontech. All of the other chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher of analytical grade.Construction of Epitope-tagged Phosphorylation Site Mutants and Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP)-tagged hBLT1—The construction of cDNA of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged hBLT1 was described previously (8Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction was performed with Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) to generate phosphorylation-deficient mutants of hBLT1 (hBLT1-Ala, hBLT1-Asp/Glu) as well as a C-terminal truncated hBLT1 (hBLT1-ΔCyto). hBLT1-ΔCyto was generated by deleting the C-terminal 44 amino acids by altering the codon 308 into a stop codon, and the only remaining serine in the C-tail at amino acid 295 was mutated to Ala using standard PCR methods. hBLT1-Ala and hBLT1-Asp/Glu were generated using a two-step PCR method. The first PCR products for hBLT1-Ala or hBLT1-Asp/Glu were obtained using forward and reverse mutant oligonucleotides (for hBLT1-Ala: hBLT1-Ala-FP1, 5′-GCTGGAGGGCGCGGGTGCCGAGGCGGCCGCCGCGCGCCGCGGGGGCGCCCTGGGCCAGGCCGCTAGGGCCGGCCCC-3′, and hBLT1-Ala-RP1, 5′-TCTAGAAAGCTTCTAGTTCAGTTCGTTTAACTTGAGAGGGGCGGCGGCTGCGAGCGCCTCGGCAGGGCCG-3′; for hBLT1-Asp/Glu: hBLT1-Asp/Glu-FP1, 5′-GCTGGAGGGCGAGGGTGACGAGGCGGACGACGAGCGCCGCGGGGGCGACCTGGGCCAGGAGGCTAGGGACGGCC-3′, and hBLT1-Asp/Glu-RP1, 5′-TCTAGAAAGCTTCTAGTTCAGTTCGTTTAACTTGAGAGGGTCGTCGGCCTCGAGGTCCTCGTCAGGGC-3′). The second PCR products for these mutants were obtained by using the first PCR product along with S295A (5′-CCGTGCTGTACGCGTGCGCCGGCGGCGGCCTGCTGCGCGCGGCGGGCGTG-3′) or S295D (5′-CCGTGCTGTACGCGTGCGCCGGCGGCGGCCTGCTGCGCGACGCGGGCGTG-3′). The second PCR products were digested with MluI and HindIII and swapped with the hBLT1-WT full-length construct at the same restriction enzyme sites. The presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The RFP was tagged at the C-terminal of hBLT1-WT and its mutants. This was accomplished by in-frame cloning the entire coding region of these receptors without a stop codon ahead of the RFP-coding region in pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech) vector. The full-length coding region of these receptors along with hemagglutinin tag at the N terminus was amplified with hBLT1-tag (5′-GGTACCGAATTCGCCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTAACACTACATCTTCTGCAGCA-3′) and hBLT1-Red-RP (5′-GCGGCCAGGATCCTCGTTCAGTTCGTTTAAC-3′). These products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pDsRed2-N1 vector at same restriction enzyme sites (hBLT1-RFP). The entire regions were sequenced to confirm the reading frame and to rule out the presence of nonspecific mutations.Cell Culture, Transfection, Expression of Receptors, Phosphorylation, β-Hexosaminidase Release and Chemotaxis—RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The transfections were performed by electroporation protocol. For each transfection, 20 μg of receptor DNA (hBLT1-WT, hBLT1-ΔCyto, hBLT1-Ala, and hBLT1-Asp/Glu) and 2 μg of pRSV-neomycin vector were used. The stable single cell-derived cell line with the hBLT1-WT and its mutants were maintained in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. 25 μg of hBLT1-RFP and 15 μg of β-arrestin1-GFP were used for transient expression (17Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in complete in growth medium for 24 h after transfection and used for microscopy. The cell surface expression was determined by incubating receptor or parental cells with 12CA5 antibody followed by FITC-labeled secondary antibody and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Receptor phosphorylation, β-hexosaminidase release assay, and chemotaxis were performed as described previously (18Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ligand Binding—The cells were subcultured overnight in 24-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in growth medium. Cells were then rinsed with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% BSA, and cells were incubated with radiolabeled ligand (0.25 nm) along with various concentrations of unlabeled ligand (0.3, 0.6, 1, 3, 10, 100, and 1000 nm) for 2 h in the same medium in triplicates on ice. The reactions were stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS containing 0.1% BSA and washed three times with same buffer. The cells were lysed with 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and bound radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific radioactivity bound was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand.Calcium Measurements—Calcium mobilization was monitored in Indo-I-loaded cells (hBLT1-WT, hBLT1-ΔCyto, hBLT1-Ala, and hBLT1-Asp/Glu) stimulated with various concentrations of LTB4. Each experiment represents an analysis of 3 × 106 cells. The cells were detached from monolayer using Versene and incubated with fresh normal medium for 3–4 h. After incubation, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were resuspended in 1× PBS containing 1% BSA at the concentration of 3 × 106/ml. The 3 × 106 cells were loaded with 1.2 μl of pluronic acid (200 mg/ml in Me2SO) and 1.5 μl of Indo-1 (1 mm solution) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing PBS + 0.1% BSA. The cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm CaCl2. The response to various concentrations of ligand was recorded using a spectrofluorometer (F2500, Hitachi, San Jose, CA).Real-time Fluorescence Microscopy—The cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding proteins tagged either with GFP or RFP into RBL-2H3 cells/mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) by electroporation. The cells were grown for 24 h and replated on glass bottom dishes (thickness of glass was 0.17 mm) and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with RPMI 1640 media without phenol red and observed using oil immersion ×60 objective lens. The fluorescence images were collected with TE-FM Epi-Fluorescence system attached to Nikon Inverted Microscope Eclipse TE300. All of the images were captured by cool snap HQ digital B/W CCD (Roper Scientific) camera. A LAMDA 10-2 optical filter changer (Sutter Instrument Company) was used to capture sequential images in different fluorescence wavelengths (for RFP, Texas Red exciter (572 nm) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/FITC/Texas Red emitter (460, 520, and 600 nm); for GFP, FITC exciter (492 nm) and emitter GRNYFP (535 ± 15 nm), Chroma Technology Corp.). All of the data obtained were analyzed on Metamorph 4.6r5 software. All of the images shown are representative of at least 10 individual images collected from at least three separate experiments.RESULTSPhosphorylation-dependent Desensitization of hBLT-1— Phosphorylation-defective or phosphomimic mutants of hBLT1 were generated by substituting the 14 Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal tail with Ala (hBLT1-Ala) or with Asp/Glu (hBLT1-Asp/Glu) (Fig. 1A) and stably expressed to similar levels in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 1B). A stable cell line expressing a mutant truncated at amino acid 306 at the C terminus of hBLT-1 (hBLT1-ΔCyto) was also generated. Competition ligand binding experiments (Fig. 1C) indicated the affinity to LTB4 of hBLT1-WT (0.7 nm) is comparable to that seen in neutrophils and in other BLT1-transfected cell lines (3Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 19Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The similar levels of expression and binding affinities for hBLT1-Ala (1.28 nm) and hBLT1-Asp/Glu (1.31 nm) suggest that these properties of BLT1 remain unaltered by the above mutations in the C-terminal tail. hBLT1-ΔCyto showed a 10-fold decrease in ligand binding affinity relative to the hBLT1-WT receptors (Fig. 1C). Stable cell lines expressing a RFP at the C terminus of hBLT1 or the mutants were also generated and showed similar functional activities as native receptors (see below).LTB4 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated the phosphorylation of hBLT1-WT (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3) or hBLT-WT-RFP (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6) by severalfold but not in alanine substitution mutants of this receptor, hBLT1-Ala or hBLT1-Ala-RFP (lanes 7–11). None of these agents stimulated detectable phosphorylation of the hBLT1-Asp/Glu or hBLT1-ΔCyto even after prolonged exposures (data not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of hBLT1 is limited to serine/threonine residues in the cytoplasmic tail. Similar phosphorylation profile of the RFP fusion of hBLT1 suggests normal folding of the hBLT1-RFP and also indicates that RFP itself does not contribute any ligand-dependent or independent phosphorylation sites. The increase in the molecular mass of the protein reflects the additional ∼20 kDa contributed by RFP.Fig. 2Phosphorylation of BLT-1. 32P-Labeled RBL cells (3 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) expressing hBLT1 or hBLT1-RFP or the indicated mutants were incubated for 5 min with LTB4 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as indicated. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 antibody and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ligand-dependent chemotaxis of hBLT1-WT and mutants was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3A). Whereas hBLT1-WT and hBLT1-Ala showed a typical bell-shaped curve, the phosphomimic mutant, hBLT1-Asp/Glu and hBLT1-ΔCyto, showed very poor responses at low concentrations of LTB4. However, comparable chemotaxis responses were seen at higher concentrations of LTB4. A similar dose response profile was also observed for the release of β-hexosaminidase with the phosphomimic hBLT1-Asp/Glu responding very weakly at low concentrations of LTB4 but reaching the same maximal response as hBLT1-WT (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the phosphorylation-defective hBLT1-Ala activated a stronger response of β-hexosaminidase release than hBLT1-WT. Consistent with the lack of ligand-induced phosphorylation, the hBLT1-ΔCyto also showed enhanced β-hexosaminidase release compared with hBLT1-WT.Fig. 3A, chemotaxis. Ligand-dependent chemotaxis of hBLT1-WT and its mutants was measured using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the mean ± S.E. of cells from four individual fields for each concentration from a representative experiment of at least three repetitions. B, LTB4-induced degranulation. RBL cells expressing hBLT1-WT or its mutants were cultured in growth medium and stimulated with LTB4 (indicated concentrations) for 10 min. The supernatants were removed and assayed for degranulation by measuring the release of β-hexaminidase. The data were expressed as percentage of total β-hexaminidase present in cells. Data shown are from a representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4 shows the dose response profiles for calcium mobilization by hBLT1-WT, hBLT1-Ala, and hBLT1-Asp/Glu cells. None of these cells showed any response to vehicle (ethanol) control. LTB4 induced a rapid and transient release of intracellular calcium in hBLT1-WT cells. hBLT1-Ala resulted in a more sustained calcium response at all of the concentrations of LTB4 (Fig. 4B). Similar sustained calcium responses were also seen with hBLT1-ΔCyto but at concentrations consistent with its lower affinity for LTB4 (data not shown). The hBLT1-Asp/Glu failed to release any calcium at lower concentrations of ligand, although the same maximal response was observed at higher concentrations of LTB4 (Fig. 4C). The cumulative data for the calcium release is shown in Fig. 4D where hBLT1-Ala curve shifted to the left side, suggesting the release of higher calcium at lower concentrations of ligand compared with hBLT1-WT. In contrast to hBLT1-Ala, the hBLT1-Asp/Glu mutant curve showed a significant shift to the right side. The results from all of the functional activities suggest that the phosphorylation-deficient hBLT1-Ala is a hyperactive mutant lacking desensitization, whereas the phosphomimic hBLT1-Asp/Glu is behaving as a constitutively desensitized receptor.Fig. 4Intracellular calcium release. RBL cells expressing hBLT1-WT (A), hBLT1-Ala (B), and hBLT1-Asp/Glu (C) loaded with Indo-1 were induced with various concentrations (black line, 0.1 nm; red line, 0.3 nm; green line, 1.0 nm; yellow line, 3.0 nm; blue line, 10 nm; and pink line, 100 nm) of LTB4, and the Ca2+ mobilization was measured. D, dose response curves of percent calcium release for hBLT1-WT and its mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation-independent β-Arrestin Translocation and Internalization of BLT-1—To determine the role of phosphorylation in ligand-dependent β-arrestin association and internalization, cell lines stably expressing hBLT1-WT or mutants were transiently transfected with β-arrestin1-GFP. Live imaging of these cells revealed the completely unexpected observation that ligand-induced phosphorylation is not a critical event in β-arrestin translocation (Fig. 5). The cells expressing hBLT1-Ala, hBLT1-ΔCyto, and hBLT1-Asp/Glu mutants also induced β-arrestin translocation upon LTB4 treatment, albeit with slightly delayed kinetics. Fig. 5 shows time-dependent vesicular forms of β-arrestin upon the addition of the ligand. To further evaluate the BLT1 internalization and the interaction with β-arrestin1, hBLT1-WT and its mutants were tagged with red fluorescent protein at the C terminus of the receptors. RBL-2H3 cells were co-transfected with RFP-tagged receptor along with β-arrestin1-GFP, and the fluorescence of RFP and GFP was measured continuously as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see supplemental videos for continuous monitoring in live cells). Fig. 6 shows the time-dependent co-localization of the receptor (hBLT1-WT (left panels); hBLT1-Ala (middle panels); and hBLT1-Asp/Glu (right panels)) and β-arrestin (yellow vesicles), presumably in the clathrin-coated pits upon the addition of the ligand. A semi-quantitative line scan of red and green fluorescence intensities at the membrane and cytoplasmic locations indicated the translocation of β-arrestin from cytoplasm to membrane and a time-dependent decrease (∼30%) of RFP receptors from the membrane. The fluorescence measurements also demonstrated the delay in translocation of β-arrestin and receptor internalization in the case of the mutants compared with wild type (Fig. 6, right panels).Fig. 5LTB4-induced changes in localization of β-arrestin. RBL cell lines expressing similar levels of the indicated WT or mutant BLT-1 receptors were co-transfected with β-arrestin-GFP. After the addition of LTB4 (0 time), green fluorescence images were collected every 10 s for 30 min using appropriate filters. Rapid (1 min) translocation of β-arrestin-GFP was seen with BLT1-WT. A delayed but comparable translocation of β-arrestin-GFP was also observed with all of the phosphorylation-defective BLT-1 mutants. With time, vesicular distribution of β-arrestin-GFP was seen with both native and mutant receptors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6LTB4-induced co-localization of hBLT1 and β-arrestin. β-Arrestin-GFP (15 μg) was co-transfected with hBLT1-WT-RFP or with hBLT1-Ala-RFP or with hBLT1-Asp/Glu-RFP into RBL-2H3 cells. After the addition of LTB4 (0 time), red and green fluorescence images were collected every 10 s for 70 min using appropriate filters as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With time, co-localization of β-arrestin-GFP and receptor RFP (yellow) was seen with both native and mutated receptors. The right panel shows fluorescence quantification with the different hBLT1 constructs as indicated. The average red and green fluorescence intensities at five different membrane (red outside and green outside) and cytoplasmic locations (green inside) were measured by Metamorph software at different time intervals and plotted as percent maximum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A hBLT1-ΔCyto-RFP construct was also generated to determine the role of the cytoplasmic tail in β-arrestin interaction and internalization. Although significant surface expression was observed, much of the hBLT1-ΔCyto-RFP remained in the cytoplasm. This could be due to the exact location of RFP at the end of the eighth helix in BLT1, resulting in incomplete processing and membrane translocation. Despite this limited surface expression, the addition of LTB4 resulted in clear ligand-induced translocation of β-arrestin to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7).Fig. 7LTB4-induced changes in β-arrestin localization. β-Arrestin-GFP (15 μg) was co-transfected along with hBLT1-ΔCyto-RFP into RBL-2H3 cells. After the addition of LTB4 (0 time), red and green fluorescence images were collected every 10 s for 30 min using appropriate filters as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The red (receptor), green (β-arrestin), and overlay of the two images at 0, 5, and 15 min are shown. Much of the hBLT1-ΔCyto-RFP remained in the cytoplasm, even in the absence of stimulation. Clear ligand-induced translocation of β-arrestin-GFP is seen at 5 and 15 min (middle panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Arrestin Is Required for BLT-1 Internalization—To determine the role of β-arrestin in BLT1 internalization, we expressed hBLT1-RFP in the presence or absence of β-arrestin1-GFP in β-arrestin-/- or in β-arrestin+/+ MEFs derived from β-arrestin1/β-arrestin2 double knock-out mice"
https://openalex.org/W2104589509,"Hyperhomocysteinemia is believed to induce endothelial dysfunction and promote atherosclerosis; however, the pathogenic mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which homocysteine (HCy) causes endothelial cell apoptosis and by which nitric oxide (NO) affects HCy-induced apoptosis. Our data demonstrated that HCy caused caspase-dependent apoptosis in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, as determined by cell viability, nuclear condensation, and caspase-3 activation and activity. These apoptotic characteristics were correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, p53 and Noxa expression, and mitochondrial cytochrome c release following HCy treatment. HCy also induced p53 and Noxa expression and apoptosis in endothelial cells from wild type mice but not in the p53-deficient cells. The NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, adenoviral transfer of inducible NO synthase gene, and antioxidants (α-tocopherol and superoxide dismutase plus catalase) but not oxidized SNAP, 8-Br-cGMP, nitrite, and nitrate, suppressed ROS production, p53-dependent Noxa expression, and apoptosis induced by HCy. The cytotoxic effect of HCy was decreased by small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of Noxa expression, indicating that Noxa up-regulation plays an important role in HCy-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Overexpression of inducible NO synthase increased the formation of S-nitroso-HCy, which was inhibited by the NO synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine. Moreover, S-nitroso-HCy did not increase ROS generation, p53-dependent Noxa expression, and apoptosis. These results suggest that up-regulation of p53-dependent Noxa expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis induced by HCy and that an increase in vascular NO production may prevent HCy-induced endothelial dysfunction by S-nitrosylation. Hyperhomocysteinemia is believed to induce endothelial dysfunction and promote atherosclerosis; however, the pathogenic mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which homocysteine (HCy) causes endothelial cell apoptosis and by which nitric oxide (NO) affects HCy-induced apoptosis. Our data demonstrated that HCy caused caspase-dependent apoptosis in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, as determined by cell viability, nuclear condensation, and caspase-3 activation and activity. These apoptotic characteristics were correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, p53 and Noxa expression, and mitochondrial cytochrome c release following HCy treatment. HCy also induced p53 and Noxa expression and apoptosis in endothelial cells from wild type mice but not in the p53-deficient cells. The NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, adenoviral transfer of inducible NO synthase gene, and antioxidants (α-tocopherol and superoxide dismutase plus catalase) but not oxidized SNAP, 8-Br-cGMP, nitrite, and nitrate, suppressed ROS production, p53-dependent Noxa expression, and apoptosis induced by HCy. The cytotoxic effect of HCy was decreased by small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of Noxa expression, indicating that Noxa up-regulation plays an important role in HCy-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Overexpression of inducible NO synthase increased the formation of S-nitroso-HCy, which was inhibited by the NO synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine. Moreover, S-nitroso-HCy did not increase ROS generation, p53-dependent Noxa expression, and apoptosis. These results suggest that up-regulation of p53-dependent Noxa expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis induced by HCy and that an increase in vascular NO production may prevent HCy-induced endothelial dysfunction by S-nitrosylation.

Once synthesized, HCy may either be metabolized to cysteine by the trans-sulfuration pathway or remethylated to methionine (1Mayer E.L. Jacobsen D.W. Robinson K. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1996; 27: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), Deficiency of the enzyme involved in these pathways (i.e. cystathionine β-synthase or 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) and/or a cofactor (i.e. folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6) required for HCy metabolism leads to elevations in the plasma concentration of HCy and its precursor methionine as well as a reduction in plasma concentrations of cysteine. Hyperhomocystemia is a significant cardiovascular risk factor, the strength of which is almost equal to that of hyperlipidemia (2McCully K.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar).Recent studies of cultured cells in vitro have showed that HCy causes endothelial dysfunction such as apoptotic cell death (3Suhara T.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These adverse vascular effects of HCy are caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a consequence of autoxidation of its sulfhydryl group (6Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Suzuki L.A. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10098-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability via the formation of S-nitroso-HCy (8Stamler J.S. Osborne J.A. Jaraki O. Rabbani L.E. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Furthermore, earlier studies have demonstrated that HCy causes abnormal endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and endothelial cell injury when administered to mice (9Eberhardt R.T. Forgione M.A. Cap A. Leopold J.A. Rudd M.A. Trolliet M. Heydrick S. Stark R. Klings E.S. Moldovan N.I. Yaghoubi M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Farber H.W. Cohen R. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), rats (10Hladovec J. Blood Vessels. 1979; 16: 202-205PubMed Google Scholar), and non-human primates (11Harker L.A. Harlan J.M. Ross R. Circ. Res. 1983; 53: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This suggests that HCy-induced endothelial dysfunction may predispose to atherosclerotic and vascular disease by altering the normally antithrombotic and vasoprotective phenotype of vascular endothelium (12Welch G.N. Loscalzo J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar).NO produced by endothelial NOS has multiple beneficial effects including modulation of platelet aggregation, inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, and control of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (13Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). It is now clear that NO can induce apoptosis in some cells or prevent apoptosis in others. Our previous study has shown that NO produced from NOS or chemical drugs can rescue cells from apoptosis by inactivating caspase-3 via S-nitrosylation (14Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Therefore, a decrease in the bioavailability of NO is associated with an increase in the vascular inflammation and the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, all of which have been shown to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. These evidences indicate that NO is a key molecule in preventing endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis as well as promoting vascular relaxation.Extensive studies have indicated that HCy can cause endothelial dysfunction and vascular lesion formation; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms between hyperhomocystemia and vascular disease are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which HCy causes endothelial cell apoptosis and the protective function of NO against HCy-induced endothelial cell death. We here found that HCy induced endothelial cell apoptosis by cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation via up-regulation of p53 and Noxa. Furthermore, increased NO production by NO donor or iNOS gene transfer ameliorated the endothelial cell injury induced by HCy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless indicated otherwise.Cell Culture—HUVECs were isolated as described previously (16Lee O.H. Lee D.J. Kim Y.M. Kim Y.S. Kwon H.J. Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on a gelatin-coated 75-cm2 flask in M199 with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 5 units/ml heparin at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air. The cells used in this study were between passages 3 and 7. Mouse endothelial cells were isolated from lungs of wild type and p53-deficient mice. In brief, animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and lungs were collected in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Peripheral lung tissue was minced and digested for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.1% collagenase-A (Roche Applied Science). The digest was passed through a blunt 14-gauge needle and filtered through a 130-μm steel mesh. Cells were pelleted at 300 × g and resuspended in murine lung endothelial cell medium (37 °C) containing 20% FBS, 35% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 35% F-12, 50 μg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 100 units/100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and plated in 0.1% gelatin-coated T75 flasks. Cells were washed after 24 h and cultured for 2–4 days. Magnetic beads were coated with anti-mouse CD102 (clone 3C4; Pharmingen) antibody (5 μg/4 × 106 beads; Dyna-beads M-450; Dynal). Per flask, 4 × 106 beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were trypsinized and selected in a magnetic field for 10 min. Cultures were grown to confluence and selected twice before being plated for experiments. Cells used in the experiments were, on average, 10 days in culture.Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was determined by the crystal violet staining method, as described previously (14Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In brief, HUVECs (2 × 105 cells/well) were plated onto 6-well plates in 2 ml of M199 containing 20% fetal bovine serum until cell density was reached to 70–80% confluence. Cells were cultured with serum-free medium for 6 h and switched to 5% fetal bovine serum M199 medium containing HCy. After 16 h, viable cells were stained by a crystal violet staining method. Plates were washed four times with tap water. After drying, cells were lysed with 1% SDS solution, and dye uptake was measured at 550 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Cell viability was calculated from relative dye intensity compared with untreated samples.4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) Staining of Nuclei—Morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin in cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by staining with the DNA-binding fluorochrome, DAPI. HUVECs were grown on glass coverslips and treated with HCy in the presence or absence of SNAP and Z-VAD-fmk for 12 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Following washing with PBS, cells were incubated in a DAPI solution (1 μg/ml) for 30 min in the dark. Cells were then washed with PBS and subjected to fluorescence microscopy.Detection of Cytochrome c Release—Harvested cells were resuspended in ice-cold mitochondrial fractionation buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm aprotinin, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 250 mm sucrose). After homogenization using a Dounce homogenizer, cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (14Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The cytosolic proteins (40 μg) were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed using a cytochrome c antibody to determine mitochondrial cytochrome c release.Caspase Activity Assay—Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (5 mg/ml aprotinin and pepstatin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspension was lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles, and the cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Caspase activities were determined by measuring proteolytic cleavage of chromogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (caspase-3-like activity), Ac-IETD-pNA (caspase-8-like activity), or Ac-LEHD-pNA as described previously (14Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Cells resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture were lysed by three cycles of freeze and thaw, and the cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. Cytosolic proteins (40 μg) were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were hybridized with antibodies against caspase-3, caspase-8, p53, cytochrome c, and iNOS, and the protein bands were visualized by exposure to x-ray film, as described previously (15Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs from HUVECs and their cDNA were prepared by previous methods (17Lee S.J. Bai S.K. Lee K.S. Namkoong S. Na H.J. Ha K.S. Han J.A. Yim S.V. Chang K. Kwon Y.G. Lee S.K. Kim Y.M. Mol. Cells. 2003; 16: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). Three μl of the cDNA mixture was used for PCR in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.01 nm each of primers for p53 and Noxa. The amplification was performed in a DNA thermal cycler under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min for the first cycle and for 30 s starting from the second cycle, annealing of p53 at 62 °C for 30 s, annealing of Noxa at 52 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles. Final extension was performed at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The primers used were 5′-CAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTATGTCGAAAAGTGTTTCTGTCATC-3′ (antisense) for the p53, 5′-CGCGGTACCATGCCTGGGAAGAAGGCGCGC-3′ (sense), and 5′-GCGGAATTCTCAGGTTCCTGAGCAGAAGAG-3′ (antisense) for the Noxa and 5′-CGCCACAGTTTCCCGGAGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCTCCAAAATCAAGTGGGG-3′ (antisense) for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Determination of ROS and Lipid Peroxidation—ROS was determined by DCF fluorescence by use of DCF-DA. HUVECs were treated with HCy for 30 min and incubated with 10 μm H2DCF-DA for another 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS twice, and fluorescence was analyzed using a confocal microscope. Lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances using malondialdehyde (MDA) standards as described previously (18Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22757) Google Scholar).Transfection with siRNA—The target sequence of siRNAs for Noxa is 5′-AACTTCCGGCAGAAACTTCTG-3′. Endothelial cells were transfected with these double-stranded siRNAs (40 nmol/ml) for 12 h by the Lipofectamine method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) and recovered in M199 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum for 30 h. Cells were cultured with serum-free medium for 6 h, followed by treatment with 1 mm HCy in M199 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After 16 h, viable cells were stained by a crystal violet staining method.Determination of NO and S-NOHCy—The level of nitrite, a stable oxidized product of NO, was determined in cell culture medium by Griess reagents (14Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The level of S-NOHCy was measured by Saville's method (19Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, confluent HUVECs were incubated for HCy in the presence or absence of 2 mm NMA for 8 h following transfection with adenoviral iNOS (AdiNOS) for 2 h and recovery for 14 h. After incubation, culture supernatant was reacted for 5 min with an equivalent volume of solution A (1% sulfanilamide dissolved in 0.5 m HCl) in the presence or absence of solution B (solution A plus 0.2% HgCl2), allowing the development of the diazonium salt. The formation of the azo dye product was obtained by reacting the two samples for an additional 5 min with an equal volume of solution C (0.02% of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride dissolved in 0.5 m HCl), and the absorbance was subsequently read at 550 nm with a microplate reader. S-NOHCy was quantified as the difference of absorbance between solution B and A (B - A), comparing the values with a standard curve made from a solution of S-nitrosoglutathione.Data Analysis and Statistics—The data are presented as means ± S.D. from more than three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using the Student's t test.RESULTSHCy Induces Caspase-3-dependent HUVEC Apoptosis— To examine the effect of HCy on endothelial cell survival, HUVECs were cultured with different concentrations of HCy, and cell viability was measured by a crystal violet staining method. HCy decreased HUVEC viability in a dose-dependent manner and appeared to exert maximal effect at a concentration of 1 mm (Fig. 1A). This effect was decreased by the addition of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, the caspase-9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-cho, and the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-cho, but not by the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-cho (Fig. 1B), indicating that activation of caspase-9 and -3 is involved in HCy-induced endothelial cell death. Furthermore, HUVECs undergoing HCy-mediated cell death displayed typical apoptotic features, including chromatin condensation, nuclear pyknosis, and in some cases nuclear fragmentation compared with control (Fig. 1C, arrow). These morphological changes were decreased by co-treatment with Z-VAD-fmk and Ac-DEVD-cho, demonstrating that HCy caused caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in cultured HUVECs.SNAP and Antioxidant Suppress HCy-induced Apoptosis— Endothelial cells produce NO, which has been shown to act as an endogenous apoptotic inhibitor (20Ceneviva G.D. Tzeng E. Hoyt D.G. Yee E. Gallagher A. Engelhardt J.F. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. Watkins S.A. Pitt B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 717-728PubMed Google Scholar), antioxidant (21Kanner J. Harel S. Granit R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and vasodilator (13Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the roles of NO and antioxidants in endothelial cell apoptosis induced by HCy, HUVECs were treated with 1 mm HCy in the presence or absence of the chemical NO donor SNAP, the NOS inhibitor NMA, and antioxidants α-tocopherol and SOD plus catalase, and cell viability was measured. SNAP treatment prevented endothelial cell death caused by HCy, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, NMA slightly increased apoptotic cell death, and the ROS-scavenging systems, such as α-tocopherol and SOD plus catalase, suppressed HCy-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, A and B). It has been demonstrated that NO produces cGMP from GTP by activating heme-containing soluble guanylate cyclase and is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate (22Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of oxidized SNAP (OxiSNAP, which has exhausted all of the NO and does not liberate NO), nitrite, nitrate, and 8-Br-cGMP on HCy-induced HUVEC apoptosis. Treatments with these chemicals did not show any protective effect compared with that of SNAP (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2SNAP and antioxidants protect HUVECs from HCy-induced apoptotic cell death.A and B, cells were treated with HCy in the presence or absence of SNAP, NMA (2 mm), α-tocopherol (100 μm), or SOD plus catalase (CAT) (100 unit of each enzyme/ml). After 16 h, cell viability was measured by a crystal violet staining method and microscopic analysis (×200). C, cells were treated with 1 mm HCy in the presence or absence of SNAP (200 μm), OxiSNAP (200 μm), NO3− (100 μm) plus NO3− (100 μm), or 8-Br-cGMP (200 μm), and cell viability was measured by a crystal violet staining method. Data shown in A and C are the mean ± S.D. (n ≥ 3). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus HCy alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NO Produced by iNOS Gene Transfer Inhibits HCy-induced HUVEC Apoptosis—We have previously shown that iNOS gene transfer prevented endothelial cell apoptosis induced by lipopolysaccharide (20Ceneviva G.D. Tzeng E. Hoyt D.G. Yee E. Gallagher A. Engelhardt J.F. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. Watkins S.A. Pitt B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 717-728PubMed Google Scholar). Since the NOS inhibitor NMA slightly increased HCy-induced endothelial cell apoptosis (Fig. 2), we further examine whether the increased endogenous NO production protects endothelial cells from HCy-induced apoptosis. HUVECs were treated with HCy following transfection with AdiNOS, and cell viability was measured. AdiNOS-transfected cells expressed iNOS protein and significantly increased NO production compared with control (Fig. 3A). When the transfected cells were treated with the specific NOS inhibitor NMA, NO production was significantly inhibited without changing the iNOS protein level. The transfected cells significantly prevented HUVECs from HCy-induced apoptotic cell death compared with control, and this prevention was reversed by the addition of NMA (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3iNOS gene transfer inhibited apoptosis induced by HCy. Cells were incubated with AdiNOS (multiplicity of infection 2) for 2 h, and the medium was changed to fresh medium. After 16 h, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 2 mm NMA. A, cells were harvested, and cell lysates were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Endothelial NOS protein was determined by Western blot analysis. The levels of nitrite were measured in the culture medium by Griess reagents. B, cells transfected with AdiNOS were incubated with 1 mm HCy in the presence or absence of 2 mm NMA. After 16 h, cell viability was measured by a crystal violet staining method. Data shown are the mean ± S.D.

Rosen H. Suzuki L.A. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10098-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in caspase-dependent apoptosis (23Bessede G. Miguet C. Gambert P. Neel D. Lizard G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1927-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of NO and antioxidants on HCy-mediated intracellular ROS accumulation by measuring the amount of fluorescent DCF produced from the oxidative reaction of DCF-DA with H2O2. HUVECs treated with HCy resulted in a significant increase in intracellular ROS accumulation compared with control cells, and this increase was further enhanced in the presence of NMA and reduced by co-treatment with SNAP and SOD plus catalase (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, AdiNOS transfection significantly reduced the HCy-mediated increase in intracellular ROS accumulation, which was reversed by the addition of NMA (Fig. 4, A and C). Since ROS is responsible for the production of MDA, as an index of oxidative damage, via oxidative lipid peroxidation (6Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Suzuki L.A. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10098-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effects of NO and antioxidants on HCy-induced MDA production. Treatment of HUVECs with HCy increased the production of MDA, which was inhibited by treatment with SNAP and SOD plus catalase but partially augmented by NMA (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, AdiNOS-transfected cells suppressed HCy-induced lipid peroxidation, and this suppression was reduced by the addition of NMA. These results indicate that NO is able to suppress HCy-induced ROS generation and oxidative injury in cultured HUVECs.Fig. 4NO and antioxidants inhibited ROS production and lipid peroxidation in HUVECs incubated with HCy.A, HUVECs were preincubated with or without NMA (2 mm), SNAP (200 μm), and SOD plus catalase (CAT) (100 units of each enzyme/ml) for 30 min or transfected with AdiNOS (multiplicity of infection 2) for 2 h and recovered in fresh medium for 12 h.

Although several candidate genes essential for this radial migration have been reported, the signaling pathways regulating it are largely unclear. Here we studied the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream signaling molecules in the radial migration of cortical neurons in vivo and in vitro. The expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative PI 3-kinases markedly inhibited radial migration. In the neocortical slice culture, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor suppressed the formation of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 and radial migration. Constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 but not Akt also significantly inhibited radial migration. In migrating neurons, wild-type Rac1 and Cdc42 showed different localizations; Rac1 localized to the plasma membrane and Cdc42 to the perinuclear region on the side of the leading processes. These results suggest that both the PI 3-kinase/Rac1 and Cdc42 pathways are involved in the radial migration of cortical neurons and that they have different roles.

During mammalian cortical development, neurons born in the cortical ventricular zone migrate radially, resulting in the inside-out formation of the cortical plate, which is composed of six layers. Although the molecular bases of radial migration are largely unknown, extracellular ligands and intracellular cytoskeletal and signaling components have been shown to be involved. Reelin, a large extracellular molecule secreted from Cajal-Retzius cells, is involved in the radial migration of cortical neurons and formation of the cortical plate (1Rice D.S. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1005-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Recent studies (2Gleeson J.G. Walsh C.A.

LIS1 and doublecortin and their associated proteins, including Nude and Nudel, co-localize with microtubules and/or centrosome in various types of cells, including neurons, and control their dynamics, suggesting they play key roles in radial migration through nucleokinesis (4Morris N.R. Efimov V.P. Xiang X. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Analyses of mutant mice have demonstrated roles for Cdk5 and its neuron-specific activator, p35, in radial migration (2Gleeson J.G. Walsh C.A.

Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cdk5 phosphorylates doublecortin and/or focal adhesion kinase, altering their abilities to control microtubule dynamics (5Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 6Tanaka T. Serneo F.F. Tseng H.C. Kulkarni A.B. Tsai L.H. Gleeson J.G.

In addition, p35 binds directly to Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner, and the Cdk5-p35 complex causes phosphorylation of Pak1, a downstream effector of Rac and Cdc42, in a Rac-dependent manner, resulting in the down-regulation of Pak1 kinase activity (7Nikolic M.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3471-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Several downstream signaling molecules of PI 3-kinase have been reported. In many kinds of cells, PI 3-kinase regulates cell polarization and migration via Rac, Cdc42, and/or Akt (protein kinase B). Rac1 and STEF/Tiam1, a Racspecific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, are involved in the radial migration of cortical neurons (10Kawauchi T. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4190-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the precise function of the PI 3-kinase/Rac1 and/or Cdc42 pathways in neuronal migration has not been reported.Here we demonstrate the involvement of the PI 3-kinase/Rac1 and Cdc42 pathways in the radial migration of cortical neurons in vivo and in vitro. The excess activation and the inactivation of PI 3-kinase, Rac1, and Cdc42, but not Akt (protein kinase B), markedly inhibited radial migration. Consistent with this, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor suppressed radial migration and reduced the formation of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 in neocortical slice culture. We further demonstrate the differential localization of Rac1 and Cdc42 in migrating neurons. These results suggest different roles for the PI 3-kinase/Rac1 and Cdc42 pathways in the radial migration of cortical neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—We used pCAGGS, a mammalian expression vector driven by chicken β-actin promoter, as described previously (11Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). To construct the expression vectors, the insert cDNAs were prepared from expression vectors for EGFP (pEGFPN1; Invitrogen), iSH2-p110α (gift from Dr. T. Katada), Δp85 (gift from Dr. I. Matsumura), Akt1-K179A (12Ohkawa Y. Hayashi K. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), Akt2-K181A, and Akt3-K177A (described below), and wild-type or mutant Rac1 and Cdc42 containing the Myc tag (gift from Dr. S. Narumiya) by PCR or enzymatic digestion. The Akt2 and Akt3 cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with human placenta mRNA and subcloned into the pCS vector. Point mutations changing lysine to alanine in Akt2 and Akt3 (Akt2-K181A and Akt3-K177A, respectively) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The insert cDNAs were blunted and cloned into pCAGGS. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.In Utero Electroporation—In utero electroporation was performed on ICR mice at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) as described previously (13Tabata H. Nakajima K. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ICR mice were provided by Japan SLC. In brief, expression vectors encoding GFP (0.2 μg/μl) and mutant proteins (described below) were co-injected into the lateral ventricle of the embryonic brain and co-electroporated with an Electro Square Porater BTX 830 (BTX). In all experiments except those using Δp85 and mutant forms of Akt, the expression vectors were used at a concentration of 0.2 μg/μl. The expression vectors encoding Δp85, Akt1-K179A, Akt2-K181, and Akt3-K177A were used at a concentration of 1.0 μg/μl. The brains were analyzed at 3 or 6 days after electroporation (E18.5 and P2, respectively).Immunohistochemistry—The dissected mouse brains were fixed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose for 4 h at 4 °C. After fixation, the brains were cryoprotected with 25% sucrose in 0.1 m PB and embedded in OCT compound. Frontal sections (10-μm thick) were prepared from the anterior half of the cerebral cortex. The following procedures were carried out at room temperature. The sections were pretreated with blocking solution A (5% normal goat serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaN3, 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline) or B (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaN3, 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies for 16 h. A mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody (1:2000, clone HM-2, Sigma) was preincubated with the Alexa Fluor 546 secondary antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes) in blocking solution A. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc (1:200) and anti-p85 (1:200) and goat polyclonal anti-p110α (1:100) and anti-Akt (1:200) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as primary antibodies. These antibodies from rabbit and goat were diluted with blocking solutions A and B, respectively. All primary antibodies were detected with AlexaFluor 546 secondary antibodies. Fluorescence images were obtained using a Pascal 5 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) and then processed with Adobe Photoshop software. We acquired stacked images from 30 optical slices at 0.36-μm intervals, as shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 4Differential distribution of Rac1 and Cdc42 in migrating neurons. The subcellular distribution of Rac1 and Cdc42 in migrating neurons. Expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged versions of wild-type Rac1 (pCAGGS-WT-Rac1) or Cdc42 (pCAGGS-WT-Cdc42) and GFP (pCAGGS-EGFP) were co-transfected into the neocortical VZ using in utero electroporation at E15.5, and coronal sections were analyzed at E18.5. Immunostaining against the Myc tag was performed to analyze the localization of Rac1 and Cdc42 in migrating neurons. Stacked images were constructed from 30 optical slices at 0.36-μm intervals (1st and 3rd panels), and higher magnification images located at the middle part of the stacked images (the boxed regions) are shown in the 2nd and 4th panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantitative Analysis of Neuronal Migration—We subdivided the cerebral cortex into 5 regions (CP1, CP2, CP3, IZ, and VZ), counted the number of GFP-positive cells, and calculated the ratios of the GFP-positive cells to the total GFP-positive cells in the indicated regions as percentages with Excel software.

J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 454: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, VZ cells were transfected with a GFP expression vector by in utero electroporation at E14.5, and 300-μm-thick coronal slices were prepared from the dorsolateral part of the anterior half of the cerebral cortex at E16.0. Slices were placed on tissue culture membranes (Transwell-COL; Corning Glass) and cultured in growth medium (DMEM/F-12 containing N2 supplement and 10% fetal calf serum). After 2 h, 25, 50, or 200 μm LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, or 0.5% Me2SO was added to the medium. To investigate the resumption of neuronal migration, slices were replaced in the new medium without LY294002 at 48 h and then observed at 72 h. GFP fluorescence and bright phase images were obtained using a Pascal 5 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) at 2, 24, 48, and 72 h of culture. We analyzed the effect of LY294002 on the radial migration of GFP-positive cells from the IZ. To determine the viability of cells, the nonviable cells were labeled with propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) after 48 h with or without LY294002 treatment.GST-PAK Pull-down Assay—The Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were measured by pull-down assay by using GST-PAK-CRIB, which is a fusion protein of GST and the Cdc42/Rac-binding domain of PAK (15Paik J.H. Chae S. Lee M.J. Thangada S. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This method is used to measure the amount of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42, because PAK only binds the GTP form of Rac1 and Cdc42. The prokaryotic GST-PAK-CRIB expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. S. Narumiya. The dorsal part of the cerebral cortex was taken from E16.0 ICR mouse brains, and cortical slices were prepared. These slices were cultured for 16 h with mild agitation in culture medium (Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mm glutamine) containing LY294002 (25 μm or 50 μm) or Me2SO (0.5%). Cultured slices were extracted with lysis buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). The extracts were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with purified GST-PAK-CRIB produced by Escherichia coli that was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). After the GST-PAK-CRIB-glutathione-Sepharose 4B was washed three times, the amounts of Rac1, Cdc42, and Akt1 were analyzed by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling), and goat polyclonal anti-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. We measured the intensities of corresponding bands by NIH Image J and further processed the data by using Excel and Cricket Graf software. Each value of quantitative data represents the average ± S.D. from three independent experiments.RESULTSTo investigate the role of PI 3-kinase and its downstream signaling molecules in the radial migration of cortical neurons, we performed in utero electroporation to introduce expression vectors encoding GFP with or without signaling molecules into neuronal progenitor cells at the cortical VZ of embryonic brains at E15.5, and we then analyzed the radial migration of the labeled neurons in the cerebral cortex. When GFP expression vector (0.2 μg/μl) alone was introduced, many GFP-positive cells migrated to both the IZ and the lower region of the CP at E18.5 (Fig. 1A, upper panels). More than 80% of the total GFP-positive cells had reached the upper region of the CP, corresponding to layers II/III, on postnatal day 2 (P2) (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Fewer than 10% of the labeled cells remained within the IZ and the lower regions of the CP (Fig. 1, A and D). These migration patterns were not altered when the amount of GFP expression vector was varied (data not shown). Thus, exogenous GFP was useful for monitoring neuronal migration and did not itself interfere with the migration.

Immunoblotting showed that the p110α and β subunits were intensely expressed throughout cortical development (data not shown). Thus, the major isoforms of PI 3-kinase expressed during cortical development are of class IA. We then examined the effect of class IA PI 3-kinases on the radial migration of cortical neurons by using constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of them in vivo (Fig. 1, B and C). Double immunolabeling for GFP and the mutant PI 3-kinases showed that GFP and the PI 3-kinase variants were co-expressed in almost all the transfected cells examined (Fig. 1, B and C). Therefore, GFP was used to identify the neurons expressing mutated PI 3-kinase. When a constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase, iSH2-p110α (iSH2-PI3K), and GFP were co-expressed, the radial migration was markedly suppressed. Fifty percent of the co-expressed cells were found in the IZ (Fig. 1, B and D). About 10% of the co-expressed cells remained within the VZ, which was similar to when the cells expressed GFP alone. The expression of a dominant-negative form of class IA PI 3-kinase, Δp85, also suppressed the radial migration. The labeled cells were diffusely distributed from the VZ/SVZ and the IZ to the CP (Fig. 1, C and D). By using neocortical slice culture, we further examined the effect of a PI 3-kinase inhibitor on the radial migration. In control slices, most of the GFP-positive cells remained within the IZ after 2 h in culture and had migrated to the CP after 24 h. Many GFP-positive cells migrated further, into the CP toward the pial surface, after 48 h (Fig. 1E, upper panels). When treated with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (25 μm LY294002), the radial migration of the GFP-positive cells was slightly retarded after 24 h and further inhibited after 48 h (Fig. 1E, lower panels). A similar effect was observed using 50 μm LY294002 (data not shown). At the concentrations of LY294002 used here (25 and 50 μm), almost all of the GFP-positive cells were propidium iodide-negative, indicating that they are viable. Treatment with excess amounts of LY294002 (200 μm) markedly increased in PI-positive nonviable cells, in association with a dramatic decrease in the GFP-positive cells (Fig. 1E). Thus, LY294002 (25–50 μm) inhibited neuronal migration but did not affect the cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that PI 3-kinase is required for the radial migration of cortical neurons.It has been well documented that PI 3-kinase regulates cellular events, including cell migration, through its downstream signaling molecules, which include Akt, Rac1, and Cdc42. Because immunoblotting showed the expression of Akt, Rac1, and Cdc42 throughout cortical development (data not shown), we investigated their roles in the radial migration of cortical neurons. We performed GST-PAK pull-down assays to examine the effect of LY294002 on the Akt, Rac1, and Cdc42 activities. When neocortical slices were treated with LY294002 (25 or 50 μm), the amounts of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 and phosphorylated Akt decreased in a LY294002 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). These results suggested that Akt, Rac1, and Cdc42 act as possible downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase signaling during cortical development.Of these three molecules, we first examined the involvement of Akt on the radial migration. When dominant-negative Akt1 (Akt1-K179A) and GFP were co-expressed, the radial migration of GFP-positive cells was not affected. More than 70% of the cells migrated normally (Fig. 2, B and C). Similarly, dominant-negative Akt2 (Akt2-K181A) and Akt3 (Akt3-K177A) had no effect on the radial migration (data not shown). These results indicated that a major downstream target of PI 3-kinase, Akt, is not involved in the radial migration of cortical neurons.We next analyzed the roles of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the radial migration. When constitutively active Rac1 (V12Rac1) and GFP were co-expressed, the radial migration of GFP-positive cells was significantly suppressed, similar to the suppression seen in cells co-expressing the mutant PI 3-kinases. The GFP-positive cells co-expressing V12Rac1 showed a loss of leading processes. The radial migration of cells co-expressing dominant-negative Rac1 (N17Rac1) and GFP was also markedly retarded (Fig. 3, A and E). More than 40% of the GFP-positive cells remained within the IZ (Fig. 3, B and E). When constitutively active Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) and GFP were co-expressed, more than 60% of the GFP-positive cells migrated normally (Fig. 3, C and E). Only 12.6 ± 2.7% (mean ± S.E., n = 5) of the transfected cells remained in the VZ/SVZ and in the IZ, where they formed cell clusters. When dominant-negative Cdc42 (N17Cdc42) and GFP were co-expressed, the radial migration was inhibited; this effect was similar to, although not as strong as, that seen with N17Rac1 (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that Rac1 and Cdc42 are downstream molecules of PI 3-kinase with different roles in the radial migration of cortical neurons.To investigate the different roles of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the radial migration, we compared the localization of wild-type Rac1 (WT-Rac1) and Cdc42 (WT-Cdc42) in radially migrating neurons in vivo (Fig. 4). The WT-Rac1 was specifically targeted to the plasma membrane of migrating neurons (Fig. 4, left panels). WT-Cdc42 was mainly localized to the perinuclear region on the side of the leading processes (Fig. 4, right panels). These results suggest that Rac1 and Cdc42 are differentially involved in the radial migration of cortical neurons, with roles in the regulation of leading process formation and cell polarity, respectively.DISCUSSIONPostmitotic neurons generated in the VZ migrate into and form the CP via the following steps: release from the VZ, migration guided by radial glia, and positioning in the appropriate layers (2Gleeson J.G. Walsh C.A. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 352-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 3Gupta A. Tsai L.H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). As demonstrated here, mutant PI 3-kinase, Rac1, and Cdc42, but not Akt, inhibited the radial migration of cortical neurons. The PI 3-kinase mutants and/or GFP-transfected cells remaining within the VZ were only a minor population, suggesting that the PI 3-kinase pathways link to the radial glia-guided migration but not to release from the VZ. What might act upstream of PI 3-kinase? It has been well documented that integrin signaling through PI 3-kinase activation is involved in cell migration, invasion, and spreading (16Mercurio A.M.

The integrin family of cell-surface receptors is reported to function in the radial glia-guided neuronal migration through neuron-glia interactions (17Fishman R.B. Hatten M.E. J.

Laminin is transiently expressed on the cell surface of radial glial fibers during central nervous system development (19Liesi P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and inhibition of β1 integrins with their blocking antibodies induces the detachment of migrating neurons from radial glial fibers (17Fishman R.B.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, neuronal integrins interacting with their ligands, such as laminin distributed along radial glial fibers, may act as an upstream activator of PI 3-kinase in the radial migration.PI 3-kinase is reported to have a role in chemotaxis. For example, PI 3-kinase and its product PI(3,4,5)P3 are involved in the chemotaxis of Dictyostelium and neutrophils (20Wang F. Herzmark P. Weiner O.D. Srinivasan S. Servant G. Bourne H.R. Nat.

In these cells, PI(3,4,5)P3 is produced by the stimulation of chemoattractants and accumulates at the leading edge of the cells. Dictyostelium lacking PTEN, a PI 3-phosphatase, displays a broad irregular leading edge, with slow movement. These observations suggest that the local accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 at the proper regions is critical for chemotaxis in these cells. We demonstrated that both excess activation and inactivation of PI 3-kinase markedly suppressed the radial migration of cortical neurons in vivo. When cortical slices were treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002, 25–50 μm), neuronal migration was also suppressed without cytotoxicity. We further investigated the reversibility of neuronal migration inhibited by LY294002. Neuronal migration was, however,"

Both LD motifs and LIM domains can serve as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Recently, we found that enforced expression of ARA55 inhibits transforming growth factor-β-mediated up-regulation of Smad binding element-luciferase reporter activity in NRP-154 and NRP-152 rat prostate and LNCaP human prostate cell lines. Moreover, ARA55 also inhibits the induction of Smad-binding element 4-luciferase and 3TP-luciferase (a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter construct) reporters by constitutively active (CA)-Smad3 in these cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest an interaction between ARA55 and either CA-Smad3 or wild-type Smad3 in HEK293 cells that occurs through the MH2 domain of Smad3 and the C terminus of ARA55 with wild-type Smad3 having stronger affinity than CA-Smad3 to ARA55. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrate that this interaction can occur in a cell-free system. These results are consistent with the luciferase data showing that the C terminus of ARA55 is critical for suppression of Smad3 activity. Furthermore, using a mammalian two-hybrid system, we confirmed that ARA55 interacts with the MH2 domain of Smad3 and suppresses CA-Smad3-induced transcriptional responses.

A constitutively active kinase domain of TβRII then phosphorylates the glycine-serine domain of TβRI, promoting the activation of the latter receptor (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). With the help of the Smad anchor for receptor activation protein, Smad2 and possibly Smad3 are recruited to TGF-β receptor complex (9Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

In this state, these receptor-activated Smads can homodimerize, associate with the co-Smad, Smad4, and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to SBE (11Wrana J.L. Attisano L.

Another Smad that associates with TβRI is Smad7; however, this homologous protein instead functions as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 to promote proteasomal degradation of TβRI (15Nakao A.

In the mature prostate, the expression and activation of TGF-β and Smads 2 and 3 are suppressed by physiological levels of androgens (17Kyprianou N. Isaacs J.T. Mol.

Upon malignant transformation, prostate epithelial cells acquire resistance to TGF-β-induced apoptosis and growth arrest, events correlating with the down-regulation of TGF-β receptor levels and loss of androgen dependence (28Guo Y.

Without trophic support of androgenic steroids, the prostate undergoes severe atrophy (49Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1996; 192: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The binding of androgen to AR causes this receptor to homodimerize, which promotes its nuclear entry and subsequent transactivation function. Previous work from our laboratory showed that ligand-bound AR blocks TGF-β signals in the prostatic carcinoma cell lines, NRP-154 and LNCaP, through the direct association of Smad3 to the ligand-binding domain of AR (31Chipuk J.E. Cornelius S.C. Pultz N.J. Jorgensen J.S. Bonham M.J. Kim S.J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1240-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, this interaction appears to be cell line-specific because AR does not block Smad3 signals in the NRP-152 rat non-tumorigenic cell line. 2H. Wang, K. Song, T. L. Sponseller, and D. Danielpour, unpublished data.2H. Wang, K. Song, T. L. Sponseller, and D. Danielpour, unpublished data. These data led us to hypothesize that AR co-regulators may play a role in such differential inhibition. We thereby explored whether the AR-associated protein ARA55, also called Hic-5 (hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5), could play such a role by controlling suppression of TGF-β signals by AR. ARA55 was originally identified as a TGF-β or hydrogen peroxide-induced protein in mouse osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells in which its overexpression promotes cellular senescence (50Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a member of the LIM protein superfamily, ARA55 is featured by four conserved zinc finger-like LIM domains in its C terminus (Fig. 1A) and high homology to the well defined focal adhesion adaptor/scaffold protein paxillin (51Thomas S.M. Hagel M. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 181-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of ARA55 has another conserved region named LD motif (LDXLLXXL). To date, two ARA55 isoforms have been identified that differ by an extra LD motif in the longer isoform (52Mashimo J. Shibanuma M. Satoh H. Chida K. Nose K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Initial studies on ARA55 focused on its negative roles in integrin-mediated signaling. Two focal adhesion-related kinases, FAK (53Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and PYK2 (54Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), have been identified as ARA55 LD motif-binding proteins. ARA55 can compete with paxillin to interact with FAK in NIH 3T3 cells, leading to reduced cell spreading on fibronectin (55Nishiya N. Tachibana K. Shibanuma M. Mashimo J.I. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5332-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, ARA55 may moderate proliferation signals transduced from focal adhesions to the nucleus in normal cells. As such, the loss of this LIM domain protein, as seen in carcinomas, may be permissive to certain malignancies (56Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Subsequent efforts revealed that ARA55 can associate with such steroid hormone receptors as AR, glucocorticoid receptor, or progesterone receptor through its C terminus and enhance their transactivation in a steroid hormone-dependent manner (57Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), probably facilitating cell proliferation. These two discrepant functions of ARA55, promoting either cell senescence or cell growth, may be explained by the finding that the phosphorylation of ARA55 at tyrosine 43 by PYK2 can cause ARA55 to selectively lose its activity for AR transactivation (58Wang X. Yang Y. Guo X. Sampson E.R. Hsu C.L. Tsai M.Y. Yeh S. Wu G. Guo Y. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15426-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and possibly for transactivation by other steroid hormone receptors (57Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential functions of ARA55 may be determined by its phosphorylation state. In this case, PYK2 may be more involved in regulating the activity of ARA55 than that of FAK as recent work suggests that ARA55 is not phosphorylated by FAK (53Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that Smad3 is another important target of ARA55 in which this LIM protein effectively inhibits gene transcription by Smad3 or TGF-β. Experimental support is provided such that transcriptional suppression occurs through a direct interaction of the LIM domains of ARA55 with the MH2 domain of Smad3. Although the full physiological implications of this interaction are yet to be revealed, it is likely that ARA55, which is induced by TGF-β in certain cells types, may function in a negative feedback loop to control TGF-β responses. Plasmids—cDNA fragment of ARA55 (the short isoform) and its truncations were amplified by PCR with ThermalAce™ DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using a human prostatic cDNA library (pLIB-prostate, Clontech) as the template and primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) listed in Table I. The resulting PCR products were inserted into FLAG or Myc (5′) tagged pcDNA3 vector (31Chipuk J.E. Cornelius S.C. Pultz N.J. Jorgensen J.S. Bonham M.J. Kim S.J. Danielpour D. J. Biol.

WT-Smad3 and its truncations were also amplified by PCR (High Fidelity PCR Kit™, Roche Applied Science) from pLIB-prostate library with the primers in Table II, and resulting PCR products were inserted into pcDNA3-FLAG vector. CA-Smad3 was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of serines to aspartic acids in its C-terminal SSXS phosphorylation motif (31Chipuk J.E. Cornelius S.C. Pultz N.J. Jorgensen J.S. Bonham M.J.

Total RNA (3.0 μg) was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) using the oligo(dT) primer. Two μl of the resulting RT product was used as template to amplify a 1-kb fragment of rat ARA55 with PCR Master Mix™ kit (Promega). The primer pair for PCR reaction was as follows: sense primer, 5′-GAC AAG CTT ATA ACC ACT GTC CCT TCC AGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GAG GAT CCC AGC CAA AGA GCT TCA GGA AGC-3′.

After centrifugation (10 min, 14,000 × g), the cleared lysate was mixed with purified GST-Smad3 or GST in cold RIPA buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was then centrifuged (5 min, 3000 rpm) and washed three times with cold RIPA buffer. The GST-Smad3-ARA55 complex was eluted with 50 μl of 1× SDS/2-mercaptoethanol loading buffer at 70 °C for 10 min. Eluted proteins were resolved with 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 micropores, Millipore), and then immunoblotted using the rabbit polyclonal antibody A-14 against Myc (1:1000, catalog number sc-789, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western Blot—HEK293 cells were plated overnight in 10% FBS-DMEM/F-12 in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/2 ml/well.

All of the secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. The Relative mRNA Level of ARA55 in NRP-154 and NRP-152 Cell Lines—Previously, we found that ligand-bound AR can repress SBE4BV-luciferase reporter activity induced by CA-Smad3 (31Chipuk J.E.

This occurred in NRP-154 and LNCaP cells but not in NRP-152 cells. We hypothesized that AR-associated proteins may be involved in reversing the repressive effect of ligand-bound AR on Smad3-mediated gene expression. Recent reports have shown (62Miyoshi Y.

https://openalex.org/W1993939968,"Upon a certain DNA damage including cisplatin treatment, p73 is stabilized and exerts its growth-suppressive and/or proapoptotic function. However, the precise molecular basis by which the intracellular levels of p73 are regulated remains unclear. In the present study, we have identified RanBPM as a novel binding partner of p73α by yeast-based two-hybrid screening, and also found that RanBPM has an ability to stabilize p73α. GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that RanBPM directly bound to the extreme COOH-terminal region of p73α, whereas it failed to interact with p53. Co-expression of RanBPM with p73α resulted in the nuclear translocation of RanBPM, and both proteins co-localized in cell nucleus as examined by indirect immunofluorescent staining. It is worth noting that the expression of RanBPM inhibited the ubiquitination of p73α, and thereby prolonged its half-life. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the proapoptotic activity of p73α was significantly enhanced in the presence of RanBPM. Taken together, our present findings implicate a novel role for RanBPM in the regulation of p73 stability and function."

The dpkA gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product was characterized.

J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). They catalyze NAD(P)-dependent interconversions between lactate and pyruvate and between malate and oxaloacetate, respectively. However, a new class of NAD(P)-dependent malate/l-lactate dehydrogenases with no sequence homology to “orthodox” MDH or LDH has been demonstrated (2Honka E. Fabry S. Niermann T. Palm P. Hensel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Jendrossek D. Kratzin H.D. Steinbuchel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, they have no Rossmann fold, which is a six-stranded parallel β-sheet core surrounded on both sides by helices (4Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), in their NAD(P)-binding domains in contrast to the orthodox proteins. Consequently, the new class of malate/l-lactate dehydrogenase family has been distinguished from the orthodox one as shown in protein data bases such as InterPro (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/index.html) (5Mulder N.J.

However, many of the family members are annotated without functional evidence as MDH or LDH only because of their sequence similarities to those of a few enzymes such as MDH from Methanothermus fervidus (2Honka E. Fabry S. Niermann T. Palm P. Hensel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and LDH from Alcaligenes eutrophus (3Jendrossek D. Kratzin H.D. Steinbuchel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In fact, three hypothetical MDHs of this family have been shown to be (S)-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (7Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3688-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase (8Cusa E. Obradors N. Baldoma L. Badia J. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7479-7484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate reductase (9Yew W.S. Gerlt J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The NAD(P) dependence is common to them, but no other functional similarities can be assigned among them. Thus, we expect the occurrence of various other proteins with new functions in this family even though they are annotated as MDH (or LDH) in protein data bases. Pseudomonas strains use both enantiomers of lysine as a sole source of carbon (as well as nitrogen) (10Chang Y.F. Adams E. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fothergill J.C. Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 99: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). l-Lysine is catabolized by Pseudomonas putida through the δ-aminovalerate pathway (11Fothergill J.C. Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 99: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas d-lysine is catabolized through the pipecolate pathway involving a series of reactions through six-carbon cyclic intermediates (12Chang Y.F. Adams E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Miller D.L. Rodwell V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2758-2764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Δ1-Piperideine-2-carboxylate (Pip2C) is reduced to l-pipecolate by Pip2C reductase (EC 1.5.1.21), which has been purified and characterized by Payton and Chang (14Payton C.W. Chang Y.F. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 864-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of Pip2C is also catalyzed by Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate (Pyr2C) reductase (EC 1.5.1.1), which inherently acts on Pyr2C, a five-membered ring homolog of Pip2C, to form l-proline in mammals, plants, and microorganisms (15Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 878-882Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 16Meister A. Radhakrishnan A.N. Buckeley S.D. J. Biol.

Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 78-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether such a dual function of Pyr2C reductase is caused by fortuitously broad specificity of the enzyme or of physiological significance. We searched for a new enzyme catalyzing the formation of N-methyl-l-phenylalanine from phenylpyruvate and methylamine and found that the enzyme gene is identical to the gene annotated as MDH of the new family of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases described above (19Muramatsu H. Mihara H. Kakutani R. Yasuda M. Ueda M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Tetrahedron. 2004; 15: 2841-2843Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the gene product showed no MDH activity. We have been skeptical about whether N-methyl-l-amino acids are the physiological substrates of the enzyme and carried out gene disruption experiments to clarify this point. Thus, as described here, we have found that the enzyme gene is actually responsible for the catabolism of both d-lysine and d-proline and that the gene product has both Pip2C reductase and Pyr2C reductase activities, which are much higher than the N-methyl-l-amino acid dehydrogenase activity. In addition, multiple sequence alignment analysis has revealed that the enzyme is the first member of a novel subclass in an NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase superfamily. Materials—d-Amino acid oxidase from porcine kidney was purchased from Sigma. Pip2C and Pyr2C were synthesized as described previously (16Meister A. Radhakrishnan A.N. Buckeley S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superose 12 and molecular weight marker proteins were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. DEAE-Toyopearl was from Tosoh (Tokyo, Japan). Green-Sepharose was prepared according to a previous method (20Ohshima T. Yamasaki T. Seikagaku. 1990; 62: 283-287PubMed Google Scholar). NADH, NADPH, and molecular-weight marker proteins for gel filtration were from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). Restriction enzymes and kits for genetic manipulation were from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). A plasmid, pK18mobsacB, was obtained from the Department of Microbial Genetics, National Institute of Genetics (Japan). All other reagents were of analytical grade from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). DpkA was purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) carrying pDPKA as described previously (19Muramatsu H. Mihara H. Kakutani R. Yasuda M. Ueda M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Tetrahedron. 2004; 15: 2841-2843Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic Analysis—Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were obtained from PubMed at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). A homology search was performed with the BLAST program (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) at GenomeNet (www.genome.ad.jp/). Multiple alignments were obtained with the ClustalW program (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) at DDBJ (spiral.genes.nig.ac.jp/homology/). Phylogenetic trees were computed with ClustalW by the neighbor joining method with Kimura's correction (bootstrap scores for 1000 iterations). Trees were displayed using a TreeView program (23Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted Gene Disruption—A P. putida mutant was obtained by disruption of the dpkA gene with the pK18mobsacB plasmid (24Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene. 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Two gene fragments, DPK1 (0.53 kbp) and DPK2 (0.54 kbp), corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-halves of the dpkA gene were amplified from P. putida ATCC12633 DNA by PCR with primer sets, dpk-f/dpkConA and dpk-r1/dpkConB, respectively (see below). A tetracycline-resistant gene fragment (TcR, 1.35 kbp) was obtained by PCR with a primer set TcBRConA/TcConB and pBR322 as a template. The DPK1, DPK2, and TcR fragments were connected by crossover PCR (25Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar, 26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) to yield a 2.4-kbp fragment (DPK1-TcR-DPK2). The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of pK18mobsacB to form pK18dpkTc. The resulting plasmid thus contained an insertional disruption of dpkA. pK18dpkTc was introduced into E. coli S17–1 (27Simon R. Priefer U. Pu ̈hler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-794Crossref Scopus (5562) Google Scholar) and then into P. putida ATCC12633 by filter mating (28Kwong S.M. Yeo C.C. Suwanto A. Poh C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with selection on an LB medium. Resulting transconjugants were selected for the integration of the tetracycline marker in the chromosome on LB agar containing 50 μg/ml tetracycline and 10% sucrose. The mutant was analyzed by PCR with the dpk-f/dpk-r1 primers to confirm the presence of its disrupted copy of dpkA gene. The primers used are dpk-f, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTCCGCACCTTCCACCAGCACCG-3′; dpkConA, 5′-CCCATCCACTAAACTTAAACAGAAAGCGATGGGGTTGGTAC-3′; dpk-r1, 5′-GGGAAGCTTTCAGCCAAGCAGCTCTTTCAGG-3′; dpk-ConB, 5′-GGGCAGGGTCGTTAAATAGCGCTGCGCCTTGCGCCGAGCAT-3′; TcBRConA, TGTTTAAGTTTAGTGGATGGGTGACAGCTTATCATCGATAA-3′; and TcConB, 5′-GCTATTTAACGACCCTGCCCTTCTTGGAGTGGTGAATCCG-3′. Enzyme Assays—The Pip2C/Pyr2C reductase activity of the enzyme was examined in a coupled reaction system containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm d-proline or dl-pipecolate, 18 μm d-amino acid oxidase, 10 mm NADPH, and 7.4 μm of the enzyme at 30 °C for 10 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid (2%), and the supernatant solution obtained after centrifugation was subjected to HPLC analysis: column, CHIRALPAK WE (Daicel, Tokyo, Japan); mobile phase, 2 mm CuSO4; flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; detection, 254 nm; temperature, 50 °C. Alternatively, Pip2C/Pyr2C reductase was assayed with a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm because of the consumption of NADPH at 30 °C in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 0.062 mm Pip2C (or Pyr2C), 0.15 mm NADPH, and 100 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 for Pip2C or pH 7.0 for Pyr2C. The reverse reaction was followed in the same manner except that 20 mm l-pipecolate (or l-proline), 0.25 mm NADP+, and 100 mm Bis-tris propane (pH 10.0) were substituted for the corresponding components. Kinetic Analysis—Initial rates of the enzyme reaction were measured with varying concentrations of one substrate and a fixed concentration of the other substrate. Substrate concentration ranges causing substrate inhibition were judged by application of the data to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten equation with the Kaleida Graph software (Adelbeck Software, Reading, PA) or the IGOR Pro software (Wave-Metrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Data obtained in the range without substrate inhibition were fitted to equation 1, which conforms to a sequential mechanism. Ka and Kb represent the Michaelis constants for NADPH (A) and Pip2C (or Pyr2C) (B), respectively. Kia is the dissociation constant for the enzyme-NADPH complex. Product inhibition studies were performed in the presence of various concentrations of NADP+, and the data were fitted to equations 2, 3, 4 corresponding to competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive inhibition patterns, respectively. P is the concentration of the product; Kis is the inhibition constant from the slope term; and Kii is the inhibition constant from the intercept term. The apparent substrate inhibition constant (Ki) for Pyr2C was determined by fitting the data to equation 5. ν=VAB/(KiaKb+KbA+KaB+AB)(Eq. 1) ν=VA/(Ka(1+P/Kis)+A)(Eq. 2) ν=VA/(Ka+A(1+P/Kii))(Eq. 3) ν=VA/(Ka(1+P/Kis)+A(1+P/Kii))(Eq. 4) ν=VA/(Kb+A+A2/Ki)(Eq. 5) Western Blotting—A polyclonal antibody against DpkA was generated in a rabbit. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). DpkA was detected with the anti-DpkA antibody and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Other Analytical Methods—Protein quaternary structure was analyzed by an AKTAexplorer system (Amersham Biosciences) using a YMC-Pack Diol 200 column (YMC Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The column was equilibrated and operated at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 m NaCl. The protein standards used were cytochrome c, myokinase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glutamate dehydrogenase from Oriental Yeast, Osaka, Japan. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined with an automated Shimadzu PPSQ10 protein sequencer (Kyoto, Japan). The nucleotide sequence of DNA was determined with an Applied Biosystems 370A DNA sequencer (Foster City, CA). The dpkA Gene Is Essential for the Catabolism of d-Lysine and d-Proline—We found that a novel enzyme, N-methyl-l-amino acid dehydrogenase, is encoded by a gene named dpkA in P. putida ATCC12633 (19Muramatsu H. Mihara H. Kakutani R. Yasuda M. Ueda M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Tetrahedron. 2004; 15: 2841-2843Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, this bacterium was unable to grow on N-methyl-l-alanine as a sole carbon source (Table I), and we speculated that the gene has other physiological functions than the metabolism of N-methyl-l-amino acids. Thus, we carried out gene disruption experiments by introducing a tetracycline-resistant gene (tet) at the center of dpkA (Fig. 2A). A tetracycline-resistant strain obtained had an insertion of 1.35 kbp in dpkA as expected and lacked the ability to produce the DpkA protein (Fig. 2, B and C). The dpkA– strain (termed HM3591) was distinct from the wild-type strain in that neither d-lysine nor d-proline supported the growth as a sole carbon source under the same conditions. Our other finding was that the mutant strain grew only slowly in the medium containing l-lysine as a sole carbon source in contrast to the wild-type strain. No difference was evident between the two strains in other media containing as a sole carbon source l-pipecolate, l-proline, and various d-amino acids except d-lysine and d-proline: d-alanine, d-valine, d-leucine, d-isoleucine, d-serine, d-threonine, d-aspartate, d-glutamate, d-glutamine, d-arginine, and d-phenylalanine (Table I). The retarded growth of the mutant on l-lysine cannot be explained clearly at present, but it is clear that the dpkA gene is essential for the metabolism of d-lysine and d-proline in P. putida.Table IGrowth phenotype of a P. putida dpkA- strain, HM3591Carbon sourceDoubling timeWild typedpkA-hGlucose2.52.5NoneNo growthNo growthMethylamineNo growthNo growthN-Methyl-l-alanineNo growthNo growthl-Lysine2.727l-Proline1.61.8d-Lysine5.4No growthd-Proline13-26No growthl-Pipecolate0.820.82 Open table in a new tab DpkA Exhibits Both Pip2C Reductase and Pyr2C Reductase Activities—d-Lysine is catabolized in P. putida through the pipecolate pathway involving a series of reactions through six-carbon alicyclic intermediates as follows: d-lysine → α-keto-ϵ-aminohexanoate → Pip2C → l-pipecolate → Δ1-piperideine-6-carboxylate → l-α-aminoadipate (Fig. 1) (12Chang Y.F. Adams E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Miller D.L. Rodwell V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2758-2764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no enzyme genes of this pathway have been identified in P. putida. The dpkA– strain grew on l-pipecolate but not on d-lysine as described above, and we assumed that the gene encodes Pip2C reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of Pip2C to l-pipecolate. We confirmed that this is exactly the case as follows. When racemic pipecolate was used as a substrate and incubated with DpkA purified as described above in the presence of d-amino acid oxidase, d-pipecolate of the racemate disappeared and the amount of l-pipecolate was doubled (data not shown). This indicates that d-pipecolate is converted to l-pipecolate by DpkA probably through Pip2C; d-pipecolate serves as a good substrate of d-amino acid oxidase to be converted to Pip2C, which is then transformed to l-pipecolate by DpkA. When d-proline was substituted for dl-pipecolate in the reaction system, it was completely converted to l-proline (Fig. 3). These results clearly indicate that DpkA acts not only on Pip2C but also on Pyr2C. In fact, both Pip2C and Pyr2C synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures” served as substrates of DpkA when NADPH oxidation was followed at 340 nm; Pip2C is better than Pyr2C as a substrate (Table II). Moreover, both l-pipecolate and l-proline underwent oxidation with NADP+ as a coenzyme although at much lower rates than the forward reaction (Table II). Namely, the reaction equilibrium favors the direction toward reduction of Pip2C (and Pyr2C). The results in vivo and in vitro together clearly indicate that DpkA has dual metabolic functions as Pip2C reductase (EC 1.5.1.21) and Pyr2C reductase (EC 1.5.1.1). NADH served as the coenzyme in both reactions but was much poorer than NADPH (Table II). The reductive methylamination of pyruvate proceeds at a rate of about a half of that of the Pyr2C reduction (Table II). Similarly, the oxidative deamination of N-methyl-l-alanine is much slower than that of l-proline.Table IINADP(H)- and NAD(H)-dependent reactions catalyzed by DpkAReactionCosubstratepHSpecific activityμmol/min/mgReduction of Pip2CaDetermined with 0.062 mm Pip2C/Pyr2C and 0.15 mm cosubstrate.NADPH8.092Reduction of Pip2CaDetermined with 0.062 mm Pip2C/Pyr2C and 0.15 mm cosubstrate.NADH8.00.67Reduction of Pyr2CaDetermined with 0.062 mm Pip2C/Pyr2C and 0.15 mm cosubstrate.NADPH8.051Reduction of Pyr2CaDetermined with 0.062 mm Pip2C/Pyr2C and 0.15 mm cosubstrate.NADH8.00.33Reductive methylamination of pyruvatebDetermined with 60 mm methylamine, 10 mm pyruvate, and 0.30 mm cosubstrate.NADPH1042Oxidation of l-pipecolatecDetermined with 20 mm substrate and 0.25 mm NADP+.NADP+101.4Oxidation of l-prolinecDetermined with 20 mm substrate and 0.25 mm NADP+.NADP+105.4Oxidation of N-methyl-l-alaninecDetermined with 20 mm substrate and 0.25 mm NADP+.NADP+100.36a Determined with 0.062 mm Pip2C/Pyr2C and 0.15 mm cosubstrate.b Determined with 60 mm methylamine, 10 mm pyruvate, and 0.30 mm cosubstrate.c Determined with 20 mm substrate and 0.25 mm NADP+. Open table in a new tab Effects of pH and Temperature on DpkA—The maximum activity of DpkA toward Pip2C occurred at pH 8.0, which was distinctly higher than that toward Pyr2C (pH 7.0) (Fig. 4, A and B). However, we found no clear difference in the maximum pH values in oxidation between l-pipecolate and l-proline; both were pH 10.0 (Fig. 4, C and D). The enzyme showed the highest activity in the 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) at 35 °C but was inactivated at a rate of about a 30% decrease in 30 min under the same conditions. The enzyme kept its full activity, however, at 30 °C for at least 30 min. Substrate Specificity—The purified enzyme exhibited neither malate dehydrogenase nor lactate dehydrogenase activity regardless of coenzyme forms (NADH or NADPH) and reaction directions. The enzyme exhibited weak oxidation activity toward trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline and l-thioproline (Table III). However, 2-picolinate, pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylate, cis-4-hydroxy-d-proline, l-azetidine-2-carboxylate, (S)-2-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, piperazine-2-carboxylate, or (S)-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate did not serve as a substrate.Table IIISubstrate specificity of DpkASubstrateRelative activity%(Reduction)aMeasured in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 mm NADPH and 0.062 mm substrate.Δ1-Piperideine-2-carboxylate100Δ1-Pyrroline-2-carboxylate552-PicolinateNDbND, not detected.Pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylateND(Oxidation)cMeasured in Bis-tris propane buffer (pH 10.0) containing 0.25 mm NADP+ and 20 mM substrate.l-Proline100l-Pipecolate26trans-4-Hydroxy-l-proline0.30l-Thioproline0.022cis-4-Hydroxy-d-prolineNDl-Azetidine-2-carboxylateND(S)-2-Pyrroline-5-carboxylateND(S)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylateNDPiperazine-2-carboxylateNDa Measured in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 mm NADPH and 0.062 mm substrate.b ND, not detected.c Measured in Bis-tris propane buffer (pH 10.0) containing 0.25 mm NADP+ and 20 mM substrate. Open table in a new tab Inhibition by Pyrrole-2-carboxylate—A substrate analog, pyrrole-2-carboxylate inhibited the enzyme; it showed only 10% of its original activity in the presence of 1.0 mm of this inhibitor. Pyr2C reductase from pig is strongly inhibited by N-formylphenylalanine at a Ki value of 0.29 mm (18Petrakis P.L. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 78-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, DpkA was resistant against 1 mmN-formylphenylalanine. Initial Rate Studies—DpkA was subject to substrate inhibition by Pip2C and Pyr2C (Fig. 5). Their reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with substrate concentrations lower than 60 μm for Pip2C and 110 μm for Pyr2C. However, the reaction rates decreased with increasing substrate concentration over these ranges. The theoretical curve calculated with equation 5 fitted well with the experimental data for Pyr2C, and an apparent inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated to be 1.2 mm (Fig. 5). However, the experimental data deviated from the calculated curve for Pip2C. We studied steady-state kinetics with substrate concentrations causing no substrate inhibition: [Pip2C], 8–60 μm; [Pyr2C], 3.7–55 μm. Initial velocities were measured with varying concentrations of NADPH or cyclic imino acid (namely Pip2C or Pyr2C) at several fixed concentrations of the other. By double-reciprocal plots, we obtained families of linear lines with intersecting patterns characteristic of a sequential mechanism (Fig. 6) and determined the kinetic constants with slopes and intercepts (Tables IV and V). The intersecting points occurred at the left of the 1/V axis, and accordingly a sequential rapid-equilibrium ordered mechanism was excluded.Table IVKinetic parameters of DpkA in the forward direction(B) Pip2C(B) Pyr2CVmax (μmol/min/mg)220168Km(NADPH) (μm)14034Km(B) (μm)1543Kia (μm)20047 Open table in a new tab Table VKinetic parameters of DpkA in the reverse direction(P) l-Pipecolate(P) l-ProlineVmax (μmol/min/mg)0.1180.271Km(NADP) (μm)112211Km(P) (μm)32,400144,000Kiq (μm)203126 Open table in a new tab Product Inhibition Studies—We studied the kinetic mechanism of DpkA further with respect to product inhibition by Pyr2C and NADPH in the oxidation of l-proline. NADPH was a competitive inhibitor against NADP+, indicating that they bind with the same enzyme form (supplemental Fig. S1). However, no other couples were competitive with one another (Table VI). Both NADPH and Pyr2C were mixed-type noncompetitive inhibitors against l-proline. Pyr2C also served as a mixed-type noncompetitive inhibitor against NADP+. However, the inhibition pattern changed to uncompetitive when the l-proline concentration was increased to a saturating level. These results indicate that the DpkA reaction proceeds through an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism; NADPH and then Pyr2C bind with the enzyme to form a ternary complex, which releases l-proline and then NADP+ to return to the unbound form (Scheme 1).Table VIProduct inhibition of DpkA by l-proline and NADP+ in the reverse directionInhibitorVaried substrateFixed substrateType of inhibitionKisKiiμmμmPyr2CNADP+Proline (unsaturated)aThe concentration of proline used was 40 mm.Noncompetitive9.26.8NADP+Proline (saturated)bThe concentration of proline used was 100 mm.UncompetitiveNAdNot applicable.12ProlineNADP+ (unsaturated)cThe concentration of NADP+ used was 0.5 mm.Noncompetitive6117NADPHNADP+Proline (unsaturated)aThe concentration of proline used was 40 mm.Competitive0.17NAdNot applicable.ProlineNADP+ (unsaturated)Noncompetitive0.621.0a The concentration of proline used was 40 mm.b The concentration of proline used was 100 mm.c The concentration of NADP+ used was 0.5 mm.d Not applicable. Open table in a new tab Relationship with Other Family Members—A phylogenetic analysis of DpkA and several proteins involved in the malate/l-lactate dehydrogenase family revealed that these proteins are grouped into at least eight clusters (Fig. 7). The proteins in each subgroup share more than 40% sequence identities with one another. These subfamilies include (i) the DpkA clade containing P. putida DpkA and its close homologs from Pseudomonas syringae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; (ii) the YiaK clade, which includes 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate reductase (YiaK) from E. coli (9Yew W.S. Gerlt J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and its homologs from Haemophilus influenzae and Pasteurella multocida; (iii) the AllD clade involving ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase (AllD) from E. coli (8Cusa E. Obradors N. Baldoma L. Badia J. Aguilar J. J.

However, the biochemical functions of most family members remain unknown, except those of LDH from A. eutrophus (3Jendrossek D. Kratzin H.D. Steinbuchel A. FEMS Microbiol.

Whether the members of this clade indeed catalyze the reduction of Pip2C (and also of Pyr2C) is under investigation. Preference for NADPH as the Coenzyme—Recently, the crystal structures of YiaK from E. coli (30Forouhar F. Lee I. Benach J. Kulkarni K. Xiao R. Acton T.B. Montelione G.T. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13148-13155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and sulfolactate dehydrogenase from M. jannaschii (SLDH) (31Irimia A. Madern D. Zaccai G. Vellieux F.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were determined. The structures of the protein complexes with NAD+ were also analyzed, and the residues directly interacting with NAD+ were identified (30Forouhar F. Lee I. Benach J. Kulkarni K. Xiao R. Acton T.B. Montelione G.T. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13148-13155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Irimia A. Madern D. Zaccai G. Vellieux F.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). His44, Asp173, Lys225, and Glu307 of SLDH interacting with NAD+ are completely conserved in YiaK and mostly in DpkA, except Glu307, which is replaced by Arg313 (or Arg314) in DpkA. The side chain of Glu307 in SLDH, which is conserved as Glu306 in YiaK, interacts with the diol group of the ADP-ribose of NADH. The Vmax/Km value for SLDH with NADPH as a coenzyme is less than 2% of that with NADH. Similarly, NADH is much better as a coenzyme of YiaK than NADPH. By contrast, DpkA prefers NADPH to NADH and is the first enzyme with this coenzyme preference among all family members. However, both Arg313 and Arg314 of DpkA are also conserved in other members of the same clade, suggesting that all of them show the same coenzyme specificity as DpkA. It is reasonable to speculate that the positive charge of Arg313 (or Arg314) in DpkA plays an important role for the interaction with the 2′-phosphate group of NADPH. Physiological Function of DpkA—We found lysine racemase activity in the periplasm of P. putida ATCCC12633 (data not shown). This is consistent with previous findings (32Ichihara A. Furiya S. Suda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 49: 154-157Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and suggests a linkage between the catabolic pathways of l-lysine and d-lysine through the racemization of lysine (Fig. 1). However, the growth defect observed with the dpkA-deficient mutant HM3591 on d-lysine as a sole carbon source suggests that DpkA is responsible for the reduction of Pip2C to l-pipecolate in vivo and that d-lysine is catabolized only through the pipecolate pathway. Chang and Adams (10Chang Y.F. Adams E. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a mutant of P. putida ATCC 25991 defective of the enzyme converting δ-aminovalerate to glutarate semialdehyde (Fig. 1) is unable to grow on l-lysine as a sole carbon source but capable of growing normally on d-lysine. Therefore, even though lysine racemase occurs in P. putida, the catabolic pathways of l-lysine (through the δ-aminovalerate pathway) and d-lysine (through the pipecolate pathway) are apparently not linked by the racemase. Such disconnection can also be seen between l-proline and d-proline in P. putida although it has proline racemase encoded by the putative proline racemase gene PP1258 (data not shown). As described above, we found that the mutant HM3591 failed to utilize d-proline as a sole carbon source in contrast to l-proline. Pyr2C is known to be a strong inhibitor of proline racemase (33Keenan M.V. Alworth W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and is produced from d-proline by the action of d-amino acid dehydrogenase. However, DpkA is deficient in the mutant, and Pyr2C is probably accumulated in the cells and prevents proline racemase from producing l-proline. Little is known about lysine racemase, in particular, whether Pip2C inhibits it in the same manner as Pyr2C inhibits proline racemase. If this is the case, however, then the above observation with the mutants can be explained by the inactivation of lysine racemase by Pip2C. Comparison with Mammalian Pip2C/Pyr2C Reductase—Lysine is metabolized through pipecolic acid in the mammalian brain but through saccharopine in other organs (34Hutzler J. Dancis J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 377: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Higashino K. Fujioka M. Yamamura Y. Arch. Biochem.

Acta. 1969; 184: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of Pip2C/Pyr2C reductase has been demonstrated in rat tissues (15Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 878-882Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), hog kidney (18Petrakis P.L. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 78-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), brains of dog, monkey, and mouse (17Garweg G. von Rehren D. Hintze U. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), plants (Phaseolus radiatus and Pisum sativum), and Neurospora crassa (16Meister A. Radhakrishnan A.N. Buckeley S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme purified from rat kidney acts on both Pip2C and Pyr2C in the same manner as the P. putida DpkA. However, the rat enzyme uses NADH as effectively as NADPH and catalyzes only the one-way reduction of Pip2C and Pyr2C in contrast to the bacterial enzyme also oxidizing l-pipecolate and l-proline. Moreover, the mammalian enzyme is inhibited by N-formyl-l-phenylalanine (17Garweg G. von Rehren D. Hintze U. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Petrakis P.L. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 78-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the bacterial counterpart is not affected by this compound. No mammalian proteins with significant similarities to the bacterial DpkA have been found by a BLAST search with various protein data bases. Therefore, the mammalian Pip2C/Pyr2C reductase probably belongs to a completely different family of proteins from the bacterial DpkA. Download .pdf (.11 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W1976811867,"Regulation of nuclear receptor activity is the focus of numerous ongoing studies to develop novel therapies for the treatment of hormone-related cancer. Although cyclin D1 functions to control the activity of several nuclear receptors, the region(s) of the protein responsible for such transcriptional comodulation remain poorly defined. Herein, we map the region of cyclin D1 required for binding and repression of the androgen receptor (AR) to a central, exclusively alpha-helical domain. Deletion of this domain disrupted AR binding and corepressor activity. Further investigations showed that this domain is sufficient for AR interaction and possesses the ability to bind histone deacetylase 3. Strikingly, overexpression of this repressor region attenuates cell cycle progression in prostatic adenocarcinoma cells. The requirement of this domain for nuclear receptor repression was conserved with respect to thyroid hormone receptor beta-1, whereas cyclin D1 activation of the estrogen receptor occurred independently of the central region. Together, these data identify a minimal repression module within cyclin D1 and demonstrate that the coactivator and corepressor functions of cyclin D1 are distinct. In addition, our data suggest that properties of the cyclin D1 central domain could be exploited to develop novel prostate cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2151726169,"Phospholipase Cɛ (PLCɛ) is a novel member of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C enzymes with a unique regulatory link to Ras GTP-ases. In the present studies, we establish existence of two splice variants (PLCɛ1a and PLCɛ1b) derived from human PLCɛ1 gene. When expressed in COS or HEK293 cells, PLCɛ1a and PLCɛ1b have similar potential to be stimulated by diverse signaling pathways via tyrosine kinase and G-protein coupled receptors and share the ability to function as an effector of Ras. The expression pattern shows broader mRNA expression of PLCɛ1a in normal tissues; furthermore, in most cell lines expressing PLCɛ, PLCɛ1a is the only splice variant present. Analysis of normal/tumor matched pairs derived from colon and rectum demonstrates greatly reduced expression levels in tumor tissues. Further studies in a colorectal tumor cell line lacking PLCɛ show restoration of transcription of PLCɛ1a and PLCɛ1b by demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, suggesting epigenetic silencing through hypermethylation. In addition, expression of exogenous PLCɛ in this cell line demonstrates inhibitory effects of PLCɛ on cell viability and proliferation. Taken together, our findings suggest that regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of PLCɛ, broadened by diversity introduced by splice variants, could play important role in PLCɛ regulation in normal and tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000398093,"The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) is the predominant mechanism for the extrusion of Ca2+ from beating cardiomyocytes. The role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of NCX1 function in normal and diseased hearts remains unclear. In our search for proteins that interact with NCX1 using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that the C terminus of calcineurin Aβ, containing the autoinhibitory domain, binds to the β1 repeat of the central cytoplasmic loop of NCX1 that presumably constitutes part of the allosteric Ca2+ regulatory site. The association of NCX1 with calcineurin was significantly increased in the BIO14.6 cardiomyopathic hamster heart compared with that in the normal control. In hypertrophic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes subjected to chronic phenylephrine treatment, we observed a marked depression of NCX activity measured as the rate of Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake or the rate of Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux. Depressed NCX activity was partially and independently reversed by the acute inhibition of calcineurin and protein kinase C activities with little effect on myocyte hypertrophic phenotypes. Studies of NCX1 deletion mutants expressed in CCL39 cells were consistent with the view that the β1 repeat is required for the action of endogenous calcineurin and that the large cytoplasmic loop may be required to maintain the interaction of the enzyme with its substrate. Our data suggest that NCX1 is a novel regulatory target for calcineurin and that depressed NCX activity might contribute to the etiology of in vivo cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction occurring under conditions in which both calcineurin and protein kinase C are chronically activated. The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) is the predominant mechanism for the extrusion of Ca2+ from beating cardiomyocytes. The role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of NCX1 function in normal and diseased hearts remains unclear. In our search for proteins that interact with NCX1 using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that the C terminus of calcineurin Aβ, containing the autoinhibitory domain, binds to the β1 repeat of the central cytoplasmic loop of NCX1 that presumably constitutes part of the allosteric Ca2+ regulatory site. The association of NCX1 with calcineurin was significantly increased in the BIO14.6 cardiomyopathic hamster heart compared with that in the normal control. In hypertrophic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes subjected to chronic phenylephrine treatment, we observed a marked depression of NCX activity measured as the rate of Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake or the rate of Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux. Depressed NCX activity was partially and independently reversed by the acute inhibition of calcineurin and protein kinase C activities with little effect on myocyte hypertrophic phenotypes. Studies of NCX1 deletion mutants expressed in CCL39 cells were consistent with the view that the β1 repeat is required for the action of endogenous calcineurin and that the large cytoplasmic loop may be required to maintain the interaction of the enzyme with its substrate. Our data suggest that NCX1 is a novel regulatory target for calcineurin and that depressed NCX activity might contribute to the etiology of in vivo cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction occurring under conditions in which both calcineurin and protein kinase C are chronically activated.

In normal cardiac muscle, the primary role of NCX1 (the cardiac isoform of NCX) is to extrude cytoplasmic Ca2+ during myocyte repolarization and diastole, which balances Ca2+ entry via L-type Ca2+ channels during myocyte depolarization (1Bridge J.H.B. Smolley J.R. Spitzer K.W. Science. 1990; 248: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 2Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The transport activity of NCX1 is known to be influenced by a variety of factors, including hormones and growth factors, intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations, membrane potential, cytoplasmic ATP, and protein and lipid phosphorylation (3Shigekawa M. Iwamoto T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 864-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, information is still limited as to the quantitative aspects of changes in these factors and their consequences on NCX1 activity in normal and diseased cardiomyocytes. For example, in hypertrophic and failing hearts from human patients and animal models, sarcolemmal NCX1 expression has often been shown to be elevated (4Kent R.L. Rozich J.D. McCollam P.L.

Res. 1999; 6: 558-570Google Scholar), which could be compensatory for the reduced ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to maintain low diastolic [Ca2+]i under these pathological conditions. However, whether increased NCX expression invariably leads to enhanced function under disease conditions is not clear, although enhanced NCX expression and function have been observed in cardiomyocytes isolated from some animal models of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (6Ahmmed G.U. Dong P.E. Song G. Ball N.A. Xu Y. Walsh R.A. Chiamvimonvat N. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7O'Rourke B. Kass D.A. Tomaselli G.F. Ka ̈a ̈b S. Tunin R. Marba ́n E. Circ. Res. 1999; 6: 558-570Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism regulating the functions of many cellular systems. In the case of NCX1, acute treatment with PMA or agonists of Gαq-coupled receptors such as phenylephrine (PE) has been shown to enhance NCX activity in isolated cardiomyocytes as well as in cells expressing cloned NCX1 (8Iwamoto T.

Res. 1998; 38: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A activation has also been reported to stimulate NCX1 activity (11Link B. Qiu Z. He Z. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C415-C423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wei S.-K. Ruknudin A. Hanlon S.U. McCurley J.M. Schulze D.H. Haigney M.C.P. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, reportedly causes substantial inhibition of NCX activity in cells expressing cloned NCX1 (13Condrescu M. Hantash B.M. Fang Y. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NCX1 stimulation by PMA and agonists of Gαq-coupled receptors occurs via a mechanism involving PKC activation and requires the participation of the central cytoplasmic loop of the exchanger (see Fig. 1a) (9Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Nakamura T.Y. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17230-17238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because these agonist effects did not require the direct phosphorylation of NCX1, the central cytoplasmic loop was considered to serve as an anchor for phosphorylatable regulatory ancillary protein(s) (9Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Nakamura T.Y. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17230-17238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we undertook a search for regulatory proteins interacting with the central cytoplasmic loop of NCX1 by using a yeast two-hybrid screen. From this search and subsequent analysis, we identified a complex, hitherto unrecognized regulatory mechanism for cardiac NCX1 involving calcineurin and PKC in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes subjected to prolonged PE pretreatment. This mechanism is capable of markedly depressing NCX1 activity. Because calcineurin acts as a central mediator of in vivo cardiac hypertrophy and failure (14Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L.

Materials—FCS, PE, FK506, PMA, calphostin C, 8-bromo-cAMP, Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS, 8-bromo-cGMP, Rp-8-CPT-cGMPS, and H89 were purchased from Sigma. GF109203X, chelerythrine chloride, KN93, and KN62 were purchased from Calbiochem. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes. Antibodies to NCX isoforms have been described (8Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. 45CaCl2 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Animals—Pregnant Wister rats and male Bio14.6 hamsters (J2N-k strain, 120 days old) and age-matched normal controls (J2N-n) were purchased from Japan SLC. The J2N-n had the same genetic background as the J2N-k, except for the difference of a genetic locus for cardiomyopathy. Cell Cultures—Primary cardiomyocyte cultures were prepared from ventricles of 1-day-old rats as described previously (17Simpson P. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). They were plated on collagen-coated 24-well dishes at a density of 4×106 cells per well and maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Staining with rhodamine-phalloidin revealed that >90% of the cells were cardiomyocytes. Two days later, the cells were divided into three groups and then maintained for up to 5 days in M199 alone, M199 with 10 μm PE, or M199 with 10% FCS (see Fig. 3a). These myocytes usually form clusters and exhibit spontaneous synchronized beating (17Simpson P. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CCL39 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and their NCX1 transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7.5% FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Construction of Vectors and Expression of NCX1 and Calcineurin— The preparation of cDNAs of dog heart NCX1 and NCX1 mutants lacking aa 246–672 (NCX1Δ246–672) or aa 407–478 (NCX1Δ407–478), their transfection into CCL39 cells, and the isolation of cell clones stably expressing high NCX activity were carried out as described previously (8Iwamoto T.

The isolation of cDNA encoding human CnAβ and the construction of its constitutively active mutant (ΔCnA) lacking the autoinhibitory and the calmodulin binding domains were described previously (18Shibasaki F. MacKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. Mckeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). A catalytically inactive mutant of CnA that functions as a dominant negative mutant was prepared from ΔCnA by mutating histidine at position 160 to glutamine (19Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. Mckeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type and mutant CnAβs were subcloned into an adenoviral vector downstream of the Tet-Off system (18Shibasaki F. MacKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were infected with adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units per cell in serum-free M199 medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Efficiency of infection under these conditions was 100%, as revealed by immunostaining with an anti-hemagglutinin antibody. In control cells, the expression of adenoviral vectors was suppressed with 1 μm doxycycline (DOX) added to culture medium. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—We used Matchmaker 3 (Clontech) for the yeast two-hybrid screen. DNA fragments corresponding to the following segments of the central cytoplasmic loop of dog NCX1, shown in Fig. 1a, were prepared using a PCR-based method: the NCX inhibitory peptide (XIP, Fig. 1a), aa 250–406; β1, aa 407–478; β1-β2, aa 479–538; β2, aa 539–613; C terminus (CT, Fig. 1a), aa 614–796; N terminus (NT, Fig. 1a), aa 250–613; and the full loop (Full, Fig. 1a), aa 250–796. Each DNA fragment was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pGBKT7 vector. We used a mixture of yeasts carrying each of these bait constructs for the initial screening of ∼4 × 107 clones from a human brain cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain. These bait and library yeast strains were mated by culturing on agar plates in complete YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) medium overnight at 20 °C. After successive screening in medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (-HLT, Fig. 1b) and then in medium lacking histidine, adenine, leucine, and tryptophan (-HALT, Fig. 1b), grown-up colonies were isolated and subjected to β-galactosidase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The inserts in β-galactosidase-positive clones were sequenced using the activation domain sequence primers by the ABI 9600 sequencer. Positive clones were verified by one-on-one transformations and selections by growth on agar plates in -HALT medium and β-galactosidase assay (see Fig. 1b). Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblot, and Immunocytochemical Analyses—Brain and/or ventricular tissues from rat or hamster and cultured rat cardiomyocytes were homogenized by Hiscotron (NITI-ON, Funabashi, Japan) in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μm benzamidine hydrochloride. The lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the resultant supernatant (up to 5 mg protein) was pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with anti-pan CnA for 2 h at 4 °C and then with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for at least 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed eight times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins solubilized from beads by boiling in the Laemmli buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 8.5% gel and then to immunoblotting with an appropriate antibody. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (21Tawada-Iwata Y. Imagawa T. Yoshida A. Takahashi M. Nakamura H. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1447-H1453PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoblot was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunocytochemistry, 5-μm-thick sections of normal and BIO14.6 hamster ventricular tissues embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and treated with rabbit polyclonal anti-NCX1 or goat polyclonal anti-CnAβ at dilutions of 1:500 and 1:200, respectively. These samples were then treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or rhodamine-conjugated anti-goat IgG. For immunostaining of rat cardiomyocytes, cells immobilized on collagen-coated glass slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then stained with anti-NCX1, anti-pan CnA, or anti-ANP. For double staining with a combination of polyclonal (rabbit) and monoclonal (mouse) antibodies, fixed and permeabilized myocytes were incubated with a mixture of two primary antibodies and then with a mixture of the fluorescence-labeled anti-mouse and rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbits IgGs. Cells were examined by a confocal laser scanning microscopy (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad) mounted on an Olympus BX50WI epifluorescence microscope with a plan-apochromat 60× water immersion objective lens (Olympus). Fractionation of Heart Extracts—Normal and BIO14.6 hamster hearts were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline using a Hiscotron homogenizer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 500,000 × g for 45 min to yield supernatant and pellet fractions. Most of the sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes were presumably recovered in the pellet fraction. Both the supernatant and pellet fractions were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-pan CnA. Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+Uptake into and Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+Efflux from Cells—Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into cells was measured as described previously (8Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T.

Physiol. 2000; 279: C393-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cardiomyocytes or CCL39 cells cultured in 24-well dishes were loaded with Na+ by incubating them at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of normal BSS (10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH7.4), 146 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 1 mm ouabain and 10 μm monensin. In cardiomyocytes pretreated with PE or FCS, Na+ loading was carried out during the last 30 min of such pretreatment. 45Ca2+ uptake was then initiated by switching the medium to Na+-free BSS containing choline chloride or to normal BSS, both of which contained 370 kBq of 45Ca2+ and 1 mm ouabain. After a 30-s incubation, cells were washed with an ice-cold solution containing 10 mm LaCl3 to stop 45Ca2+ uptake. Cells were subsequently solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquots were taken for the determination of radioactivity and protein. Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+ uptake in normal BSS from that in Na+-free BSS. To observe the effects of FK506, protein kinase modulators, or thapsigargin, cells were incubated with these substances during the last 15–30 min of Na+ loading, except that endogenous PKC was down-regulated by treatment with 0.3 μm PMA for 24 h. The Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake activities in control cells not pretreated with PE or other agents were as follows: for cardiomyocytes, 12.1 ± 0.5 nmol/mg/30s (n = 9); for CCL39 cells expressing the wild-type NCX1, NCX1Δ246–672, and NCX1Δ407–478, 10.4 ± 0.5, 4.2 ± 0.4, and 5.3 ± 0.2 nmol/mg/30s (n = 9), respectively. These values were taken as 100% in Figs. 3d, 4a, 5, 6, and 7.Fig. 5Effect of activated or dominant negative CnA on Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in cardiomyocytes pretreated with PE or FCS. Myocytes were treated with no growth factor (-PE), 10 μm PE (+PE), or 10% FCS (+FCS) for 72 h. In one series (bar on the extreme right for +PE), PE-treated myocytes were subsequently infected with dominant negative can, and the rate of Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was measured 24 h later. In all other series, myocytes were infected at 24 h after the start of growth factor treatment either with activated CnA in presence (+DOX/AdCnA) or absence (+AdCnA) of DOX or with dominant negative CnA (+AdD.N.CnA), and uptake rates were measured 48 h later.

After rinsing cells six times with Ca2+- and Na+-free BSS for 1 min, 45Ca2+ efflux was measured for 20 s in Ca2+- and Na+-free BSS or in Ca2+-free BSS, both of which contained 1 μm thapsigargin, to acutely increase [Ca2+]i (23Furukawa K. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8058-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux was estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+ efflux in Ca2+- and Na+-free BSS from that in Ca2+-free BSS. Detection of TUNEL-positive Cells—For in situ detection of DNA fragmentation, we assayed TUNEL-positive cells using an apoptosis detection kit (Takara Biomedical) essentially as described previously (24Saito S. Hiroi Y. Zou Y. Aikawa R. Toko H. Shibasaki F. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34528-34533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The number of TUNEL-labeled nuclei was counted by observing rat cardiomyocytes with a light microscope (40× objective; Olympus). TUNEL-positive cells were <3% in normal cardiomyocytes. Data Analysis—Reproducibility of the data presented in the figures and those described in the text was confirmed in at least three independent experiments. Significant differences between two groups of data were evaluated by an analysis of variance assay with post hoc tests. p < 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant finding. Isolation of CnAβ as a NCX1-binding Protein and Mapping of the Interacting Site in NCX1—To isolate protein(s) interacting with NCX1, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using various segments of the large central loop of NCX1 as bait (Fig. 1a). From an initial screen in which we used a mixture of yeast populations expressing individual bait sequences, we isolated a positive clone encoding a ∼100 amino acid C-terminal tail of CnAβ with its autoinhibitory domain (Fig. 1a). We then examined the interaction of individual NCX segments with the CnAβ tail by one-on-one transformations and selection by colony growth and β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 1b). We confirmed that aa 407–478 of the NCX1 protein, known as the β1 repeat, and other fragments containing this same sequence associate with the CnAβ tail. We examined whether calcineurin interacts with NCX1 and its isoforms (NCX2 and NCX3) at the protein level. We found that anti-pan CnA co-precipitated proteins reactive with antibody to each isoform from lysates of rat brain and heart, although these proteins were still relatively abundant in the supernatant fractions (Fig. 1c). Thus, at least some calcineurin was physically associated with NCX isoforms, consistent with the fact that the β1 repeat sequence is conserved in these isoforms. Of note, antipan CnA immunoprecipitated single major proteins from rat (Fig. 1c) and hamster (Fig. 2b) hearts that were recognized by anti-CnAβ, indicating that the antibody predominantly precipitated CnAβ under the conditions used. Enhanced Association of CnAβ with NCX1 in BIO14.6 Hamster Heart—The BIO14.6 hamsters develop cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy due to δ-sarcoglycan deficiency (25Bajusz E. Homburger F. Baker J.R.

We examined the interaction of NCX1 with calcineurin in the hearts of 120-day-old BIO14.6 hamsters, because our recent study has suggested that [Ca2+]i might be elevated in BIO14.6 cardiomyocytes due to increased basal Ca2+ influx (27Iwata Y.

Anti-CnAβ immunoprecipitated more abundant NCX1 protein from BIO14.6 than from normal hearts despite the similar contents of NCX1 and calcineurin in these preparations (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, calmodulin also was more abundant in the immunoprecipitates from BIO14.6 heart, although total calmodulin was again not different (Fig. 2b), suggesting that calcineurin is activated in the BIO14.6 heart. Immunocytochemistry with anti-CnAβ revealed the presence of calcineurin at the peripheral sarcolemma in BIO14.6 but not in normal cardiomyocytes, although it was detectable in the cell interior and at the intercalated discs in both types of myocytes (Fig. 2a). Striated patterns seen in the cell interior may reflect the presence of calcineurin in the Z-lines (16Vega R.B. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2039642352,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the most important systems for conveying excess cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain are the external NADH dehydrogenases (Nde1p and Nde2p) and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase shuttle. In the latter system, NADH is oxidized to NAD+ and dihydroxyacetone phosphate is reduced to glycerol 3-phosphate by the cytosolic Gpd1p. Subsequently, glycerol 3-phosphate donates electrons to the respiratory chain via mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gut2p). At saturating concentrations of NADH, the activation of external NADH dehydrogenases completely inhibits glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation. Studies on the functionally isolated enzymes demonstrated that neither Nde1p nor Nde2p directly inhibits Gut2p. Thus, the inhibition of glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation may be caused by competition for the entrance of electrons into the respiratory chain. Using single deletion mutants of Nde1p or Nde2p, we have shown that glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation via Gut2p is inhibited fully when NADH is oxidized via Nde1p, whereas only 50% of glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation is inhibited when Nde2p is functioning. By comparing respiratory rates with different respiratory substrates, we show that electrons from Nde1p are favored over electrons coming from Ndip (internal NADH dehydrogenase) and that when electrons come from either Nde1p or Nde2p and succinodehydrogenase, their use by the respiratory chain is shared to a comparable extent. This suggests a very specific competition for electron entrance into the respiratory chain, which may be caused by the supramolecular organization of the respiratory chain.

This suggests a very specific competition for electron entrance into the respiratory chain, which may be caused by the supramolecular organization of the respiratory chain. The physiological consequences of such regulation are discussed. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks transhydrogenase activity (1Bruinenberg P.M. Jonker J. van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 142: 302-306Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 32: 199-225Crossref Google Scholar), and the redox couple NAD+/NADH cannot pass through the mitochondrial membrane. Hence, systems for NADH turnover in mitochondria as well as in the cytosol are required under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The reason for this is that several processes result in production of NADH, i.e. several processes are, contrary to ethanol fermentation, not redox neutral. The synthesis of 1 mol of glycerol, the second major by-product of S. cerevisiae cells fermenting glucose, results in the consumption of 1 mol of NADH, whereas other by-products such as acetate lead to the production of cytosolic NADH. The largest part of excess cytosolic NADH formation is connected to biomass production (3Albers E. Larsson C. Lidén G. Niklasson C. Gustafsson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Recent Res. Dev. Microbiol. 1998; 2: 253-279Google Scholar). The synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids and even the highly reduced lipids is associated with assimilatory NADH production. In particular, NADH is generated in the biosynthetic pathways of amino acid synthesis (3Albers E. Larsson C. Lidén G. Niklasson C. Gustafsson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Recent Res. Dev. Microbiol. 1998; 2: 253-279Google Scholar). Anaerobically, the only means by which S. cerevisiae can reoxidize surplus production of NADH is by glycerol production (2van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 32: 199-225Crossref Google Scholar, 5Nordström K. J. Inst. Brew. 1968; 74: 429-432Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Aerobically, several systems exist for conveying excess cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial electron transport chain in S. cerevisiae (6Bakker B.M. Overkamp K.M. van Maris A.J. Kotter P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 15-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two most important systems in this respect seem to be the external NADH dehydrogenase (Nde1p/Nde2p) (7Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M. Kötter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Biol.

Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Nde1p/Nde2p system, which is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane with the catalytic sites projecting toward the intermembrane space, has been shown to directly oxidize cytosolic NADH (7Luttik M.A.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27991-27995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), is situated in the inner membrane of the mitochondria with the catalytic site projecting toward the cytosol and has been shown to be active in maintaining a cytosolic redox balance (9Larsson C. Påhlman I-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this system, the co-factor NADH is oxidized to NAD+ by the cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd1p) when catalyzing the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; J, flux. 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; J, flux. to glycerol 3-phosphate. Thus, glycerol 3-phosphate delivers its electrons to the respiratory chain via Gut2p with the subsequent regeneration of DHAP.Previously, we have shown (10Påhlman I-L. Larsson C. Avéret N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27991-27995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) kinetic interactions between Nde1p/Nde2p and Gut2p. Our data demonstrate that the deletion of either one of the external dehydrogenases caused an increase in the efficiency of the remaining enzyme. In addition, we have shown that the activation of NADH dehydrogenase inhibits the Gut2p in such a manner that, at a saturating concentration of NADH, glycerol 3-phosphate is not used as a respiratory substrate. This effect is not a consequence of a direct action of NADH on Gut2p activity because both NADH dehydrogenase and its substrate are needed for Gut2p inhibition (10Påhlman I-L. Larsson C. Avéret N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27991-27995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The present study raised three distinct questions, which we address in this report. 1) Is the role of each of the external NADH dehydrogenases (Nde1p/Nde2p) equivalent in this process? 2) Is the kinetic regulation of the activity of one enzyme as a function of the rate of another enzyme having the same physiological function as that allowed by their association in the same supramolecular complex in the inner membrane, or is it regulated by competition in the supply of electrons to the respiratory chain? 3) Does this competition in electron supply between the two external NADH dehydrogenases and Gut2p also apply to the internal dehydrogenases (Ndip and/or succinodehydrogenase)?Using two single mutants, Δnde1 and Δnde2, we were able to show that Nde1p was the enzyme involved in the complete inhibition of Gut2p, whereas when Nde1p was absent, the respiratory rate was caused equally by Nde2p and Gut2p. Moreover, when they were functionally isolated, all the considered dehydrogenases were insensitive to each another, pointing out that the inhibition during oxygen consumption was linked to a competition for electron supply to the respiratory chain. In the presence or absence of each one of the external dehydrogenases, Ndip activity was affected in a way that was comparable with Gut2p. When the activity of succinodehydrogenase was considered, succinate oxidation was increased in the absence of Nde1p. Moreover, although Nde1p was able to inhibit substrate oxidation for all other dehydrogenases considered, it was not able to inhibit succinate oxidation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were all derived from W303-1A (Table I). The cells were cultivated as batch cultures in a defined medium, yeast nitrogen base (Difco), using 5 g/liter glucose as the carbon and energy source. The cells were harvested subsequent to glucose depletion but after the diauxic shift occurred during respiratory growth on ethanol.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainDescriptionWild typeade2-1, his3-11, 112trp1-1a, ura3-1, can100Δnde1ade2-1, his3-11, 112trp1-1a, can100, Δnde1::TRP1Δnde2ade2-1, his3-11, 112trp1-1a, can100, Δnde2::LEU2 Open table in a new tab Preparation of Mitochondria—Yeast mitochondria (S. cerevisiae) were prepared as described previously (11Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and suspended in Medium 1 (0.65 m mannitol, 0.36 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-maleate, 5 mm Trisphosphate, pH 6.8).Respiration Assay—Oxygen consumption was measured at 28 °C in a 2-ml thermostatically controlled chamber equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode (Gilson) connected to a microcomputer, which provided an on-line display of rate values. Mitochondria (0.5 mg·ml–1) were incubated in Medium 1. The substrate supply consisted of either various concentrations of NADH, glycerol 3-phosphate, ethanol, and succinate or an NADH-regenerating system (4 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2 mm NAD+, and various amounts of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which is able to work with NAD+ as a co-factor).Enzymatic Activities—NADH-ferricyanide reductase and glycerol 3-phosphate-ferricyanide reductase were assayed in Medium 1 on mitochondria in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml antimycin and 1 mm KCN and different concentrations of NADH and in the presence or absence of a saturating concentration (75 mm) of glycerol 3-phosphate. The reaction was started by the addition of 1.5 mm ferricyanide, and its reduction was followed at 436 nm (ϵ = 0.21 mm–1·cm–1).Measurement of DHAP—DHAP was measured spectrophotometrically in neutralized HClO4/EDTA extracts as described previously by Bergmeyer (12Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VI. VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany1988: 342-350Google Scholar). NAD+ was measured fluorometrically in neutralized HClO4/EDTA extracts as described previously (12Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VI.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27991-27995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that the activation of external NADH dehydrogenase inhibits Gut2p in such a manner that, at a saturating concentration of NADH, glycerol 3-phosphate is no longer used as a respiratory substrate. This effect is not a consequence of a direct action of NADH on Gut2p because both NADH dehydrogenase and its substrate are needed for this inhibition. Because NADH dehydrogenase activity is caused by Nde1p and Nde2p, the question arises as to the respective role of each of these enzymes in such an inhibition process. Using a NADH-regenerating system (see “Experimental Procedures”), different steady states of oxygen consumption could be obtained depending on the NADH concentration produced by the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. At a saturating concentration of glycerol 3-phosphate, the respiratory rate was modulated by adding different amounts of NADH-producing enzyme. For each experimental condition, the respiratory rate and the glycerol 3-phosphate consumption (i.e. the dihydroxyacetone phosphate formation flux) were determined (Fig. 1A). Because oxygen consumption in the presence of both NADH and glycerol 3-phosphate was a combination of these two substrates, we quantified glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation via dihydroxyacetone phosphate production (see Fig. 1A). The NADH-linked respiratory rate was evaluated by the difference between the total respiratory rate and the dihydroxyacetone phosphate formation flux. This technique is validated in Table II, which shows that when glycerol 3-phosphate is the sole substrate, the respiratory rate is equal to the dihydroxyacetone phosphate production flux. Fig. 1, B and C, shows typical experiments of non-phosphorylating respiratory rates of both glycerol 3-phosphate and NADH, using mitochondria isolated from either the Δnde1 strain (Nde2p) or the Δnde2 strain (Nde1p). When only Nde2p was present, the addition of increasing concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to the mitochondria respiring on glycerol 3-phosphate led to a slight increase in the total oxygen consumption (Fig. 1B and Table II) and a decrease in glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation associated with an increase in NADH oxidation. At the saturating concentration of both substrates, the part of oxygen consumption linked to each substrate was comparable (Table II). Moreover, the remaining respiration represented 57% of the maximal respiration for glycerol 3-phosphate and 62% for NADH (Table II). When only Nde1p was present, the addition of increasing concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to mitochondria respiring on glycerol 3-phosphate led to a drastic increase in the total oxygen consumption (Fig. 1C and Table II) and a complete inhibition in glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation associated with an increase in NADH oxidation. It should be noted that in the presence of glycerol 3-phosphate, the optimal respiration on NADH was stimulated (26%) (Table II). These results showed that both enzymes behaved very differently and that in wild type mitochondria, Nde1p was the enzyme responsible for the total inhibition of glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation when NADH was present.Table IIRespiratory rates and dihydroxyacetone phosphate production flux in isolated mitochondria from Δnde1 and Δnde2 strainsStrainSubstratesJO2JDHAPJO2—JDHAPNADH232 ± 190232 ± 19Δnde1G3P223 ± 17226 ± 21-3 ± 20NADH + G3P270 ± 31127 ± 15143 ± 17NADH242 ± 260242 ± 26Δnde2G3P158 ± 18149 ± 209 ± 19NADH + G3P304 ± 320295 ± 34 Open table in a new tab The Competition between Nde1-2p and Gut2p for Respiration Is Not Linked to an Interaction between These Enzymes—Previous studies (13Grandier-Vazeille X. Bathany K. Chaignepain S. Camougrand N. Manon S. Schmitter J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9758-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have shown that Nde1p, Nde2p, and Gut2p are part of a supramolecular complex that can be isolated from yeast mitochondria. This implies that these enzymes are able to interact functionally with each other. Thus, when Nde1p oxidizes NADH, it is possible that it inhibits glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation by Gut2p. To test this hypothesis, we measured the activity of the dehydrogenases that were functionally isolated in the presence of antimycin A and KCN, to inhibit the respiratory chain. In these conditions, the reduction of an artificial electron acceptor (ferricyanide) reflects the activity of the external dehydrogenases. However, we observed that ferricyanide itself inhibited the NADH-regenerating system (data not shown). To bypass this problem, increasing concentrations of NADH were added directly to isolated mitochondria. To measure electron flux from NADH dehydrogenases when both Ndep1 or 2, and Gut2p were functioning, we measured the NAD+ formation flux (Fig. 2A). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2A, it must be stressed that in the presence of Fe(CN)6 plus antimycin A plus KCN, no electron could go through the respiratory chain, and we assessed the actual activity of each dehydrogenase. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2A, NAD+ quantification allowed us to determine the activity of Nde1p or Nde2p; the Fe(CN)6 reduction rate represents both NADH oxidation and Gut2p activity. Thus, the difference between JFe(CN)6 and JNAD+ represents JDHAP. Fig. 2, B and C, shows that for any NADH concentration and any enzyme (Nde1p or Nde2p), glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation was constant. In these experimental conditions, no inhibition of Gut2p was observed, showing that the inhibition of glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation (see Fig. 1) did not come from physical interaction between these enzymes. Because the electron transfer between Gut2p and O2 was inhibited by Nde1p, the only explanation is a competition in electron transfer to the respiratory chain.Fig. 2Absence of direct inhibition between Nde1-2p and Gut2p. A, the technique used to assess the various fluxes is shown. The enzymes were functionally isolated by respiratory chain inhibition with antimycin A and KCN. NADH oxidation flux was assessed via NAD+ production flux, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fe(CN)6 represents the sum of NADH and glycerol 3-phosphate (G3 P) oxidation. Thus the glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation rate via Gut2p is the difference between the Fe(CN)6 reduction flux (divided by 2 because Fe(CN)6 only accepts one and the NAD+ production flux.

NADH electron) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities as a function of NADH concentration are shown in mitochondria isolated from Δnde1 (B) or Δnde2 (C). Mitochondria (0.5 mg·ml–1) were incubated in Medium 1 in the presence of antimycin A and potassium cyanide (see “Experimental Procedures”). In a first set of experiments, ferricyanide reduction (▴) and NAD+ production (•) were measured in the presence of 75 mm glycerol 3-phosphate. In a second set of experiments, ferricyanide reduction was measured in the absence of glycerol 3-phosphate (□). Dehydrogenase activities were expressed in micromoles of the substrate (NADH or glycerol 3-phosphate), consumed·min–1·mg protein–1 (i.e. ferricyanide production flux/2). This figure represents a typical experiment representative of three such independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Internal Dehydrogenases Are Also Involved in the Competition for Electron Supply to the Respiratory Chain—To further study this competition process, we asked whether internal dehydrogenases (i.e. internal NADH dehydrogenase, Ndip, and succinodehydrogenase) could be involved. Both the respiratory rate (JO2) and the NADH oxidation flux (JNAD+) were measured in the presence of an internal substrate (either ethanol or succinate) and NADH (see Fig. 3) on wild type mitochondria (Table III). When NADH was the sole substrate, JNAD+ was the exact measure of the electron flux from NADH to oxygen (JO2). In the presence of both ethanol and NADH, the respiratory rate was essentially the result of external NADH oxidation, and the electron flux from Ndip was inhibited strongly (82%) (Table III). In contrast, in the presence of both NADH and succinate, the resulting respiratory rate accounted for both substrates in which the utilization was inhibited by only roughly 30% (Table III). As shown above for Gut2p, Ndip is inhibited drastically by external NADH dehydrogenases, whereas when succinodehydrogenase is active in conjunction with external dehydrogenases, it is inhibited in the same way as they are. Because electron fluxes from Nde1p and Nde2p play distinct roles in glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation inhibition, we asked whether their behavior was comparable in the case of Ndip. Table IV shows that Nde1p alone was able to inhibit ethanol oxidation in a way that was comparable with glycerol 3-phosphate oxidation (see Table II). In mitochondria isolated from the mutant Δnde2, the respiratory rates with different substrates were similar to the ones in wild type mitochondria, except when succinate was used as the substrate (30% stimulation). However, in these mitochondria, the respiratory rate with NADH plus succinate has characteristics comparable with the wild type mitochondria. Moreover, when only Nde2p was present, at a saturating concentration of ethanol and NADH, the part of oxygen consumption linked to each substrate was comparable (Table IV), which is similar to what was shown with glycerol 3-phosphate and NADH (see Table II). In mitochondria isolated from the Δnde1 strain, the respiratory rate with succinate as a substrate was increased compared with both wild type and Δnde2. When both NADH and succinate were used as substrates, the respiratory rate was high, and succinate was the main substrate that was oxidized (Table IV).Fig. 3Scheme illustrating the technique used to assess the various fluxes in Tables III and IV. NADH oxidation flux was assessed via NAD+ production flux, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oxygen consumption flux represents the sum of NADH and ethanol or succinate oxidation fluxes. Thus, the internal substrate oxidation rate is the difference between oxygen consumption flux and NAD+ production flux.

Both external dehydrogenases share the same function, leaving one to wonder about the role of this redundancy. Previous studies (8Small W.C. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Nde1p is the main enzyme necessary for cytosolic NADH reoxidation during growth on a non-fermentable carbon source. However, NDE2 gene expression is induced after the diauxic shift (15DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar), i.e. for growth on ethanol. Thus, under these conditions, which were the conditions used in the present study, both enzymes were present. In this study, we showed that mitochondria bearing only the Nde1p or the Nde2p enzyme had a comparable oxygen consumption rate on NADH. Even though both enzymes share the same function, they did not have the same role in regulating oxygen consumption fluxes. We have shown that both Gut2p and Ndip were inhibited when functioning in conjunction with Nde1p, whereas Nde2p did not have such an effect. This could have been caused either by enzyme interactions, because they have been shown to belong to the same supramolecular complex, or by electron transfer competition. Clearly, when it was functionally isolated, Gut2p was not inhibited by Nde1p, ruling out the enzyme interaction hypothesis. Thus, the only remaining hypothesis that can explain our results is competition between dehydrogenases for the electron supply to the respiratory chain. We have shown that electrons coming from Nde1p have the right of way over those coming from either Gut2p or Ndip. Finally, this shows that even though both Nde1p and Nde2p share the same function, they do not have the same role in providing electrons to the respiratory chain and/or reoxidizing NADH. Interestingly, when both NADH and succinate were used as substrates at the same time, the resulting oxygen consumption rate was the sum of 60% of each of the individual (NADH or succinate) respiratory rates. Under these conditions, there did not seem to be any priority in electron transfer. That electrons coming from Nde1p had the right of way over electrons coming from Gut2p and Ndip, although this peculiar behavior was not observed for succinate, supports the specific organization of the dehydrogenases and respiratory chain. Previous work (16Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 17Schagger H. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Schagger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) has shown that complexes III and IV are assembled into large supercomplexes. Our hypothesis is that these supercomplexes can interact specifically with either complex II to form a respiratory chain using succinate or with the other supercomplex containing most of the dehydrogenases, i.e. Nde1p, Nde2p, Ndip, and Gut2p. For the sake of comprehension, two distinct phenomena should be considered here. First, the present study was conducted under a non-phosphorylating respiratory rate condition, under which the respiratory rate compensated the energy waste. Thus, the respiratory rate cannot be increased indefinitely, which explains why the dehydrogenases have to share the electron flux. However, some of these dehydrogenases have a full priority in electron transfer to the respiratory chain. In regard to our hypothesis, this priority implies that the dehydrogenases involved belong to the same supramolecular complex. This is reinforced by the fact that the dehydrogenases themselves are not able to inhibit each other. Second, and this is a different situation, if one considers the case of succinate, the succinodehydrogenase can belong to a different supramolecular complex, and the electron flux is then shared between the different dehydrogenases involved.Whichever mechanism is involved, the fact that electrons coming from certain dehydrogenases have priority over electrons coming from other dehydrogenases must have physiological consequences. Indeed, it is accepted generally that the yeast mitochondrial respiratory chain is able to oxidize matricial or cytosolic NADH in a comparable manner. Moreover, if all the dehydrogenases are able to oxidize their substrate at the same time, the redox potential, i.e. the NADH/NAD+ ratio in either the cytosol or the mitochondria, should be the same, in contrast to the situation observed in mammalian cells. In these cells, it is well known that the transfer of reduced equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria by the malate/aspartate shuttle is proton motive force-dependent and leads to an important difference between the redox potentials, that is the mitochondria are more reduced than the cytosol. The results shown in this study scrutinize the validity of our thinking concerning yeast mitochondrial and c"
https://openalex.org/W2061945098,"We have previously shown that low extracellular pH (pHe) promotes cell killing by the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In this study, we examined whether amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ antiporter capable of lowering the intracellular pH (pHi), can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptotic death. Human prostate adenocarcinoma DU-145 cells were treated with various concentrations of TRAIL (10–200 ng/ml) and/or amiloride (0.1–1 mM) for 4 h. Amiloride, which caused little or no cytotoxicity by itself, enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The TRAIL-mediated activation of caspase, and PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) cleavage were both promoted by amiloride. Western blot analysis showed that combined treatment with TRAIL and amiloride did not change the levels of TRAIL receptors (death receptor (DR)4, DR5, and DcR2 (decoy recepter 2) or antiapoptotic proteins (FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), and Bcl-2). However, unlike pHe, amiloride promoted the dephosphorylation of Akt. Interestingly, amiloride also induced the dephosphorylation of P13K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) kinases along with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and PP1α phosphatases. In vitro kinase assays revealed that amiloride inhibited phosphorylation of kinases and phosphatases by competing with ATP. Taken together, the present studies suggest that amiloride enhances TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting phosphorylation of the PI3K-Akt pathway-associated kinases and phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1992317426,"Chitinases have been implicated to be of importance in the life cycle development and transmission of a variety of parasitic organisms. Using a molecular approach, we identified and characterized the structure of a single copy LmexCht1-chitinase gene from the primitive trypanosomatid pathogen of humans, Leishmania mexicana. The LmexCht1 encodes an ∼50 kDa protein, with well conserved substrate binding and catalytic domains characteristic of members of the chitinase-18 protein family. Further, we showed that LmexCht1 mRNA is constitutively expressed by both the insect vector (i.e. promastigote) and mammalian (i.e. amastigote) life cycle developmental forms of this protozoan parasite. Interestingly, however, amastigotes were found to secrete/release ∼>2-4-fold higher levels of chitinase activity during their growth in vitro than promastigotes. Moreover, a homologous episomal expression system was devised and used to express an epitope-tagged LmexCht1 chimeric construct in these parasites. Expression of the LmexCht1 chimera was verified in these transfectants by reverse transcription-PCR, Western blots, and indirect immunofluorescence analyses. Further, results of coupled immunoprecipitation/enzyme activity experiments demonstrated that the LmexCht1 chimeric protein was secreted/released by these transfected L. mexicana parasites and that it possessed functional chitinase enzyme activity. Such transfectants were also evaluated for their infectivity both in human macrophages in vitro and in two different strains of mice. Results of those experiments demonstrated that the LmexCht1 transfectants survived significantly better in human macrophages and also produced significantly larger lesions in mice than control parasites. Taken together, our results indicate that the LmexCht1-chimera afforded a definitive survival advantage to the parasite within these mammalian hosts. Thus, the LmexCht1 could potentially represent a new virulence determinant in the mammalian phase of this important human pathogen.

Thus, the LmexCht1 could potentially represent a new virulence determinant in the mammalian phase of this important human pathogen. Leishmania sp. are a group of trypanosomatid protozoan pathogens, which are transmitted to their mammalian hosts via the bite of infected sand fly vectors. In humans, these parasites cause a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from mild cutaneous ulcerations to severe and typically fatal visceral disease (1P/WorldBank/WorldHealthOrganization UND Tropical Disease Research: Progress 1995-1996: Thirteenth Programme Report of UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1997: 100-111Google Scholar). All Leishmania have a life cycle that includes two major parasite developmental stages: 1) extracellular, flagellated promastigote forms that reside and multiply within the alimentary tract of their sand fly vector hosts and 2) obligate intracellular, amastigote forms, which reside and multiply within the phagolysosomal system of infected mammalian macrophages (2Handman E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Parasite proteins, which mediate the survival, growth, and development of Leishmania within these diverse host environments generally remain to be elucidated. However, one such molecule thought to be involved in these processes is a parasite-derived chitinase. The putative substrate of this enzyme, chitin, is a ubiquitous structural polysaccharide found in arthropods that may create barriers to parasite development in such hosts (3Sacks D. Kamhawi S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 453-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In that regard, based on light and electron microscopic observations, previously it has been hypothesized that a Leishmania chitinase might function to facilitate both parasite infection and survival within their sand fly vector hosts (4Schlein Y. Jacobson R.L. Shlomai J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 245: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Schlein Y. Jacobson R.L. Messer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9944-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Further, it was suggested that a parasite chitinase might also aid in the transmission of these organisms to their mammalian hosts (5Schlein Y. Jacobson R.L. Messer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9944-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite its apparent relevance, to date little direct evidence exists per se concerning the role(s) of such a chitinase in the developmental biology of Leishmania parasites in either their sand fly vector or mammalian hosts. However, previously we used a heterologous probe to indicate that promastigote forms of Leishmania mexicana (i.e. a stage present in its insect vector) contained a putative chitinase-like sequence within their genome (6Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 94: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is important to note that this parasite is the major etiologic agent of human cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World (7Grimaldi Jr., G. Tesh R.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 230-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Further, experimental studies of L. mexicana have been greatly facilitated because culture systems exist for generating the various life cycle developmental forms of this parasite in vitro (8Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Bates P.A. Tetley L. Exp.

Moreover, several mouse model systems have also been established to study the infectivity and pathogenicity of L. mexicana in vivo (8Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Alexander J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6794-6801PubMed Google Scholar, 12Buxbaum L.U. Denise H.

Carlier Y. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5075-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In light of the above, in the current report we used a molecular approach to identify, characterize, and examine the expression of the Lmex-Cht1-chitinase gene throughout the various developmental life cycle stages of this human pathogen. In addition, parasites transfected with an LmexCht1-chimeric construct were evaluated in both human macrophages and in mice to determine whether this gene may play a role(s) in the survival and virulence of this parasite within its mammalian host. Reagents—All chemicals used, unless specified, were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Enzymes used for molecular studies were obtained from Roche Applied Science, DNA and RNA molecular mass standards were from Invitrogen, and protein molecular mass standards were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Parasites and Culture Conditions—Promastigote developmental forms of the M379 strain of L. mexicana (WHO designation: MNYC/BZ/62/M379) were grown at 26 °C in Medium M199 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, 1The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; Ab, antibody; DIG, digoxigenin; gDNA, genomic DNA; HA, hemagglutinin; Lmex-Cht1, gene encoding the chitinase of L. mexicana; 4MU, 4-methylumbelliferone; nt, nucleotide; oligo, oligodeoxyribonucleotide; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; SP, signal peptide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SL, signal leader; HA, hemagglutinin; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) essentially as described previously (14Sopwith W.F. Debrabant A. Yamage M. Dwyer D.M. Bates P.A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Amastigote forms of the L. mexicana M379 strain were maintained in BALB/c mice as described previously (8Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Lesion amastigotes were isolated from infected mice and cultured axenically in vitro at 32 °C; procyclic promastigote cultures were established in vitro by transformation of lesion amastigotes at 26 °C; and metacyclic promastigotes were generated from procyclic promastigotes all as described previously (8Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Bates P.A. Tetley L. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Bates P.A. Parasitology. 1994; 108: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For isolation of nucleic acids and proteins, parasite cultures were harvested at ∼mid-log phase (∼1-2 × 107 cells ml-1) by centrifugation at 2100 × g for 15 min. at 4 °C (15Debrabant A. Bastien P. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 220: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The resulting cell pellets were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) by centrifugation as above and finally resuspended in the appropriate buffers. To assess whether wild-type L. mexicana parasites released/secreted any measurable chitinolytic activity during their growth in vitro, promastigotes and axenic amastigotes were grown to ∼1 × 107 cells ml-1 as above, harvested by centrifugation, and their cell-free culture supernatants were processed as described previously (16Shakarian A.M. Joshi M.B. Yamage M. Ellis S.L. Debrabant A. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 245: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Aliquots of such culture supernatants were used for both enzyme assays and immunoprecipitation experiments. Prior to use in assays, parasite culture supernatants and unused medium controls were neutralized to ∼pH 7.0 using 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH8.0. Enzyme Assays—Cell-free culture supernatants from both wild-type L. mexicana promastigotes and axenic amastigotes (above) were analyzed for their exochitinase (which releases dimers of N-acetylglucosamine from the non-reducing ends of chitin) and endochitinase (which hydrolyzes bonds within the chitin polymer) activities (17McCreath K.J. Gooday G.W. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1992; 14: 229-237Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For these assays, the fluorogenic substrates: 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-N,N′-diacetylchitiobioside (4MU-chitobiose) and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-N,N′,N″-triacetylchitiotrioside (4MU-chitotriose) were used to measure exo- and endochitinase activities, respectively (6Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 94: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The concentration of the fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) product generated from these substrates was determined using 4MU standards. Fluorescence was measured with a Turner Digital Filter Fluorometer (Model 112; Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) using a 360-nm excitation filter and a 450-nm emission filter. In these experiments, fresh, unused, complete parasite growth (culture) medium was used as a background control. Values obtained from such controls were subtracted from those generated with various test samples. The results of these enzyme assays are expressed as pmol of 4MU product generated h-1 ml-1 of parasite culture supernatant using either 4MU-chitobiose or 4MU-chitotriose as substrates. All samples were assayed in triplicate and these assays were repeated on multiple samples. In parallel, such parasite culture supernatants were also subjected to immunoprecipitation reactions using an anti-LdCht1-peptide antiserum or preimmune serum from the same rabbit (i.e. normal rabbit serum, NRS) in a protein A-based assay as described previously (6Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 94: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated protein A-bound complexes resulting from such reactions were subsequently assayed for their exochitinase and endochitinase activities as described above. Results of these immunoprecipitation experiments were normalized by subtracting the values obtained with NRS from those obtained with the anti-LdCht1-peptide antiserum. All samples were assayed in triplicate, and these assays were repeated on three independently generated samples. Nomenclature—The designations used in this report for genes, proteins, and plasmids follow the nomenclature for Trypanosoma and Leishmania as outlined by Clayton et al. (19Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R. Baltz T. Barrett M. Bastien P. Belli S. Beverley S. Biteau N. Blackwell J. Blaineau C. Boshart M. Brin-gaud F. Cross G. Cruz A. Degrave W. Donelson J. El-Sayed N. Fu G. Ersfeld K.

Stuart K. Tuner M. Ullu E. Vanhamme L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Primers, PCR, and Probe Preparation—Oligonucleotide primers: PCR-Fwd and PCR-Rev, respectively were designed to portions of Region II (i.e. a putative catalytic site) and Region III (i.e. a putative substrate binding site) of the Leishmania donovani chitinase 1 gene (18Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previously, these regions were shown to be relatively well conserved among chitinase genes from various sources (18Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These primers (PCR-Fwd: 5′-GACGGCATCGACTTCAACTGGGAGTA-3′ and PCR-Rev: 5′-GTACGCCATCAAGTGCACATAGTCGAG-3′) were synthesized by β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry using an Expedite™ nucleic acid synthesis system (PE Applied Biosystems) and used in PCR amplifications with L. mexicana genomic (g) DNA as a template. It was possible to use gDNA as template since trypanosomatid protozoans generally do not possess introns within the coding region of their open reading frames (ORF) (20Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21868-21874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fong D. Lee B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After an initial hot start at 94 °C for 2 min, the conditions used for amplification were: 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s (35 cycles), and a final step at: 72 °C for 5 min. The resulting 270-bp amplified-product was cloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmid (Lmex-PCR270) was subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Analyses of the sequence data obtained from the Lmex-PCR270 clone showed that it had high sequence identity with the L. donovani Cht1 gene (18Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Subsequently this cloned PCR fragment was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP using the PCR Dig Labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The resulting digoxigenin-labeled probe (Lmex-DIG270) was used to screen an L. mexicana cosmid library. Generation and Screening of an L. mexicana Cosmid Library— Genomic DNA was isolated from 109 mid-log phase L. mexicana M379 promastigotes using a Gnome DNA Isolation Kit (Bio101, Carlsbad, CA). Such gDNA was used to construct an L. mexicana cosmid library. To that end, following restriction endonuclease digestion, gDNA was ligated into the SuperCos I vector, phage-packaged, and adsorbed onto host E. coli, XL-1 Blue MR cells according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Subsequently, ∼3000 colonies from this cosmid library were screened using the Lmex-DIG270 probe under high stringency hybridization and washing conditions (i.e. 0.1× SSC; 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). Among the several positive clones identified from such screening, one (Lmex-Cos1) was chosen for further analyses. DNA was isolated from this Lmex-Cos1 cosmid clone using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen). Such DNA was subsequently subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Nucleotide Sequencing and Analyses—DNA was sequenced using the fluorescent di-deoxy chain terminator cycle sequencing method (22McCombie W.R. Heiner C. Kelley J.M. Fitzgerald M.G. Gocayne J.D. DNA Seq. 1992; 2: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) at the Johns Hopkins University DNA Analysis facility (Baltimore, MD). Sequence data obtained from both strands were analyzed using the Genetic Computer Group (GCG) software package (23Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar) running on an NIH Unix System and Sequencher™3.0 software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Further, such sequences were also subjected to BLAST-N and BLAST-P analyses using the NCBI BLAST-link (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Signal sequence and protease cleavage sites were predicted using the SignalP link available at the world wide ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) available at www.expasy.ch/tools. Protein domain analysis was done using the Worldwide Web-based Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (smart.embl-heidel-berg.de) available via EMBL-EBI, European Bioinformatics Institute (at www.ebi.ac.uk). Protein multiple sequence alignments were done using the ClustalW program (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar) using a MacVector 7.0 software package (GCG, Madison, WI). Isolation of Genomic DNA and Southern Blot Analysis—L. mexicana gDNA was prepared from log phase promastigote cells using the GNome DNA isolation kit as described above. For Southern blot analyses, such DNA was digested with several restriction endonucleases and separated in 1% agarose gels, transferred to positively charged Nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science) and cross-linked to the membranes by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker® 2400 (Stratagene). Subsequently, blots were hybridized under high stringency using a second digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe (i.e. LmexCht1-DIG1151), which corresponded to a major portion of the L. mexicana chitinase open reading frame (i.e. nt 1-1151). After washing these blots at high stringency (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C), the hybridized fragments were visualized using an anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody in conjunction with a chemiluminescent reagent (CSPD) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Images were captured from such blots using BIOMAX™-MR x-ray film (Kodak). DNA was also isolated from the Lmex-Cos1 cosmid clone and digested with several different restriction endonucleases. Subsequently, such preparations were subjected to Southern blot analysis as above. Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from exponential and stationary phase promastigote and axenic amastigote cultures of L. mexicana, as well as from the lesion-derived amastigotes using TRIzol® according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Aliquots of 5 μg of total RNA were separated in 1.2% agarose gels using the glyoxal method (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7.27-7.45Google Scholar), transferred onto nylon membranes, and cross-linked by UV irradiation as above. Blots were hybridized under high stringency conditions using a DIG-labeled probe (LmexCht1-DIG270). Subsequent to high stringency washing, such blots were subjected to immunological detection using anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and developed using the CSPD chemiluminescent reagent as described above. Mapping of the 5′-Spliced Leader (SL) Acceptor Site—As indicated above, trypanosomatids generally do not possess introns within their ORFs. However, the pre-mRNAs in these organisms are joined to a 39-nt conserved spliced leader at their 5′-end by trans-splicing to generate mature, translatable mRNAs (26Borst P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 701-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 27Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To identify the 5′-splice acceptor site in the LmexCht1 gene, RT-PCR analysis was performed essentially as described previously (18Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For these reactions, cDNA was generated from total RNAs isolated from both L. mexicana M379 promastigotes and axenic amastigotes. Such cDNAs were used as template in PCR with a forward primer (i.e. SpliceFwd) based on the L. mexicana spliced leader sequence (i.e. nt 5-31 of the 39-nt SL sequence) (28Fernandes O. Murthy V.K. Kurath U. Degrave W.M. Campbell D.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar): 5′-AACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTCTGTA-3′ and a reverse primer (i.e. ORF-RT/Rev) based on a portion of the 5′-end (i.e. nt 138-157) of the LmexCht1 ORF: 5′-CAGTTATCGAGGTGTTGTGC-3′. The resulting PCR-amplified products obtained from these reactions (i.e. using cDNAs from both promastigote and axenic amastigotes) were cloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and analyzed. Sequence data obtained from these two parasite developmental forms were compared. Generation of an Epitope-tagged Expression Construct—In this report, the pKSNEO leishmanial vector (29Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was used to episomally express an L. mexicana gene construct. This vector has been used previously to express a variety of homologous and heterologous genes in both promastigotes and axenic amastigotes in several different species of Leishmania parasites (30Charest H.

The pKSNEO vector contains 3′-UTR regulatory elements from an L. donovani amastigote-specific (i.e. A2) gene (34Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which can favor some differential up-expression (albeit not completely parasite stage-specific) in amastigote forms of these organisms (31Ghedin E.

This leishmanial vector was used to express a construct encoding an LmexCht1-hemagglutinin-tagged (-HA) chimeric protein in L. mexicana parasites. To that end, a construct was designed that contained the complete open reading frame of the L. mexicana Cht1 gene (including its 5′-end encoding the signal peptide) joined, at its 3′-end, with a sequence encoding a nine amino acid epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (Roche Applied Science). This construct was generated by PCR using the Lmex-Cos1 cosmid as template. The forward primer used in these reactions was 5′-GATACTAGTATGGTGCAGAGGAGCTCACTT-3′ (containing an SpeI restriction endonuclease site shown in bold). The reverse primer was 5′-CAAACTAGT-TCACGCGTAGTCCGGCACGTCGTACGGGTATAGATCGCGGTC-3′ (containing an SpeI restriction endonuclease site shown in bold; stop codon in bold italics; and an HA epitope tag (underlined sequence)). The resulting amplified product was gel-purified and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to generate a pCR2.1::LmexCht1-HA plasmid. The insert was excised from the latter plasmid using an SpeI restriction endonuclease. Subsequently, the excised fragment was ligated into the pKSNEO (SpeI-linearized) plasmid to generate the pKSNEO::LmexCht1-HA plasmid construct. The orientation of Lmex-Cht1-HA in pKSNEO was verified using restriction endonuclease analysis. Further, the sequence of the pKSNEO::LmexCht1-HA construct was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Transfection of Plasmids into L. mexicana Promastigotes—Log phase L. mexicana promastigotes were transfected with either the pKSNEO control plasmid or the pKSNEO:: LmexCht1-HA construct by electroporation using methods derived from Debrabant et al. (32Debrabant A. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16366-16372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To that end, L. mexicana promastigote cells were harvested, washed two times with 1× PBS by centrifugation (2100 × g, 10 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in ice-cold electroporation buffer (21 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.0) at 108 cells ml-1. A 500-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was added to a 2-mm gap electroporation cuvette (BTX® Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) to which 20 μl of purified plasmid DNA (at 1 μg μl-1) in sterile 10 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was added. The cells were electroporated using a single pulse (conditions: 475 V, 800 microfarads, and 13 ohms) in a BTX ECM-600 electroporation system (BTX® Harvard Apparatus). Electroporated cells were incubated on ice for 10 min, transferred into 5 ml of complete culture medium (M199 containing 10% (v/v) FBS) as described above and incubated at 26 °C for 24 h. Following this, the transfected cells were harvested by centrifugation as above and resuspended in the same culture medium containing 10 μg ml-1 Geneticin® (G418, Invitrogen). Subsequently, these transfectants were selected for their growth in increasing concentrations (up to 200 μg ml-1) of G418 over a period of several weeks. Promastigote cultures of such transfectants were routinely maintained and grown at 26 °C in complete growth medium containing 200 μg ml-1 of G418. For some experiments, such transfected promastigotes were allowed to transform and grow under axenic amastigote growth conditions (i.e. in pH 5.5 medium at 32 °C) (35Debrabant A. Joshi M.B.

Growth kinetics of both pKSNEO control and pKSNEO::LmexCht1-HA-transfected parasites were monitored at regular intervals during the time course of their growth in vitro. To that end, aliquots of such cultures were diluted appropriately with an isotonic buffer (ISOTON-II, Beckman-Coulter Particle Characterization, Miami, FL) and counted using a Model Z1 Coulter Counter (Beckman-Coulter) essentially as described by Debrabant et al.

https://openalex.org/W2057521146,"Activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor dimers are composed of Jun, Fos, and ATF member proteins, but the mechanisms that determine AP-1 composition are not clearly defined and the function of specific dimers is not well understood. MEKK1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase and an ubiquitin ligase that regulates both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. Herein, we demonstrate that MEKK1 regulates the AP-1 protein repertoire. Both FGF-2 and phorbol ester-inducible urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression requires AP-1 binding to an enhancer element in the uPA promoter, and we have previously shown that FGF-2 or PMA induction of uPA expression is strongly dependent on MEKK1. JunB mRNA is significantly increased in MEKK1-/- cells, demonstrating that MEKK1 suppresses JunB mRNA expression. Upregulation of JunB expression in MEKK1-/- cells forms an inhibitory AP-1 complex that binds to the uPA promoter and inhibits uPA transcription. MEKK1 also regulates Fra-2 protein stability by inducing Fra-2 ubiquitination and degradation. MEKK1 regulates AP-1-dependent gene expression by regulating the expression, activity and degradation of component members of the AP-1 complex. Controlling the repertoire of a transcription factor complex is a newly defined function for an MAPK kinase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2045880555,"Several nucleotide analogues have been described as inhibitors of NS5B, the essential viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of hepatitis C virus. However, their precise mode of action remains poorly defined at the molecular level, much like the different steps of de novo initiation of viral RNA synthesis. Here, we show that before elongation, de novo RNA synthesis is made of at least two distinct kinetic phases, the creation of the first phosphodiester bond being the most efficient nucleotide incorporation event. We have studied 2′-O-methyl-GTP as an inhibitor of NS5B-directed RNA synthesis. As a nucleotide competitor of GTP in RNA synthesis, 2′-O-methyl-GTP is able to act as a chain terminator and inhibit RNA synthesis. Relative to GTP, we find that this analogue is strongly discriminated against at the initiation step (∼150-fold) compared with ∼2-fold at the elongation step. Interestingly, discrimination of the 2′-O-methyl-GTP at initiation is suppressed in a variant NS5B deleted in a subdomain critical for initiation (the “flap,” encompassing amino acids 443–454), but not in P495L NS5B, which shows a selective alteration of transition from initiation to elongation. Our results demonstrate that the conformational change occurring between initiation and elongation is dependent on the allosteric GTP-binding site and relaxes nucleotide selectivity.

The Flaviviridae is an important virus family comprising three genera, namely flavivirus, pestivirus, and hepacivirus. Both flavivirus and hepacivirus genera comprise major human pathogens, such as Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Yellow Fever virus, and the Hepatitis C virus (HCV 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; IMPDH, inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; WT, wild type; IC50, inhibitory concentration of 50%. ), respectively. The discovery of HCV in the late 1980s and analysis of its prevalence in the general population has revealed that HCV is the most common etiological agent of chronic liver disease (1Wasley A. Alter M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than 170 millions persons are infected by HCV in the world, making these individuals at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Liang T.J. Rehermann B. Seeff L.B. Hoofnagle J.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 2000; 132: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Unlike other viral diseases for which antiviral therapies exist (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus or herpes infections), a persistent HCV infection can be controlled (3Poynard T. Marcellin P. Lee S.S. Niederau C. Minuk G.S. Ideo G. Bain V. Heathcote J. Zeuzem S. Trepo C. Albrecht J.

Cort S. Albrecht J.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). In some cases, HCV can be eradicated from an infected patient (5Somsouk M. Lauer G.M.

Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1946-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and this represents the first example of a complete success of antiviral therapy ever. Current antiviral therapies rely on the association of interferon α to the nucleoside analogue ribavirin. Ribavirin is a broad spectrum antiviral agent discovered about 30 years ago. Although not effective on all HCV isolates and associated with undesirable side effects (6Lauer G.M. Walker B.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar), ribavirin exerts its antiviral activity by at least two mechanisms that are intimately linked. First, it is intracellularly converted to ribavirin 5′-monophosphate, which is a potent inhibitor of the cellular inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) (7Miller J. Kigwana L. Streeter D. Robins R. Simon L. Roboz J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 284: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Streeter D.G. Witkowski J.T. Khare G.P. Sidwell R.W. Bauer R.J. Robins R.K. Simon L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Inhibition of IMPDH depresses the intracellular concentration of GTP. Second, ribavirin is also converted to ribavirin triphosphate and acts as a GTP analogue. It is incorporated into viral RNA, leading to lethal mutagenesis of the viral genome (9Vo N.V. Young K.C. Lai M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10462-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and inhibits the polymerase directly after its incorporation (9Vo N.V. Young K.C. Lai M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10462-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Maag D. Castro C. Hong Z. Cameron C.E. J. Biol.

Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Canard B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, IMPDH inhibition and subsequent depression of cellular GTP pools potentiate the action of ribavirin triphosphate as an antiviral nucleotide analogue. The antiviral action of ribavirin as a nucleotide analogue indicates not only that the HCV polymerase is an interesting target for antiviral drugs but also that nucleosides in general are interesting molecules to develop potent anti-HCV treatments. Therefore, several nucleoside analogues are currently being evaluated as potential anti-HCV agents, such as 2′-O-methyl nucleosides, 2′-C-methyl nucleosides, and β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (12Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar, 13Migliaccio G. Tomassini J.E. Carroll S.S. Tomei L. Altamura S. Bhat B. Bartholomew L. Bosserman M.R. Ceccacci A.

Antiviral Res. 2003; 58: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A clear picture of the mechanism of action of some of these inhibitors is beginning to emerge. In the case of β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, no direct inhibition of the polymerase is observed using the purified enzyme in assays in vitro (12Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar). Rather, it is thought that the analogue 5′-monophosphate is incorporated into the viral RNA selectively leading to biologically inactive genomes. In the case of 2′-modified analogues, it has been reported that they act as non-obligate chain terminator of RNA synthesis (14Carroll S.S. Tomassini J.E. Bosserman M. Getty K. Stahlhut M.W. Eldrup A.B. Bhat B. Hall D. Simcoe A.L. LaFemina R. Rutkowski C.A. Wolanski B. Yang Z. Migliaccio G. De Francesco R. Kuo L.C. MacCoss M. Olsen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11979-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Unlike obligate chain terminators (e.g. azidothymidine, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleosides in antiretroviral treatments), non-obligate chain terminators carry a 3′-hydroxyl group, and thus bear potential to support further RNA synthesis once incorporated into viral RNA. Most of our understanding of the mechanism of action of nucleoside analogues comes from studies performed on the HIV-1-reverse transcriptase and its nucleoside inhibitors (for recent reviews, see Refs. 16Menendez-Arias L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and 17Deval J. Courcambeck J. Selmi B. Boretto J. Canard B. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase is a DNA and RNA primer-dependent DNA polymerase. The HCV polymerase, however, is an RNA polymerase able to initiate RNA synthesis without primer in a so-called de novo RNA synthesis process, as well as to elongate an existing RNA primer (18Oh J.W. Ito T. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Luo G. Hamatake R.K. Mathis D.M. Racela J. Rigat K.L. Lemm J. Colonno R.J. J.

Primer-independent RNA synthesis is unique to viral RNA polymerases so far. To perform such an initiation step, these polymerases have selected through evolution unique structural features essential to the synthesis of their own short RNA primers (21Choi K.H. Groarke J.M. Young D.C. Kuhn R.J. Smith J.L. Pevear D.C. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4425-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 22Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V.

Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the HCV polymerase as well as some elegant enzymatic assays have identified such a structure (23Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 24Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W.

Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). A β-strand-turn-β-strand (“flap”) subdomain actually obstructs the polymerase active site when the latter is compared with related primer-dependent polymerases. Based on both structural and deletion studies, it has been proposed that the flap gives physical support to initiating nucleotides, up to the point where the neo-synthesized primer RNA triggers a conformational change of the polymerase active site (23Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 24Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W.

Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the polymerase must adopt an alternate conformation in which the primer is elongated in a processive fashion. Recently, the flap has been shown to play a role in repressing primer-directed RNA synthesis in favor of initiation of RNA synthesis (27Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gutshall L. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The HCV polymerase has been reported to be activated by GTP, which is able to bind to a low affinity allosteric site away from the polymerase active site (23Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It is suspected that the action of GTP at this allosteric site plays a role in the triggering of the switch between initiation and elongation. These distinct steps of RNA synthesis are not clearly characterized, either structurally or kinetically. This context of poorly defined mechanisms of RNA synthesis impedes precise evaluation of the inhibition potency of nucleotide analogues. The 2′-modified analogues are not obligate chain terminators. Therefore, a viral RNA terminated with such an analogue is expected to abort viral synthesis, hence the observed antiviral effect, but a 2′-modified nucleoside monophosphate incorporated into viral RNA and further elongated is also expected to exert an antiviral effect through the production of structurally altered progeny RNA genomes. Not known with precision either is the extent of discrimination of these analogues at the HCV polymerase active site during the initiation or elongation step. Clearly, a better understanding of the different steps of RNA synthesis is needed, as well as a molecular basis for the evaluation of inhibitor potency. This should aid the design of potent HCV inhibitors and the in vivo-in vitro correlation of their antiviral effect, as well as the anticipation of future potential resistance mechanisms that might develop upon sustained treatments. In this report, we contribute to the characterization of the initiation step of RNA synthesis. We have made use of 2′-O-methyl-GTP to dissect the effect of this GTP analogue on NS5B at the level of allosteric activation, inhibition of initiation, and elongation of RNA. We report discrimination values of this analogue relative to GTP during the initiation and elongation phases of RNA synthesis. We show that there is a marked discrimination of this analogue at the initiation of RNA synthesis, but not when RNA synthesis reaches the elongation phase. HCV 1b Polymerase Plasmid Constructions, Enzyme Preparation, and Reagents—Several reports (27Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gutshall L. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Vo N.V. Tuler J.R. Lai M.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10579-10591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) mention that the authentic C-terminal part of NS5B is critical in the repression of primer-dependent synthesis in favor of initiation. Because we did not examine both RNA synthesis modes simultaneously, all NS5B proteins were truncated at their C terminus by 55 residues, and 6 histidine residues were added to the C terminus of each of the proteins to facilitate affinity purification. The resulting NS5B is called wild-type NS5B throughout this report, and it is unlikely that the former has a C terminus extending long enough to reach the active site (Fig. 2), as described for a 21-amino acid C terminus-truncated NS5B (29Adachi T.

Zhang F. Wang Q.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9020-9028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NS5B wild-type or mutant proteins were expressed from the pDest 14 vector (Invitrogen) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene). All constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. NS5B proteins were purified from bacteria grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (17 μg/ml) and induced with 50 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside during 16–18 h at 17 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and recombinant RdRps were purified in sodium phosphate buffer through a Talon cobalt affinity column (Invitrogen) followed by SP-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted proteins were concentrated to 2 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C. No attempts were made to titrate the active site concentration of NS5B preparations. Therefore, maximum velocity values (VM) related to total enzyme concentration are reported instead of kcat values throughout this report (see Tables I and II). RNA molecular weight markers were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and the appropriate template RNA. For this purpose, reactions were performed in T7 buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 10 min, using 10 ng of DNA oligonucleotide (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ or 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′) template annealed to the T7 primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′), and 10 μm [α-32P]GTP (1 μCi). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of recombinant T7 RNA polymerase. The GMP marker was synthesized through hydrolysis of [α-32P]GTP by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG-Biotech; homopolymeric cytosine template was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. For elongation experiments, RNA oligonucleotides were 5′-α-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). γ-32P-Labeled adenosine 5′-triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol), α-32P-labeled guanosine 5′-triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol), α-32P-labeled cytosine 5′-triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol), and uniformly labeled [3H]GTP (5.20 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. 2′-O-Methyl-GTP was purchased from Trilink, Inc.Table ISteady-state constants of wild-type, Δ-flap, and P495L NS5B polymerase for RNA templates during initiationWTΔ-flapP495LNucleotidesGTP2′-O-meGTPGTP2′-O-meGTPGTP2′-O-meGTPKm (μm)aKm and Vmax were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”8.5 ± 0.8205 ± 2515 ± 1.770 ± 37.6 ± 0.6130 ± 25Vmax (s-1)bVmax is expressed in picomoles·s-1·pmol-1 enzyme.9.2 ± 0.2 × 10-31.4 ± 0.06 × 10-33.7 ± 0.09 × 10-31.1 ± 0.01 × 10-315.9 ± 0.3 × 10-31.6 ± 0.1 × 10-3Vmax/Km (s-1/μm)1 × 10-36.7 × 10-62.7 × 10-41.6 × 10-52 × 10-31.3 × 10-5Discrimination148-fold17-fold157-folda Km and Vmax were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Vmax is expressed in picomoles·s-1·pmol-1 enzyme.

The radioactivity bound to the filter was determined using liquid scintillation counting. IC50 was determined using the equation, % of activity =100/(1+(I)2/IC50)(Eq. 1) where I is the concentration of inhibitor. IC50 was determined from curve-fitting using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Steady-state Incorporation of Nucleotide into Homopolymeric Templates—Polymerase activity was assayed by monitoring the incorporation of radiolabeled guanosine on 15-mers cytosine RNA oligonucleotide template. All indicated concentrations are final. The reaction was performed in RdRp buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Igepal CA630) containing 10 or 100 μm GTP as indicated, 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 10 μm RNA oligonucleotide. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μm purified NS5B and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn over time from 10 s to 1 h. For inhibition analysis, increasing concentration of 2′-O-methyl-GTP (10, 50, 100, 200, or 400 μm) were added before the addition of NS5B, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. Reaction products were separated using sequencing gel electrophoresis (20% acrylamide, 7 m urea in TTE buffer (89 mm Tris, 28 mm taurine, 0, 5 mm EDTA)) and quantitated using photo-stimulated plates and a FujiImager (Fuji). The formation of products was fitted with a burst equation, (P)=A⋅(1−exp(−(Vi⋅t))+kss⋅t)(Eq. 2) where A is the amplitude of the burst, Vi is the initial velocity of the reaction, and kss is the enzyme turn over rate. Determination of Vmax and Km—An RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3′-end of the negative strand of the HCV genome (RNA H(–), 5′-UCGGGGGCUGGC-3′) was used to analyze the synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond. The RNA H(–) template (10 μm) was mixed in RdRp buffer with 1 μm NS5B. The reactions were started by addition of 100 μm [α-32P]CTP (1 μCi), GTP (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 μm), and incubated at 30 °C. Elongation was measured with a 5′ α-32P-labeled hairpin-RNA template (5′-UGACGGCCCGGAAAACCGGGCC-3′). The hairpin-RNA template (1 μm) was mixed with 1 μm NS5B in RdRp buffer before the addition of GTP (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 500 μm), and reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1–30 min. Initiation or elongation reactions involving 2′-O-methyl-GTP were conducted using 2 μm enzyme to allow accurate measurement of low incorporation rates. All maximal velocities (VM values) were then normalized to 1 μm enzyme. Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and the reactions were quenched with EDTA/formamide. Products were separated using sequencing gel electrophoresis and quantified using photo-stimulated plates and a FujiImager (Fuji). Product formation was fitted to a curve according to Equation 2. The dependence of Vi on NTP concentration is described by the hyperbolic equation, Vi=Vmax⋅(NTP)/(Km+(NTP))(Eq. 1) where Vmax and Km are the maximal velocity and the affinity constant of NTP incorporation by NS5B, respectively. Vmax and Km were determined from curve-fitting using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). GTP plays a special role during viral RNA synthesis by HCV NS5B. It is the initiating nucleotide of (+)RNA genome synthesis, it is incorporated throughout the genome during the elongation process, and its concentration is perhaps regulating theses steps through binding to an allosteric site (23Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Biroccio A. Ceccacci A. Pacini L. Narjes F.

Virol. 2002; 76: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mode of action of GTP analogues (such as ribavirin triphosphate) is expected to be complex. We have made use of a known GTP analogue inhibitor, 2′-O-methyl-GTP, to dissect kinetically the different mechanisms at work during initiation and elongation of RNA synthesis. The Target of 2′-O-Methyl-GTP and Its Inhibition Kinetics— When poly(rC) is used as a template of RNA synthesis, the appearance of poly(rG) RNA products is biphasic (Fig. 1A). The initial rate of RNA synthesis can be measured during the linear phase of the reaction, and the addition of increasing concentrations of 2′-O-methyl-GTP to the reaction decreases this rate of synthesis. The decrease of synthesis rate, i.e. inhibition, can be plotted as a function of 2′-O-methyl-GTP synthesis, giving a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.5 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 1B). In an attempt to characterize further the mechanism of 2′-O-methyl-GTP inhibition, a traditional Henri-Michaelis-Menten analysis was performed, and the reciprocal Lineweaver-Burke plot is shown in Fig. 1C. The 2′-O-methyl-GTP analogue exhibits some features of a competitive inhibitor. However, above 200 μm GTP, all experimental curves merge with the uninhibited (I = 0) reaction curve, indicating that 2′-O-methyl-GTP ceases to exert its inhibitory activity. This non-linear behavior indicates that several phenomena are taking place in the same enzyme site and/or time, and thus, the kinetics of initiation and elongation of RNA were studied for between the GTP and its competing analogue. Kinetics of the Initiation Phase of RNA Synthesis Using GTP—The initiation phase of RNA synthesis is defined as the formation of the first phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides to form a ribo-dinucleotide primer. In the case of the HCV polymerase, structural studies have indicated that the active site is closed by the flap on one side and the fingers on the other side (Fig. 2). Thus, one can envision that nucleotides are polymerized up to a certain extent into RNA primers, then the active site has to open up to adopt a processive mode of elongative synthesis. These steps can be illustrated by a polymerization reaction analyzed with a gel assay. In this assay, an oligonucleotide of 15 consecutive cytidines (oligo(C)15) is used as a template to direct RNA synthesis using GTP as the sole nucleotide substrate. Fig. 3A shows a kinetic order of appearance of oligoG products. The size distribution of products generated using the oligoC15 template is identical to that obtained using poly(rC) (not shown). Abortive 6-mer products or less accumulate over time, whereas products >6-mer are rapidly and processively converted to 15-mer (template length, or G15) final products. In fact, a closer examination of the reaction products reveals that the overall reaction can be kinetically split into three phases (Fig. 3B). First, the very first phosphodiester bond formation from G1 to G2 occurs rapidly, and G2 products accumulate over time. Second, abortive products up to G6 are formed. Subsequently, a third phase occurs in which G6 products are elongated processively into full-length, run-off products. Fig. 3C shows the individual quantitation of reaction products. A band-product accumulating over time indicates a rate-limiting step for the subsequent phosphodiester bond formation. It is apparent that, out of the final G15 product, G2 and G5 accumulate more than G3, G4, and G6. Very similar patterns of product formation are observed in the presence of higher GTP concentrations (see “Supplementary Material,” Fig. S) as well as for a variety of templates (not shown). We conclude that, as opposed to the commonly reported hypothesis (33Lohmann V. Roos A. Korner F. Koch J.O. Bartenschlager R. Virology. 1998; 249: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Lohmann V. Roos A. Korner F. Koch J.O. Bartenschlager R. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the true initiation reaction of formation of the G2 product is not rate-limiting, even at low GTP concentrations of 10 μm such as those used here. Instead, it is the next reaction from G2 to G3 which is rate-limiting together with another slow rate reaction from G6 to highly polymerized products. The formation of G2 or G3 to G6 and of >G6 products will be referred to as the initiation, transition, and elongation reaction, respectively. The initiation reaction was examined in greater kinetic details for GTP and 2′-O-methyl-GTP comparatively. Kinetic Analysis of the P1 to P2 Reaction, and Its Inhibition by 2′-O-Methyl-GTP—The kinetics of P2 product formation was examined using a gel assay as described above (Fig. 4A). To examine a single nucleotide incorporation and simplify the analysis, we made use of a short oligonucleotide template allowing the extension of a single GTP or 2′-O-methyl-GTP. As reported b"

A yeast one-hybrid screen showed that a longer isoform of gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor 4 (GKLF) we term GKLFa interacts with the CD11d promoter. Purified GST-GKLFa protein was shown to bind within the –61 to –44 region that overlaps a binding site for the CD11d transcriptional activators Sp1 and transforming growth factor β-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1). Transfection of GKLF/GKLFa in myeloid cells reduced CD11d promoter activity, whereas, down-regulation of GKLF/GKLFa with small interfering RNAs led to up-regulation of CD11d expression. Differentiation of myeloid cells with phorbol ester led to activation of the CD11d promoter and reduced occupancy of the promoter by GKLF/GKLFa but an increased occupancy by TIEG1 in vivo. Binding of GKLF/GKLFa, Sp1, and TIEG1 to the CD11d promoter in vivo is dependent on their zinc finger DNA binding domains. GKLFa physically associates with the histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 and 2, and both HDACs are bound to the CD11d promoter in vivo but released after exposure of myeloid cells to phorbol ester suggesting that GKLF/GKLFa recruits HDACs to effect repression.

In contrast, prolonged activation of these receptors leads to tissue damage as evidenced during reperfusion of ischemic blood vessels, stroke, atherosclerosis, and autoimmunity (7Noti J.D. Curr.

The CD11a–d genes are differentially expressed in that all leukocytes express CD11a, whereas, CD11b–d expression is generally observed in myeloid cells. With the exception of the CD11d gene, a considerably large number of studies have been conducted into the role and regulation of the leukocyte integrins. This latest leukocyte integrin to be identified is highly expressed on leukocyte subsets including macrophage foam cells and splenic red pulp macrophages (11Van der Vieren M. Le Trong H. Wood C.L.

Adjacent to the Sp1/Sp3 binding sites on these other leukocyte integrin genes are functional sites for other transcription factors (7Noti J.D. Curr.

CD11d exhibits biphasic expression in response to PMA in that shorter exposure (24 h) to 10 nm PMA leads to down-regulation of CD11d expression (15Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol.

In this current study a longer isoform of gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor 4 (GKLF, KLF4) (22Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Transfection analysis revealed that GKLF/GKLFa represses CD11d promoter activity in leukocytes and antisense down-regulation of GKLF/GKLFa expression leads to activation of CD11d in myeloid cells. We show using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) that the up-regulation of CD11d in PMA-stimulated myeloid cells correlates with reduced occupancy of the CD11d promoter by GKLF/GKLFa and histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 and 2 in vivo.

Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26948-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To differentiate between HA-tagged proteins bound to the endogenous CD11d promoter and the integrated CD11d-(–173/+74)-luc reporters, primers specific to the CD11d-luc fusion were used. The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, for 30 cycles. Samples were also analyzed at 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, and 39 cycles of amplification to verify linearity. The PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis, stained with Vistra Green, and quantitated on a Storm Phosphorimager. Binding of each transcription factor is the amount of PCR product derived from each immunoprecipitated DNA expressed relative to that of the appropriate input DNA. Binding of KLF5 (29Adam P.J.

Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Silencing of GKLF and Lung Kruppel-like Factor 2—GKLF siRNA corresponding to nucleotides 528–881 of the GKLF sequence (GenBank™ accession no.

THP1 and HL60 cells were electroporated at 300 V, 125 microfarads with 0.6 or 1.2 μg of siRNA as described (32Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol.

RT-PCR was performed with primers to GKLF, CD11d, Sp1, or glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the PCR products were stained with Vistra Green and quantitated on a Storm Phosphorimager. Expression of each gene was determined relative to GAPDH. The PCRs were analyzed at 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, and 39 cycles to monitor linearity. GKLF Binds to a Site That Overlaps the Sp1 Binding Site—We previously showed that CD11d is controlled by Sp proteins, and in vivo DNase I footprint analysis revealed that one or more proteins, presumably Sp proteins, occupy the –66 to –38 region of the CD11d promoter (Fig. 1A) (15Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8959-8969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, site-directed mutagenesis of the –54 to –44 region suggested that a putative repressor protein might interact. 2J. D. Noti, unpublished observations. To isolate the putative repressor and possibly other transcription factors that interact adjacent to this region, a yeast one-hybrid screen of a spleen cDNA expression library was employed using a yeast strain in which were integrated four copies of the –100 to –20 region fused upstream of the his3 and lacZ genes as bait. BLAST analysis of the one-hybrid clones selected on 45 mm 3-AT revealed one clone that corresponded to a longer isoform of GKLF that we refer to as GKLFa (Fig. 1B). The GKLFa protein contains an additional 102-bp sequence inserted in-frame and immediately upstream of the zinc finger region (Fig. 1B). The –66 to –40 region of the CD11d promoter contains a GC-rich sequence that resembles the binding site for members of the Sp and Kruppel-like families and was examined further by EMSA. Purified GST-GKLFa efficiently bound the wild-type probe to the –66 to –40 region, but not to probes containing mutations at –55, –51, –46, and –61 (Fig. 1, C and D). Binding of GST-GKLF yielded the same binding pattern.2 Mutations at –61 and –55 prevented Sp1 from binding (Fig. 1D). EMSA was also performed using nuclear extract protein from THP1, Jurkat, and IM-9 cell lines and yielded essentially the same results with one exception (Fig. 1E). In extracts from IM-9 cells, loss of Sp1 binding to probes containing mutations at –51 and –46 was also observed. It should be noted that these results do not allow us to conclude whether GKLF or GKLFa (or both) are bound. Overall, these results indicate that GKLF/GKLFa binds a longer and overlapping site shared by Sp1. GKLF/GKLFa Down-regulates the CD11d Promoter in Both Myeloid and Non-myeloid Cells—Co-transfections of pCMV-HA-GKLF or pCMV-HA-GKLFa along with CD11d-(–173/+74)-luc showed that both forms of this Kruppel-like protein (GKLF/GKLFa) significantly repressed luciferase expression from the CD11d promoter in both myeloid and non-myeloid cells (Fig. 2A). GKLF/GKLFa also was able to repress luciferase expression from reporters containing 3-bp mutations (the same ones introduced into the EMSA probes) at –65 or –42 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mutations at –55 and –46 resulted in an increase in luciferase expression that was unable to be repressed by GKLF/GKLFa and show that these sites are essential for GKLF/GKLFa to functionally interact. The mutations at –61 and –51 resulted in a significant reduction of luciferase expression in the absence of co-transfected GKLF/GKLFa and suggest that a transcriptional activator(s) is prevented from binding. In THP1 cells, one of these activators is Sp1 as evidenced by the inability of cotransfected Sp1 to increase luciferase expression from a reporter containing the –61 mutation (Fig. 2B) and the other is TIEG1 that we recently reported activates CD11d (32Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26948-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The inability of GKLF/GKLFa to further repress luciferase expression of the –61 and –51 mutant reporters is consistent with the results of the EMSA (Fig. 1) that indicate these sites are also essential for binding. Further, the sites essential for binding of Sp1 revealed in the EMSA (–61 and –55) are also the sites essential for co-transfected Sp1 to interact in THP1 cells (Fig. 2B).Fig. 5Prolonged exposure of myeloid cells to PMA leads to reduced GKLF/GKLFa and Sp1 binding to CD11d. A, proteins bound in vivo to the CD11d promoter were detected by ChIP analysis of genomic DNA from THP1, HL60, IM-9, and Jurkat cells either unstimulated (0) or stimulated with 100 nm PMA for 48 h (48). Genomic DNA was cross-linked to bound proteins in vivo with formaldehyde, sheared, and precipitated with anti-GKLF (GKLF) or anti-Sp1 (Sp1) antibodies, and amplified by the PCR with primers specific to the –200 to –20 region. Amplification of cross-linked genomic DNA that was precipitated in the absence of antibodies (No Ab) is shown. Genomic DNA that was not cross-linked (Input) was also amplified by PCR. The quantity of each input DNA was initially determined by OD260/280 and adjusted if necessary to yield approximately the same amount of PCR product for the four cell lines. A representative gel stained with ethidium bromide is shown. As control, amplification of the –712 to –520 region of the CD11d promoter following immunoprecipitation was done. For semiquantitation, the PCR products were stained with Vistra Green and analyzed on a Storm Phosphorimager. B, Western blot analysis shows that anti-GKLF antibodies can detect purified GST-GKLF (GST-GKLF) and GST-GKLFa (GST-GKLFa) proteins and a single band at 55 kDa corresponding to the endogenous GKLF and GKLFa proteins in THP1 cells. The results show that the antibodies do not differentiate between GKLF and GKLFa, and therefore, the results in A reflect the total amount of these proteins that are bound. C, the above PCR analysis at 30 cycles was confirmed to be within the linear range by monitoring the PCR through 21–39 cycles of amplification. The accumulation of input, Sp1, and GKLF/GKLFa PCR products following 21–39 cycles of amplification of reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from unstimulated (–PMA) and PMA-stimulated (+PMA) THP1 cells is shown. The yield of PCR product (Relative %) after amplification of input and immunoprecipitated DNAs from unstimulated THP1 cells for 30 cycles was set at 100%. The linearity of the PCR reaction was also confirmed during the analysis of the other cell lines but is not shown. The results represent the mean ± S.D. from two independent experiments done in duplicate. D, Sp1 binding is reduced prior to release of GKLF/GKLFa from the CD11d promoter. Proteins bound in vivo to the CD11d promoter were detected by ChIP analysis of genomic DNA from THP1, HL60, and IM-9 cells either unstimulated (0) or stimulated with 10 nm PMA for 24 h (24), or 100 nm PMA for 48 h (48). Immunoprecipitation and PCR analysis of the –200 to –20 region is as described above. Amplification of cross-linked genomic DNA that was precipitated following exposure to non-immune sera (Non-immune) is also shown. The results represent the mean ± S.D. from two independent experiments done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1A putative repressor protein binds the CD11d promoter.

A, THP1, HL60, Jurkat, and IM-9 cells were cotransfected with CD11d-(–173/+74)-luc and 5 μg each of either the GKLF or GKLFa mammalian expression plasmid pCMV-HA-GKLF or pCMV-HA-GKLFa. Luciferase expression from CD11d-(–173/+74)-luc cotransfected with the empty plasmid pCMV-HA (None) in all cell lines 24 h post-transfection is set at 100%. The mean luciferase activities ± S.D. are indicated after normalization to either total protein (CD11d/protein) or Renilla luciferase expressed from the co-transfected pTK-RL plasmid (CD11d/Renilla). This was done because, on occasion, expression from pTK-RL in transfected IM9 cells appeared to be down-regulated through a cryptic site on this plasmid, which, when used as means to normalize for differences in transfection efficiencies, appears to skew the results by masking potential repression of the CD11d promoter by the Kruppel-like proteins. B, THP1 and Jurkat cells were cotransfected with CD11d-(–173/+74)-luc (wt) or luciferase reporters which contain the 3-bp mutations at –65, –61, –55, –51, –46, or –42, that were analyzed in the EMSA (Fig. 1C) and 5 μg each of either pCMV-HA (None), pCMV-HA-GKLF (GKLF), pCMV-HA-GKLFa (G"
https://openalex.org/W1999727181,"The Int-6 protein has been originally identified as the product of a mouse gene being a frequent integration site of the mouse mammary tumour virus. Here, we show that reducing Int-6 expression by RNA interference in HeLa cells markedly alters mitosis progression. Defects in spindle formation, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis were observed. These abnormalities of mitosis completion are correlated with an inhibition of cyclin B-Cdk1 kinase activity, due to a prolonged inhibitory phosphorylated state of Cdk1. In line with this observation, the Wee1 tyrosine kinase that negatively controls Cdk1 was less efficiently inactivated during G2 in Int-6-depleted cells. These findings support the notion that the oncogenic properties associated with alteration of Int-6 originate from chromosomal instability."
https://openalex.org/W1966764187,"Loss of function of either the RVS161 or RVS167 Saccharomyces cerevisiae amphiphysin-like gene confers similar growth phenotypes that can be suppressed by mutations in sphingolipid biosynthesis. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Rvs161p as bait to uncover proteins involved in this sphingolipid-dependent suppressor pathway. In the process, we have demonstrated a direct physical interaction between Rvs167p and the two-hybrid interacting proteins, Acf2p, Gdh3p, and Ybr108wp, while also elucidating the Rvs167p amino acid domains to which these proteins bind. By using subcellular fractionation, we demonstrate that Rvs167p, Ybr108wp, Gdh3p, and Acf2p all localize to Rvs161p-containing lipid rafts, thus placing them within a single compartment that should facilitate their interactions. Moreover, our results suggest that Acf2p and Gdh3p functions are needed for suppressor pathway activity. To determine pathway mechanisms further, we examined the localization of Rvs167p in suppressor mutants. These studies reveal roles for Rvs161p and the very long chain fatty acid elongase, Sur4p, in the localization and/or stability of Rvs167p. Previous yeast studies showed that rvs defects could be suppressed by changes in sphingolipid metabolism brought about by deleting SUR4 (Desfarges, L., Durrens, P., Juguelin, H., Cassagne, C., Bonneu, M., and Aigle, M. (1993) Yeast 9, 267–277). Using rvs167 sur4 and rvs161 sur4 double null cells as models to study suppressor pathway activity, we demonstrate that loss of SUR4 does not remediate the steady-state actin cytoskeletal defects of rvs167 or rvs161 cells. Moreover, suppressor activity does not require the function of the actin-binding protein, Abp1p, or Sla1p, a protein that is thought to regulate assembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Based on our results, we suggest that sphingolipid-dependent suppression of rvs defects may not work entirely through regulating changes in actin organization.

Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Initially, BAR family function was thought to be involved only in regulating early endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton (3Crouzet M. Urdaci M. Dulau L. Aigle M.

In addition, it is now believed that BAR family proteins may function to regulate critical membrane topological/morphological changes. Work has demonstrated that Drosophila amphiphysin regulates the organization of specialized membrane domains that are required for cortical protein localization (7Zelhof A.C. Bao H. Hardy R.W. Razzaq A. Zhang B. Doe C.Q. Development. 2001; 128: 5005-5015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, studies have shown that the BAR domain (Fig. 1) itself binds directly to membranes and may initiate membrane curvature events that facilitate the development of a tubulovesicular membrane system required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, regulation of membrane dynamics, and depolarization-contraction coupling in striated muscle (1Zhang B.

Thus, understanding how BAR proteins function within various yeast pathways should increase our understanding of their roles in higher eukaryotes, as well. All members of the BAR family have an N-terminal conserved BAR domain (Fig. 1). All but Rvs161p have a central domain enriched in proline and a C-terminal SH3 domain. These two regions bind each other and interact with other actin-binding proteins (see below) (16Sivadon P. Crouzet M. Aigle M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Balguerie A. Sivadon P. Bonneu M. Aigle M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central domain of Rvs167p is not as well conserved and is enriched in proline, glycine, and alanine (14Colwill K. Field D. Moore L. Friesen J. Andrews B. Genetics. 1999; 152: 881-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bin1, an isoform of the human amphiphysin II, has additional domains that either bind the Myc oncoprotein or function in nuclear localization (5Wechsler-Reya R. Sakamuro D. Zhang J. Duhadaway J.

However, Rvs161p and Rvs167p seem not to have totally redundant functions because BAR domain exchange between the two proteins does not yield functionally redundant chimeras (16Sivadon P. Crouzet M. Aigle M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and Rvs161p functions independently of Rvs167p in nuclear fusion during the yeast conjugation process (25Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that Rvs161p and Rvs167p form a complex in vivo (26Navarro P. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys.

Open table in a new tab Sphingolipids are essential membrane lipids that are conserved structurally throughout evolution (29Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 30Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic sphingolipids, including those of the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, are composed of a LCB sphingoid backbone that is C2 amide linked to a very long chain fatty acid. Ceramide serves as the backbone for all complex sphingolipids (29Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 30Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae and mammalian sphingolipid biosyntheses are very similar up to ceramide production (Fig. 2). Various polar head groups are attached at the C1 position of ceramide of complex sphingolipids, and it is at this point in sphingolipid biosynthesis where yeast and mammalian cells diverge. In higher eukaryotes, polar head groups include phosphocholine for sphingomyelin, carbohydrates for glycosphingolipids, and sialic acid residues (31Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Yeast sphingolipid head groups are all inositol-based, with S. cerevisiae producing only three complex sphingolipids: inositolphosphorylceramide, mannose inositolphosphorylceramide, and mannose diinositolphosphorylceramide (29Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 30Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar) Recessive mutations that suppress rvs defects have been isolated and reside within the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae. Loss of function mutations in the SUR1/CSG1, SUR2, SUR4/ELO3, ELO2, and IPT1 genes alter sphingolipid biosynthesis in yeast and suppress rvs defects (24Desfarges L. Durrens P. Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Sur1p/Csg1p is a subunit of the mannose inositolphosphorylceramide synthase (32Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas Sur2p is a LCB hydroxylase that converts dihydrosphingosine to phytosphingosine (33Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Sur4p/Elo3p and Elo2p are very long chain fatty acid elongases required for the production of the C26 fatty acids found in all yeast complex sphingolipids (34Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Ipt1p is a mannose diinositolphosphorylceramide synthase that catalyzes the terminal step in yeast sphingolipid biosynthesis (35Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Wells G.B. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29620-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). SUR7, isolated as a multicopy suppressor of rvs defects, including those associated with the actin cytoskeleton, regulates sphingolipid levels but by a mechanism that has yet to be elucidated (36Sivadon P. Peypouquet M.F. Doignon F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Young M.E. Karpova T.S. Brugger B. Moschenross D.M. Wang G.K. Schneiter R. Wieland F.T. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). How rvs defects are suppressed by altering sphingolipid metabolism is not known but may be mediated through regulating changes in the actin cytoskeleton (38Balguerie A. Bagnat M. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Breton A.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that deleting the individual sphingolipid genes described above suppresses the actin depolarization defects of rvs161 cells; the process of actin depolarization/repolarization is important for many cell events including cell stability during stress and for maintaining proper polarized cell growth (39Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Welch M.D. Holtzman D.A. Drubin D.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It was shown that depending on the gene deleted, either Rvs161p function was rendered nonessential for repolarization of actin under high salt stress, or depolarization in rvs161 cells was decreased under the same conditions (38Balguerie A. Bagnat M. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Breton A.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results suggest a link among sphingolipid metabolism, Rvs161p, and the regulation of actin repolarization. In the present study, we used a two-hybrid screen to isolate proteins interacting with Rvs161p/Rvs167p, and we determined their role in the sphingolipid-dependent suppression of rvs defects brought about by loss of function of the SUR4 gene (Table I). We have uncovered a novel two-hybrid interaction that may link RVS function, sphingolipid metabolism, and nitrogen assimilation. Moreover, we present evidence that our Rvs167p two-hybrid interactions exist in vivo, possibly within sphingolipid/sterol rafts. Additional studies aimed at determining how altering sphingolipid metabolism suppresses rvs defects show that rvs167 sur4 and rvs161 sur4 double mutant cells harbor rvs null steady-state actin cytoskeletal defects. Moreover, we demonstrate that rvs161 sur4 abp1 and rvs161 sur4 sla1 triple mutant cells are viable and grow under conditions that would normally cause growth defects in rvs161 null mutants. Thus, the sur4-dependent suppression of rvs defects does not require certain factors that are thought to be involved in regulating actin organization (14Colwill K. Field D. Moore L. Friesen J. Andrews B. Genetics. 1999; 152: 881-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ayscough K.R. Eby J.J. Lila T. Dewar H. Kozminski K.G. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol.

Overall, our results hint at the possibility that sphingolipid-dependent suppression of rvs defects may not function entirely through remediating the actin cytoskeletal defects of mutant cells. Yeast Strains, Miscellaneous Microbial Techniques, and Growth Conditions—The yeast strain PJ69-4A (YJN737) was used for all two-hybrid studies and was obtained from Phil James (43James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other strains were constructed in the W303-1A (MATa ura3–1 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 trp1–1 ade2 can1–100) or MY2792 (YJN146) (MATα ura3–52 leu2–1 his3–200) backgrounds (25Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The plasmids YIp-rvs161::LEU2, YIp-rvs167::HIS3, and YIp-sur4::HIS3 were used to generate rvs161, rvs167, and sur4 deletion alleles. acf2, abp1, sla1, gdh3, and ybr108w deletion alleles were constructed using the plasmid pFA6a-kanMX and the PCR method described by Longtine et al. (44Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.R. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Strains harboring functional rvs161::RVS161-HA-TRP1 and rvs167::RVS167-HA-TRP1 alleles were constructed using the plasmid pFA6a-3HA-TRP1 (44Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.R. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). A functional rvs167::RVS167-GFP-TRP1 allele was constructed using the plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-TRP1 (44Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.R. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose), YEPDLG medium (YEP containing 0.05% glucose), YEPDHS (YEPD medium containing 6% NaCl), or in synthetic minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and adenine. Yeast transformations were performed using the procedure described by Ito et al. (45Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For routine propagation of plasmids, Escherichia coli XL1Blue cells were used and grown in LB medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Reagents for Two-hybrid Screen—The initial two-hybrid screen isolating Rvs161p-interacting proteins was performed using YJN737. In subsequent two-hybrid studies, PJ69-4A strains were used which harbored rvs161::URA3 (YJN738) or rvs167::URA3 (YJN739) deletion alleles. The Gal4 binding domain vectors pBD-GAL4Cam-RVS161 and pBD-GAL4Cam-RVS167 were constructed using the plasmid pBD-GAL4Cam (Stratagene) (Table II). The Gal4 binding domain truncation plasmids pAS2-1-RVS167BAR, pAS2-1-RVS167BARGPA, pAS2-1-RVS167GPASH3, and pAS2-1-RVS167SH3 were constructed as described previously (14Colwill K. Field D. Moore L. Friesen J. Andrews B. Genetics. 1999; 152: 881-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the plasmid pAS2-1 (BD Biosciences). Plasmid pACT2 (BD Biosciences) was used to construct the Gal4 activation domain plasmids, pACT-LAS17, pACT-ACF2, pACT-GDH3, pACT-RVS167, pACT-RVS161, pACT-FUS2, and pACT-YBR108w. Gene fragments cloned into vectors were generated by PCR using the high fidelity Pfu polymerase and were sequenced prior to subcloning.Table IIDescription of two-hybrid plasmidsTwo-hybrid plasmidsRelevant characteristicsSourcepBD-GAL4Cam-RVS161Gal4p binding domain-full-length Rvs161p chimera expressionThis studypBD-GAL4Cam-RVS167Gal4p binding domain-full-length Rvs167p chimera expressionThis studypAS2-1-RVS167BARGal4p binding domain-Rvs167p BAR domain chimera expressionThis studypAS2-1-RVS167BARGPAGal4p binding domain-Rvs167p BARGPA domain chimera expressionThis studypAS2-1-RVS167GPASH3Gal4p binding domain-Rvs167p GPASH3 domain chimera expressionThis studypAS2-1-RVS167SH3Gal4p binding domain-Rvs167p SH3 domain chimera expressionThis studypACT-LAS17Gal4p activation domain-full-length Las17p chimera expressionThis studypACT-ACF2Gal4p activation domain-full-length Acf2p chimera expressionThis studypACT-GDH3Gal4p activation domain-full-length Gdh3p chimera expressionThis studypACT-RVS167Gal4p activation domain-full-length Rvs167p chimera expressionThis studypACT-RVS161Gal4p activation domain-full-length Rvs161p chimera expressionThis studypACT-FUS2Gal4p activation domain-full-length Fus2p chimera expressionThis studypACT-YBR108wGal4p activation domain-full-length Ybr108wp chimera expressionThis study Open table in a new tab Two-hybrid Analysis—For the Rvs161p interaction screen, a large scale two-hybrid screen was performed using YJN737 containing the pBD-GAL4Cam-RVS161 plasmid and a yeast activation domain genomic library (YL2H-C1) (a gift from Phil James) (43James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 2.7 × 106 independent transformants were initially screened on His–Leu–Trp– agar containing 2.5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Transformed cells were grown at 30 °C for 10 days at which time randomly selected His+ colonies were transferred to Leu–Trp– master plates. After 2 days at 30 °C, these colonies were replicated to Leu–Trp–Ade– plates and grown for 1 week at 30 °C. Ade+ colonies were subsequently assayed for β-galactosidase activity (LacZ+) using a filter assay. His+, Ade+, LacZ+ yeast clones were randomly chosen for further analysis. After overnight growth in SD-Leu broth at 30 °C, plasmid DNA was precipitated from cells and propagated in XL1Blue cells, which were plated on LB medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. All plasmids isolated were retested for interaction with Rvs161p. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA inserts from these reactive clones was determined using a primer specific for the activation domain vector. Liquid β-Galactosidase Assays—LacZ assays were performed as described in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (BD Biosciences) using the substrate chlorophenolred-β-d-galactopyranoside. Briefly, three independent colonies from a single positive clone were inoculated into Leu– Trp– medium and grown to exponential phase (A600 ∼ 0.5–0.8). Cells were pelleted from 1.5 ml of the growing culture and resuspended in 300 μl of buffer 1 (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm NaCl, 4.5 mml-aspartate (hemimagnesium salt), 2.0 g of bovine serum albumin, and 100 μl of Tween 20"

The thyroid TRK-T3 oncogene consists of the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain fused in-frame with sequences of the TFG (TRK-fused gene), encoding a protein of unknown function. TFG contains a coiled-coil domain responsible for TRK-T3 oligomerization. In addition, recent analysis of the sequences outside of the coiled-coil domain suggested possible interactions with other proteins. Based on the presence of a putative SHP-1 SH2-binding site within the TFG sequences, we have investigated the role of the SHP-1 phosphatase in TRK-T3 oncoprotein signaling. In this study we show that SHP-1 interacts with and down-regulates TRK-T3. We provide evidence that SHP-1 SH2 and catalytic domains, respectively, associate with the TFG- and NTRK1-derived portions of TRK-T3.

Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is expressed in the hematopoietic system, the nervous system, epithelial cells, and the NGF-responsive PC12 cell line (2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Based on its function as an antagonist of the growth promoting and oncogenic potential of tyrosine kinases, SHP-1 has been proposed as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in lymphoma, leukemia, and other cancers (3Wu C. Sun M. Liu L. Zhou G.W. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The first evidence of SHP-1 as a negative regulator of cell proliferation was provided by moth-eaten mice, which lack SHP-1 expression. These mice displayed an array of hematopoietic abnormalities caused by the overproduction of the hematopoietic cell lineage (4Lyons B.L. Lynes M.A. Burzenski L. Joliat M.J. Hadjout N. Shultz L.D.

SHP-1 is a 68-kDa protein composed of two SH2 domains, a catalytic domain, and a flexible C terminus. SHP-1 is dormant in the cytoplasm, and its phosphatase activity is inhibited by both SH2 domains and the C-terminal tail (Fig. 1A). Recent studies based on the crystal structure of SHP-1 have demonstrated that the N-terminal SH2 domain, rather than C-terminal SH2, is responsible for autoinhibition. In response to activation signals, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins bind to SHP-1 SH2 domains. This causes structural rearrangements, which expose the active site and renders the SHP-1 catalytic domain capable of interacting with downstream substrates (11Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X.

Moreover, TFG has been recently detected as a novel fusion partner for NORI in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (15Hisaoka M. Ishida T. Imamura T. Hashimoto H. Genes Chrom. Cancer. 2004; 40: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Studies performed on the normal counterpart have shown that the TFG gene is ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues and that it is conserved among several species, including C. elegans (16Mencinger M. Aman P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The major characteristic of TFG is the presence of a coiled-coil domain (12Greco A. Mariani C. Miranda C. Lupas A. Pagliardini S. Pomati M. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6118-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which exerts a crucial role in TRK-T3 oncogenic activation by mediating the formation of protein complexes (17Greco A. Fusetti L. Miranda C. Villa R. Zanotti S. Pagliardini S. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to the coiled-coil domain, the TFG protein also contains several consensus sites, which suggest possible interactions with other proteins. These include a PB1 domain (18Roccato E. Pagliardini S. Cleris L. Canevari S. Formelli F. Pierotti M.A. Greco A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), putative phosphorylation sites for PKC and CK2, glycosylation sites, as well as SH2- and SH3-binding sites (19Mencinger M. Panagopoulos I. Andreasson P. Lassen C. Mitelman F. Aman P. Genomics. 1997; 41: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Several of these sites are identical in TFG proteins from different species, indicating that the protein might be involved in basic cellular processes (16Mencinger M. Aman P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these sites are present in the TFG portion contained within the TRK-T3 and ALK oncogenes. The TFG sequences outside the coiled-coil domain play an important role in TRK-T3 oncogenic activation. Their deletion interferes with different mechanisms involving protein processing, formation of stable and/or functional complexes, and possible interactions with other proteins (18Roccato E. Pagliardini S. Cleris L. Canevari S. Formelli F. Pierotti M.A. Greco A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In particular, the PB1 domain appears to have a crucial role since a single point mutation at a conserved Lys residue completely abrogates TRK-T3 activity, thus demonstrating the significance of this region in oncogenic activation. Another important contribution is further provided by a consensus site for binding to the SHP-1 SH2 domain, where the Y33F mutation drastically reduces TRK-T3-transforming activity. In this study, we have tried to elucidate the role of the SHP-1 phosphatase in TRK-T3 oncoprotein signaling and to explore the putative interaction between SHP-1 and TFG sequences. We show that SHP-1 is a negative modulator of the TRK-T3 oncoprotein. Both the TFG and NTRK1 portions of the TRK-T3 oncoprotein recruit SHP-1 by respectively interacting with either the SH2 or the catalytic domain. In addition, we identify TFG tyrosine 33 as the residue responsible for SHP-1 binding. Moreover, we provide evidence that TFG reduces SHP-1 catalytic activity. Our data suggest that TFG is a novel SHP-1 auxiliary docking protein, which participates in the regulation of phosphatase activity. Plasmid Construction—The T3/WT plasmid contains TRK-T3 cDNA inserted into the pRC/CMV expression vector (12Greco A. Mariani C. Miranda C. Lupas A. Pagliardini S. Pomati M. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6118-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which carries the neomycin resistance gene. The T3/Y291F (20Roccato E. Miranda C. Ranzi V. Gishizky M.L. Pierotti M.A. Greco A. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and T3/Y586F (21Ranzi V. Meakin S.O. Miranda C. Mondellini P. Pierotti M.A. Greco A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) mutants respectively carry the Tyr291 and Tyr586 to Phe mutations. The T3/Y291/586F mutant carries both of these mutations (21Ranzi V. Meakin S.O. Miranda C. Mondellini P. Pierotti M.A. Greco A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All the mutants were inserted into the pRC/CMV expression vector. The T3/L2 mutant, inserted into the pIRESneo expression vector, is deleted for all the TFG sequences except the coiled-coil domain (18Roccato E. Pagliardini S. Cleris L. Canevari S. Formelli F. Pierotti M.A. Greco A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The T3/ABN kinase-defective mutant, inserted into the pRC/CMV expression vector, carries the Lys339 to Ala mutation of the ATP-binding site (17Greco A. Fusetti L. Miranda C. Villa R. Zanotti S. Pagliardini S. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The SHP-1 plasmid, in the pRK5RS vector, was kindly provided by Dr. A. Ullrich. SHP-1 cDNA was transferred into the pIREShyg vector as follows. SHP-1 cDNA in the original pRK5RS vector was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotides, both containing NotI sites (underlined): 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTATACAGAGAGATGCTGTCCCGTGGG-3′; 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTATCACTTCCTCTTGAGGGA-3′. Amplified cDNA was digested by NotI and inserted into the pIREShyg vector previously linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The resulting plasmid, SHP-1hyg was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. The SHP-1 C455S site-specific mutant was constructed by QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the SHP-1 and the SHP-1hyg cDNAs as templates. The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: 5′-CATCATCGTGCACAGCAGCGCCGGCAT-3′; 5′-ATGCCGGCGCTGCTGTGCACGATGATG-3′ (the mutated nucleotide is indicated in bold). Full coding sequence analysis identified the clones carrying the C455S mutation and confirmed that no additional mutations were accidentally inserted during the mutagenesis reaction. The resulting plasmids are indicated as SHP-1 C455S (expressed in the pRK5RS vector) and SHP-1hyg C455S (expressed in the pIREShyg vector). SHP-1 constructs inserted into the pIREShyg vector were used to perform biological assays to determine transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells. For all other experiments, SHP-1 constructs in the pRK5RS vector were used. TFG cDNA was amplified by PCR from a cDNA expression library using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ATTATGGATCCATGAACGGACAGTTGGAT-3′, (containing the BamHI site, underlined); 5′-CGCCCAAGCTTTCGATAACCAGGTCCAGG-3′, (containing the HindIII site, underlined). The amplified cDNA was digested by BamHI/HindIII and was inserted into the pCDNA 3.1/myc-His(-)A vector (Invitrogen), linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. N-TFG cDNA (amino acids 1–193) was amplified by PCR using TFG cDNA contained in the pCDNA3.1/myc plasmid as template. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-ATTATGGATCCATGAACGGACAGTTGGAT-3′ (containing the BamHI site, underlined); 5′-CGCCCAAGCTTTGAAACCTGATCATCTGTT-3′ (containing the HindIII site, underlined). Amplified cDNA was excised by BamHI/HindIII digestion and was inserted into the pCDNA 3.1/myc-His(-)A vector (Invitrogen), linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. The N-TFG/Y33F site-specific mutant was constructed by QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis, according to the manufacturer's guidelines, using N-TFG cDNA contained in the pCDNA 3.1/myc vector template. The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: 5′-ATTCCTATTCATAATGAAGATATTACTTTTGATGAATTAGTGCTAATGATGCAAC-3′; 5′-GTTGCATCATTAGCACTAATTCATCAAAAGTAATATCTTCATTATGAATAGGAAT-3′ (the mutated nucleotide is indicated in bold). Clones carrying the Y33F mutation were identified by full coding sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Human embryo kidney HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The NF797 cell line, derived from NIH3T3 cells transformed by the TRK-T3 oncogene, were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum. NIH3T3 cells (8×104/60 mm plate) were co-transfected by the CaPO4 method using 1250 ng of plasmid DNA (250 ng of T3/WT in combination with different amounts of SHP-1hyg or the empty vector) together with 15 μg of mouse carrier DNA. Transfected cells were selected in DMEM containing 5% serum to determine transforming activity. Transfection efficiency was determined by selecting transfected cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% serum in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml), selecting for T3/WT, and hygromycin (25 μg/ml), selecting for SHP-1hyg. The transformed foci and resistant colonies were fixed and Giemsa-stained 2 weeks after transfection. HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected using the CaPO4 method with the SHP-1 constructs or the empty pSV3neo vector together with T3/WT or T3/mutants, TFGmyc or N-TFGmyc. One day after transfection, cells were kept in 10% serum medium for 6–7 h, serum-starved for 20 h in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and then processed for protein extraction. To perform pull-down experiments, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with TRK-T3 or TFG constructs (5 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with PLCLB buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF) supplemented with aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Na3VO4. Cell extracts (1 mg) were precipitated with the appropriate antibodies. The precipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by 7 or 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and immunoblotted with the appropriated antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies used were: anti-TRK and anti-SHP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-c-Myc (Roche Applied Science). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for TFG (anti-TFG) were produced by Dr. Stebel (C.S.P.A. University of Trieste) using a Hys-TFG fusion protein. Total cell lysates used to analyze the phosphorylation of ERKs were obtained from transfected HEK293T cells which were serum-starved overnight, lysed in SDS lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS) and sonicated for 15 s. Protein samples (50 μg) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed as described above. Antibodies to phospho-ERK and total ERK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Generation of GST-SHP-1 Fusion Proteins—GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified SHP-1 fragments into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The polymerase chain reaction was performed with wild type SHP-1 cDNA as a template and the following oligonucleotide primers, containing EcoRI or XhoI restriction sites (underlined): 5′-ATTGAATTCTGTCCCGTGGGTGGTTTCAC-3′ (nucleotides 259–279), 5′-ACCGAATTCTCACTTCCTCTTGAGGGAACC-3′ (nucleotides 2029–2049) for the full-length SHP-1 (FL, residues 2–598); 5′-CCGGAATTCCGCTGTCCCGTGGGTGGTTTCAC-3′ (nucleotides 259–279), 5′-CCCGCTCGAGGGTCCTGCAGGACACCCTGCTG-3′ (nucleotides 505–525) for the N-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2, residues 2–90); 5′-CCGGAATTCCGCCCACTAGTGAGAGGTGG-3′ (nucleotides 574–591), 5′-CCCGCTCGAGGGGCCTCCTCAATCCCCGTCTT-3′ (nucleotides 847–867) for the C-terminal SH2 domain (C-SH2, residues 107–204); 5′-CCGGAATTCCGCTGTCCCGTGGGTGGTTTCAC-3′ (nucleotides 259–279), 5′-CCCGCTCGAGGGGCCTCCTCAATCCCCGTCTT-3′ (nucleotides 847–867) for the two SH2 domains (NC-SH2, residues 2–204); 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGCCAAGGCTGGCTTCTGGGAG-3′ (nucleotides 979–999), 5′-CCCGCTCGAGGCTTAGTGGTTTCAATGAACTG-3′ (nucleotides 1801–1821) for the PTP domain (PTP, residues 242–522). The amplified products were digested by EcoRI for full-length SHP-1 or EcoRI/XhoI for the other fragments and inserted in-frame into the pGEX-4T-2 vector respectively linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The fusion genes were then confirmed by DNA sequencing (see Fig. 6A). GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria. In the case of GST-SHP-1 FL, induction was performed by adding 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubating at 30 °C. The induction of other GST-SHP-1 proteins was performed in 0.5 mm IPTG at 37 °C. The fusion proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-conjugated-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining. GST-SHP-1 Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—To monitor the binding of TRK-T3 and N-TFG proteins to either full-length SHP-1 or specific SHP-1 domains, 10 μg of GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins or GST were coupled to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. Lysates from NF797 cells (800 μg) or HEK293T cells transfected with TRK-T3 constructs (800 μg) or N-TFG constructs (1 mg) were incubated with the immobilized fusion proteins for 3 h at 4 °C.The beads were washed three times with HNTG, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by 7% (for TRK-T3 proteins) or 10% (for N-TFG proteins) SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed as described above. The bound TRK-T3 proteins were visualized using anti-TRK antibodies; the bound N-TFG proteins were visualized using anti-TFG antibodies. Phosphatase Assay—To assay SHP-1 phosphatase activity, SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated as described above from 800 μg of cell lysate proteins prepared from HEK293T cells co-transfected with SHP-1 and different amounts of TFG cDNA. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% NonidetP-40) supplemented with aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in RIPA buffer and once in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.25, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of phosphatase buffer containing 4 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of 0.2 m NaOH, and absorbance was measured at 410 nm. SHP-1 Is a Negative Regulator of the TRK-T3 Oncoprotein— SHP-1 modulates NTRK1 activity after NGF-induced activation and therefore exerts an important role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system (10Marsh H.N. Dubreuil C.I. Quevedo C. Lee A. Majdan M. Walsh G.S. Hausdorff S. Said F.A. Zoueva O. Kozlowski M. Siminovitch K. Neel B.G. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The SHP-1/NTRK1 interaction is mediated by tyrosine 490 of NTRK1. This residue is also involved in the recruitment of SHC and FRS2 adaptor proteins (Fig. 1A). We were interested in determining the effect of SHP-1 on TRK-T3, a cytoplasmic oncoprotein derived from the rearrangement of NTRK1 with the TFG gene (Fig. 1A) (12Greco A. Mariani C. Miranda C. Lupas A. Pagliardini S. Pomati M. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6118-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This was performed by investigating whether SHP-1 and TRK-T3 formed complexes in living cells. Wild type TRK-T3 cDNA (T3/WT) was transfected into HEK293T cells together with either SHP-1 cDNA, the SHP-1 C455S catalytically inactive mutant, or the empty pSV3neo vector. Cell extracts were subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-TRK antibodies. Western blot hybridization with anti-SHP-1 antibodies detected SHP-1 proteins in TRK-T3/SHP-1 co-transfected cells (Fig. 1B, first panel). This indicated that both wild type and mutated SHP-1 could form complexes with the oncoprotein. Hybridization of a twin blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that the level of TRK-T3 oncoprotein phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of SHP-1 but not in the presence of the SHP-1 C455S mutant (Fig. 1B, second panel). This effect is not related to the amount of the TRK-T3 oncoprotein, which was comparable in all the samples (Fig. 3, third panel). These data indicate that SHP-1 interacts with and dephosphorylates TRK-T3. Therefore, oncogenic rearrangement and the consequent delocalization of the NTRK1 kinase activity do not affect SHP-1 mediated down-regulation. Similar to the NGF-activated NTRK1 receptor, the TRK-T3 oncoprotein triggers multiple signal transduction pathways, including that of ERK1/2. We next investigated the effect of SHP-1-mediated TRK-T3 down-regulation on the activation of the downstream target ERK1/2. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the TRK-T3 and SHP-1 constructs as described above. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with site-specific phosphotyrosine antibodies to measure the phosphorylation of ERKs. As shown in Fig. 2 (top panel), phosphorylation of ERKs was detected in the presence of the TRK-T3 oncoprotein. Interestingly, the phosphorylation level of both p44 and p42 ERKs was reduced in cells expressing wild type SHP-1, but not in those expressing the catalytically inactive SHP-1 C455S mutant. Such differences are not related to ERK1/2 expression level, which were comparable in all the samples (Fig. 2, bottom panel). These data indicate that TRK-T3 down-regulation by SHP-1 phosphatase affects downstream signaling. As a consequence of dimerization/oligomerization mediated by the activating portions, TRK oncoproteins display constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. In in vitro cell culture systems, this results in oncogene-mediated transformation of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. We investigated the effect of SHP-1 on TRK-T3 biological activity by performing NIH3T3 transfection/focus formation assays. The constructs used for these assays were the T3/WT inserted into the pRC/CMV vector, carrying the neomycin resistance gene, and SHP-1hyg wild type and SHP-1hyg C455S mutant inserted into the pIREShyg vector, carrying the hygromycin resistance gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). T3/WT was transfected in the presence of different amounts of either the SHP-1hyg or the SHP-1hyg C455S construct. Co-transfection efficiency was detected by selection in the presence of both G418 and hygromycin. The transforming activity was subsequently determined by selection in 5% serum medium. The relative transforming activity (RTA) was determined as the ratio between transforming activity and transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3, transforming activity was comparable when T3/WT was co-transfected with an equal amount of either SHP-1 wild type or the catalytically inactive SHP-1 C455S mutant. Increasing amounts of wild type SHP-1 reduced TRK-T3 transforming activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, different amounts of the SHP-1 C455S mutant did not affect TRK-T3 transforming activity. These data demonstrate that the negative regulation of TRK-T3 by SHP-1 phosphatase results in the inhibition of transforming activity. TRK-T3 Recruits SHP-1 through Both the TFG and TK Portions—NTRK1 down-regulation by SHP-1 phosphatase is mediated by the Tyr490 residue of NTRK1, which is required for optimal complex formation between the two proteins (10Marsh H.N. Dubreuil C.I. Quevedo C. Lee A. Majdan M. Walsh G.S. Hausdorff S. Said F.A. Zoueva O. Kozlowski M. Siminovitch K. Neel B.G. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With respect to the TRK-T3 oncoprotein, in addition to the SHP-1 interaction site in the NTRK1-derived portion (Tyr291), a potential SHP-1-specific SH2-binding site is present within the TFG portion (Tyr33) (Fig. 1A). Indirect evidence of SHP-1 recruitment by the TRK-T3-activating portion is provided by the experiment reported in Fig. 4A. SHP-1 cDNA was co-transfected together with the following TRK-T3 mutants: 1) T3/Y291F, in which tyrosine 291, corresponding to Tyr490 of NTRK1 and representing the docking site for SHC, FRS2, and FRS3, was mutated to phenylalanine. 2) T3/Y586F, in which tyrosine 586, corresponding to Tyr785 of NTRK1 and representing the docking site for PLC-γ, was changed to phenylalanine. 3) T3/Y291/586F, in which both tyrosine 291 and 586 to phenylalanine mutations were introduced. 4) T3/ABN, carrying the lysine 339 to alanine mutation of the ATP-binding site. Anti-TRK immunocomplexes were hybridized with anti-SHP-1 and anti-TRK antibodies to respectively detect SHP-1/TRK-T3 interactions and TRK-T3 construct expression (Fig. 4A, top and middle panels). The expression of SHP-1 was detected by Western blot of total extracts with anti-SHP-1 antibodies (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). All the mutants were capable of recruiting a considerable amount of the SHP-1 protein with respect to T3/WT. Interestingly, both the T3/ABN and T3/Y291F mutants behaved differently from the equivalent NTRK1 mutants, which were previously shown to coimmunoprecipitate with very little SHP-1 when compared with the wild type receptor (10Marsh H.N.

https://openalex.org/W2037790755,"Binding partners of the Src homology domains of Vav-1 were characterized by a two-hybrid screening of a Jurkat cell cDNA library. One of the isolated clones encoded a new protein named VIK that belongs to the Kruppel-like zinc-finger gene family. Genome mapping showed that a single gene positioned at chromosome 7q22.1 generated three possible isoforms containing alternative domains such as proline-rich and Kruppel-associated box A or B repressor domains. The isolated isoform, VIK-1, did not contain such motifs but presented six tandemly arranged zinc-fingers and consensus Kruppel H–C links. VIK-1 interacted both with Vav-1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 through two independent domains and corresponded to a Vav C-Src homology domain (SH)3 partner able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm exhibiting functional nuclear addressing and export sequences. The results indicated a restricted expression of the protein during the G1 phase and its overexpression resulted in an inhibition of the cell-cycle progression that was reversed in the presence of Vav 1. Thus, this ubiquitous factor provides a first link between Vav-1 and the cell-cycle machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2009430599,"Transcription initiation begins with recruitment of an RNA polymerase to a promoter. Polymerase-promoter interactions are retained until the nascent RNA is extended to 8–12 nucleotides. It has been proposed that accumulation of “strain” in the transcription complex and RNA displacement of promoter-polymerase interactions contribute to releasing the polymerase from the promoter, and it has been further speculated that too strong a promoter interaction can inhibit the release step, whereas a weak interaction may facilitate release. We examined the effects of partial deletion of the nontemplate strand on release of T7 RNA polymerase from the T7 promoter. T7 polymerase will initiate from such partially single-stranded promoters but binds them with higher affinity than duplex promoters. We found that release on partially single-stranded promoters is strongly inhibited. The inhibition of release is not due to an indirect effect on transcription complex structure or loss of specific polymerase-nontemplate strand interactions, because release on partially single-stranded templates is recovered if the interaction with the promoter is weakened by a promoter base substitution. This same substitution also appears to allow the polymerase to escape more readily from a duplex promoter. Our results further suggest that template-nontemplate strand reannealing drives dissociation of abortive transcripts during initial transcription and that loss of interactions with either the nontemplate strand or duplex DNA downstream of the RNA lead to increased transcription complex slippage during initiation.

Instead, the polymerase appears to retain at least some promoter interactions until the RNA reaches a length of 8–12 nucleotides. Since these promoter interactions are energetically favorable, their release must be driven by accumulation of strain in the initial transcription complex (IC) (5Carpousis A.J Gralla J.D. J. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 98: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During initiation by the single-subunit bacteriophage T7 RNAP, for example, the nascent RNA interacts with a “recognition loop,” which contacts the –7 to –11 promoter base pairs during initiation (8Temiakov D. Mentesanas P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and may thereby displace part of the polymerase-promoter interaction to facilitate release.Another force driving release of the polymerase from the promoter may be the collapse of the initial transcription bubble. During initiation by T7 RNAP, the size of the transcription bubble grows from 7–8 to ∼13 base pairs as the RNA is progressively extended (10Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Villemain J. Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 958-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Upon transition to elongation, the bubble collapses to a size of 8 base pairs (10Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Villemain J. Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 958-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There may therefore be a favorable energetic component to formation of the EC due to a reformation of ∼5 DNA base pairs upon transition to elongation. On the other hand, this may involve displacement of a similar number of RNA:DNA base pairs in the hybrid (10Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) so that the reduction in transcription bubble size would be close to energetically neutral.T7 RNAP will initiate transcription from partially single-stranded (pss) promoters, which are duplex from –23 to –5 but which lack downstream nontemplate (NT) strand DNA (12Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2690-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Polymerase binding to such promoters has been found to be much tighter than to fully duplex promoters (14Diaz G.A. Rong M. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10837-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Given such enhanced binding, it is legitimate to ask if the polymerase would be able to release such a promoter upon transition to elongation. If promoter release on such templates is indeed inefficient or even abrogated, there may be at least two possible mechanisms for why release fails. One is that binding to the pss promoter is simply too strong to be disrupted by the forces and competing interactions that disrupt the promoter interaction on a duplex promoter. The other possibility is that inefficient release would not be a direct consequence of the strength of the interaction with the pss promoter but rather a consequence of how the pss promoter modifies normal transcription complex structure. For example, it has been shown that on pss promoters, the RNA is not displaced from the template strand, and extended RNA:DNA hybrids are formed (16Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17He B. Kukarin A. Temiakov D. Chin-Bow S.T. Lyakhov D.L. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44277-44285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If the nascent RNA does not follow its normal pathway during transcription from pss templates, it may not be able to help displace the promoter-polymerase interaction as it is believed to do on a duplex template.To address these questions, we have used enzymatic footprinting to monitor polymerase movement away from the promoter during T7 RNAP initiation and elongation on duplex, pss, and heteroduplex templates. We find that promoter release by the polymerase is indeed abrogated on promoters that lack part of the NT strand around the transcription start site. Release is not recovered if the NT strand is present but is not complementary to the template, indicating that it is reannealing of the template strand and not its simple presence or absence that determines whether release occurs. Finally, we find that if the promoter is mutated to weaken its interaction with the polymerase, release is recovered even with pss templates, indicating that failure to release is due to overly strong interactions with the pss promoters and not to a change in transcription complex structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Polymerase and Templates—Wild type and mutated T7 RNAP were purified as described previously (36Bonner G. Patra D. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol. The Q239C (–7) mutant was constructed by cysteine substitution of Gln239 in T7 RNAP in which 7 of the 12 endogenous cysteines had been mutated to serines using PCR-mediated mutagenesis as described previously (24Muhkerjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DNA oligomers were purchased from Qiagen and purified by PAGE. The sequences of all oligomers are presented in Table I. Where indicated, synthetic oligomers were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol; ICN) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). To form double-stranded or pss templates, each oligomer was mixed with equimolar complementary oligomer in annealing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl) at 0.5 μm, followed by heating to 95 °C for 1 min, and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature.Fig. 1A, structure of the synthetic promoters used. For PNT–5, the NT strand extends from –23 to –5. The T strand sequence from –23 to +6 matches the T7 class I promoter, and from +7 to +34 the transcript sequence is CCGGAAUUCGAGCUCGCCCGGGGAUCCU.

NTPs were added to 0.5 mm, unless otherwise indicated, and transcripts were labeled by inclusion of 1% (v/v) 800 Ci/mm, 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]GTP in the reaction mixture. To form halted complexes, required NTPs with 3′-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (3′-dNTP; Trilink Biotechnologies) were added to 0.5 mm in reaction mixture. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.01% xylene cyanol) and analyzed by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide (19% acrylamide, 1% bisacrylamide) gel cast in 1× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer containing 7 m urea. The gels were analyzed with an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager.DNA Footprinting and Digestion Assays—Halted complexes were formed as described above. DNase I (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) footprinting on these halted complexes was carried out as described (31Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In exonuclease III (ExoIII) digestion reactions, halted complexes were incubated with 1 unit/μl ExoIII (New England Biolabs) at room temperature for 15 min or 30 min, as indicated in the figures. Products were resolved by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide (14.2% acrylamide, 0.8% bisacrylamide) with 7 m urea gel, followed by phosphorimaging. The digestion patterns were assessed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Cleavage positions were mapped by reference to Maxam-Gilbert G+A ladders prepared as described (31Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).DNA Cleavage by FeBABE-conjugated RNAP—Conjugation of Q239C (–7) with FeBABE (Dojindo Laboratories) was carried out as described previously (24Muhkerjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out on halted complexes with DNA in which the 5′-end of the template (T) strand was labeled. DNA sequences are given in Table I. Halted complexes were formed at room temperature in transcription buffer with 1 × 10–8 m DNA and 3 × 10–8 m FeBABE-conjugated enzyme as above. After a 10-min incubation, cleavage was carried out by the addition of sodium ascorbate and H2O2 as described previously (24Muhkerjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R.

Cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide and visualized by phosphorimaging.RESULTSTranscript Patterns on pss and Heteroduplex Templates—It has been previously shown that T7 RNAP will transcribe from promoters in which the NT strand downstream of –5 is missing (12Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2690-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, transcription initiation from such templates does not replicate the transcript patterns seen on fully double-stranded templates (18Gong P. Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44277-44285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Jiang M. Ma N. Vassylyev D.G. McAllister W.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the transcript patterns obtained in assays with the four different synthetic promoter templates illustrated in Fig. 1A. In these reactions, 3′-dUTP replaces UTP so that the polymerase can only extend to +13 to form a halted EC (EC13). On all of these templates, a 13-mer is generated in amounts that equal or exceed the molar amount of template (Fig. 1D). We therefore conclude that the polymerase can extend transcripts beyond the initiation phase on all of these templates. However, the heteroduplex or bubble (BUB), gapped (GAP), or PNT–5 templates all exhibit greatly increased levels of oligo(G) slippage synthesis relative to the fully double-stranded (D.S.) promoter. In addition, if we measure the amounts of 13-mer synthesized per template over the reaction time course (Fig. 1D), we see that at the 2-min time point approximately one 13-mer has been synthesized on every template molecule. For the bubble and double-stranded templates, there is little increase in the amount of 13-mer over the next 14 min of the reaction. However, on the gapped and PNT–5 templates, additional 13-mers are generated at the rate of 1 every 3–4 min (Fig. 1D). These observations are consistent with previous studies showing that ECs formed on templates missing the NT strand are unstable and turn over rapidly, whereas ECs formed on double-stranded or heteroduplex templates turn over more slowly (20Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Another difference noted is that whereas transcription on the bubble, gapped, or PNT–5 templates is characterized by high levels of oligo(G) synthesis and near normal levels of 4- and 5-mer abortive transcripts, the levels of 6-, 7-, and 8-mer abortive transcripts obtained with these templates are less than with the double-stranded promoter (compare lane 13 with lanes 14–16 in Fig. 1B). To amplify the signal due to abortion at the 6- and 7-mer points, we carried out reactions at low (0.01 mm) CTP levels (Fig. 1C), and we also compared the rates of 6-mer synthesis in the absence of CTP on duplex and bubble templates (Fig. 1F). Under limiting CTP conditions, the polymerases pause after synthesis of the 6- and 7-mers, because CTP is required to extend these transcripts. On the double-stranded promoter, the delay in extending the 6- and 7-mer leads to a large increase in the level of 6- and 7-mer abortive transcripts, as is apparent in lanes 1, 5, 9, and 13 of Fig. 1C. On this template, the repeated abortion of transcription at the 6- and 7-mer points also delays the appearance of the 13-mer (Fig. 1E), revealing that, on average, it takes more than 16 min for all of the polymerases to clear the double-stranded promoter at low CTP concentrations. In contrast, the amounts of 6- and 7-mer synthesized on the other three templates are much less than with the double-stranded template, particularly in terms of the ratios of 6- or 7-mer to 13-mer (on the double-stranded template, for example, the 6-mer is made in 14-fold excess of 13-mer at 0.01 mm CTP, whereas on the gapped template, the 13-mer is 2-fold in excess of 6-mer). In the absence of CTP, transcription stops at the 6-mer (Fig. 1F). On both duplex and bubble templates, one 6-mer per template is synthesized 2 min after initiation of the reactions (Fig. 1F, lanes 1 and 7). On the duplex template, the IC with the 6-mer RNA (IC6) is unstable and turns over every 2–3 min, leading to a steady accumulation of 6-mer over an extended reaction time course (lanes 2–6). In contrast, on the bubble template, the IC6 is stable, and turnover during a 60-min reaction is barely detected (lanes 8 and 9). These observations suggest that the absence of a complementary NT strand has at least two effects on initial transcription: 1) it markedly increases the amount of oligo(G) synthesis; 2) it stabilizes ICs in which the RNA is longer than 5 nt.Efficient Promoter Release Requires a Fully Duplex Promoter— To detect clearance of the promoter by the polymerase, we used ExoIII to digest the template strand from the 3′ (upstream) end (Fig. 2A). In the absence of polymerase, digestion of double-stranded, PNT–5, Bubble, or Gapped promoters for 10 min (lanes 2, 8, 14, and 20) or 30 min (lanes 5, 11, 17, and 23) reduces the 56-nt T-strand to fragments of 25 nt or less. If polymerase and NTPs allowing RNA extension to 7 nt are added, the exonuclease is blocked at –20, corresponding to the upstream edge of the transcription complex bound to the promoter (lanes 3, 9, 15, and 21). Prolonged (30-min) treatment of the IC with ExoIII leads to some digestion beyond –20 (lanes 6, 12, 18, and 24). If NTPs allowing RNA extension to +13 are added to the reaction with the double-stranded template, the block to ExoIII digestion moves downstream to +2, revealing release of the polymerase from the promoter upon formation of EC13 (lanes 4 and 7).Fig. 2A, exonuclease III digestion of the indicated templates in which the T-strand is labeled at the 5′-end with 32P; [template] and [RNAP] are as in Fig. 1. Digestion was carried out for either 10 or 30 min (as indicated) with either naked DNA (lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, and 23); polymerase + GTP, ATP, and 3′-dCTP (resulting in synthesis of a 7-mer; lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24); or GTP, ATP, CTP, and 3′-dUTP (resulting in 13-mer synthesis; lanes 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25). B, DNase I digestion of the indicated templates (5′-end-labeled T-strand) with either no polymerase (lanes 3, 9, 15, and 21); polymerase + GTP, 3′-dATP (lanes 4, 10, 16, and 22); polymerase + GTP, ATP (lanes 5, 11, 17, and 23); polymerase + GTP, ATP, 3′-dCTP (lanes 6, 12, 18, and 24); and polymerase + GTP, ATP, CTP, 3′-dUTP (lanes 7, 13, 19, and 25). The vertical lines indicate regions of protection from DNase I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the PNT–5, Bubble, or Gapped promoters, a block at –20 is observed for IC7 (lanes 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24), just as for the double-stranded promoter. However, upon the addition of NTPs, allowing extension to +13, the block at –20 persists, and no new block at +2 is observed (lanes 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25). After 30 min, some digestion beyond –20 is observed, especially with the Bubble and Gapped promoters (lanes 19 and 25); however, the new blocks to ExoIII do not appear at +2 but are spread between –7 and +1 (PNT–5 and bubble templates; lanes 13 and 19), or –13 and –17 (gapped template; lane 25). These observations suggest that, on the PNT–5, Bubble, and Gapped templates, promoter-polymerase interactions persist even if the transcript is extended to lengths that allow full promoter clearance on a double-stranded promoter.It is possible that on these templates the polymerase extends the transcript to +13 but then slides back to reestablish interactions with the promoter, leaving the downstream DNA uncovered. To test this possibility, we carried out a set of experiments using DNAse I to monitor movement of the polymerase during initiation (Fig. 2B). The results with the double-stranded promoter are straightforward and, as in the ExoIII experiment, reveal an efficient and quantitative progression of the polymerase through the transcription reaction. When NTPs allowing transcript extension to +4 are present, the IC4 footprint extends from –18 to +9, with partial protection extending ∼7 nt downstream of this (lane 4). Formation of an IC6 (lane 5) or IC7 (lane 6) extends the footprint downstream by 1 or 3 nt, respectively, whereas the upstream border of the footprint remains static. Extension of the RNA to 13 nt shifts the downstream boundary of protection to +19 and reveals disengagement of the polymerase from the promoter as detected by loss of protection of the –17 to –2 region (lane 7). On the PNT–5 template, protection by IC4 (lane 10) and IC6 (lane 11) extends from –17 to +9, although the downstream border of the footprint is difficult to define because DNase I digestion between –11 and +14 is weak even in the absence of polymerase (lane 9). Protection extends 1–2 nt further downstream in IC7 (lane 12), and DNA downstream of –14 shows a pattern of both suppressed and enhanced cleavage relative to either IC4/6 or naked DNA. This is probably due to binding of the single-stranded DNA to the polymerase in a manner that is not reflective of the mode of binding with a fully duplex template. Formation of EC13 leads to extensive protection of the downstream DNA up to +25, whereas protection of the promoter region up to –17 persists (lane 13). Results with the Bubble and Gapped templates are similar to those with PNT–5, but because these templates are both duplex downstream of +14, digestion patterns in this region are more readily comparable with those of the double-stranded promoter. It is seen that the downstream protection by EC13 on the Bubble (lane 19) and Gapped (lane 25) templates extends to +19 and is essentially identical to the protection observed on the double-stranded promoter (lane 7). However, on the Bubble and Gapped templates, protection of the upstream promoter up to –17 persists in EC13.The DNase I and exonuclease III results are therefore in agreement and suggest that the persistent protection of the promoter upon the addition of NTPs allowing transcript extension to 13 nt is not due to a polymerase that has slid back to the promoter, since, if that were the case, we would not expect to see the downstream extension of the EC13 footprint on the PNT–5, Bubble, or Gapped templates. However, since these experiments were done with polymerase in 3-fold excess of template, it is possible that the persistent promoter protection is due to a second polymerase molecule that binds to the promoter after the first has moved off to form the EC. This seems unlikely, because a polymerase halted at +13 is close enough to the promoter to block binding by a second enzyme, but to test this, we carried out an ExoIII experiment with double-stranded promoter and PNT–5 and with varying polymerase/template ratios (Fig. 3). NTPs allowing RNA extension to 13 nt were present. When polymerase is in severalfold excess of promoter, strong blocks to ExoIII are observed at +2 and –20 on the double-stranded and PNT–5 promoters, respectively (lanes 1–3 and 6–8). As the polymerase concentration is reduced, limited digestion beyond these blocks is detected (lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10), but even at a 1:1 polymerase/template ratio, the predominating block on PNT–5 is at –20 (lane 10). We conclude that this block is not due to a second polymerase that binds after the first has cleared the promoter and halted at +13 but rather to a single polymerase that retains promoter interactions.Fig. 3ExoIII digestion of double-stranded (lanes 1–5) or PNT–5 (lanes 6–10) in reactions with RNAP/template ratios varying from 16 to 1, as indicated, and with GTP, ATP, CTP, and 3′-dUTP present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Promoter Clearance on pss Templates Is Inefficient Even When Transcription Extends to +26 —The above results indicate that promoter clearance on a pss promoter is inefficient when the transcript is extended to 13 nt. To determine whether the transcript could be extended even further on such a template without leading to promoter release, we used a promoter that allows transcript extension to 14 or 26 nt by including GTP/ATP/3′-dCTP or GTP/ATP/CTP/3′-dUTP, respectively, in the reaction (Fig. 4). Because movement of the polymerase to +26 would probably allow binding of a second polymerase to the promoter, we worked with 1:1 RNAP/template ratios.

Transfer and retention of 346J21 in breast cancer cell lines leads to growth arrest after 8-10 cell doublings, accompanied by the appearance of characteristic senescent cell morphology and senescence-associated acid beta-galactosidase activity. Loss of transferred BAC results in reversion to the immortal growth phenotype of the parental cancer cell lines. BAC 346J21 restores senescence in the human breast cancer cell lines, MCF.7 and MDA-MB468, and the rat mammary tumor cell line LA7, but not in the human glioblastoma cell line T98G. We postulate that inactivation of both copies of SEN16 is required for the immortalization of breast epithelial cells at an early stage of tumorigenesis. Positional mapping of 346J21 shows that SEN16 is distinct from other candidate tumor suppressor genes reported at 16q24."
